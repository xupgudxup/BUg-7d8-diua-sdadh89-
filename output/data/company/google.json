    "description": "Les attaques récentes de Donald Trump contre l’Europe ont réveillé les consciences de nombreux pays européens qui militent désormais pour réduire leur dépendance aux États-Unis.

    "fullText": "Recevez tous les soirs un résumé de l’actu importante avec Le Récap’\n\n« Souveraineté numérique » : dans un communiqué de presse envoyé le 26 janvier 2026, le Ministère chargé de la fonction publique et de la réforme de l’État annonce la couleur. Son projet : généraliser Visio, un outil de visioconférence conçu pour sevrer la France, et plus généralement l’Europe, de sa dépendance aux géants américains.\n\nAlors que Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype ou WebEx règnent en maîtres absolus sur nos réunions virtuelles depuis des années, le gouvernement, par la voix de David Amiel, ministre délégué chargé de la Fonction publique, officialise la généralisation de son alternative maison. D’ici 2027, l’ensemble des services de l’État auront l’obligation d’utiliser Visio.\n\nDéveloppé par la Direction interministérielle du numérique (DINUM), Visio coche toutes les cases de la souveraineté. Il ne s’agit pas d’une simple copie française de Zoom, mais d’un logiciel conçu avec plusieurs couches françaises.\n\nCôté hébergement, les données seront stockées chez Outscale, filiale de Dassault Systèmes, qui bénéficie du très strict label SecNumCloud de l’ANSSI. C’est la garantie que les données ne sont pas soumises aux lois extraterritoriales américaines. Visio intègrera aussi plusieurs fonctionnalités IA comme :\n\nActuellement testé par 40 000 utilisateurs, Visio va monter en puissance. Le CNRS, l’Assurance Maladie ou encore le ministère des Armées basculeront sur l’outil dès le premier trimestre 2026.\n\nVisio est déjà disponible aujourd’hui, mais est réservé à certains métiers publics, comme l’enseignement. Le gouvernement ne dit pas s’il ouvrira un jour sa solution souveraine au grand public.\n\nL’initiative est louable, mais le défi est immense. Aujourd’hui, l’administration française, comme le reste du monde, vit sous perfusion numérique américaine. Les systèmes d’exploitation, les suites bureautiques et même les messageries instantanées utilisées au sommet de l’État (on pense à WhatsApp, malgré les interdictions régulières) créent une dépendance systémique aux États-Unis et à leurs géants.\n\nLa réalité du terrain est souvent celle de la facilité : Teams est inclus dans la suite Microsoft 365, Zoom est devenu un verbe du langage courant et Google Meet fonctionne avec un simple lien. Tenter de déloger ces outils ne sera pas aisé : les habitudes sont difficiles à bouleverser. L’État français dispose d’autres alternatives déjà crédibles, notamment sur la messagerie sécurisée avec des solutions comme Tchap ou Olvid, mais il s’agit de solutions très confidentielles.\n\nMalgré cette réalité des usages, la bataille semble aujourd’hui difficilement critiquable. Laisser les conversations stratégiques du ministère des Armées ou les travaux du CNRS transiter par des serveurs étrangers pose un risque de sécurité évident. La dépendance stratégique vis-à-vis d’infrastructures externes fragilise l’État en cas de conflit diplomatique ou commercial : Donald Trump a le pouvoir de paralyser les administrations européennes s’il le souhaite. L’inverse n’est pas vrai.\n\nAutre élément mis en avant par Bercy : le coût. Selon Bercy, l’arrêt des licences payantes aux géants américains permettrait d’économiser 1 million d’euros par an pour chaque tranche de 100 000 utilisateurs.\n\nEn plus de cette annonce sur la vidéoconférence, d’autres chantiers commencent à voir le jour à échelle européenne. Parmi eux : les réseaux de paiement. Aujourd’hui, Visa et Mastercard ont un droit de vie ou de mort sur les transactions commerciales du continent. Un blocage pourrait être fatal pour l’économie européenne, même s’il est aujourd’hui hautement hypothétique.\n\nÀ l’avenir, l’Europe pourrait développer son propre réseau de paiement pour permettre des paiements dans la zone sans passer par VISA et MasterCard. Certains pays disposent déjà de leurs propres réseaux souverains (c’est le cas de CB en France), mais il n’existe pas de solution universelle. L’initiative Wero, à base de QR code, ouvre la porte à des nouveaux paiements hors des rails américains.\n\nToute l'actu tech en un clin d'œil\n\nAjoutez Numerama à votre écran d'accueil et restez connectés au futur !\n\nTous nos articles sont aussi sur notre profil Google : suivez-nous pour ne rien manquer !",

    "description": "The Maia 200 AI chip is described as an inference powerhouse — meaning it could lead AI models to apply their knowledge to real-world situations much faster and more efficiently.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nMicrosoft has revealed its new Maia 200 accelerator chip for artificial intelligence (AI) that is three times more powerful than hardware from rivals like Google and Amazon, company representatives say.\n\nThis newest chip will be used in AI inference rather than training, powering systems and agents used to make predictions, provide answers to queries and generate outputs based on new data that's fed to them.\n\nMaia 200 is already being deployed in Microsoft's U.S. central data center region, with the company set to use the chips to generate synthetic data and in reinforcement training to improve next-generation large language models (LLMs). The AI accelerator will also be used to power Microsoft Foundry and 365 Copilot AI, and be part of the infrastructure that the company can provide through its Azure cloud platform.\n\nThe new chip delivers performance of more than 10 petaflops (1015 floating point operations per second), Scott Guthrie, cloud and AI executive vice president at Microsoft, said in a blog post. This is a measure of performance in supercomputing, where the most powerful supercomputers in the world can reach more than 1,000 petaflops of power.\n\nThe new chip achieved this performance level in a data representation category known as \"4-bit precision (FP4)\" — a highly compressed model designed to accelerate AI performance. Maia 200 also delivers 5 PFLOPS of performance in 8-bit precision (FP8). The difference between the two is that FP4 is far more energy efficient but less accurate.\n\n\"In practical terms, one Maia 200 node can effortlessly run today’s largest models, with plenty of headroom for even bigger models in the future,\" Guthrie said in the blog post. \"This means Maia 200 delivers 3 times the FP4 performance of the third generation Amazon Trainium, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU.\"\n\nMaia 200 could potentially be used for specialist AI workloads, such as running larger LLMs in the future. So far, Microsoft's Maia chips have only been used in the Azure cloud infrastructure to run large-scale workloads for Microsoft’s own AI services, notably Copilot. However, Guthrie noted there would be \"wider customer availability in the future,\" signaling other organizations could tap into Maia 200 via the Azure cloud, or the chips could potentially one day be deployed in standalone data centers or server stacks.\n\nGuthrie said that Microsoft boasts 30% better performance per dollar over existing systems thanks to the use of the 3-nanometer process made by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the most important fabricator in the world, allowing for 100 billion transistors per chip. This essentially means that Maia 200 could be more cost-effective and efficient for the most demanding AI workloads than existing chips.\n\nMaia 200 has a few other features alongside better performance and efficiency. It includes a memory system, for instance, which can help keep an AI model’s weights and data local, meaning you would need less hardware to run a model. It's also designed to be quickly integrated into existing data centers.\n\nMaia 200 should enable AI models to run faster and more efficiently. This means Azure OpenAI users, such as scientists, developers and corporations, could see better throughput and speeds when developing AI applications and using the likes of GPT-4 in their operations.\n\n—'It won’t be so much a ghost town as a zombie apocalypse': How AI might forever change how we use the internet\n\n— GPT-4 has passed the Turing test, researchers claim\n\n—The more advanced AI models get, the better they are at deceiving us — they even know when they're being tested\n\nThis next-generation AI hardware is unlikely to disrupt everyday AI and chatbot use for most people in the short term, as Maia 200 is designed for data centers rather than consumer-grade hardware. However, end users could see the impact of Maia 200 in the form of faster response times and potentially more advanced features from Copilot and other AI tools built into Windows and Microsoft products.\n\nMaia 200 could also provide a performance boost to developers and scientists who use AI inference via Microsoft’s platforms. This, in turn, could lead to improvements in AI deployment on large-scale research projects and elements like advanced weather modeling, biological or chemical systems and compositions.",

    "description": "Microsoft announced its new Maia 200 AI chip, taking aim at Amazon, Google, and Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft (MSFT) is taking aim at cloud rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) with the debut of its next-generation custom AI chip.\n\nCalled Maia 200, the chip will run in Microsoft’s own data centers before the company eventually makes it available to its wider customer base.\n\nLike Google’s TPUs and Amazon’s Trainium processors, Microsoft’s second AI chip is meant to give the Windows maker more flexibility when it comes to how it powers its AI services. By using its own internally developed chips, the company ensures it doesn’t have to rely solely on processors developed by Nvidia (NVDA) or AMD (AMD).\n\nGoogle and Amazon have been using their own custom chips for years, while Microsoft has been slower to adopt in-house AI silicon.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the Maia 200 will be built using TSMC’s 3-nanometer process and is designed to run large-scale AI workloads, while “delivering efficient performance per dollar.”\n\nThe Maia 200 will be built into large server racks with trays housing four chips each. Microsoft is also touting how quickly it can deploy the new chips into data centers, saying chips are installed and running AI models within days of parts arriving.\n\nGetting AI servers up and running quickly is an important aspect of the broader data center business. It’s not just a matter of keeping construction costs down, either. The longer a chip goes unused, the less cash it can generate for the company by running AI apps.\n\nThe Maia 200 adds to the growing competition Nvidia is facing from both AMD and its own customers. Microsoft’s Maia 100 already powers both the company’s and OpenAI’s (OPAI.PVT) AI models, while Google and Amazon both power their respective models and Anthropic’s (ANTH.PVT) models.\n\nAnd in November, The Information reported that Meta was talking to Google about using the search giant’s TPUs in its own data centers to power its AI services. That sent Nvidia stock down at the time, as Wall Street raised fears that the company was in danger of losing market share.\n\nNvidia’s stock price is up less than 1% since the start of the year.\n\nDespite the incursions into Nvidia’s lane, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are unlikely to pose a serious threat to the AI leader. Experts say that while the cloud company’s AI chips may function well for their own services, that’s not likely to translate to smaller third-party customers as easily.\n\nNvidia’s chips are also highly coveted because they are designed to be multipurpose, allowing companies to use them for a litany of applications and services.\n\nAs for performance, the Maia 200 won’t unseat Nvidia, but Microsoft claims it outpaces both Google’s latest TPU and Amazon’s newest Trainium chip in a number of categories. The Maia 200 also packs more high-bandwidth memory than Google’s or Amazon’s offerings, which is key to running high-powered AI applications.",

    "description": "For Jack Buser, who has worked in the gaming industry for 30 years, AI is  an opportunity to push the boundaries of player experiences.",
    "fullText": "Tony Stark relied on his ultra-polished, tech-heavy \"Iron Man\" suit to achieve his superhero feats.\n\nJack Buser, the global director for games at Google Cloud, thinks AI will help game developers in the same way.\n\n\"There will always be holdouts, just like every technological revolution, but it's becoming so common now,\" Buser told Business Insider. \"We're seeing a major shift.\"\n\nBuser and other tech industry leaders have said that implementing AI could transform how people work. In the gaming industry, the tech could help streamline operations, resulting in cost cuts, faster production times, or help developers tackle an array of tasks.\n\n\"It's like the Iron Man suit of armor, right? It's still you inside the suit of armor, but you're suddenly able to do things that you couldn't do before,\" Buser said. \"If you armor everybody up in your studio with suits that allow them to work more quickly and remove the drudgery, that tends to be well received after it's been implemented.\"\n\nBuser urged executives at studios and companies to take the lead by giving developers the necessary tools.\n\n\"If you're the CTO of a games company, make that suit of armor available. Make sure that it's safe. Make sure that you take the time to work with people inside your company so that they can understand what the technology can and can't do, and what your intentions for the technology are and what they are not,\" Buser said.\n\n\"It has as much to do with getting these tools up and running in your development pipelines as it does working culturally with your company to help it make that transformation,\" he added.\n\nGetting comfortable with AI, he said, shouldn't be confined to developers alone.\n\n\"It can be tricky at the executive level. You don't have a crystal ball of where this is all going,\" he said. \"It takes getting your hands dirty, experimenting with the technology, seeing what it does and what it doesn't do.\"\n\nMany global industries are undergoing a technological shift driven by advances in AI. Companies are increasingly adopting the tech in their workflows, which some critics say could diminish job prospects for humans. Supporters argue it's a powerful tool that can help workers do their jobs better and faster.\n\nFor Buser, who has worked in the gaming industry for 30 years, AI has created an opportunity to push the boundaries of player experiences. At Google, that means embracing the era of \"living games.\"\n\nThe live games model, in which developers continue to add new content to a game after its initial release, is already common. AI, however, could make living games more adaptable, personalized, and immersive. The AI could also shorten update turnaround time, making the transition for players more seamless.\n\n\"As we look forward, we're looking at things like real-time game experiences,\" Buser said.\n\nFor now, though, the gaming industry will be focused on scaling and normalizing the tech.\n\n\"2026 is where companies start to scale these efforts,\" Buser said. \"Game developers who were using AI in one or two parts of their development workflow will suddenly be using it throughout their workflow. You'll start to see games that are using multiple AI-based features that are affecting the player experience.\"",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: German research into responses to health queries raises fresh questions about summaries seen by 2bn people a month\n\nHow the ‘confident authority’ of AI Overviews is putting public health at risk\n\nGoogle’s search feature AI Overviews cites YouTube more than any medical website when answering queries about health conditions, according to research that raises fresh questions about a tool seen by 2 billion people each month.\n\nThe company has said its AI summaries, which appear at the top of search results and use generative AI to answer questions from users, are “reliable” and cite reputable medical sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Mayo Clinic.\n\nHowever, a study that analysed responses to more than 50,000 health queries, captured using Google searches from Berlin, found the top cited source was YouTube. The video-sharing platform is the world’s second most visited website, after Google itself, and is owned by Google.\n\nResearchers at SE Ranking, a search engine optimisation platform, found YouTube made up 4.43% of all AI Overview citations. No hospital network, government health portal, medical association or academic institution came close to that number, they said.\n\n“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,” the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches, and creators with no medical training at all).”\n\nGoogle told the Guardian that AI Overviews was designed to surface high-quality content from reputable sources, regardless of format, and a variety of credible health authorities and licensed medical professionals created content on YouTube. The study’s findings could not be extrapolated to other regions as it was conducted using German-language queries in Germany, it said.\n\nThe research comes after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews responses.\n\nIn one case that experts said was “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could have left people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. The company later removed AI Overviews for some but not all medical searches.\n\nThe SE Ranking study analysed 50,807 healthcare-related prompts and keywords to see which sources AI Overviews relied on when generating answers.\n\nThey chose Germany because its healthcare system is strictly regulated by a mix of German and EU directives, standards and safety regulations. “If AI systems rely heavily on non-medical or non-authoritative sources even in such an environment, it suggests the issue may extend beyond any single country,” they wrote.\n\nAI Overviews surfaced on more than 82% of health searches, the researchers said. When they looked at which sources AI Overviews relied on most often for health-related answers, one result stood out immediately, they said. The single most cited domain was YouTube with 20,621 citations out of a total of 465,823.\n\nThe next most cited source was NDR.de, with 14,158 citations (3.04%). The German public broadcaster produces health-related content alongside news, documentaries and entertainment. In third place was a medical reference site, Msdmanuals.com with 9,711 citations (2.08%).\n\nThe fourth most cited source was Germany’s largest consumer health portal, Netdoktor.de, with 7,519 citations (1.61%). The fifth most cited source was a career platform for doctors, Praktischarzt.de, with 7,145 citations (1.53%).\n\nThe researchers acknowledged limitations to their study. It was conducted as a one-time snapshot in December 2025, using German-language queries that reflected how users in Germany typically search for health information.\n\nResults could vary over time, by region, and by the phrasing of questions. However, even with those caveats, the findings still prompted alarm.\n\nHannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher specialising in AI, health and law at the University of Basel who was not involved with the research, said: “This study provides empirical evidence that the risks posed by AI Overviews for health are structural, not anecdotal. It becomes difficult for Google to argue that misleading or harmful health outputs are rare cases.\n\n“Instead, the findings show that these risks are embedded in the way AI Overviews are designed. In particular, the heavy reliance on YouTube rather than on public health authorities or medical institutions suggests that visibility and popularity, rather than medical reliability, is the central driver for health knowledge.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “The implication that AI Overviews provide unreliable information is refuted by the report’s own data, which shows that the most cited domains in AI Overviews are reputable websites. And from what we’ve seen in the published findings, AI Overviews cite expert YouTube content from hospitals and clinics.”\n\nGoogle said the study showed that of the 25 most cited YouTube videos, 96% were from medical channels. However, the researchers cautioned that these videos represented fewer than 1% of all the YouTube links cited by AI Overviews on health.\n\n“Most of them (24 out of 25) come from medical-related channels like hospitals, clinics and health organisations,” the researchers wrote. “On top of that, 21 of the 25 videos clearly note that the content was created by a licensed or trusted source.\n\n“So at first glance it looks pretty reassuring. But it’s important to remember that these 25 videos are just a tiny slice (less than 1% of all YouTube links AI Overviews actually cite). With the rest of the videos, the situation could be very different.”",

By July 2025, the technology had expanded to more than 200 countries in 40 languages, with 2 billion people served AI Overviews each month.\n\nWith the rapid rollout of AI Overviews, Google is racing to protect its traditional search business, which generates about $200bn (£147bn) a year, before upstart AI rivals can derail it. “We are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace,” Pichai said last July. AI Overviews in particular were “performing well”, he added.\n\nBut overviews carry risks, experts say. They use generative AI to provide snapshots of information about a topic or question, adding conversational answers above the traditional search results in the blink of an eye. They can cite sources, but do not necessarily know when that source is incorrect.\n\nWithin weeks of the feature launching in the US, users encountered untruths across a range of subjects. One AI Overview said Andrew Jackson, the seventh US president, graduated from college in 2005. Elizabeth Reid, Google’s head of search, responded to criticism in a blog post. She conceded that “in a small number of cases”, AI Overviews had misinterpreted language on web pages and presented inaccurate information. “At the scale of the web, with billions of queries coming in every day, there are bound to be some oddities and errors,” she wrote.\n\nBut when those questions are about health, accuracy and context are essential and non-negotiable, experts say. Google is facing mounting scrutiny of its AI Overviews for medical queries after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information.\n\nThe company says AI Overviews are “reliable”. But the Guardian found some medical summaries served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm. In one case, which experts said was “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.\n\nIn another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people who had serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. What AI Overviews said was normal could vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result and not bothering to attend follow-up appointments.\n\nAI Overviews about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.\n\nGoogle initially sought to downplay the Guardian’s findings. From what its own clinicians could assess, the company said, the AI Overviews that alarmed experts linked to reputable sources and recommended seeking expert advice. “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information,” a spokesperson said.\n\nWithin days, however, the company removed some of the AI Overviews for health queries flagged by the Guardian. “We do not comment on individual removals within search,” a spokesperson said. “In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”\n\nWhile experts welcomed the removal of some AI summaries for health queries, many remain worried. “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health,” says Vanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity.\n\n“There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information,” adds Sue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals.\n\nA new study has prompted more concerns. When researchers analysed the responses to more than 50,000 health-related searches in Germany to see which sources AI Overviews rely on most, one result stood out immediately. The single most cited domain was YouTube.\n\n“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,” the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg, board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches and creators with no medical training at all).”\n\nIn medicine, it is not only where answers come from that matter, or their level of accuracy, but how they are presented to users, experts say. “With AI Overviews, users no longer encounter a range of sources that they can compare and critically assess,” says Hannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher in AI, health and law at the University of Basel. “Instead, they are presented with a single, confident, AI-generated answer that exhibits medical authority.\n\n“This means that the system does not merely reflect health information online, but actively restructures it. When that response is built on sources never designed to meet medical standards, such as YouTube videos, this creates a new form of unregulated medical authority online.”\n\nGoogle says AI Overviews are built to surface information backed up by top web results, and include links to web content that supports the information presented in the summary. People can use these links to dig deeper on a topic, the company told the Guardian.\n\nBut the single blocks of text in AI Overviews, combining health information from multiple sources, can cause confusion, says Nicole Gross, an associate professor in business and society at the National College of Ireland.\n\n“Once the AI summary appears, users are much less likely to research further, which means that they are deprived of the opportunity to critically evaluate and compare information, or even deploy their common sense when it comes to health-related issues.”\n\nExperts have raised other concerns with the Guardian. Even if and when AI Overviews do provide accurate facts about a specific medical topic, they may not distinguish between strong evidence from randomised trials and weaker evidence from observational studies, they say. Some also miss important caveats about that evidence, they add.\n\nHaving such claims listed next to one another in an AI Overview may also give the impression that some are better established than they really are. Answers can also change as AI Overviews evolve, even when the science hasn’t shifted. “That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough,” says Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity.\n\nGoogle told the Guardian that links included in AI Overviews were dynamic and changed based on the information that was most relevant, helpful and timely for a given search. If AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed some context, the company would use these errors to improve its systems, and also take action when appropriate, it said.\n\nThe biggest worry is that bogus and dangerous medical information or advice in AI Overviews “ends up getting translated into the everyday practices, routines and life of a patient, even in adapted forms”, says Gross. “In healthcare, this can turn into a matter of life and death.”",

    "title": "My career path to Google included bartending and working at a nursing home. Here's what it taught me.",
    "description": "Milica Cvetkovic, said that getting her current job at Google was like training for a marathon — and she wouldn't change much about her journey.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Milica Cvetkovic, a 35-year-old senior technical solutions consultant at Google, based in Chicago. Her identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been working on building AI systems for Google Cloud customers for about three years, but my path to get there was a little non-traditional.\n\nI'm not one of those people who applied to Google 100 times. I took a lot of different routes along the way. My career journey has been wild. \n\nI improvised; I had moments when I was poor without health insurance; I had moments when I was lonely and helpless; I had moments when I messed up and was scared. But I also met the most magical people and had the best adventures. Regardless of how hard it was, I would change very little.\n\nI was born and raised in Serbia, and moved to the US when I was 18. Instead of going to law school in Serbia, I took a gap year, bartended, and then went to college and majored in math.\n\nAfter college, I moved to downtown Chicago and became a bartender. I love bartending. If I had time, I would do it now. Then I moved to New Orleans and worked as a shot girl on Bourbon Street for a while.\n\nNext, I moved to Columbus and worked as a caregiver at a nursing home, which was probably one of the lowest moments of my life. I moved to Columbus, where I knew nobody, and where it was hard to meet new people. Working in the nursing home exposed me to seeing people die for the first time.\n\nThese experiences taught me that discipline matters a lot. When people say you have to work hard, that means you have to have discipline. I am not one of those people who were brought up with this hardcore discipline — I had to build it myself.\n\nEventually, I found a role somewhat related to what I studied and became a curriculum designer at McGraw-Hill Education for four or five years. At some point, I visited friends in Madison, Wisconsin, and decided I wanted to live there.\n\nSo I moved there and started grad school for statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The whole time I was in grad school, I continued working remotely for McGraw-Hill Education.\n\nIn grad school, I began researching how to teach machine learning to nontechnical audiences, specifically computational biologists. That experience, combined with my education in curriculum design, opened a lot of doors for me in education.\n\nDuring my last semester of grad school, I started an internship as a machine learning engineer with a local startup in Madison that was using a device to predict animal health. I ended up working there full-time after grad school and also started teaching, first in bootcamps and eventually at the university level.\n\nAt some point, I didn't want to code 24/7 anymore. I felt like my soft skills weren't being utilized enough. Around that time, I saw that Google had posted my current job, and it was a perfect fit.\n\nI think it's very valuable to have the skill to talk about technical concepts in a way that people are going to understand. The most incredible talks I've heard from accomplished scientists are from those who can talk about their research in an interesting and non-technical way.\n\nYou don't have to kill people with terminology and keywords to make a point. A lot of times when people do that, their audience gets confused. So I think having that ability is probably the most valuable skill that I bring.\n\nI had failures along the way. It's not like everything went smoothly. I'm an immigrant, and for most of the time, I was alone in all of this. I've been through some really stressful situations.\n\nWhen I started teaching at the university level, I worked very hard to get there, and I finally did, but I was super sick. Instead of being upfront about that, I ended up in the ER twice during that class, and I didn't deliver the way I wanted.\n\nYou have to move on in those moments. When you fail, you do damage control, and if the damage control doesn't work, you move on and do better next time.\n\nPeople come from different backgrounds and situations. You don't have to hustle and have 17 different things you do in order to get a Big Tech job. You can be excellent in just one thing; it just turns out I had all those interests.\n\nThere wasn't one experience that made me get the job — it was everything. I worked in education; I was an engineer; I was technical; I had the degrees that mattered; I could speak to non-technical audiences; I had work experience; and I was active in the tech community.\n\nAs someone who ran a marathon, I can say that getting the job at Google was like training for the marathon. The marathon itself is more of a celebration of all the work that you've already done. That's what my application to Google was.",

    "title": "Google Chrome Is About to Drop Support for These Macs",
    "description": "If you have an older Mac, your time with Chrome may be ending.",
    "fullText": "Nothing lasts forever, and technology is no exception. As shiny and new as your computer was when you first bought it, eventually, developers will drop support for it. There's no telling when exactly, but at some point, you'll open an app to find a message that reads something like: \"This device does not support the latest version of this app. Please update your hardware.\"\n\nThat goes for Macs, as well. You might forget that fact, since Apple's computers tend to stick around for a long time. But inevitably, the shadow of end-of-life policies comes for them, too. If you're still rocking an older Mac, I have some bad news, specifically if you use Chrome: Google is officially planning its last supported version of the browser.\n\nGoogle quietly announced the news in a post on the Chrome Platform Status site. The company confirmed that Chrome 150 will be the last version of the browser to support macOS 12, otherwise known as macOS Monterey. Once Google eventually releases Chrome 151, users on macOS 12 will not be able to install it, and will forever be stuck on Chrome 150. Google hasn't said when Chrome 150 will actually drop (we're currently on Chrome 143), but MacRumors estimates it'll be sometime in mid-2026, based on past releases.\n\nBefore you panic, know there are a couple caveats here. First, Chrome will not stop working on macOS 12 once version 151 drops. You'll still be able to use Chrome as you always have. In fact, you might not even notice the difference, minus any new features and changes that Google rolls out in future software versions. You will see an alert that your browser is out of date, but it'll still get you to YouTube, Gmail, and Lifehacker.\n\nThis version of macOS is also fairly outdated. Google isn't just picking last year's macOS version, or the one before that. We're currently on macOS 26, which for these purposes, could be read as macOS 16. It's the fourth version of macOS since Monterey, meaning unless you know your Mac is running macOS 12, there's a good chance you're running something that Chrome still supports.\n\nIf you aren't sure, click the Apple in the top-left corner, then choose \"About This Mac.\" Here, you'll find the macOS version next to \"macOS.\"\n\nLet's say your Mac is running macOS 12. If so, you really should stop using Chrome once version 151 drops. That's because you'll no longer receive Google's latest security updates for the browser, which puts your machine (and its data) at risk.\n\nOnce Chrome 150 drops, bad actors will look for security vulnerabilities in the code to exploit. Google will do the same, and will patch any it or any third-party researchers find. Once 151 comes out, it'll include those patches, but Chrome 150 users will be left behind. The risk only grows as new vulnerabilities are discovered, and new versions of Chrome come out.\n\nAs such, you have a couple of options if you're running macOS 12. The first is to update your OS, if you have that choice. If your Mac does support macOS 13 or newer, updating will open you up to new versions of Chrome. Of course, perhaps the reason you're running macOS 12 is because you cannot update. While that largely affects Macs that are at least 10 years old, there are still plenty of these machines out there. There are alternative ways to update your older Mac, even if Apple won't let you, such as with OpenCore Legacy Patcher, but that might be too technical a route for some.\n\nThe other option here is to stop using Chrome, and switch to a browser that does support macOS 12. Firefox, for example, supports macOS 10.15 or later, and Microsoft Edge fully supports macOS 12 and later. (Safari itself hasn't been updated on macOS 12 since July 2024.)\n\nIt isn't fun watching your tech grow old, but you don't need to chuck your Mac just because Chrome will end support this year—even if the newest ones are really good.",

    "title": "Google's AI-Generated Headlines Are Here to Stay",
    "description": "That clickbait title might have been written by AI.",
    "fullText": "Last month, Google told online publishers that it had started testing AI-generated headlines in Google Discover, replacing stories' carefully handcrafted titles with truncated alternatives made up by Gemini. Some journalists were predictably unhappy, but now, the company says that the AI headlines are no longer an experiment—they're a \"feature.\"\n\nBack when the testing began, the results ranged from poorly worded to straight up misinformation. For instance, one AI-generated headline promised \"Steam Machine price revealed,\" when the original article made no such claim. Another said \"BG3 players exploit children,\" which sounds serious, until you click through to the article and see that it's about a clever way to recruit invincible party members in Baldur's Gate 3 (which, to be fair, does involve turning child NPCs into sheep at one point).\n\nAt the time, Google said that the test was a \"small UI experiment for a subset of Discover users,\" and simply rearranged how users saw AI previews, which were introduced in October of last year and feature short AI summaries of articles, including an occasional AI headline. However, while that AI headline was previously hidden below the original, authored headline, the test put it up top, while getting rid of the authored headline entirely.\n\nFor a while, it seemed like Google might have been willing to back away from the AI headlines, but now the company says it's doubling down. In a statement to The Verge, Google said that its AI headlines are no longer in testing, but are now a full-fledged feature. The company didn't elaborate on why, but did say that the update \"performs well for user satisfaction.\"\n\nWhen 9to5Google then reached out for more detail, the publication was told, \"The overview headline reflects information across a range of sites, and is not a rewrite of an individual article headline.\"\n\nWell, that hasn't quite been the case for me: When I first wrote about this \"experiment,\" I actually had yet to run into one of the AI headlines. But perusing my Google Discover feed today (to see yours, swipe right from the home screen on an Android phone, or scroll down in the Google app), I've finally seen some first hand. To Google's credit, these AI previews do seem to synthesize several sources as claimed—you can see them above the linked story. However, they still call out one article in particular, linking to it and using its header photo. That can easily lead users to think the AI generated headline was written by the linked publication.\n\nThat can have consequences for the publication or writer if the AI gets something wrong, which a disclaimer at the bottom of these AI previews admits can happen. For instance, The Verge said it saw an AI Discover headline on a story from Lifehacker's sister site PCMag that said, \"US reverses foreign drone ban,\" even though the linked story goes out of its way to say headlines that claim this are \"misleading.\"\n\nThe AI headlines I've seen personally haven't been quite that bad, but as someone with a more than decade-long career in journalism, I do question their helpfulness. For instance, \"Starfleet Academy full of Trek Nods\" is much less informative than the original, \"One of TNG's Strangest Species Is Getting a Second Life In Modern Star Trek.\" I guess \"Star Trek show has Star Trek things\" is apparently clickier or more useful to the reader than just saying what the specific Star Trek thing is?\n\nAnother example: \"Anbernic unveils RG G01 Controller.\" I hope you know what those letters and numbers mean, because this AI headline completely buries the context in the original headline, \"Anbernic's New Controller Has a Screen and Built-In Heartbeat Sensor, for Some Reason.\"\n\nI guess this is a future that I'll have to get used to though. That I'm starting to see these headlines myself, despite not being part of the initial experiment, does suggest we can expect them to stick around, and to roll out to more people. If you see something that seems questionable while scrolling Google Discover, the feature has probably rolled out to you now too.\n\nTo check whether that suspicious headline was written by a human or not, try clicking the \"See more\" button at the bottom of the article's description and looking for a \"Generated with AI\" disclaimer.\n\nOn the plus side, only about half of the articles in my Google Discover are currently using AI headlines, so not every piece of \"content\" is being affected. But for journalists, the move still comes at a tough time: According to Reuters, Google traffic from organic search was down by 38% on test sites in the United Stated between November 2024 and November 2025, and while Google Discover isn't Search, editors write headlines the way they do for a reason. Using a robot to overwrites those decisions probably isn't the best way to tackle eroding trust in media.\n\nI've reached out to Google for comment on its AI headlines and will provide an update when I hear back.",

    "description": "Personal Intelligence from Google connects Gemini AI to Gmail, Photos, and Search history, setting new standards for personal AI assistants.",
    "fullText": "Google rolled out a powerful new feature to AI Mode in Search this week. It's called Personal Intelligence, and it weaves together many of the company's existing services in a radical new way.\n\nThis was also launched recently in Gemini, Google's AI chatbot. Business Insider's Pranav Dixit tried it and was blown away. Here's his review:\n\nPersonal Intelligence feels like Google has been quietly taking notes on my entire life and finally decided to hand me the notebook.\n\nWith my permission, Gemini can tap into my Google account — Gmail, Photos, Search history, YouTube, and more — and reason across all of it to answer questions the way a human assistant might, except this one has years of receipts on my life.\n\nThis is something I've wanted since AI-powered chatbots blew up in late 2022. Back then, I'd pour my soul into ChatGPT and get a smart answer. Then, the bot would immediately forget I existed, like a genius goldfish. Over the last few years, OpenAI and Anthropic have enabled their chatbots to connect to services like Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar. But Google has home field advantage: it already has the broadest view of what you've actually done, searched, watched, and saved.\n\nGemini's ability to connect the dots is scary-good, well beyond what ChatGPT or Claude can do. When I asked it for sightseeing ideas for my parents, who have already visited the Bay Area a few times, it suggested museums and gardens, correctly inferring they've already done hikes and trips to redwood forests.\n\nWhen I asked Gemini how it knew, it told me it deduced this based on \"breadcrumbs\" left across my Google account: Family emails, photos of Muir Woods, a parking reservation in Gmail, and a Google search for \"easy hikes for seniors.\"\n\nThis is so powerful that Google is already trying to preempt the freak-out. VP Josh Woodward said Google takes \"steps to filter or obfuscate personal data\" from the conversations we have with Gemini.\n\n\"We don't train our systems to learn your license plate number; we train them to understand that when you ask for one, we can locate it,\" he wrote recently.\n\nSo, I asked it for my license plate number and it was able to locate it, based on photos of my car in Google Photos.\n\nI also asked Gemini when my car insurance was up for renewal and it correctly told me, based on emails from AAA in my Gmail inbox.\n\nWhen I asked it to help me plan an upcoming trip, it accounted for the fact that we're traveling with an infant — because it already knows we have a new baby. Of course it does.\n\nThis is the future every AI company keeps promising. Last year, Meta said its new north star wasn't \"the metaverse\" — that alternate VR universe the company is literally named after — but \"personal superintelligence,\" an AI that \"knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them.\"\n\nOne path to that vision: AI-powered glasses that can see and hear what you see and hear, turning everyday life into the raw material for an always-on assistant. To get there, Meta has poured billions of dollars into a hiring spree and into the data centers needed to run it all.\n\nBut Meta doesn't have a digital record of my life like Google does. I barely post on Facebook. I mostly swipe through Instagram Reels. WhatsApp is encrypted. And after Meta killed Supernatural, my favorite VR workout app, I have very little reason to use its Quest headset anymore.\n\nMeta talks about \"personal superintelligence\" as a future goal. As far as I'm concerned, Google just shipped it.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Sometimes a comeback story starts with a fumble.\n\nA former top OpenAI researcher said Google's AI renaissance is as much about OpenAI's missteps as it is about what the search giant got right.\n\n\"Personally, what I think you should consider Google's comeback, I think it's OpenAI's fumble,\" Jerry Tworek, a former VP of research at OpenAI, said on a Wednesday episode of Ashlee Vance's \"Core Memory\" podcast.\n\nTworek, who spent almost seven years at OpenAI, said earlier this month that he left the startup \"to try to explore types of research that are hard to do at OpenAI.\"\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman declared a \"Code Red\" in December amid increasing competition from Google. The tech giant received wide praise across the industry for the capabilities of its Gemini 3 AI model, which some observers said had surpassed ChatGPT.\n\nWhile declining to detail what he described as OpenAI's missteps, Tworek said that the pioneering AI company should never have lost the lead it established with the release of ChatGPT in 2022.\n\n\"If you are a company that is ahead and has all the advantages that OpenAI has you should always stay ahead,\" he said.\n\nOverall, Tworek said, \"Google did a lot of things right.\"\n\n\"Very clearly, Google started treating seriously at that moment, training large language models and, like, through OpenAI fumbling its lead, they are very, very close now in capability and in terms of models trained,\" he said, adding that the whole industry began to up its investment in AI when OpenAI showed ChatGPT could generate revenue.\n\nAs for OpenAI, Tworek said that the sheer toll of the AI race has led the non-profit-research lab-turned-public-benefit-corporation to place less of an emphasis on risky research that may not yield results. A spokesperson for OpenAI did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\n\"There are multiple aspects of certain things that are just hard to do in a company that has to compete in an extremely, extremely brutal and demanding race for having the best AI model in the world right now,\" he said. \"One dynamic is there is naturally how much willingness of risks companies are willing to take from the perspective of trying to not fall behind.\"\n\nTworek said \"all major AI companies\" are facing pressure to show user growth and pay for GPUs while simultaneously competing to be the best available model.\n\n\"That does affect somehow your appetite for risk that you are willing to take,\" he said.\n\nDo you work at OpenAI or Google?

    "title": "10 Google Search Hacks Everyone Should Know",
    "description": "These tips can help you get better search results.",
    "fullText": "It's not just you. Google Search has become significantly worse in recent years. In the past, you only had to watch out for low-quality content filled with SEO-bait keywords. Today, you have to be wary of AI-generated garbage, misinformation, and a generally worse UI. Still, it's not impossible to find good search results on Google. I've found a number of tricks that have helped me reduce the number of low-quality entries Google returns for my searches. Here are 10 such tips everyone should know about before their next search:\n\nI'm still annoyed by Google's decision to slap AI right at the top of search results, and I make it a point to get rid of it every time I use a new browser or a new device. Doing this is much harder if you're using the Google Search app, so stick to web browsers if you want to rid yourself of AI results. To that end, there are actually a few easy ways to remove AI from Google's results. The quickest is to add -ai to your search queries and Google will remove AI results. Alternatively, you can try using the Hide Gemini browser extension.\n\nGoogle's best days were when it showed a simple page with 10 blue links the moment you searched for anything. If you want to return to that simplicity, you can use the Web search filter in Google. Once you search for something on Google, click the More button below the search bar up top, and select Web. This will remove all the clutter from Google Search and return 10 webpages at a time. If you use Chrome, you can simply type \"web\" in the address bar to start a Web search.\n\nI've also written about a browser extension called Lucky, which does the same thing in Safari for iPhone. Lucky is available at a one-time fee of $3, and, in my opinion, it's well worth the price.\n\nIf you know the domain you want to visit, you can limit your search to that domain alone. For example, you could restrict results to .gov if you only want to look at official US government sites, or .fr if you only wish to search websites registered in France. Just add site:.gov (or any other domain of your choice) to your search queries, and you'll find better results that way. It's also useful if you want to restrict searches to .ac.uk or .edu sites, which are more education-focused.\n\nIf you've found a trusted source that you like, such as Lifehacker, you can use Google to restrict your results only to that website. You can add site:lifehacker.com to your queries on Google, and it'll only show you results from this website. Just replace the name of the site with whichever one you like. This method is often better than using that site's internal search tools, too.\n\nWhen you're looking for specific information, you may be better off searching for a particular file format. For instance, if you're looking for scientific articles, you may have a better chance of finding a pdf file than a web result. In these cases, you can use the filetype:pdf filter to locate pdf files, and you can replace the file type to locate results in a different file format.\n\nIf you're finding significantly worse results using Google search, you can try to refine the results by using Google's built-in filters. Just below the search bar, you'll see a few tabs such as All, News, More, Tools, etc. Click through each of these to eliminate certain types of results. Specifically, the Tools tab lets you refine results by date, and even allows you to remove results for related search terms and focus only on exact matches.\n\nSometimes, basic Google search tools just aren't good enough to find what you need. This is particularly true when your search terms include words that are popular for other reasons. For instance, you're searching \"president,\" but not the president of your country. This is where advanced search could help you remove unwanted results. You can go to the Google Advanced Search page and use all the filters there to find what you need. Each filter has a helpful description right next to it, which makes it easy to figure out what you're doing.\n\nGoogle also allows you to upload files and images to find results. Open Google search and click the + button in the search bar to upload a file or an image. You can attach a query to the image, and Google will help answer that question, or you can even look for images similar to the one you've uploaded. This can be useful if you want to detect fake profiles online, as scammers often steal profile photos from others to create a fake identity.\n\nIf you can't always be bothered with using various manual methods to hide all the junk from your Google Search results, consider using a content blocker to do so. My favorite has long been uBlock Origin, which is available on desktop and on mobile. It'll remove all sponsored results, unwanted product listings, and most types of junk from your Google results.\n\nIf you really like and trust certain websites, you should add those as preferred sources on Google. This will ensure that results from those sites are highlighted among search results and the Top Stories section in your search results. Google rolled this feature out in 2025, and it's the most effective way to find information from higher quality websites. If you'd like, you can click this link to add Lifehacker as a preferred source.",

    "title": "Google Gemini's free test prep is the latest nail in the coffin for SAT tutors",
    "description": "Google launched free SAT practice tests via Gemini, with Princeton Review content, challenging traditional tutoring and ed-tech firms.",
    "fullText": "Students have long studied for the SATs with endless flashcards and prep books that doubled as doorstops. There's also personal tutors and prep classes for those who can afford it.\n\nGoogle debuted free, on-demand practice tests for the SAT through Google Gemini on Wednesday. The content of these tests is vetted by the Princeton Review — one of the publishers of those study tombs — while feedback is given by Google's AI.\n\nWhile the practice tests are only available for the SAT, Google teased that more exams were coming in the future.\n\n\"For anything you don't understand, you can ask Gemini to explain the correct answer,\" wrote Google DeepMind's Carol Walport. \"By helping you identify specific knowledge gaps, Gemini empowers you to turn those insights into action.\"\n\nWe’re launching full-length, on demand practice exams for standardized tests in @GeminiApp, starting with the SAT, available now at no cost.\n\nPractice SATs are grounded in rigorously vetted content in partnership with @ThePrincetonRev, and Gemini will provide immediate feedback… pic.twitter.com/GmivPuBp7B\n\nIt's another blow to the tutoring industry, a small but lucrative space coaching young adults toward academic success. College prep is especially high-earning. One SAT tutor told Business Insider last year that he charged $135 to $155 an hour; an essay tutor said he made $200,000 while only working nine months.\n\nIt's not the first time technology has eaten into the largely human tutoring industry. PDFs of practice tests have long run rampant around the internet. Tools like Quizlet and Chegg have made it easier for students to share study materials.\n\nThe threat of AI is wholly new, though, and the industry is still figuring out how to respond.\n\nIn 2023, Chegg's stock crashed 49% in a single day after the company said students were using ChatGPT to study. Two years later, the company laid off 45% of its workforce — or 388 employees — while citing the \"new realities of AI.\"\n\nSal Khan, the founder of the online tutoring program Khan Academy, said in 2023 that AI could be the \"biggest positive transformation that education has ever seen.\" Khan aims to give every student an \"artificially intelligent, but amazing, personal tutor.\"\n\nThe AI companies also know that education is a space where they can grow. Anthropic launched Claude for Education in April, which included student programs and a \"learning mode.\" Elon Musk's xAI has Grokipedia, a knowledge base similar to Wikipedia.\n\nOpenAI launched its Study Mode in July, when Business Insider declared education a \"new battlefield in the AI war.\"\n\nIn his famous 2023 letter about the future of AI, Bill Gates gave significant space to his predictions for education. Teachers would need to adapt, he wrote, but they wouldn't go away entirely.\n\n\"Even once the technology is perfected, learning will still depend on great relationships between students and teachers,\" Gates wrote. \"It will enhance — but never replace — the work that students and teachers do together in the classroom.\"\n\nBut for students and parents evaluating their options ahead of SAT season, Gemini's new test-prep offerings are the latest competition for human tutors.",

    "description": "Apple, Siri, and Google Gemini AI are at the forefront as Apple rebuilds its assistant, betting on AI model commoditization and flexibility.",
    "fullText": "Apple's decision to rebuild Siri around Google's Gemini AI models looks, at first glance, like an admission of failure. After years of promising breakthroughs, Apple is reportedly paying Google roughly $1 billion a year to keep its digital assistant relevant.\n\nLook closer, though, and the move represents something more radical: a giant bet that AI models will become commodities.\n\nTop tech reporter Mark Gurman wrote this week that Apple's revamped Siri, codenamed Campos, will launch later this year as a full-fledged chatbot embedded across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The underlying intelligence will come from Google's Gemini.\n\nThe more important detail is architectural. Apple is designing Campos so that the underlying AI models can be swapped out over time, according to Gurman's report for Bloomberg.\n\n\"That means the company will have the flexibility to move away from Google-powered systems in the future if it so chooses,\" he wrote.\n\nThat design choice tells us a lot about Apple's AI strategy.\n\nRather than trying to win an AI arms race against Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta by spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure, Apple appears to be positioning itself as model-agnostic. Siri remains Apple's direct interface to more than 1 billion iPhone users. The \"brains\" underneath, however, can change.\n\nIf Apple is right, the leading AI models will converge in quality over time, becoming roughly interchangeable. At that point, differentiation shifts away from the model itself and toward distribution, integration, privacy controls, and user experience — areas where Apple already excels.\n\nApple could then choose whichever AI provider is best, cheapest, or most strategically useful every few years. So, Google's Gemini might power Siri today, but tomorrow it could be OpenAI's latest GPT offering, or Claude from Anthropic, or whatever Meta is cooking up next, or xAI's Grok, or Mistral's offerings, or even region-specific models such as DeepSeek or Alibaba's Qwen in China. Services like OpenRouter already demonstrate how models can be swapped in and out.\n\nApple is also playing a longer game. Its search deal with Google, worth an estimated $20 billion a year, shows how valuable iPhone distribution is. If AI models truly commoditize, Apple could eventually flip the Siri relationship the same way: AI model providers could end up paying Apple for access to its massive user base.\n\nThe strategy also saves Apple enormous capital expenditure. While rivals pour huge sums of money into AI data centers and chips, Apple can let others shoulder that cost. For instance, Google spent more than $60 billion in capex during the first three quarters of 2025, while Apple spent $12.7 billion in its latest fiscal year.\n\nIf this AI building boom turns about to be a bust, Apple may dodge a bullet. Of course, it might turn out that underinvesting in your own AI capabilities is a strategic blunder of epic proportions.\n\nWe'll see in the next few years. Right now, Apple just placed a huge bet that the real power in the AI era won't belong to model makers, but to whoever controls the interface.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Nestled in Bloomberg’s reporting earlier on Apple’s plans to revamp Siri as a chatbot with iOS 27, was an interesting...",
    "fullText": "Nestled in Bloomberg’s reporting earlier on Apple’s plans to revamp Siri as a chatbot with iOS 27, was an interesting tidbit on a possible change in the company’s cloud strategy. Specifically, Mark Gurman says Apple and Google are discussing running the next-generation Siri models directly on Google’s servers, not Apple’s.\n\nWith iOS 26.4, Apple is set to launch the first new LLM Siri features, using models running in Private Cloud Compute based on an older generation of Gemini. But the Siri chatbot coming in the iOS 27 cycle will apparently be based off the newer, smarter, Gemini 3 models. Running these latest-gen models seemingly requires higher performance servers than what Apple can deliver right now through its own Private Compute cloud infrastructure …\n\nAs such, Apple user conversations with the new Siri chatbot experience would be trafficked through Google’s (much larger) cloud infrastructure for every request.\n\nThat would represent a big departure philosophically for Apple, which talked up Private Cloud Compute as a way to extend the privacy bubble of the personal data on your iPhone into Apple’s cloud. However, the Private Cloud Compute idea was designed under a prior regime. When Apple was promoting Private Cloud Compute at WWDC 2024, it had not conceived needing to license Gemini models from Google at all.\n\nAs such, it’s not unthinkable that other elements of its AI plan may be in flux. While Apple would probably like to keep as much of its processing running on its cloud, rather than a third-party, the new heads of Siri — Craig Federighi and former Vision Pro exec Mike Rockwell — seem to be choosing practicality over idealism. There is clearly pressure to ‘catch up’ and deliver modern Siri features to users as soon as possible, even if that means reneging on some parts of their prior published vision.\n\nAfter all, the company was also previously downplaying the premise of a chatbot experience altogether, but plans change and Apple is clearly responding to the proven market success of services like ChatGPT. It’s also probably safe to assume that Apple would negotiate the Google cloud server arrangement such that sensitive user data is not logged or retained by Google, sufficiently siloed from Google’s advertising and data collection units.\n\nBehind the scenes, parts of iCloud have depended on providers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform since its inception. These third-party data storage partners enable features like iCloud Photos to operate and scale, all the while Apple holds the encryption keys. Back in 2021, it was reported that Google’s cloud hosted an enormous 8 exabytes of iCloud content.\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

    "title": "Google Just Promised No Ads in Gemini (for Now)",
    "description": "The statement comes about a week after OpenAI announced ads are coming to ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "A week after OpenAI admitted it will soon start testing ads in ChatGPT, Google has promised that it's not planning to inject ads into Gemini anytime soon.\n\nThe statement was given to journalist Alex Heath during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said the company doesn't have \"any plans\" for ads in Gemini. While the statement was fairly brief, it also jibes with a similar quote Hassabis gave to Axios, where he said he was \"a little bit surprised\" that OpenAI was already introducing ads to ChatGPT.\n\nThat surprise is understandable, especially because OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in 2024 that he considered ads a \"last resort for us as a business model.\" But looking at the numbers, it makes sense that ChatGPT is getting ads long before Gemini is even thinking of them.\n\nWhile Google makes most of its money through showing people ads, it's also able to rely on Search and YouTube to push ads to most of those eyeballs. Meanwhile, OpenAI is pretty much just ChatGPT. As the latter moves to a for-profit model, it now has to put moneymaking first, something it's had trouble doing without relying on traditional internet moneymakers like ads. Google, meanwhile, is already profitable elsewhere, and is able to take its time and use its sheer size to keep Gemini ad-free, at least while it continues to chase market share.\n\nDoes this mean Google's AI will never get ads? Well, never say never. But it does mean that they're probably not on the horizon—even if Google plans to more aggressively monetize Gemini over the long term, it isn't facing the same kind of time crunch as Altman's company.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the presence of ads will push users away from ChatGPT, but the move comes in the wake of significant wins for Gemini and one major loss for ChatGPT. First, Google's Nano Banana image editing model went viral on social media, winning over the general public. Then, Google struck a deal with Apple to put its AI into the iPhone, and it looks like Gemini will be powering Siri for the foreseeable future.\n\nMeanwhile, ChatGPT reportedly saw a 6% dip in users early last month, following a model update from Gemini—and that was before the introdution of ads. While ChatGPT still seems to be in the lead on total user count, there's evidence that Google is catching up.\n\nThe divide in strategy seems clear: As OpenAI seeks ways to get more money out of its existing user base, Google can focus on growing its own with new integrations into the products we already use every day. I can't say what the limits of this growth are, but I can say that I rarely go out of my way use AI, yet I've still found myself accidentally relying on Google's AI overviews every now and then. If Google can get more people like me to casually integrate AI into our regular workflows, it's possible we could soon have a new AI leader on our hands.",

Last year a Los Angeles judge ruled that the platforms’ design features may be responsible for harm – and not just the third-party content posted on sites and apps.\n\nHistorically, tech firms have turned to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law underpinning US internet regulation that exempts platforms from legal liability for content generated by its users, as part of their legal defence. The first bellwether case is still due to begin on 27 January with jury selection.\n\nSnap remains a defendant in the other two cases.\n\nBeasley Allen, a law firm involved in the lawsuits on the plaintiff side, has said the cases could have profound consequences including billions of dollars in damages, forcing changes in platform design and new US regulations governing how tech firms interact with minors.\n\n“The litigation is being compared to past landmark cases against big tobacco and opioid manufacturers – industries that were held accountable for public health harms after years of denial,” the firm said in a statement last year.\n\nSnap, Meta, TikTok and YouTube have been contacted for comment.",

    "fullText": "Broadcom has a massive opportunity in front of it with custom AI chips.\n\nAlphabet has multiple shots on goal to produce outsized growth over the next decade.\n\nUiPath has the potential to be a huge winner as it transitions to become an agentic AI orchestration platform.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\n\nIf you want to turn $100,000 into $1 million over the next decade, you're going to need around a 26% compound average annual return (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That's a pretty big return, but not one that's impossible to hit. By comparison, the S&P 500 index generated an average yearly return of 14.8% over the past decade, and the Nasdaq 100 had a 19.7% average annual gain over that same period.\n\nLet's look at three stocks to buy that have the potential to help you reach this goal.\n\nIf you're shooting for outsized gains, you need to find stocks that have the opportunity to produce massive growth. One company with a huge growth opportunity in front of it is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). The company is a leader in the hot data center networking market, but its biggest opportunity is in helping customers create custom artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\n\nBroadcom is a leader in ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) technology, where it provides the building blocks to turn chip designs into actual chips that can be produced at scale. It helped Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) produce its well-regarded tensor processing units (TPUs), and other companies, including OpenAI, have turned to it to help them design their own custom chips. Analysts at Citigroup have predicted that Broadcom's AI revenue could rise fivefold over the next two years. Meanwhile, those estimates don't even include any contribution from Apple, with whom the company has been reportedly working, as well.\n\nPerhaps no company has as many shots on goal for outsized growth over the next decade as Alphabet. From AI to robotaxis to quantum computing, Alphabet is at the forefront of multiple technological shifts. The company also has the most complete AI stack of any company, with both a leading large language model (LLM) in Gemini and its world-class custom AI chips. This gives it a structural cost advantage with AI training and inference that filters into both its search/AI discovery and cloud computing businesses.\n\nAlphabet also has huge distribution (through Chrome, Android, and a search-revenue sharing deal with Apple) and monetization (its massive global ad network) advantages that provide a wide moat as search and generative AI chatbots meld together. Meanwhile, the company's TPUs have become so highly regarded that customers are now starting to Analysts at Morgan Stanley predict that every 500,000 TPUs deployed through Google Cloud equates to around $13 billion in revenue. It expects Alphabet to deploy 5 million TPUs in 2027 and 7 million in 2028.",

    "description": "Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a senior software engineer, explains how AI integration and prompt engineering are changing hiring in Big Tech software roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a 29-year-old senior software engineer based in Seattle. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a Big Tech employee for the past eight years, working at Google, Amazon, Splunk, and now Salesforce. I've had a front-row seat to witness the changes in the tech landscape.\n\nI've learned which skill sets software engineers need to land a job offer in the AI era. Tech companies agree that AI makes engineers more productive, so engineers are expected to use it to build things more quickly and reliably.\n\nI personally make heavy use of AI to help me with boilerplate stuff so that I can concentrate on the hard stuff, like system design and complex business logic.\n\nWhen I was interviewing for software engineering jobs in 2020, LeetCode and system design were the de facto standards for cracking a job interview. Job seekers who had an advanced understanding of data structures and algorithms would come out on top.\n\nToday, this is just the baseline expectation. AI is now widely used for coding, review, and design, so tech companies, especially startups, expect more from candidates.\n\nSome skills remain the same: Software engineers still need a problem-solving mindset and should know how to scale systems and leverage cloud services. New hires must now also understand prompt engineering — how to leverage AI to code a solution more efficiently.\n\nYou need to be able to use AI for error handling and bug fixing. AI systems integration is another important new skill that involves incorporating AI into existing workflows, scaling AI systems, and determining when to use traditional versus AI solutions for business decisions.\n\nYou're still expected to have fundamental knowledge of core system design, data structures, and algorithms. You can still expect interviewers to test your problem-solving approaches, and if you know how to make the correct tradeoffs in time and space. Interviewers still care about debugging skills, since AI makes a lot of fundamental logic errors.\n\nYou also need to be prepared for some new things. I've seen firsthand that working with AI assistants in live screen-sharing mode is now allowed in some interviews. Interviewers are looking to see if you can help them achieve their business outcomes by combining software engineering skills with AI prompting.\n\nIn an interview I had with a Silicon Valley startup in 2024, I expected the hiring team to give traditional coding challenges. I was taken aback when I was given a huge code file and asked to debug a buggy behavior, and the interviewers explicitly said I could use AI assistance.\n\nI ignored the invitation to use AI, thinking I was supposed to do it myself, and ended up spending a lot of time on the problem to no avail. I failed that interview. That was an eye-opener for me about AI's new role in this field.\n\nYou may also be asked system design questions about where AI should be integrated into the current business workflow, or to discuss the trade-offs of using AI and traditional approaches in various problem contexts.\n\nDuring my own system design interviews, I noticed companies starting to ask questions about how to integrate AI to enhance existing systems and support a particular model lifecycle in terms of infrastructure. What I've seen is that companies give access to a small codebase and expect you to deliver a small feature in about one hour, which is impossible without AI. With AI, you can roll it out easily.\n\nI've also been asked behavioral questions, like \"How do you plan to evaluate the use of AI in order to make the workflow better?\" and \"How do you plan to balance automation and manual oversight?\"\n\nFor new graduates, here's how to show hiring teams that you're equipped for the emerging needs of the software engineering role.\n\nStart by contributing to open-source projects on AI or any other GitHub project. This demonstrates that you can navigate a production codebase and work on it independently to build a new feature or fix a bug. For solo repositories, include a README that explains the rationale for your decision.\n\nIncorporate the use of AI in traditional repositories to demonstrate hands-on experience with AI integration. Don't just deploy and run it locally — try to deploy it to the cloud. Many cloud providers provide free student credits.\n\nFocus on prompting AI to drive intended outcomes more effectively by providing structured input and output. Skills like AWS or GCP cloud certifications demonstrate your ability to be a keen learner.\n\nLearn different problem-solving patterns and practice these skills regularly. Muscle memory and pattern recognition go a long way.\n\nFor experienced software engineers, your biggest asset is your deep engineering experience — here are three tips that will help you in 2026 and beyond.\n\nPairing years of engineering expertise with impressive AI skills will get the attention of hiring managers. Consider boning up on these complementary skills:\n\nSenior software engineers don't just build; they also need to strategize and innovate. Try to understand the trade-offs of relying on a third-party API versus using an open-source one and fine-tuning it for your business purposes. Questions on cost, reliability, and maintainability should always be top of mind as you develop an AI product mindset.\n\nIdentify workflows that have a great deal of manual involvement in your current job, and use AI to see if you can improve them. You can leverage AI to help you brainstorm on how to make it more efficient.\n\nBoth veteran and newbie engineers should stay curious: find out the cool technologies and AI agents available in today's market, but don't abandon fundamental engineering approaches. The hybrid understanding of these technologies is what makes you valuable.\n\nIf I were interviewing, I'd position myself as a 'hybrid engineer.' Don't just be a pure coder or just a prompt engineer. Be the bridge.",

The most prized employees today are \"player-coaches,\" people who ship work themselves while also guiding projects, mentoring peers, and shaping strategy. AI makes that hybrid role even more potent, allowing a single strong contributor to amplify their output, and their influence, without managing a large team, Musa wrote this week.\n\nThe result is a revival of the individual contributor track. You no longer have to become a full-time people manager to earn top-tier pay. At companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, senior ICs can now match (or beat) the compensation of managers simply by delivering outsized results, he noted.\n\nFor ambitious employees, the takeaway is simple: in the AI era, execution compounds. And Silicon Valley is increasingly willing to pay for it.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Larry Page, Google cofounder, moves major assets and residence from California to Florida as the Billionaire Tax Act targets ultrawealthy residents.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Larry Page recently drew his line in the sand on a beach on the opposite side of California — and it cost him over $170 million.\n\nCalifornia has proposed the Billionaire Tax Act, which would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth over $1 billion. Page, whose net worth is $269 billion as of January according to Forbes, isn't giving California the option to tax him and is deserting the Golden State for a state on the opposite extreme of taxing the wealthy: Florida.\n\nThe proposed bill, which doesn't appear on the ballot until November, would retroactively tax billionaires living in California as of January 1. Conveniently, Page reportedly located a Florida residence just before then.\n\nPage purchased a 4.5-acre compound in Miami's glamorous Coconut Grove neighborhood in December 2025 for $101.5 million, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Miami-Dade County property records show late restaurateur Jonathan Lewis previously owned the property.\n\nAnd for good measure, property records show a trust linked to Page bought another property — less than a mile away from the other — for $71.9 million in January this year. The trust, Tropical Frontier Revocable Trust, lists Florida attorney Benjamin Babcock and Mary McFadden Quisenberry, the chief operating officer of Palo Alto, California-based Rosewood Family Advisors, as trustees. Babcock declined to comment on the transaction.\n\nTax filings from Page's family foundation, the Carl Victor Page Memorial Foundation, show Rosewood Family Advisors provided tax and accounting services for the foundation in 2024. Rosewood Family Advisors could not be reached for comment.\n\nPage also filed to move a number of his businesses from California to Delaware, Florida, and Texas, Business Insider reported earlier this year.\n\nAn agent involved in the $101.5-million transaction, Danny Hertzberg of The Jills Zeder Group, declined to comment on this particular deal. He said wealthy Californians have been lining up to buy homes in Florida recently.\n\n\"We started feeling an impact, let's say in early December, which really picked up going to the end of the year,\" Hertzberg told Business Insider. \"California's dominating the high end of the market. The market right now, in terms of offers and active buyers, has a huge California presence, and it's directly related to 5% net worth.\"\n\nWealthy people moving to South Florida isn't a new trend, though some of the most recent residents made large splashes. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, arguably, became the most notable Florida mover after building his own compound on an exclusive island in Miami's Biscayne Bay.\n\nSouth Florida tried a somewhat rebrand in the early 2020s as the Silicon Valley of the East and did attract some movers. This latest shift has serious legs and the potential to change the perception of South Florida, according to Hertzberg.\n\n\"All of the movement I've seen from California is primary residences — people putting roots down and planning to be here,\" Hertzberg said. \"I think that may push along an already strong existing trend as Miami emerges as a major destination for finance and tech.\"\n\n\"With the level and caliber of people that are looking, that have already acquired properties here, and that are moving here, I do think, on the overall business perspective of Miami, it's already one of the major players in the country, if not the world,\" Hertzberg added. \"And it's going to be elevated as one of the premier destinations for those industries of finance, tech, and everything related.\"",

    "description": "Google finally revealed the origin of Nano Banana's codename.",
    "fullText": "The person who named Google's Nano Banana AI image-generation model has a pretty good idea of why the world found it so appealing.\n\n\"One reason we were successful is the model was available everywhere from day one — it didn't matter what country you were in, or whether you were a developer or a consumer, you had it on the same day,\" Product Manager Naina Raisinghani recently told Keyword, Google's official blog. \"And then culturally relevant prompts went viral everywhere, like the popular figurine trend, which started in Thailand, or the saree trend in India.\"\n\nGoogle revealed that Raisinghani was the originator of the model's zany codename, a last-minute decision.\n\n\"So at 2:30 a.m., one of the PMs messaged me saying we needed to submit it, and I said, 'OK, how about something funny like 'Nano Banana'?' And they're like, 'Yeah, sure. That's completely nonsensical,'\" Raisinghani told Keyword.\n\nThe search giant previously had a sweet tooth when it publicly named versions of its Android operating system after a dessert, a tradition it ended in 2019 when it reverted to the less indulgent practice of going with a numeral.\n\nNano Banana isn't the result of a health kick, though. Raisinghani said it is a play on her own nickname, \"Naina Banana.\"\n\n\"Some of my friends call me Naina Banana, and others call me Nano because I'm short and I like computers,\" she said. \"So I just smushed my two nicknames together. And it fit because it was a Flash model.\"\n\nAI frontier model makers and hyperscalers have frequently chosen creative (and sometimes food-centric codenames) for their models during public testing.\n\nLMArena, a popular AI testing platform, allows users to pit two AI models against each other, and they vote for a winner. After the vote, the initially masked model names are revealed. Companies can choose both publicly released models and those still in development, hence the codenames.\n\nGoogle doesn't have any plans to change the model's name.\n\n\"People responded really well,\" Raisinghani said. \"They were so impressed with it, and then they found the name funny, and that kind of grew discourse.\"\n\nRaisinghani also said her team is having fun with the banana wordplay and imagery.\n\n\"We've embraced the banana emoji as one of us. The team is split on the banana puns of it all,\" she said. \"But we're glad people find the model appealing.\"",

    "title": "A millennial quit a 6-figure job at Google to pursue more meaningful work: 'I wanted more out of my career and my life.'",
    "description": "Job quitters have become outliers in a frozen hiring market. Those who do it say the uncertainty was worth it to take some agency over their lives.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this year, Joslyn Orgill faced a career-defining choice: keep her six-figure data engineer job at Google — or leave it behind to pursue a path she hoped would make her happier in the long run.\n\nThere were many reasons it made sense to stay put. For one, Orgill had long viewed Google as the top destination for aspiring technical engineers — and she'd worked hard to get there. She spent two summers interning at ExxonMobil and Adobe, and in 2021 earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree in information systems from Brigham Young University through an integrated program.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, she was doing well — and she and her husband had bought a home in Austin less than two years earlier, a decision that made staying at Google feel like the practical choice.\n\nHowever, the reasons to leave began to build — she was concerned about job security in a tech career, felt somewhat invisible at a large company, and had a growing desire to pursue work she was more passionate about.\n\n\"Google's an amazing company, but the job just wasn't a great fit for me,\" said the 30-year-old.\n\nOver the past year, I've interviewed more than a dozen workers who, like Orgill, chose to quit their jobs with a major employer — in some cases, without having another role lined up. While some eventually landed at another large corporation, others stepped away from the corporate world entirely; they joined a smaller business, pursued a venture of their own, made a career pivot, or focused on personal matters, such as parenting.\n\nThese individuals have become outliers in an economy where workers are quitting at one of the lowest rates in the past decade — a trend driven by a hiring slowdown that's left many clinging to their jobs with few alternatives. Those who have called it quits in this environment told Business Insider they did so due to concerns about job security, shifts in workplace culture, entrepreneurial ambitions, and a desire to do more meaningful work. In short, they tend to quit because they want more agency over their careers in the long run.\n\nOrgill shared how she eventually became confident in her decision — and offered advice for others facing a crossroads in their careers.\n\nOrgill's decision was shaped in part by her time at BYU, where she taught two sections of an introductory programming and analytics course as an adjunct professor. She loved it and felt she was good at it.\n\nIn November 2021, Orgill received an offer for a full-time cloud technical resident role at Google, based in Austin, with the help of a referral from her sister-in-law. After she gave her a tour of a Google office, Orgill was especially eager to join the company.\n\n\"I just loved the vibes,\" she said. \"I was really excited to work at Google.\"\n\nShe eventually settled into a full-time data engineer role, but over time, she said she began to feel \"unseen\" — and that it often didn't feel like her work was making much of an impact.\n\n\"I wanted more out of my career and my life,\" she said, \"something that I was more passionate about than what I could achieve at a big company like Google.\"\n\nOrgill considered pursuing new roles, both inside and outside Google, but said there didn't seem to be many openings she was interested in — something she attributed, in part, to a broader hiring slowdown in tech.\n\n\"I had friends who were graduating and weren't able to find jobs,\" she said, \"so I just didn't have a lot of confidence that I would be able to find something that I enjoyed more at a different tech company.\"\n\nOrgill also wasn't fully confident in her job security at Google — or in the tech industry more broadly. That concern hit home in January 2023, about six months into the job, when Google announced plans to lay off around 12,000 workers.\n\n\"It was a crazy, crazy day,\" she said. \"That was a scary time.\"\n\nAs doubts about her career grew, Orgill said her interest in teaching lingered in the back of her mind. One path she'd considered was working in tech, earning good money, and returning to teaching later in life. But over time, she began to question whether it was worth postponing what she truly wanted to do.\n\n\"I felt like there were so many reasons not to — I'm making enough money, we just bought a house — but I realized that if I don't do it now, I'll always be wondering: what if I had?\"\n\nLast August, she left her job at Google to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science with a focus on education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nWhile she's still figuring out what she wants to do after the program — which typically takes four to six years — she's strongly considering an academic career, potentially as a professor teaching computer science or information systems courses. Her larger goal, she said, is to help broaden participation in the computer science field.\n\n\"I want other people to feel confident that they can do something with technology, even if they're from an underrepresented group,\" she said.\n\nOrgill said she received three years of funding from the university to pursue her Ph.D. and receives a modest monthly stipend. From a financial perspective, a big reason she felt comfortable resigning from Google is that her husband works remotely and kept his job when they moved to Illinois.\n\nThe couple tried to sell their home in Austin but didn't secure an offer they felt good about, so they're renting it out to friends while living in an apartment near campus. However, the rent they collect doesn't fully cover the mortgage, so they hope to sell the home eventually.\n\nOrgill said her experience in the Ph.D. program has been good so far. When she occasionally wonders whether leaving Google was the right move, she thinks back to how much she enjoyed teaching at BYU.\n\n\"That's what I go back to when I'm scared,\" she said, \"because getting a Ph.D. is a lot of work, and obviously giving up a salary and all of the benefits that I had was a big deal.\"\n\nOne of Orgill's top pieces of advice for others weighing a big career move: consider how much you're willing to give up financially to pursue more meaningful work. She added that having a supportive partner has also been crucial to making the pivot.\n\n\"My husband was incredibly supportive and wanted me to find something that I was passionate about,\" she said. \"I'm really grateful for that.\"",

    "description": "OpenAI leads enterprise AI adoption among US businesses, outpacing Anthropic and Google. Ramp data shows rising paid usage in December 2025.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is crushing it with business users and is far ahead of rivals such as Anthropic and Google in the enterprise AI market, according to new data this week.\n\nThat's a contrast to some of the hand-ringing that's gone on since Google's Gemini chatbot began gaining on ChatGPT a few months ago.\n\nThe new data comes from Ramp, a startup that helps companies pay their bills. Ramp analyzes corporate card and bill-paying activity on its platform from more than 50,000 US businesses to track billions of dollars spent on AI services each month.\n\nThe latest numbers cover December 2025. The report shows that OpenAI regained momentum among US businesses, posting its strongest growth in months as overall corporate adoption of AI continued to accelerate.\n\nThe share of US businesses paying for AI products and services rose to 46.6% in December, up 1.6 percentage points from November. That was the largest month-over-month increase since mid-2025, Ramp data shows.\n\nMuch of that growth was driven by OpenAI. Business adoption of OpenAI products climbed two percentage points to 36.8%, reversing a short-lived slowdown in the fall and reaching a new record high. Ramp's line-item data shows gains in both enterprise chat subscriptions and API spending, suggesting broader OpenAI usage across office workers and technical teams.\n\nIt's unclear how many current paid users OpenAI has, but the company said in November 2025 that it had 1 million business customers.\n\nThe rebound underscores OpenAI's continued dominance in the enterprise AI market at a time when companies are moving beyond experimentation. Rather than trial use, December's growth reflects recurring spend tied to everyday business functions, including software development, research, finance, sales, and customer support.\n\nCompetitors continued to gain ground, though at a slower pace. Anthropic's adoption rose to 16.7%, with growth concentrated among technology companies making heavy use of APIs.\n\nGoogle's AI adoption increased to 4.3%, a figure Ramp notes likely understates usage because many businesses access Gemini for free through Google Workspace plans.\n\nThese Ramp numbers also exclude business use of free AI tools, in which no paid transaction occurs, and when employees use personal accounts with AI companies to complete work tasks. This means the data likely underestimates actual AI adoption rates.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "The Gemini AI chatbot can now reason across Google apps including Gmail, Photos and YouTube, offering something OpenAI and Anthropic don't have.",
    "fullText": "Google is escalating the competition in artificial intelligence by leaning into a key advantage its rivals largely lack: an ecosystem of consumer apps used daily by billions of people.\n\nOn Wednesday, Google unveiled Personal Intelligence, a new beta capability in the Gemini app that allows the assistant to tailor responses by reasoning across a user's connected Google services, starting with Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history.\n\nThe feature rolls out in the US on Wednesday to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers. The company said it will also bring the technology to the free Gemini app and AI Mode in Search.\n\nWhile Gemini could previously pull information from individual apps, Personal Intelligence represents a significant change forward. Powered by Gemini 3, the system can now analyze and reason across multiple apps simultaneously, surfacing insights without users having to specify where to look. For example, Gemini might connect a Gmail confirmation with photos from a past trip and videos a user watched on YouTube to provide more relevant recommendations or answers.\n\nThat contextual depth highlights Google's strategic positioning in the AI race. Rivals such as OpenAI and Anthropic offer powerful standalone models, but they do not control consumer platforms on the scale of Gmail, YouTube, Photos, or Search. Google does, and Personal Intelligence is designed to turn that reach into differentiated value.\n\n\"The best assistants don't just know the world; they know you and help you navigate it,\" said Google VP Josh Woodward, who oversees the Gemini app, Google Labs, and AI Studio. \"This marks our next step toward making Gemini more personal, proactive, and powerful.\"\n\nThe company described the feature as a way for Gemini to move beyond reactive answers toward proactive assistance. The company argues this will make Gemini more useful in everyday tasks, from shopping and travel planning to content recommendations.\n\nThe rollout begins on the web, Android, and iOS. For now, Personal Intelligence is limited to personal Google accounts and is not available for Workspace users, including business, enterprise, and education accounts.\n\nPrivacy and control are central to the launch, Google said. The feature is off by default, and users must explicitly choose which apps to connect. Even when enabled, Gemini will not personalize every response, instead applying Personal Intelligence only when it determines it will be helpful. Users can opt out of personalization for specific responses, disconnect apps at any time, and manage or delete past chats.\n\nIn a sign of how Google is shipping fast these days, Woodward warned about potential \"over-personalization,\" where the model makes connections between unrelated topics.\n\n\"When you see this, please provide feedback by giving the response a 'thumbs down,'\" he wrote in a blog announcing the feature.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "OpenAI broke new ground when it enabled shopping within ChatGPT, but Walmart's head of AI said the retailer's new Google Gemini deal goes further.",
    "fullText": "The AI shopping war is heating up, and Walmart is positioning itself to come out on top.\n\nThe concept of letting a chatbot buy things on your behalf leapt from the hypothetical realm into reality when ChatGPT rolled out a batch of shopping experiences with major retailers in November.\n\nThen, on Sunday, Google's AI platform Gemini announced its own commerce approach, which it developed in partnership with many of the same retailers, including the world's largest, Walmart.\n\nWhile both services promise to allow customers to find products and complete transactions in a more conversational and automated way, Walmart's new head of AI, Daniel Danker, said Tuesday that the way Gemini handles transactions is more seamless than ChatGPT does.\n\n\"We're essentially having their AI agent, Gemini, partner with our AI agent to create a unified shopping journey,\" he said at the ICR Conference in Orlando. \"Imagine it like a window inside of Gemini where our shopping agent kicks in and helps you complete that purchase.\"\n\nGoogle said its new standards create a common language for different companies' AI agents to interact with.\n\nWith Gemini, Danker said, Walmart is able to link a customer's chat session with their existing Walmart profile and shopping sessions where Gemini wasn't involved.\n\n\"For the most part, our customers aren't just customers; they're often members. And so, they're getting great delivery fees and a great experience that's really attuned to them,\" he said, referring to the subscription service Walmart+. \"That member experience shows up directly within Gemini.\"\n\nDanker said he expects agentic shopping to help Walmart capture more sales from people who didn't set out intending to make a purchase. He said this new approach could enable an almost seamless transaction when a person enlists a chatbot to help solve a problem.\n\nFor example, if someone turned to Gemini for tips on how to remove a wine stain from a particular brand of carpet, a cleaning product could be added to their existing shopping cart for delivery in one combined shipment, he said.\n\nDanker said working with both ChatGPT and Gemini sets Walmart up to win in AI.\n\nIt appears that chatbot-powered shopping is here to stay, with Morgan Stanley analysts estimating that agentic sales could add $115 billion to US e-commerce spending by 2030.\n\nDanker is betting that Walmart's long-standing reputation for low prices and its growing strength in delivery will give the company a significant edge with customers in AI.\n\n\"The most important currency in an agentic shopping world is actually trust and affordability,\" Danker said. \"Without trust and affordability, it's very difficult for customers to hand the wheel to someone else and expect that the right thing will happen.\"\n\nDanker said Walmart's broad selection, low prices, and fast fulfillment help it appear more frequently in Gemini and ChatGPT's shopping recommendations.\n\n\"That doesn't just serve one need, but serves a whole bunch of needs,\" he said.",

    "description": "Use AI to connect and reason across your Google apps in just a few clicks.",
    "fullText": "Since the days when Google Gemini was still called Bard, it's been able to connect with the company's other productivity apps to help pull context from them to answer your questions—but you still had to connect those apps to the AI manually using extensions. And even after bringing your apps together, you usually had to tell Gemini where to look for your data to get much use out of its abilities. For Instance, if you wanted it to pull information from your emails, you might have started a prompt with \"Search my email.\"\n\nNow, Google is making it easier to connect Gemini to its various services, and adding \"reasoning\" when pulling context from across your Google Workspace. It's calling the feature \"Personal Intelligence.\"\n\nRolling out in beta for paid subscribers in the U.S. today (and coming to other countries and free users \"soon\"), Personal Intelligence is an opt-in feature that currently works with Gmail, Photos, YouTube, and Search, all of which you can connect in one tap while setting up the feature.\n\nThat alone makes it more convenient than a collection of extensions, but there are supposedly a few upgrades to general usability as well. The biggest is that Gemini will apparently be able to \"learn\" about you from a grab bag of sources all at once, without you having to specify where to look, and use that information to answer your questions.\n\nIn an example, Google has a user say \"I need to replace the tires for my car. Which ones would you suggest for me?\" The bot then runs through multiple reasoning steps, pulling from all the data available to it, to find out what car the prompter drives and which tires would be best for it in the conditions the prompter tends to drive in. Specifically, in the example, it references actual vacations the prompter had taken in the past, using Google Photos data, while also using Gmail data to help the prompter find their car's specific trim. This can take a while, which is why there's an \"Answer now\" button next to the reasoning progress bar to stop the bot from getting stuck. In the example, it took about 10 seconds for the AI to generate a response.\n\nGoogle is promising its typical Workspace privacy guarantees with Personal Intelligence, saying \"because this data already lives at Google securely, you don't have to send sensitive data elsewhere to start personalizing your experience.\" In other words, it's not going to move the needle on how much data about you Google can access, but at least it'll prevent you from having to connect your Workspace to third parties. The company also promises that data Personal Intelligence pulls from sources like Gmail won't be used to train Gemini, but that \"specific prompts and responses\" might be, at least after personal data has been filtered out.\n\nGoogle also says, \"Gemini will try to reference or explain the information it used from your connected sources so you can verify it,\" although we don't have any examples of that in action yet. It's worth keeping an eye out, though, if you're worried about hallucinations. To that end, the company does suggest asking Gemini \n\nGoogle says that eligible users should see an invitation to try Personal Intelligence on the Gemini home screen as soon as it's rolled out to them, but if you don't, you can turn it on manually by following these steps:\n\nOpen Gemini and click or tap Settings.\n\nClick or Tap Personal Intelligence.\n\nUnder Connected Apps, select which apps you would like Personal Intelligence to take information from.\n\nAnd that's it! Remember, Personal Intelligence is off by default and is only available for paid subscribers for now, so it may be some time until you can actually use it. Google also stresses the Gemini might not personalize every response, as that will save time on more simple requests. The company also said Personal Intelligence for AI Mode in Google Search is currently planned, but does not have a set release date.",

    "description": "They can take on a lot more responsibility, if they choose to.",
    "fullText": "The internet is a wild place, and not particularly kid-friendly. Unfortunately, it's highly impractical to keep your kids entirely off the web. That's where family accounts come in handy: Parents can set their kids up with supervised accounts, giving them access to essential apps and services, without allowing unfettered access to the entire net. It's often imperfect, and kids find workarounds for the guardrails, but still; it's better than nothing.\n\nEvery company that offers a family account handles things differently. Meta, for example, continues to update their policies in the wake of criticism surrounding how addictive and harmful their apps can be for children. These days, teens have to deal with a number of limitations they didn't previously have: While users 16 and older can remove these limitations if they wish, those under 16 need a parent's consent to do so. That means things like screen time, going live on Instagram, and DMs are all blocked and controlled by the parent for users 15 and under.\n\nIf you're the administrator of a Google Family Account, you might assume you have a similar level of control over your kids' Google accounts. Perhaps you imagine it's like Meta: When they're old enough, maybe something like 16, they can decide for themselves what level of access they have on their account, but until then, you'd have the final say. As it turns out, that's not the case. In fact, you really only have that control until your kid turns 13.\n\nI first came across this issue from this LinkedIn post from user Melissa McKay. McKay, frustrated, shared how she received an email from Google, alerting her that her youngest child will soon have the option to remove supervision on their Google Account once they turn 13. According to the attached screenshots, the email says that once the child turns 13, they'll be able to access more Google apps and services, and customize their Google Account to make it their own. McKay summed up her discontent with the following: \"Call it what it is. Grooming for engagement. Grooming for data. Grooming minors for profit.\"\n\nThe post currently has over 6,400 reactions on LinkedIn, which is relatively viral for the platform. Since I don't have kids, this is the first I'm hearing about these rules. But a quick search pulls up Google's official support doc on the subject. Indeed, when a child turns 13 (or an applicable age due to the law of the country or region) they are given the choice to either continue on with parental supervision, or manage their own Google Account.\n\nHere's what that means for your child:\n\nThey'll no longer have access to YouTube Kids, but will have access to general YouTube. Google will also disable supervised YouTube experiences.\n\nThey'll be able to add payment cards to Google Wallet or Google Pay, and can remove cards from their phone or watch, as well.\n\nThey'll be able to use these cards for tap to pay, in-app payments, website payments via Google Pay, autofill, as well as various payments across Google services, like the Play Store and YouTube.\n\nAnd here's what that means for you, as their parent:\n\nYou can no longer set up supervision features like downtime, app blocking, or mandatory location sharing. (Your child can choose to share their location, if they want to.)\n\nYou can no longer see your child's transactions or get notifications when they make new purchases.\n\nYou can't add or remove payment cards for your kid.\n\nYou can't block their access to Wallet passes.\n\nOf course, these changes are contingent on your child's decision to remove the supervision. They can choose to keep it on, and, as such, you can continue to monitor and administer your kid's account. However, I can imagine many 13 year olds will choose to remove supervision, unless they're particularly agreeable. As such, you effectively lose control when your child does turn 13.\n\nInterestingly, Google says that once a child removes supervision without your permission, their device is locked \"temporarily.\" It's not clear whether this means that the parent device needs to unlock the device, or if this just a cool down period, and the device will unlock on its own. I've reached out to Google for clarity here.\n\nEven though Google allows kids to lift restrictions when they turn 13, they don't have total access to all of Google's services. According to this support doc, there are some key age-restricted content and services that require users to be 18 or older, including:\n\nThat's it, at least according to Google's safety doc. I've reached out to Google again for clarity on what other restrictions are in place on accounts between ages 13 and 18, and will update this article when I know more.\n\nThis is all changing, however. Kate Charlet, Google's head of global privacy, safety, and security, posted on LinkedIn as well, acknowledging the current policy and asserting that Google has changes in the works. Soon enough, Google will require both the child and the parent to agree to lift supervision. That should help parents who aren't ready to let their 13 year old access standard YouTube and other Google services without their permission.\n\nOf course, for parents that have already received an email about their kids reaching \"the age of digital consent,\" this might not offer much solace.",

    "title": "Google Is Changing Its Account Policy About Minors Who Turn 13",
    "description": "They now need a parent's permission before removing supervision on their Google Account.",
    "fullText": "If you have a Family Account through Google, you might assume you can control what your child can see or do on their device. You can, but, as it happens, only up to a certain point. When your kid turns 13, Google will send them an email, letting them know they can choose to disable your supervision over their account. You get an email too, but they don't need your permission to lock you out of their device. Once they decide they're ready for a relatively complete Google Account experience, it's their choice to make.\n\nDespite being Google's official policy, this situation was not common knowledge. Following a relatively viral LinkedIn post about the subject, parents were peeved at the notion of Google deciding that their 13 year old was ready to be unsupervised on the internet. Google's Family Account does allow kids to stay on supervised plans after they turn 13, but they can choose to remove the supervision at any point, which largely defeats the purpose. Unless your child really respects your rules, they likely won't keep their account locked down when they don't have to.\n\nLuckily for parents, that's now changing. In a separate LinkedIn post, Google's Kate Charlet announced that under a planned policy update, minors will need to get their parents' permission before disabling supervision. (Charlet also referred to turning 13 as the \"age of digital consent,\" which seems to me to be an extremely strange way to say \"old enough to have an unsupervised Google Account.\")\n\nWhen I reached out to Google about the changes, the company told me that the policy should now be adjusted. As such, 13-year-olds shouldn't be able to remove supervision without permission. That said, Google's support documents have not yet been updated, so it might take some time to fully roll out.\n\nSpeaking of Google's former support documents, the company notes that when kids did choose to remove permissions, their device would lock up temporarily. When I asked Google about this, I was told that due to the change in policy, device lock is no longer a feature. However, it's still unclear to me how this feature worked when kids could remove permissions on their own: Did parents have to manually unlock the device for their kids? Would devices unlock after a set period of time? I've reached back out to Google about these questions, though they might not matter once teens need their parents' permission.\n\nAs I explain in my post here, removing supervision takes a lot of controls away from parents, and gives teens a lot more responsibility. Parents can't control screen time, manage payment cards and transactions, and can't block standard YouTube in favor of YouTube Kids. In addition, kids can choose to stop sharing their location with you if they want to.\n\nBut now that parents have the authority here, these controls can continue for your 13-year-old. If you want them to keep their location turned on, they won't have the option to turn it off; if you want to monitor their transactions, they can't stop you; if you don't want them having a credit card, they won't be able to add one—at least, until you manually disable supervision on your end.\n\nIt's a good thing that Google is giving families more options, and it joins other big tech companies, like Meta, doing the same.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Google Maps User Should Know",
    "description": "Take your route planning to the next level.",
    "fullText": "Google Maps is the only navigation service I use, and I've learned many of its tricks over the years. The default settings do a good enough job for most people, but it's worth reviewing all of its features to ensure that you're getting exactly what you need. For instance, avoiding tolls may be great where you live, but if you're driving in a different state or country, that same feature could land you in some serious trouble. These tips will help you make the most of Google Maps' many features, and reduce the chances of losing your way while using the app.\n\nEven if you ignore everything else in this article, don't ignore this. I've observed that, sometimes, Google Maps automatically enables route options I did not select, which can lead to some sticky situations. Whenever I'm on a long road trip to unknown destinations, I like to double-check route settings before I head out. To do this, tap the profile icon in the top-right corner in the Google Maps app, and go to Settings > Navigation > Route options. This has four options: Avoid tolls, Avoid highways, Avoid ferries, and Prefer fuel-efficient routes. I like to disable all of these to ensure that I reach my destination safely and quickly.\n\nIf you're in an area you know fairly well, you can enable some of these options to find a cheaper route, or one with less traffic. But in unfamiliar territory, I prefer to play it safe.\n\nI often travel to places with poor or no cellular signal, and Google Maps' offline mode has been a lifesaver in these locations. It lets you download Google Maps data for specific locations, and I've set up the app to automatically download and update this data when new information becomes available. This makes it a lot easier to navigate when the internet disappears.\n\nYou can easily do this by searching for a destination on Google Maps and swiping left on the controls that appear below its name. Tap More > Download offline map > Download to save it for offline use. To automatically update offline maps, go to your Google maps settings and select Offline. Now hit the gear icon in the top-right corner and select Auto-update offline maps.\n\nGoogle Maps shows you better search results and improves recommendations for fuel-efficient routes if you choose the correct type of vehicle. Go to your Google Maps settings and navigate to Your vehicles. Select the correct engine type for your vehicle to ensure better recommendations. If you're using an EV, you can also use this page to set the type of charger it uses. This helps Google Maps send you to compatible EV charging stations when you're out and about.\n\nIf you often stream music while driving, you should consider connecting your streaming accounts with Google Maps, which supports both Apple Music and Spotify. Once you've connected the navigation app with either of these services, you'll be able to control music playback and choose playlists from your library, all without leaving the Google Maps app. I don't recommend looking at your phone when you're driving, but you can use this feature to control playback or quickly change songs while your car's stopped. It's a lot faster than switching to a different app to change music.\n\nSome of you will prefer to use voice assistants to do this, but on an iPhone in particular, I haven't had much luck with using Siri to change music. That's why I've connected my streaming accounts to Google Maps instead.\n\nGoogle Maps can highlight accessibility information for you. This can be extremely helpful if you're traveling with people who have mobility challenges or are living with disabilities. I never thought much about these options until I started traveling with my senior citizen parents, who can no longer climb lots of stairs or stand for long hours. That's why I went to the Google Maps settings, navigated to App & display, and enabled Emphasize accessibility info. This feature prominently shows if a destination has accessible entrances, seating, reserved parking spots, and if restrooms are available (and accessible), etc.\n\nNote that this information isn't always accurate, so if accessibility is your top priority, I still recommend calling ahead to confirm if your destination's accessible features are available and in working order. Similarly, when you're using walking directions to get somewhere, try tapping the options button, which is next to the share icon. This will reveal the Trip options page, where you can select Wheelchair accessible to avoid routes with stairs and choose ones that have elevators instead.\n\nI use Google Maps a lot while I'm walking around, and I have a few tips to make it easier to find where you're going. The first is to use Google Maps when you're wearing an Apple Watch or an Android smartwatch, if you have one. Google Maps buzzes your watch when you have a direction coming up, and you can quickly look at the watch to see which way to go. With this, I don't have to keep looking at my phone for directions. This approach worked really well on a recent trip to Singapore in rainy weather, where it wasn't always possible to keep looking at my phone while also holding my water bottle and umbrella.\n\nYou can also use Live View to get even more detailed walking directions. It uses your phone's camera to identify shops, signs, and other landmarks near you. Then, it gives you directions in a camera view, which is like a live video walkthrough taking you to your destination. This makes it great for navigating indoors, like in airports or malls.\n\nWhen you review listings on Google Maps, or make other contributions, others may be able to view your profile and all your ratings, reviews, photos, and other contributions. If you don't want this information to be visible, you can make your profile private on Google Maps. To do this, go to Google Maps settings > Location & privacy > Profile and enable Restricted profile.\n\nGoogle Maps also keeps track of all the places you've visited, and not everyone is comfortable storing that data on Google's servers. Now, I should say that this information is legitimately useful sometimes. Once, a friend's car was wrongly sent a speeding ticket from a different state. He was able to use his Google Maps timeline data to prove to law enforcement that he was, in fact, not in that state at the time.\n\nHaving said that, you'll be able to better preserve your privacy by not storing this information in the first place. To do that, go to Google Maps settings > Location & privacy. Review all the options in the Timeline section to see what fits your preferences. I've switched off Timeline entirely, and I also chose Delete all Timeline data, but your needs may be different, so you may choose to delete a specific range of timeline data or automatically delete it after a certain period of time instead.\n\nTo delete your search history from Google Maps, scroll down on this page and select Maps history.\n\nIf deleting your Google Maps data permanently isn't the ideal solution for you, then you may want to try incognito mode instead. This works exactly like it does in web browsers, meaning that it won't save your Google Maps data as long as you're in that mode. You can enable it by tapping the profile icon in Google Maps and selecting Turn on incognito mode. You can check if it's enabled by looking at the profile icon, where your picture will be replaced by the incognito icon.\n\nIf you have trouble remembering all of the trips you want to take, you can quickly save your favorites in Google Maps, and add them to various lists. For instance, if you're planning a trip to Florida and you want to save all of the destinations you've heard about in one spot, you can look for each one individually on Google Maps and hit the Save button on their listings. This lets you save the destination to a new list, where you can keep a tab on all the places you want to go to. You can also share these lists with others, and everyone can add the places they're interested in to your list, too. I used this feature during my London trip last year, where I bookmarked restaurants that served authentic fare from around the world. It allowed me to taste food that I'd never tried before, and helped me better organize my daily plan to fit a couple of museums or other attractions around my meals.",

    "description": "An alternative to MCP transcoding is gRPC, and Google Cloud is working with MCP maintainers to support pluggable transports in the MCP SDK.",
    "fullText": "Our most intelligent model is now available on Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise\n\nAI agents are moving from test environments to the core of enterprise operations, where they must interact reliably with external tools and systems to execute complex, multi-step goals. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the standard that makes this agent to tool communication possible. In fact, just last month we announced the release of fully-managed, remote MCP servers. Developers can now simply point their AI agents or standard MCP clients like Gemini CLI to a globally-consistent and enterprise-ready endpoint for Google and Google Cloud services.\n\nMCP uses JSON-RPC as its standard transport. This brings many benefits as it combines an action-oriented approach with natural language payloads that can be directly relayed by agents in their communication with foundational models. Yet many organizations rely on gRPC, a high-performance, open source implementation of the remote procedure call (RPC) model. Enterprises that have adopted the gRPC framework must adapt their tooling to be compatible with the JSON-RPC transport used by MCP. Today, these enterprises need to deploy transcoding gateways to translate between JSON-RPC MCP requests and their existing gRPC-based services.\n\nAn interesting alternative to MCP transcoding is to use gRPC as the native transport for MCP. Many gRPC users are actively experimenting with this option by implementing their own custom MCP servers. At Google Cloud, we use gRPC extensively to enable services and offer APIs at a global scale, and we’re committed to sharing the technology and expertise that has resulted from this pervasive use of gRPC. Specifically, we’re committed to supporting gRPC practitioners in their journey to adopt MCP in production, and we’re actively working with the MCP community to explore mechanisms to support gRPC as a transport for MCP. The MCP core maintainers have arrived at an agreement to support pluggable transports in the MCP SDK, and in the near future, Google Cloud will contribute and distribute a gRPC transport package to be plugged into the MCP SDKs. A community-backed transport package will enable gRPC practitioners to deploy MCP with gRPC in a consistent and interoperable manner.\n\nThe native use of gRPC as a transport avoids the need for transcoding and helps maintain operational consistency for environments that are actively using gRPC. In the rest of this post, we explore the benefits of using gRPC as a native transport for MCP and how Google Cloud is supporting this journey.\n\nFor organizations already using gRPC for their services, native gRPC support allows them to continue to use their existing tooling to access services via MCP without altering the services or implementing transcoding proxies. These organizations are on a journey to keep the benefits of gRPC as MCP becomes the mechanism for agents to access services.\n\n“Because gRPC is our standard protocol in the backend, we have invested in experimental support for MCP over gRPC internally. And we already see the benefits: ease of use and familiarity for our developers, and reducing the work needed to build MCP servers by using the structure and statically typed APIs.” -  Stefan Särne, Senior Staff Engineer and Tech Lead for Developer Experience, Spotify\n\nUsing gRPC as a native transport aligns MCP with the best practices of modern gRPC-based distributed systems, improving performance, security, operations, and developer productivity.\n\nThe performance advantages of gRPC provide a big boost in efficiency, thanks to the following attributes:\n\nBinary encoding (protocol buffers): gRPC uses protocol buffers (Protobufs) for binary encoding, shrinking message sizes by up to 10x compared to JSON. This means less bandwidth consumption and faster serialization/deserialization, which translates to lower latency for tool calls, reduced network costs, and a much smaller resource footprint.\n\nFull duplex bidirectional streaming: gRPC natively supports the client (the agent) and the server (the tool), sending continuous data streams to each other simultaneously over a single, persistent connection. This feature is a game-changer for agent-tool interaction, opening the door to truly interactive, real-time agentic workflows without requiring application-level connection synchronization.\n\nBuilt-in flow control (backpressure): gRPC includes native flow control to prevent a fast-sending tool from overwhelming the agent.\n\nEnterprise-grade security and authorization\n\ngRPC treats security as a first-class citizen, with enterprise-grade features built directly into its core, including:\n\nMutual TLS (mTLS): Critical for Zero Trust architectures, mTLS authenticates both the client and the gRPC-powered server, preventing spoofing and helping to ensure only trusted services communicate.\n\nStrong authentication: gRPC offers native hooks for integrating with industry-standard token-based authentication (JWT/OAuth), providing verifiable identity for every AI agent.\n\nMethod-level authorization: You can enforce authorization policies directly on specific RPC methods or MCP tools (e.g., an agent is authorized to ReadFile but not DeleteFile), helping to ensure strict adherence to the principle of least privilege and combating \"excessive agency.\"\n\nOperational maturity and developer productivity\n\ngRPC provides a powerful, integrated solution that helps offload resiliency measures and improves developer productivity through extensibility and reusability. Some of its capabilities include:\n\nUnified observability: Native integration with distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) and structured error codes provides a complete, auditable trail of every tool call. Developers can trace a single user prompt through every subsequent microservice interaction.\n\nRobust resiliency: Features like deadlines, timeouts, and automatic flow control prevent a single unresponsive tool from causing system-wide failures. These features allow a client to specify a policy for a tool call that the framework automatically cancels if exceeded, preventing a cascading failure.\n\nPolyglot development: gRPC generates code for 11+ languages, allowing developers to implement MCP Servers in the best language for the job while maintaining a consistent, strongly-typed contract.\n\nSchema-based input validation: Protobuf's strict typing mitigates injection attacks and simplifies the development task by rejecting malformed inputs at the serialization layer.\n\nError handling and metadata: The framework provides a standardized set of error codes (e.g., UNAVAILABLE, PERMISSION_DENIED) for reliable client handling, and clients can send and receive out-of-band information as key-value pairs in metadata (e.g., for tracing IDs) without cluttering the main request.\n\nAs a founding member of the Agentic AI Foundation and a core contributor to the MCP specification, Google Cloud, along with other members of the community, has championed the inclusion of pluggable transport interfaces in the MCP SDK. Participate and communicate your interest in having gRPC as a transport for MCP:",

    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s AI engine inside the Pentagon network.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military’s data as possible into the developing technology.\n\n“Very soon we will have the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,” Hegseth said in a speech at Musk’s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.’s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.\n\nHegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would “make all appropriate data” from the military’s IT systems available for “AI exploitation.” He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.\n\nHegseth’s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.\n\nThe Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.\n\nDuring his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, “We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.”\n\nHe noted that the Pentagon possesses “combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.”\n\n“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we’re going to make sure that it’s there,” Hegseth said.\n\nThe defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models “that won’t allow you to fight wars.”\n\nHegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,” before adding that the Pentagon’s “AI will not be woke.”\n\nMusk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called “woke AI” interactions from rival chatbots like Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to questions about the issues with Grok.",

    "fullText": "After Apple chose Gemini to power Siri, Alphabet surpassed Apple to become second-most valuable company in world\n\nGoogle’s parent company hit a major financial milestone on Monday, reaching a $4tn valuation for the first time and surpassing Apple to become the second-most valuable company in the world.\n\nAlphabet is the fourth company to hit the $4tn milestone after Nvidia, which later hit $5tn, Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe spike in share price comes after Apple announced it had chosen Google’s Gemini AI model to power a major overhaul of the iPhone maker’s digital assistant Siri, which comes installed in every iPhone. Neither company disclosed how much the deal was worth.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,” Apple said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nAs tech stocks continue a years-long meteoric rise, fears of a bubble in the stock market persist; however, Wall Street’s excitement for new avenues of investment in AI does as well. Alphabet’s milestones signal a remarkable change in investor sentiment for Alphabet, with its stock surging about 65% in 2025, outperforming its peers on Wall Street’s elite group of stocks, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”.\n\nThe tech giant has allayed investors’ doubts about its artificial intelligence strategy in recent months with a series of high-profile product launches, including the latest version of its flagship AI model, Gemini, and the popular Nano Banana image generator and editor. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and Google’s insurgent rival, left investors and consumers underwhelmed with the release of its latest model, GPT-5, which allowed Alphabet to surge ahead.\n\nGoogle, best known for making the world’s most popular search engine and browser, has also turned its once-overlooked cloud unit into a major growth engine, which drew a rare tech investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Google Cloud’s revenue jumped 34% in the third quarter, with a backlog of non-recognized sales contracts rising to $155bn. Renting out Google’s self-developed AI chips that were reserved for internal use to outside customers has also enabled the unit’s breakneck pace of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company’s dominant revenue generator – the advertising business, driven by Google Search and YouTube – has largely held steady in the face of economic uncertainty and intense competition.\n\nThe company has faced two landmark US antitrust suits as it has navigated its place in the AI boom. After Google lost the first case, a judge ruled in September against breaking up the company, allowing it to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.\n\nIn the second case, a judge ruled Google had illegally monopolized the online ad market last April. A trial over how to remedy the monopoly began in September, which could see the judge forcing Google to divest parts of its lucrative ads business to foster competition.",

    "description": "Apple’s AI Siri is planned for this year, and it'll use Google Gemini.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly two years since Apple announced a more intelligent Siri, and yet, we're still waiting to get our hands on it. Aside from being able to answer a few questions about Apple products or shunt your questions off to ChatGPT for you, the voice assistant is essentially still the same it was before Apple Intelligence launched for other Apple features in iOS 18.1. Now, the iPhone maker seems to be throwing in the towel on developing an AI-enabled Siri entirely on its own, and is asking Google for help. I can't imagine Tim Cook is too happy about that, but on the flip side, that does mean an AI Siri might finally come out, and soon.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC's Jim Cramer, Apple admitted that it is now planning to use Google Gemini to power its AI-infused Siri, rather than purely in-house models. The company said that, \"After careful evaluation, we determined that Google's technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we're excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users.\"\n\nPreviously, Apple had promised that its AI Siri would be able to do tasks on your behalf, like send a drafted email, or would be able to answer questions using context pulled from your phone, like surfacing a friend's address using information pulled from a text thread. Reportedly, however, implementing these features during testing kept breaking more traditional Siri features, like setting alarms and reminders, which has kept sending Apple back to the drawing board. The new, Gemini-powered voice assistant for Android faced similar issues at first, but based on my hands-on time with the company's latest phones, those growing pains seem to have subsided, so it makes sense that Google would be the first company Apple would turn to while looking for outside help.\n\nApple hasn't said too much more about the deal for now, but Google itself did step in to offer Apple users a bit more clarity, plus some reassurance about their data.\n\nIn a statement on X, the company assured Apple users that \"Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\" That's the same deal Apple has with OpenAI right now, which allows its users to ask ChatGPT questions without the AI being able to train on them or keep a log of their requests. It essentially means Google won't get any data from your AI-powered Siri. Google's statement also confirmed a detail from CNBC's initial article, stating that its agreement with Apple will be a multi-year deal.\n\nPerhaps most exciting is that Google said the AI-powered Siri will come out \"this year,\" mirroring a statement an Apple spokesperson gave to Daring Fireball last March, admitting that an AI-enabled Siri was taking longer than anticipated and saying the company hoped to launch it in 2026. That's welcome relief to anyone who thought Apple had given up on the project.\n\nA more concrete timeline is still unknown, although Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, a reputable reporter with inside sources at Apple, has previously said to expect the AI Siri upgrade to launch in the spring. Personally, I could also see the company holding the launch until its annual WWDC event, which tends to happen in June.\n\nDespite Apple and Google's public feud as the makers of iOS and Android, respectively, this wouldn't mark the two companies' first time working together, especially in the mobile space. Previously, it was uncovered that Google and Apple have a lucrative deal to make Google the default search engine in Safari, which caused a lengthy legal battle that ultimately allowed the companies to maintain their deal, but barred exclusivity contracts. Part of the reasoning behind the AI Siri delay might be that the companies wanted to work together on AI before, but were holding off on it out of an abundance of caution. However, according to the courts, Google will also be able to make deals with outside distributors for \"preloading and placement\" of its GenAI products going forward, which seemingly puts both companies in the clear.",

    "description": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin studied graduate computer science at Stanford—but admits Gen Z no longer needs a degree to land a high-paying job at the tech giant.",
    "fullText": "Whether it’s Nike’s Phil Knight, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, or Google’s Sergey Brin, many of the world’s most influential business founders can trace part of their success back to Stanford University. Nestled in the foothills of Silicon Valley, the school has long functioned as a launchpad for tech’s elite.\n\nBut the rise of artificial intelligence is challenging long-held assumptions about the value of higher education. As tech reshapes entry-level work and companies rethink traditional hiring pipelines, the payoff of a four-year degree—especially from elite institutions—is increasingly up for debate.\n\nStill, Brin doesn’t regret his own academic path. Speaking to Stanford engineering students last month, he said his decision to study computer science was not driven by a fixation on credentials.\n\n“I chose computer science because I had a passion for it,” he said. “It was kind of a no-brainer for me. I guess you could say I was also lucky because I was also in such a transformative field.”\n\nEven in an era when AI can write code, Brin cautioned students against chasing—or abandoning—fields of study based solely on automation fears.\n\n“I wouldn’t go off and switch to comparative literature because you think the AI is good at coding,” he said. “The AI is probably even better at comparative literature, just to be perfectly honest anyway.”\n\nBrin met Google cofounder Larry Page in 1994 during his second year of graduate studies at Stanford. Together they developed PageRank, an algorithm they later renamed Google and would become a company in 1998.\n\nGoogle’s hiring practices today reflect how dramatically the industry has shifted. The tech giant is now embracing workers without college degrees.\n\n“In as much as we’ve hired a lot of academic stars, we’ve hired tons of people who don’t have bachelor’s degrees,” Brin said. “They just figure things out on their own in some weird corner.”\n\nBetween 2017 and 2022, the share of job postings at Google requiring a degree dropped from 93% to 77%, according to analysis from the Burning Glass Institute. And Google isn’t alone: companies including Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco have reduced degree requirements in recent years, signaling a broader industry shift toward skills-based hiring.\n\nThat’s forcing a broader reckoning over what a degree actually signals and whether it’s still a reliable proxy for talent.\n\n“I don’t think necessarily because you go to an Ivy League school or have great grades it means you’re going to be a great worker or great person,” said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in 2024. For many roles, skills matter far more than credentials, he added: “If you look at skills of people, it is amazing how skilled people are in something, but it didn’t show up in their resume.”",

    "fullText": "The “more intelligent” version of Siri that Apple plans to release later this year will be backed by Google’s Gemini language models, the company announced today. CNBC reports that the deal is part of a “multi-year partnership” between Apple and Google that will allow Apple to use Google’s AI models in its own software.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” reads an Apple statement given to CNBC.\n\nToday’s announcement confirms Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reporting late last year that Apple and Google were nearing a deal. Apple didn’t disclose terms, but Gurman said that Apple would be paying Google “about $1 billion a year” for access to its AI models “following an extensive evaluation period.”\n\nBloomberg has also reported that the Gemini model would be run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers, “ensuring that user data remains walled off from Google’s infrastructure,” and that Apple still hopes to improve its own in-house language models to the point that they can eventually be used instead of relying on third-party models.\n\nAlthough Apple’s iPhones and iOS compete with Google’s Android operating system and the many smartphones that use it, the companies still cooperate in plenty of other areas. Google has paid Apple billions of dollars to remain the default search engine in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (though that deal has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years).\n\nApple’s announcement is a blow to OpenAI and the many versions of its ChatGPT model, which Apple has used elsewhere in iOS and macOS. Bloomberg reports that Apple also tested OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude models before deciding to go with Gemini. ChatGPT came out ahead of Gemini in tests that Ars ran using earlier versions of the models, but Google’s models have apparently improved enough (and amassed enough users) to worry OpenAI; CEO Sam Altman declared a “code red” last month and pushed back several planned ChatGPT features so that the company could better respond to Google’s Gemini 3 release.\n\nApple originally promised the improved, AI-powered Siri for 2024’s iOS 18 release, but ultimately delayed the feature because it didn’t work reliably enough. The new version of Siri should arrive in an update to iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 Tahoe later this year.",

In addition to being available via a stand-alone app, Gemini powers some Google search features, and it's also the default AI assistant on the company's Pixel smartphones.\n\nThomas Hudson, a VP principal analyst at the research firm Forrester, told Business Insider that the deal could \"look counterintuitive\" given Apple and Google compete in the smartphone market.\n\nHowever, he pointed to Google's long-running deal to make it the default search engine on Apple's iPhones as an example of how the pair have partnered before.

    "description": "A Google AI product manager says moving sideways and using what you already know is the best way to break into product roles.",
    "fullText": "A Google AI product manager's career advice is unexpectedly crustacean.\n\nMarily Nika, who has worked in AI product roles for over a decade, said in an episode of \"The Growth Podcast\" by Aakash Gupta published Sunday that aspiring product managers should \"be like crabs.\"\n\n\"That means that you need to move adjacent to what you've been doing,\" Nika said, adding that one's past experience is a competitive advantage.\n\nNika shared the example of a student in her AI product management boot camp who worked in the hearing aid industry and felt stuck and closed off from the tech industry. The student believed he was in a \"completely different domain\" and didn't see a clear path into product management, she said.\n\nNika encouraged him to look more closely at how his experience could translate. When they checked Apple's careers site, they found an opening for a product manager working on AirPods — a role where expertise in hearing could be relevant.\n\n\"We need to be open-minded. We really need to bring in the previous experience we have because that's gonna set us apart,\" Nika said.\n\nNika also provided another example involving a sports journalist who sought to transition into an AI product manager role in sports. Rather than being afraid of lacking a traditional product résumé, Nika advised him to lean into his domain expertise. Product skills can be learned, but a deep understanding of users and industries is harder to replace, she said.\n\nNika said becoming \"AI literate\" is now essential for product managers.\n\n\"Understand the unique intricacies that AI brings, understand how dependent we are on data,\" she said, describing how AI has become an expectation for the role.\n\nAspiring product managers should also understand \"what goes behind coding,\" like knowing what APIs are and how products are shipped.\n\nOther tech leaders and workers echo the same message.\n\nA vice president of product and growth for AI products at Dropbox told Business Insider last year that product managers should familiarize themselves with new AI tools, including vibe coding tools that enable non-coders to quickly prototype ideas.\n\nInstead of spending time writing documents, product managers can use AI tools to build lightweight prototypes to test ideas early, he said. This can help \"accelerate how they think about developing their taste, developing their craft, and understanding what makes sense in physical products,\" he added.\n\nA senior product manager at Microsoft told Business Insider in December that product managers will increasingly be expected to use AI to work faster. He said AI tools helped him draft work documents, summarize information, and generate suggestions for approaching product management problems.",

    "description": "Sergey Brin is joining his Google co-founder, Larry Page, in reducing ties to the state where they built their fortunes.",
    "fullText": "For nearly three decades, Google has been steeped in the lore of Silicon Valley.\n\nLarry Page and Sergey Brin, two Stanford University graduate students, created the search engine in 1998 and built the start-up out of a friend’s garage in Menlo Park, Calif. Over time, Google became a nearly $4 trillion juggernaut, helping to cement the Northern California region as the global epicenter of the internet industry.\n\nNow, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page are cutting some ties with the state where they made their fortunes.\n\nIn the 10 days before Christmas, an entity connected to Mr. Brin, 52, terminated or moved 15 California limited liability companies that oversee some of his business interests and investments out of the state, according to documents seen by The New York Times. Seven of the companies — including those that appear to manage one of Mr. Brin’s superyachts and his interest in a private air terminal at San Jose’s international airport — were converted into Nevada entities.\n\nMr. Brin is joining Mr. Page, 52, in reducing his California presence. More than 45 California limited liability companies associated with Mr. Page filed documents last month to either become inactive or move out of the state, according to state records. A trust with ties to Mr. Page also purchased a $71.9 million mansion in Miami’s Coconut Grove neighborhood this week, according to a deed seen by The Times.\n\nAnother entity jointly managed by Mr. Brin and Mr. Page moved out of California and to Nevada on Christmas Eve, according to a filing seen by The Times.\n\nThe Google founders’ shrinking connections to California underscore the impact of a potential ballot measure that would affect the state’s wealthiest residents. Proposed by a health care union, the measure calls for Californians worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time tax that would be equivalent of 5 percent of their assets. If the measure gains enough signatures to reach the state ballot in November and wins approval, it would retroactively apply to anyone who lived in the state as of Jan. 1 and they would have five years to pay it.\n\nThe potential wealth tax has already caused some California billionaires to establish more ties outside the state. Last month, the venture capitalist Peter Thiel announced that he opened an office for his family investment firm in Miami. David Sacks, the tech investor and White House adviser on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, unveiled a new office for his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in Austin, Texas.\n\nBut the actions of Mr. Brin and Mr. Page stand out because of their wealth — their combined net worths total more than $518 billion, as estimated by Forbes — and how closely identified they are with California. While both stepped down from day-to-day management of Google and its parent, Alphabet, in 2019, they remain on the board of the company and Mr. Brin has recently become more active in Google’s A.I. efforts.\n\nMr. Brin and Mr. Page still have connections to California, including homes across the state. It’s unclear how much time they will be spending in the state this year.\n\nA representative for Mr. Brin declined to comment. Google and representatives for Mr. Page did not respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal previously reported on Mr. Page’s Miami home purchase and Business Insider reported on some details of the shifting of Mr. Page and Mr. Brin’s companies.\n\nThe ballot initiative, which was proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system, has elicited a broad spectrum of reactions.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has called the measure bad policy, arguing that it will lead billionaires to simply move to tax-friendlier states. Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, has defended the initiative, drawing criticism from tech investors and entrepreneurs who are discussing funding a challenger to his seat.\n\nOthers have said the proposed tax could drive entrepreneurs and investors out of California, which could then stifle innovation. Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn and a Silicon Valley resident, said the measure was a “horrendous idea” that might force founders and executives to sell shares in companies that they run simply to fulfill the tax obligation.\n\n“Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue,” Mr. Hoffman posted on social media on Wednesday. Mr. Hoffman’s spokeswoman said he was not available for comment.\n\nJensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia and one of California’s wealthiest men, was among the few billionaires who publicly said they accepted the wealth tax. “We chose to live in Silicon Valley and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television this week, adding that he was “perfectly fine” with it.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesman declined to comment.\n\nIn a statement, Suzanne Jimenez, chief of staff at Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, said an exodus of billionaires from California was overblown.\n\n“The overwhelming majority of billionaires have chosen to stay in California past the Jan. 1 deadline,” she said. “Only a very small percentage left before the deadline, despite weeks of Chicken Little talking points claiming a modest tax would trigger a mass departure.”\n\nKirsten Noyes and Georgia Gee contributed research.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Guardian investigation finds AI Overviews provided inaccurate and false information when queried over blood tests\n\nGoogle has removed some of its artificial intelligence health summaries after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading information.\n\nThe company has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.\n\nBut some of the summaries, which appear at the top of search results, served up inaccurate health information, putting users at risk of harm.\n\nIn one case that experts described as “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy.\n\nTyping “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” served up masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients, the Guardian found.\n\nWhat Google’s AI Overviews said was normal may vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result, and not bother to attend follow-up healthcare meetings.\n\nAfter the investigation, the company has removed AI Overviews for the search terms “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” and “what is the normal range for liver function tests”.\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We do not comment on individual removals within Search. In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”\n\nVanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity, said: “This is excellent news, and we’re pleased to see the removal of the Google AI Overviews in these instances.\n\n“However, if the question is asked in a different way, a potentially misleading AI Overview may still be given and we remain concerned other AI‑produced health information can be inaccurate and confusing.”\n\nThe Guardian found that typing slight variations of the original queries into Google, such as “lft reference range” or “lft test reference range”, prompted AI Overviews. That was a big worry, Hebditch said.\n\n“A liver function test or LFT is a collection of different blood tests. Understanding the results and what to do next is complex and involves a lot more than comparing a set of numbers.\n\n“But the AI Overviews present a list of tests in bold, making it very easy for readers to miss that these numbers might not even be the right ones for their test.\n\n“In addition, the AI Overviews fail to warn that someone can get normal results for these tests when they have serious liver disease and need further medical care. This false reassurance could be very harmful.”\n\nGoogle, which has a 91% share of the global search engine market, said it was reviewing the new examples provided to it by the Guardian.\n\nHebditch said: “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health.”\n\nSue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, welcomed the removal of the summaries but said she still had concerns.\n\n“This is a good result but it is only the very first step in what is needed to maintain trust in Google’s health-related search results. There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information.”\n\nMillions of adults worldwide already struggle to access trusted health information, Farrington said. “That’s why it is so important that Google signposts people to robust, researched health information and offers of care from trusted health organisations.”\n\nAI Overviews still pop up for other examples the Guardian originally highlighted to Google. They include summaries of information about cancer and mental health that experts described as “completely wrong” and “really dangerous”.\n\nAsked why these AI Overviews had not also been removed, Google said they linked to well-known and reputable sources, and informed people when it was important to seek out expert advice.\n\nA spokesperson said: “Our internal team of clinicians reviewed what’s been shared with us and found that in many instances, the information was not inaccurate and was also supported by high quality websites.”\n\nVictor Tangermann, a senior editor at the technology website Futurism, said the results of the Guardian’s investigation showed Google had work to do “to ensure that its AI tool isn’t dispensing dangerous health misinformation”.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Andrew using one of the following methods.\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu.

The company constantly measures and reviews the quality of its summaries across many different categories of information, it added.\n\nIn an article for Search Engine Journal, senior writer Matt Southern said: “AI Overviews appear above ranked results. When the topic is health, errors carry more weight.”",

Ron Wyden (D-OR), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), and Ed Markey (D-MA) wrote that “X’s generation of these harmful and likely illegal depictions of women and children has shown complete disregard for your stores’ distribution terms.” X users have identified several cases where Grok undressed or sexualized apparent minors in the AI-created images.\n\nThe senators point to the app stores’ own policies for why the app should be removed. Google’s terms of service say that apps are subject to removal if they fail to bar users from “creating, uploading, or distributing content that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of children” or portray kids “in a manner that could result in the sexual exploitation of children.” Apple prohibits apps that are “offensive” or “just plain creepy.” Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether X was in compliance with their policies and whether they planned to remove the app.\n\nFailing to remove X from the app stores would both show a double standard, and undermine the companies’ arguments for their control over the app stores in the first place, the lawmakers write. Both companies removed ICEBlock and Red Dot from their stores following government pressure. The apps were used to anonymously report sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. “Unlike Grok’s sickening content generation, these apps were not creating or hosting harmful or illegal content, and yet, based entirely on the Administration’s claims that they posed a risk to immigration enforcers, you removed them from your stores,” the senators wrote.\n\nThey also warned that inaction would “undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones. This principle has been core to your advocacy against legislative reforms to increase app store competition and your defenses to claims that your app stores abuse their market power through their payment systems.”",

    "title": "4 Googlers share how they reinvented their careers and pivoted to AI",
    "description": "Each of these four Google employees took different paths to pivot into AI, but all of them spent roughly a year preparing for the transition.",
    "fullText": "Pivoting to an AI job may be trendy, but that doesn't mean it's an easy feat.\n\nAs AI-related jobs continue to pop up, and companies invest heavily in upskilling, more workers are looking to add \"AI\" to their job titles.\n\nTo see how it can be done, Business Insider spoke with four Google employees who transitioned to AI teams. While each followed a different path, all of them spent roughly a year building the necessary skills to land new roles — and for some, the transition took several years.\n\nFrom participating in employee hackathons to becoming AI content creators, the four employees share how they made the shift:\n\nEmrick Donadei said he didn't feel qualified to pivot to an AI team until he participated in Google's seven-day employee hackathon in 2024. The 32-year-old engineer said he didn't create a revolutionary product, but it gave him hands-on experience with tools, and something tangible he could use to start conversations with teams across the company. \n\nRoughly 10 months after his first hackathon, he said he landed his new role.\n\nWhile the hackathon kick-started his transition, his work didn't stop there. The Googler continued to experiment with tools outside the hackathon, he said. He also created a podcast about AI developments and watched Andrej Karpathy's YouTube videos to get up to speed with machine learning concepts and anything related to LLMs.\n\nAfter finding a new role, Donadei said that he participated in another hackathon in 2025, which opened up even more opportunities. He had the opportunity to transition into AI research, began working part-time on open-source committees and with AI research teams, and published a public technical disclosure with Google as a follow-up to his work.\n\nMaitri Mangal, 27, worked as a traditional software engineer before transitioning to an AI team. During the roughly year-long period she took to prepare for the pivot, Mangal dedicated roughly two hours daily toward up-skilling, and still spends hours learning weekly, she said.\n\nShe said that creating social media content was a way for her to reinforce the material that she learned through Google's internal training and other online courses.\n\n\"That really, for me, changed everything,\" Mangal said about content creation.\n\nShe said seeing that her content helped other people motivated her to continue learning about the technology and making videos. Even though she already changed jobs, she said she still spends about an hour daily learning new information, whether that's in the form of internal trainings for her job, or watching YouTube courses to prepare for content.\n\nRahul Kasanagottu, 32, spent two and a half years transitioning to an AI role at the tech giant. He said his paternity leave gave him a head start on reading about AI.\n\nIn addition to reading 11 books on the topic, Kasanagottu also took a Deep Learning Specialization course taught by Andrew Ng, and watched 3Blue1Brown videos on YouTube.\n\nSimilar to Donadei, Kasanagottu said solo projects were a key part of his career transition. He said it was difficult to convince hiring managers he could do the job without having demos and hands-on projects to show. While the books he read typically didn't come with assignments, the courses had a lot of hands-on exercises, Kasanagottu said.\n\nMilica Cvetkovic took a different path than the other three Googlers who made internal pivots to AI teams. She landed a role in AI consulting at the tech giant about three years ago, after completing graduate school and conducting research in machine learning.\n\nAfter she received her Master's in statistics, she worked as a machine-learning engineer at a Madison-based startup and simultaneously taught machine-learning boot camps and college-level courses.\n\n\"Having a skill to talk in a nontechnical way is probably the most valuable skill that I bring,\" Cvetkovic said.\n\nHer move to an AI team at Google was less of a deliberate pivot and more the result of the right opportunity aligning with her background and interests. She said that she realized she didn't want to code anymore, and that's when she came across a consulting role at Google.\n\nCvetkovic said she can't name one single experience that led to her getting the job. Rather, she compared her career journey to training for a marathon. A marathon, she said, is the \"celebration of all the work that you've done.\"\n\n\"That's literally what my application was. It was just very good fit,\" Cvetkovic said.\n\nDid you transition to an AI role? We want to hear from you.

    "description": "Critics warned a wealth tax in California would lead to a billionaire exodus. Florida says come on in, the water's warm.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Larry Page has quietly—or loudly—joined the billionaire exodus from California, shifting businesses east and dropping about $173 million on two ultra-luxury waterfront mansions in Miami’s Coconut Grove in a move that looks strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos’ relocation playbook. The timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look downright Bezos-ian.​\n\nIn late December and early January, The Wall Street Journal reported, Page snapped up two neighboring estates in Miami’s Coconut Grove, paying roughly $101.5 million for one waterfront compound and $71.9 million for another in an off‑market deal, for a combined outlay of about $173.4 million. One of the homes, previously listed for $135 million, spans 13 bedrooms and 15.5 bathrooms and sits directly on the water, while the second, bought from heiress Sloan Lindemann Barnett and her husband Roger Barnett, nearly doubled in value in less than five years.​\n\nThe purchases plant Page squarely inside one of Miami’s most exclusive enclaves, long favored by global elites seeking privacy, water access, and low‑key luxury. Local brokers say his splashy entry is part of a broader surge of high‑net‑worth Californians scouting Coconut Grove and other South Florida neighborhoods as they hedge against looming tax changes while upgrading to trophy waterfront properties. The real-estate purchases double as both a luxury retreat and a massive tax‑savings vehicle, with Page the most prominent of California’s ultrawealthy choosing to leave as state lawmakers are targeting fortunes like his with an aggressive wealth‑tax push.\n\nBehind the real-estate headlines, Page has been methodically severing his financial and legal ties to California ahead of a proposed wealth tax that targets residents worth more than $1 billion. Regulatory filings show he has moved his family office and several investment and holding entities out of the state, Business Insider reported, reincorporating key vehicles in Delaware and listing new business addresses in Florida.​\n\nThe New York Times previously reported Page had been telling associates he was considering Florida specifically because of a proposed ballot measure that would impose a 5% annual levy on the worldwide assets of billionaires domiciled in California. If passed and applied retroactively to residents as of Jan. 1, 2026, analysts estimate the tax could cost Page—currently ranked as the world’s second‑richest person—well over $10 billion.\n\n​​Some Silicon Valley executives, notably Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, warned such an outcome was possible, saying in late December founders would have to sell off parts of their companies to pay for “fraud, waste, and political favors for the organizations pushing this ballot initiative.” California Rep. Ro Khanna responded to the Times‘ reporting that Page and Peter Thiel were looking to leave by flagging the story on X and saying, seemingly sarcastically in the style of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, “I will miss them very much.”",

    "description": "The LLC moved as California's ultrarich weigh leaving ahead of a proposed tax on billionaires that would take effect retroactively starting January 1.",
    "fullText": "An entity tied to Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page moved out of California at the end of 2025, beating the deadline on a proposed wealth tax of the state's rich and powerful.\n\nT-Rex LLC, formed in 2006 and linked to Brin and Page, converted out of California into a Delaware LLC called T-Rex Holdings on December 24, 2025, according to a California filing reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPrior filings over the past 20 years listed Brin and Page as managers of the LLC at a Palo Alto address. In the conversion filing, T-Rex Holdings listed an address in Reno, Nevada, as its principal office, with Brin and Page both remaining managers.\n\nRepresentatives for Brin and Page didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe move comes as California's wealthiest residents are weighing whether to leave the state. A proposed ballot measure would make the roughly 200 California residents whose assets exceed $1 billion pay a one-time 5% tax. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. The measure attempts to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit.\n\nEarlier this week, Business Insider first reported that Page severed ties with California in late December by converting his family office out of the state and incorporating it in Delaware. He has also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures.\n\nIt's unclear what the entity tied to Brin and Page does. The filing describes T-Rex Holdings as a \"management company.\" Like other ultrawealthy executives, Brin and Page have used LLCs as flexible vehicles to hold assets or manage investments, often with little public disclosure. The LLC's name may be a reference to Stan, a bronze T. rex statue that presides over Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nBrin, who cofounded Google with Page in 1998, is associated with several other entities in California, including the Sergey Brin Family Foundation and Bayshore Global Management, which acts as his family office. Filings do not show any other entity associated with Brin leaving California.\n\nPage and Brin are, respectively, the second and fourth-richest people on the planet, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Each has a net worth exceeding $250 billion.\n\nAfter stepping back from executive roles in 2019, the two have taken differing paths. Brin has returned to hands-on work at Google. Page is a controlling shareholder, but has remained outside the company's daily operations.\n\nIf the proposal receives enough signatures, it will appear on the state ballot in November. If approved by voters, it will apply retroactively to the beginning of the year, meaning those who wish to avoid the tax would need to have been out of the state by the end of December 2025.\n\nCalifornia law determines residency based a variety of factors, including time spent in California and any substantial business dealings.\n\nA December 11 letter from celebrity attorney Alex Spiro to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, seen by Business Insider, urged the governor to stop the proposed tax: \"It will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Spiro wrote. \"Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax.\"",

    "title": "Google's Getting Rid of a Way to Import Third-Party Accounts Into Gmail",
    "description": "This month, Gmail is ending POP support, which can break syncing your email from third-party accounts.",
    "fullText": "If you've been running several email accounts through your Gmail, you might want to double-check your settings this month—that's because Google is ending support for the POP3 protocol that can sync emails from third-party accounts. And while there are some other solutions, they don't work quite the same.\n\nPOP3 is an older standard of syncing emails between multiple accounts that allowed users to import emails from a third-party account and manage them in one spot. It's also a less secure method of transferring emails, so it's not a total surprise that Google is phasing it out, but the company hasn't broadcast the change too loudly, so it might come as a surprise to some users.\n\nIf you're still using POP3 to fetch your emails from a third-party account, there are a couple of ways to fix it before Google pulls the plug:\n\nForward emails from your other accounts. Rather than having Gmail reach out to your third-party accounts, you can set up automatic forwarding on the other end. How to do this will depend on which email providers you use, so check your third-party account settings for forwarding options.\n\nUse IMAP to check your email from the Gmail apps. In the Gmail app for Android and iOS, you can log into third-party email accounts that support IMAP connections.\n\nThe IMAP protocol works a bit differently than POP3. While POP3 would import messages into your Gmail but leave the original, IMAP syncs between your accounts. So if you use the Gmail app to check your email and delete some messages, they'll be gone if you check the original account later.\n\nGoogle's support doc says this change will take effect \"Starting January 2026\" with no more specific time frame. At time of writing, POP3 support is still working on my own email accounts, so it's not disabled just yet, but it's a good idea to update your email setup sooner rather than later.",

    "fullText": "Google and chatbot-building startup Character.AI have agreed to settle multiple lawsuits from families whose teenagers died by suicide or hurt themselves after interacting with Character.AI's chatbots.\n\nThese negotiations are among the first settlements in lawsuits that accuse AI tools of contributing to mental health crises and suicides among teenagers.\n\nOpenAI is facing a nearly identical lawsuit over the death of a 16-year-old, while Meta has come under scrutiny for letting its AI have provocative conversations with minors. As these companies race to develop and monetize their AI chatbots, they're spending big to make large language models sound more friendly and helpful, and ultimately keep users coming back.\n\nIn October 2024, Florida-based Megan Garcia filed a lawsuit against Character.AI, alleging that the company, which lets people have in-depth and personal conversations with AI chatbots, was responsible for the death of her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III. He had died by suicide months earlier.\n\nA Wednesday court filing in the Garcia case said that an agreement was reached with Character.AI, its founders, Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, and Google. In 2024, the search giant hired the founders of Character.AI, who were former Google employees, and paid for non-exclusive rights to use the startup's technology. The startup remains a separate legal entity.\n\nThe terms of the settlements were not immediately available\n\nThe defendants have also settled four other similar cases in New York, Colorado, and Texas, according to court documents from this week.\n\nMatthew Bergman, the legal representative of the families, along with Google and Character.AI, did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nGarcia's suit said that the startup failed to implement safety guardrails to prevent her son from developing an inappropriate and intimate relationship with its chatbots. The suit claimed that he was sexually solicited and abused by the technology, and the chatbot did not respond adequately when Setzer began talking about self-harm.\n\n\"When an adult does it, the mental and emotional harm exists. When a chatbot does it, the same mental and emotional harm exists,\" Garcia told Business Insider in an interview last year. \"So who's responsible for something that we've criminalized human beings doing to other human beings?\"",

    "title": "Google Play Protect is now the custom DPC gatekeeper, and everyone is a threat",
    "description": "This is a significant shift in how Android Enterprise operates, and the quiet nature of the rollout is arguably as damaging as the way it is being executed.",
    "fullText": "For anyone landing here after searching for answers as to why you're seeing unsettling Play Protect warnings for safe, compliant apps, read this help article and submit an appeal.\n\nGoogle has a habit of dropping significant changes into unassuming help centre articles, and the subject of this article regarding Device Policy Controller (DPC) allowlisting is no exception.\n\nThe changes, which went live earlier this year, involve a new \"Approved Android Enterprise device policy controllers allowlist.\" It’s a dry title for what is essentially a mandatory \"permission to operate\" for any EMM or custom solution developer in the Android space.\n\nWhile it might look like a routine security tweak on the surface, this move introduces a fundamental layer of gatekeeping to Android Enterprise that has far-reaching consequences for the wider ecosystem, consequences Google appears either to have overlooked or simply decided aren't their problem.\n\nThe premise is simple: Only DPCs verified and approved by Android Enterprise are now permitted during the Android Enterprise provisioning process. If your DPC isn't on the list, the enrolment can fail with a rather ominous message: \"Harmful app blocked\".\n\nOn the surface, Google’s justification appears to be the typical \"security and privacy\" refrain. A DPC holds considerable power over an end-user device and could result in some rather unsavoury predicaments if a user could be convinced to factory reset their device, initiate provisioning, and enrol into a potential attacker's solution... But as is often the case with these top-down mandates, the \"security\" label is being used to justify a level of centralised control that feels increasingly stifling for the ecosystem.\n\nWhat this results in is perhaps the most significant change to how a DPC operates since the introduction of Android Enterprise, in Android Lollipop (5.0).\n\nTo understand the gravity of this, we first have to look at what a DPC actually is.\n\nIn the Android management world, the DPC is the \"agent\" application, the Device Owner that holds the keys to the kingdom. It can communicate with a backend - typically but not always an EMM server - and may enforce policies like Wi-Fi settings, app restrictions, and password requirements directly on the OS.\n\nAt least, in the enterprise ecosystem. More broadly the community has leveraged custom DPCs for turning their applications into native Android kiosks, building community/open source management platforms, expanding solutions out to use cases like parental control, device leasing, and more. Consider Acurast, which uses Device Owner (DO) to put a device into a pool of worldwide resources developers can use for their decentralised computing needs, Xibo which is a DO-supported media client, or FreeKiosk which does what it says on the tin.. amongst many others.\n\nDPCs are used for all sorts of functionality for all sorts of use cases. They can also run entirely locally through hard-coded restrictions/functionality in cases where the whole use case is to showcase the app utilising DPC functionality itself. Historically, Google didn't care whose DPC you used, nor what it did, provided it called the right APIs and didn't outright abuse either the user or the OS. This allowed for a flourishing ecosystem of solutions built upon custom DPCs.\n\nIn parallel to this more recently (well, 2019), Google introduced the Android Management API. This native-feel implementation of a consistent and centralised management platform has been the default and only option for enterprise vendors to build their enterprise management solutions for the last few years, following the deprecation of the Play EMM API. Custom DPCs haven't gone away, though without the Play EMM API there's no app or account management available. This has to go through AMAPI. If you're an enterprise EMM vendor, Play access is a cornerstone of your solution.\n\nAMAPI in turn has become more and more restrictive on who uses it and how; their permissible usage page has grown more complex and limited as time has progressed, most recently completely blocking new vendors from even touching the API without Google's approval of a vendor's business case, and then limiting the number of devices permitted to enrol without continued and repetitive applications for increased quotas. It's becoming quite a restrictive, overly-moderated experience.\n\nAs Google tightens the screws on AMAPI access, the custom DPC route has become a more appealing option. I can speak to several vendors I've worked with previously denied access to AMAPI who have turned to custom DPC, for example. For many use cases access to Google Play for app/account management isn't all that critical and achieves the goals in mind. Google's approval framework might suggest if a vendor can't get approval for AMAPI, they must automatically be doing something untoward, but given the permissible uses are limited and target some of the most popular use cases for restricted access - financing, device as a service (DaaS), and in-house solutions - that suggestion would be plainly wrong.\n\nIn any case, the move to start restricting custom DPCs could have been anticipated, though I'm not sure many (including me) did so. While I agree policing of the custom DPC market is beneficial (I'm sure some fall for the mandate to wipe and enrol their devices into a malicious solution, I've seen worse), the way Google has gone about it leaves a terrible taste in my mouth.\n\nI want to be clear I am in favour of keeping the ecosystem safe. It's what I spend most of my days doing through the very DPCs in question (amongst other things). I'm also not just grumpy about this because it's change; I wrote of my support for developer verification just a few months ago.\n\nOn the face of it, the restrictions aren't unreasonable. Frustrating though they may be in limiting choice and freedom for projects and organisations taking advantage of the Android Enterprise framework, what Google has put in place is fine - it's even slightly less restrictive than the requirements for AMAPI as there's no explicit restriction on in-house solutions. I also can't argue the dev guidance and mobile unwanted software policies for some of the causes of being flagged outside of the allowlist, as it makes perfect sense - SMS, notifications, and accessibility permissions should absolutely be challenged given their sensitive nature, and a DPC should never be anything other than fully transparent with its capabilities and behaviours.\n\nThere are two very distinct issues I take with how this allowlist has come about, however.\n\nIn the aforementioned developer verification announcements, Google provides a year for developers to get on board. There are multiple approaches to verification offered, and generally speaking even those slowest to adapt to change have a justifiable amount of time to figure things out. It's not dissimilar to Play EMM API being deprecated, that's been going on for a few years now with vendors still tip-toeing over to AMAPI. There was an iFrame approval change that was deprecated in 2021, and in 2023 I was still writing about it. Let's not even touch on Device Administrator deprecation..\n\nGoogle made the change earlier this year and no one outside of existing partners would have known until their DPCs were being actively blocked, something demonstrated in the customer community multiple times:\n\nThis lack of communication feels tone-deaf. It ignores the reality of countless developers who have built livelihoods on the open nature of Android, only to be thrown face-first into an arbitrary wall.\n\nGoogle Play Protect was introduced as the world’s most widely deployed mobile threat protection service. Its job is to find malware, identify potentially harmful applications (PHAs), and keep users safe from real threats, but here Google is using Play Protect as the gatekeeper, and by folding the \"Approved DPC\" list into Play Protect’s enforcement engine, Google has turned a tool designed for protection into a weapon of enforcement of Google's will.\n\nThere's obviously a distinction between GPP flagging on sensitive permissions, which is valid and I take no issue with, versus GPP running off an arbitrary list of package names a team within Google has to maintain. The latter is mind-boggling to me.\n\nThe weaponisation of a tool many in the ecosystem have applauded as a beacon of Android security means when a user or an IT admin attempts to enrol a device using a DPC that isn't on Google's allowlist, Play Protect intervenes.\n\nIt doesn't say, \"This vendor hasn't completed their paperwork.\", it displays some of the scariest warnings in the Android lexicon.\n\nThis is a massive erosion of trust. If \"unsafe\" just means \"not a Google approved application,\" my prediction is we will eventually see the messaging for Play Protect soften, lowering the likelihood of taking actual malware warnings seriously. It all starts with an \"oh ignore the warning, just continue\", and authority is lost. Google is crying wolf to protect its ecosystem boundaries, and in doing so, they are devaluing the very security tool they claim is vital for the platform's health.\n\nWith this allowlist, the days of building a custom DPC for anything but what Google considers a justifiable use case are heading towards a reality where this may not be possible. Whether you’re a developer building an open-source management tool, or a company with a bespoke internal DPC for a fleet of industrial devices, you now have to go through an opaque verification process that is down to the interpretation of the human undertaking the approval at the time. If you're building anything else, that human may just not put the package name on the list.\n\nAgain, I'm not against protection for users in the ecosystem. I find it, however, baffling with all the signals Play Protect gets from a device, with all of the ecosystem data Google consumes across billions of Android devices, all of the pattern recognition, user feedback, all of this noise Google has chosen to forego every ounce of technology they use powering Android's industry-leading security.. for a list. Implemented with little to no consideration for the ramifications to businesses and communities.\n\nThe answer is to get verified, because this new reality treats every custom DPC as hostile until you prove otherwise.\n\nIf you're going to navigate it, here are the hoops; steps that shouldn't be unnecessary if Play Protect judged behaviour instead of defaulting to the ban-hammer:\n\nIf you’re blocked mid-provisioning, tell admins and users plainly that the warning is about allowlisting, not malware, and point out the option for them to continue the install if present in the Play Protect warning.\n\nStandardisation is a good thing. I’ve spent years advocating for the Android Management API (AMAPI) and a more consistent experience across OEMs. But standardisation should not be achieved like this.\n\nGoogle needs to decouple technical safety from verification. If an app isn't verified, the OS should tell the user that. It should say: \"This management tool is from an unverified/unknown/unapproved developer. Proceed with caution.\" It should not say: \"This app is trying to bypass security.\" By using the PHA stick to enforce partner rules, Google is signalling that the wider community - the tinkerers, the niche hardware vendors, and the independent developers - are no longer a priority. It’s a move that lacks empathy for the diverse ways Android is used across the world.\n\nThe ship has sailed to put a pause on this now, but it's not too late to put out visible announcements, talk about the security, justify the change, adjust the messaging - everything that was done with developer verification should be done here, too.\n\nTo the developers and vendors struggling with this: My advice is to document everything: Any failed appeal, any poor user experience, and any customer you lose because of a misleading warning. Submit it to the customer community and make sure you're seen and heard. We've made incredible changes through the community over the last few years. Feedback matters.",

    "description": "ChatGPT's web traffic has decreased since November, when Google launched Gemini 3. ChatGPT still has the lead, but it could signal shifting tides.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI's recent \"code red\" over Gemini makes a lot of sense when you look at the data.\n\nWhile the ChatGPT maker continues to dominate the AI race, competitors are gaining ground. In November, Google released Gemini 3 Pro, the first iteration of its Gemini 3 class of models.\n\nSince then, Gemini web traffic has increased while ChatGPT web traffic declined, according to Similarweb data first highlighted by Menlo Ventures partner Deedy Das.\n\nIn December, Gemini traffic increased by 28.4% month-over-month, while ChatGPT traffic decreased by 5.6%, the data shows.\n\nThe chart's data only tells part of the story, only accounting for site visits to chatgpt.com and gemini.google.com. It does not factor in use of the consumer apps or other integrations, like Google's AI overviews in Google Search.\n\nAnd while there's no guarantee that one traffic trend is directly because of the other, the data highlights the shifting tides of the AI race.\n\nWeb traffic for both ChatGPT and Gemini are up year-over-year, but their estimated site traffic growth rates are staggeringly different. ChatGPT traffic is up 49.5%; Gemini's traffic is up 563.6%, per Similarweb.\n\nChatGPT still has a healthy lead. In December, ChatGPT attracted 5.5 billion visitors, according to Similarweb. Gemini came in second with 1.7 billion; DeepSeek, Grok, Character.AI, Perplexity, and Claude all trailed behind with fewer than 400 million visitors each.\n\nAfter its launch, Gemini 3 was lauded as a potentially market-leading model. It was more visual and creative than previous iterations, and was better at coding.\n\nGoogle has also flexed its primary advantage over OpenAI: the ability to integrate its AI within its highly used search products. Basically everyone uses Google — OpenAI must convince people to turn to ChatGPT instead of the search giant's products.\n\nOpenAI and Google are also competing in the image generation market. Less than a month after Google released its Nano Banana Pro AI image model, OpenAI announced the launch of ChatGPT Images.\n\nGemini 3 famously triggered a \"code red\" at OpenAI. In an internal Slack message, CEO Sam Altman reportedly told staff that OpenAI would prioritize ChatGPT while pushing back other product plans.\n\nIn December, Altman said on the \"Big Technology\" podcast that the company would not be in emergency status \"that much longer,\" and that \"code red\" periods normally last six to eight weeks.\n\nAltman also said that Gemini 3 did not have \"the impact we were worried it might.\"\n\n\"But it did — in the same way that DeepSeek did — identify some weaknesses in our product offering strategy, and we're addressing those very quickly,\" he added.",

    "title": "A Facebook veteran took a big career risk that resulted in a 'giant failure' — but embracing a 'J-curve' career path paid off",
    "description": "Molly Graham, former Facebook and Google executive, shares how a risky career move and embracing a J-shaped career path grew her expertise.",
    "fullText": "At 25 years old, Molly Graham was thriving in Facebook's HR department when a senior executive urged her to transfer out of her stable role and help build a mobile phone instead.\n\nShe took the risk — and it could have derailed her career.\n\nBut Graham, who later became a C-suite executive at some of America's biggest companies and philanthropies, now views that risky bet as one of the most important moves she ever made.\n\n\"It just felt like falling off a cliff,\" Graham, now the founder of Glue Club, said in a recent interview on Lenny Rachitsky's podcast. \"Taking risks, accepting the terrible fall and that experience of falling has been more than worth it.\"\n\nGraham described the experience as part of what she calls the \"J-curve\" — a career trajectory where a risky move leads to an initial drop before eventually producing outsized gains. Visually, she describes it as standing on a ledge, stepping off, sinking briefly, and then rising far higher than where you started — just like the shape of the letter J.\n\nThe concept, which she has also written about in her Lessons Substack, challenges the idea of a steady career ladder that steadily moves up and to the right.\n\nInstead of climbing rung by rung with promotions every two to five years, Graham argues that some of the most valuable professional growth comes from jumping into roles you aren't ready for and surviving any setbacks.\n\nGraham's own J-curve began when billionaire investor and \"All-in\" podcast host Chamath Palihapitiya, then Facebook's vice president of growth, recruited her to help develop a smartphone, encouraging her to make the move by sketching out the J-shaped trajectory on a whiteboard.\n\nHe brought her on despite her having no experience in product development, dropping her into rooms filled with engineers and phone specialists with deep subject matter expertise. She recalled feeling like an \"idiot\" for much of her first six months.\n\nAt her midyear review, Palihapitiya delivered what Graham called the worst performance evaluation she had ever received. But the new experience eventually expanded her expertise.\n\n\"Slowly, I remember I had been doing all these trips to Taiwan because we were actually working on hardware and I, at some point, came back from Taiwan and I like drew on a whiteboard for him the layout of a mobile phone, trying to explain to him kind of like why something he wanted to do was not possible,\" Graham said. \"And I so vividly remember walking out of that meeting being like, 'Oh like I actually know things.' And slowly then over the following three years I became an expert in mobile.\"\n\nPalihapitiya did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\n\"The phone itself was a giant failure — a massive, costly failure for Facebook,\" Graham told Rachitsky on the podcast. \"But it was not a failure for me.\"\n\nShe credits the experience with teaching her that she could operate far outside her comfort zone — a lesson that later helped her take on senior leadership roles, including serving as COO of Quip, which Salesforce acquired for $750 million, and overseeing operations at the $7.4 billion Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\n\nThe J-curve, Graham said, is especially common at fast-moving companies like Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, and SpaceX, where leaders value employees who are willing to take big risks early and learn quickly. In those environments, proving adaptability can matter more than checking every qualification box.\n\nNot everyone supported Graham's decision at the time. She said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, then the number two at the tech giant, advised against the move — as did her father.\n\n\"When wiser, more experienced people questioned the job offer, it definitely made me pause,\" Graham told Business Insider in a follow-up email. \"But my gut felt really strongly that I needed to take the risk.\"\n\nThat instinct, she said, ultimately helped her discover what kind of work she didn't want to do, and where her strengths lay. She didn't want to sift through mock ups of hardware design and argue about a button's placement. Instead, she sharpened her management skills and prepared to help lead large organizations.\n\n\"The much more fun careers are like jumping off cliffs,\" Graham told Rachitsky. \"They can take you to places that you never could have imagined.\"",

    "description": "The Google cofounder has severed ties between California and several of his business entities, including his family office.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Larry Page is peacing out of California.\n\nThe Google cofounder has cut ties between California and many of his assets that risked exposing him to a proposed new wealth tax in the state, meeting an end-of-2025 deadline, according to filings reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPage's family office, Koop, was converted out of California in late December and incorporated in Delaware, per filings with both states. Page converted several other entities to Delaware, including Flu Lab LLC — a vehicle he has used to fund research on tackling influenza and lists its principal office address in Nevada — and another entity named One Aero, which has funded his flying car ventures and lists its principal office address in Florida.\n\nA filing was also made to convert Dynatomics, LLC from California to Delaware with a new principal address in Keller, Texas. Page launched Dynatomics, a new startup focused on applying AI to aircraft manufacturing, in 2023, Business Insider previously reported. A source close to Page said that the team, run by Chris Anderson, continues to work out of California.\n\nAnderson and representatives for Page's family office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe New York Times reported in December that Page had told people he was considering moving to Florida because of a proposed ballot measure that would tax the state's wealthiest residents. The proposal, if passed successfully, would mean that any California resident worth more than $1 billion would be taxed 5% of their assets.\n\nUnder California law, residency is determined by the nature of a person's ties to the state, with factors such as the time spent in the state and the maintenance of substantial business ties taken into account. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nA source close to Page said the Google cofounder had already left the state. Whether Page's move is temporary could not be learned.\n\nPage is ranked the second-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nBesides his family office and funding vehicles, Page converted out an LLC that Business Insider previously identified as being used to purchase islands in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, from California to Delaware, with a new address listed in Florida.\n\nA separate LLC Page used to purchase an Island in Fiji was also converted out to Delaware.\n\nPage's wife, the scientist Lucinda Southworth, founded a marine-conservation charity named Oceankind. Filings show that Oceankind converted out of California to Delaware in December.\n\nDelaware has become a popular state for businesses to incorporate due to its favorable tax structure, privacy, and its home to a court system specifically designed to handle corporate disputes. The state does not require LLCs to disclose the names and addresses of directors when incorporating, providing them with an extra layer of privacy.\n\nPrivacy is especially important to Page, whose family office is shrouded in a level of secrecy unparalleled by most and carefully managed by its CEO, Wayne Osborne.\n\nCristina Rosado, an attorney who handles many of Page and Southworth's assets, signed several of the California filings.\n\nPage incorporated three entities in Florida last year, as previously reported by The New York Times. A Koop LLC was incorporated in Florida in January 2025, per filings reviewed by Business Insider. It could not be confirmed if it belongs to Page.\n\nThe California billionaire tax proposal faced some opposition from leaders in venture capital and politics. In a post on X in December, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said the proposed measure would mean California would lose its most important taxpayers and \"net off much worse.\"\n\n\"Long term damage unless legislature bans wealth taxes,\" he added. \"Easier to equalize taxes on work income and capital gains at the national level.\n\nMatt Mahan, Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, on Monday described the tax as \"a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy.\"\n\nWhite House AI czar David Sacks has criticized the proposal and said it will backfire. He has also said he believes Miami and Austin will overtake New York and San Francisco for finance and tech, respectively. He announced this month that his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, had opened an office in Austin.\n\nLast month, celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro wrote a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, warning that the proposed billionaire tax would \"trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave something to share?

    "title": "Jaana Dogan reveals how AI built in 1 hour what took a year",
    "description": "How Google engineer Jaana Dogan discovered an AI tool that recreated a year-long engineering effort in one hour—what it means for developers and AI’s future.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence rarely shocks senior engineers anymore. Most professionals in big tech expect rapid progress. Yet, in early 2026, a candid revelation by Jaana Dogan, a principal engineer at Google, managed to do exactly that. Her experience with an AI coding tool ignited a global conversation about software development, productivity, and the real role of human engineers in an AI-assisted future.\n\nThis was not marketing hype. It came from someone deeply involved in building large-scale AI systems. That authenticity is why her story resonated across the tech world.\n\nJaana Dogan is a Principal Engineer at Google, associated with work on advanced AI systems, including Google’s Gemini ecosystem. Engineers at this level typically focus on system architecture, long-term design decisions, and complex coordination between multiple components rather than routine coding.\n\nShe is not a celebrity technologist or influencer. Instead, she represents a growing group of highly experienced engineers who speak openly about how AI tools are reshaping their daily work. That credibility matters, especially when discussing sensitive topics like productivity gains and automation.\n\nThe moment that brought Jaana Dogan into the spotlight involved a hands-on experiment with Claude Code, an AI coding tool developed by Anthropic. Out of curiosity, she tested whether the tool could understand and recreate a complex system her team had already built at Google.\n\nAccording to Dogan, after providing a clear description of the problem, the AI generated a functional version of a distributed agent orchestrator in roughly one hour. Her team had spent close to a year designing and building a similar system internally.\n\nThis account was first reported by The Indian Express, which quoted Dogan’s own public remarks and reactions from the wider tech community.\n\nTo understand why this mattered, some context helps.\n\nA distributed agent orchestrator is not a simple script. It coordinates multiple autonomous agents, manages communication between them, and ensures tasks execute in the correct order. These systems often involve:\n\nIn large organizations like Google, building such systems involves months of design reviews, testing, and refinements. That’s why the speed of the AI-generated result raised eyebrows.\n\nThe AI output was not production-ready software. Dogan herself made that clear. The generated code still required validation, security reviews, performance testing, and human judgment. However, the structure and logic closely resembled what her team had arrived at after extensive discussions.\n\nThink of it like this: the AI produced a strong architectural draft, not a finished skyscraper.\n\nThis distinction is crucial for maintaining factual accuracy and avoiding exaggerated claims.\n\nThis was not a startup demo or marketing blog post. The observation came from a senior Google engineer with direct experience in large-scale AI systems.\n\nDogan openly acknowledged limitations instead of claiming AI superiority. That balance increased trust in her assessment.\n\nIf AI tools can reduce early-stage development time from months to hours, workflows will change. That affects cost planning, timelines, and team structures.\n\nCoverage from The Economic Times and Times of India further highlighted how divisive this moment was for software engineers globally.\nSources:\n– Economic Times (Technology Updates)\n– Times of India (Tech News)\n\nLong answer: The role is evolving.\n\nAI tools excel at pattern recognition and rapid synthesis. They struggle with context, accountability, and responsibility. Human engineers still:\n\nDecide whether an approach fits real-world constraints\n\nHandle edge cases that AI cannot predict\n\nEnsure compliance with legal and ethical standards\n\nMaintain systems over long timeframes\n\nDogan herself encouraged developers to test AI tools in domains they understand deeply. That advice reflects confidence, not fear.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of this story is Dogan’s openness about a competitor’s product. Historically, engineers at major tech firms avoid praising rival tools publicly.\n\nHer response suggests a cultural shift. Many professionals now view AI advancement as a shared ecosystem rather than a zero-sum competition. Progress by one company often pushes the entire field forward.\n\nThat mindset aligns with broader industry trends toward open research, shared benchmarks, and collaborative safety discussions.\n\nTeams can explore ideas quickly without committing months up front.\n\nEngineers may spend less time on boilerplate code and more time on design, review, and decision-making.\n\nPrompt design, system evaluation, and AI oversight will become core technical skills.\n\nThese conclusions align with discussions already happening in academic research and enterprise software planning.\n\nThis story gained traction not because it was sensational, but because it felt honest. It showed excitement, concern, and realism at the same time.\n\nDogan didn’t claim AI had “won.” She highlighted how powerful tools can reshape workflows when used thoughtfully. That balanced perspective is exactly what Google’s E-E-A-T framework values: experience, expertise, authority, and trust.\n\nJaana Dogan did not set out to start a global debate. She simply shared an authentic professional observation. Yet that moment revealed something important: AI tools are no longer just assistants. They are becoming collaborators.\n\nThe future of software development will not be purely human or purely automated. It will sit somewhere in between. Engineers like Jaana Dogan help the industry understand that future clearly, without hype or fear.\n\nAnd that clarity, more than speed or novelty, is what truly matters.\n\nThe Indian Express – Global Technology Coverage\n\nThe Economic Times – AI & Software Industry News\n\nJaana Dogan is a Principal Engineer at Google who works on advanced artificial intelligence systems,\n\nincluding projects related to Google’s Gemini AI ecosystem. She is known for sharing real-world\n\ninsights on how AI tools impact modern software development.\n\nJaana Dogan’s AI experiment went viral because she revealed that an AI coding tool recreated a system\n\nsimilar to her team’s year-long engineering work in about one hour, sparking debate about AI’s role\n\nin software development.\n\nNo, AI did not replace human engineers in Jaana Dogan’s experiment. The AI-generated code acted as a\n\nprototype and still required human expertise for validation, testing, optimization, and long-term\n\nsystem responsibility.\n\nA distributed agent orchestrator is a software system that coordinates multiple autonomous agents,\n\nmanages communication between them, and ensures tasks execute reliably across distributed computing\n\nenvironments.\n\nJaana Dogan’s experience shows that AI can dramatically speed up early-stage development and\n\nprototyping, while human engineers remain essential for system design, ethical decisions, quality\n\ncontrol, and long-term maintenance.",

    "description": "Maddy Zhang spent over four years at Google. She shared five tips for getting into Big Tech, from referrals to technical interviews.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech can seem impenetrable. This Google alum has some tips for getting your foot in the door.\n\nMaddy Zhang spent over four years working as a software engineer for Google, touching both the search and advertising businesses. She now works at Airbnb, per her LinkedIn, and previously held internships at Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft.\n\nOn the \"A Life Engineered\" podcast, Zhang shared five tips for landing a job at Google or one of its competitors.\n\nFirst, she recommended applying to jobs early — as in, within hours of the openings being posted.\n\n\"Because there's so much competition, it's honestly an employer's market,\" Zhang said. \"If you wait a day, probably there's going to be hundreds of applicants for it.\"\n\nWhile the recruiter is supposed to look at all of the applications, they'll likely look at the first batch and ignore the rest, she said.\n\nApplying quickly can help you land a job, LinkedIn data shows. Responding quickly helps too: US job seekers who reply to a prospective employer's message within 24 hours are 4.1 times as likely to get hired and 6.7 times as likely to get an interview, according to Indeed.\n\nNext, she advised getting referred by a current employee. Zhang's friends who have applied with referrals had a higher success rate, she said. But that doesn't mean ask anyone on LinkedIn to support you.\n\n\"If you don't actually have a connection with them, it's not going to help,\" she said.\n\nWhile a good résumé or referral might get you through the recruiter's initial pass, applicants must then pass a technical interview. Many engineers prepare using LeetCode — a tool Zhang said was still valuable.\n\n\"I know no one really likes it,\" she said. \"It's a necessary evil.\"\n\nZhang recommended doing a mix of easy, medium, and hard LeetCode problems. When you get stuck, she advised not just looking at the answer, but retyping and running the solution.\n\nIt's easy to think that Google is filled to the brim with Stanford graduates. That wasn't Zhang's experience, though. Her next piece of advice: Don't underestimate yourself based on your school.\n\nMost of Zhang's friends didn't go to \"good computer science schools,\" she said. Many attended state schools or community colleges before transferring.\n\n\"As you progress forward in your career, your school matters less and less,\" she said.\n\nEven with the best application, interview prep, and referrals, there's no guarantee of a job. That's Zhang's final piece of advice: remember it's a numbers game.\n\nZhang said that she had been rejected hundreds of times. When she was younger, those rejections made her want to give up on the industry. She's since learned that it's not personal.\n\n\"Maybe I had a bad day, maybe the interviewer had more qualified candidates, maybe there's something I couldn't control,\" Zhang said.\n\n\"Rejection is nothing on who you are as a software engineer.\"",

    "fullText": "Fraudsters use phishing to steal card details, which fund a spending spree using Apple Pay or Google Pay\n\nYou get a call from your bank and the informed voice asks to you to confirm the personal details they have on file, which you do. You are then asked whether you bought something at an electrical retailer recently for £120 and spent £235 in Birmingham, but neither transaction rings true.\n\nThe caller tells you they have blocked the payments but they must now secure your account, and say they will send you a notification to approve, or a code to pass on to them. You feel under pressure to protect your money, so you do what is asked.\n\nUnfortunately, the person at the other end of the phone is not your bank but a criminal, and they have added your payment card to a digital wallet on one of their many smartphones. At some stage, your account will be emptied by purchases of expensive phones or designer clothes, which will then be sold on.\n\nBanks have seen an increase in the number of attempts to exploit victims using the elaborate digital wallet fraud and have introduced new security measures to counter the threat.\n\nDanai Antoniou, the chief scientist at Gradient Labs, a financial services AI company, says the approach from criminals can appear harmless as the victim is not being asked to move money.\n\n“This is why most people don’t question it. If the notification says ‘never share this with anyone’ (or similar), they will pre-emptively mention it to the customer that this is a routine comment that comes with every notification – which is true, customers do become immune to warnings if they get warnings frequently,” she says.\n\n“Victims often describe feeling panicked and pressured during the call, being told their account is under attack, or that their money is at risk. In that heightened emotional state, approving a notification feels like the responsible thing to do. The victim believes they’re protecting their account, when, in reality, they’re handing over the keys.”\n\nSantander says that digital wallet fraud was the second biggest reason for card scam losses last year, while HSBC has reported an increase over the past 18 months.\n\nUK Finance, the banking trade body, says that the number of attempts has surged, in part because security systems have prevented criminals being successful, forcing them to make more attacks.\n\nThe fraud can start with phishing where the victim provides personal and bank details after a text message that promises, for example, a winter fuel allowance payment, or an offer for cheap products on social media.\n\nAfter a few weeks, enough time for the victim to forget about supplying details, the fraudster will contact them, claiming to be from their bank. They will know which bank because of the details already supplied by the victim.\n\nThey may ask the victim to confirm the address, or postcode, they have on file, in order to portray legitimacy. The criminal will then ask about some transactions, all fabricated, and when the victim says they don’t recognise them, the criminal will claim they have been stopped, and more measures must be taken to secure the account. They will say that a notification is on the way, and the victim should approve it to secure the account.\n\n“The notification the customer receives is entirely legitimate, as it’s the genuine notification your bank sends when a new Apple Pay or Google Pay card is being added to a device, or the bank may send you a code via text, or in the app. They have just added your card into their Apple Pay or Google Pay and you are now receiving a text, or a notification, to approve it,” Antoniou says.\n\nFrom there, the criminals can act quickly and empty the account of the victim. “They drain accounts at high-value merchants, such as tech stores and fashion retailers. The appeal is simple: electronics and designer goods can be quickly resold on the secondary market with minimal loss of profit during the money-laundering process,” she adds.\n\nBanks don’t need your help to protect your account: they have systems in place to freeze and block accounts if needed. “Never trust anyone who calls you from your bank unless you arranged that phone call in advance. If somebody calls, tell them you will call the bank back yourself,” Antoniou says. And don’t use a number they give you: search on the web for the bank’s phone number, or use the one on the back of your physical debit or credit card.\n\nNationwide warns people to be aware of what any one-time passcodes they receive are being used for.\n\nHSBC says it has put in new security measures to counter the threat of wallet fraud and more would be coming this year. “We are regularly reminding customers not to give out their details, such as one-time passcodes, and to treat them as carefully as you would your pin,” it adds.\n\nUK Finance says: “Set up bank alerts in your app, and check your transactions regularly so you know about any suspicious transactions as soon as possible.\n\n“If you think you’ve fallen for a scam it’s important to contact your bank immediately and report it to Report Fraud.”\n\nApple says it is not responsible for approving a card for inclusion in the wallet, but that it gives banks information that they can use to combat fraud.\n\nGoogle did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "The Google Search Appliance (GSA) is a discontinued series of rack-mounted servers with search engine indexing software.\n\nThe GSA operating system was based on CentOS. The software was produced by Google and the hardware was manufactured by Dell. The final 2009 GSA version was based on Dell's PowerEdge R710. Google announced the phase out of the GSA in early 2016 and a complete discontinuation by 2019.\n\nThe GSA was supplied in two models: a 2U model (GB-7007) capable of indexing up to 10 million documents, and a 5U (2U plus 3U storage) model (GB-9009) that was capable of indexing up to 30 million documents. Sales were operated on a licensing scheme which started as a two-year contract for maintenance, support and software updates.\n\nThe GSA contained Google search technologies and a means of configuring and customizing the appliance.\n\nThe GSA was first introduced in 2002.\n\nSoftware version 6.0 was released in June, 2009. This software ran on some hardware versions of the GB-1001 model (all units with an \"S5\" prefix in their \"Appliance ID\"), and all GB-7007 and GB-9009 models.\n\nGoogle released version 7.0 on October 9, 2012 and version 7.2 on February 11, 2014.\n\nThe GSA could be purchased in two separate versions based on the number of documents being indexed. Model G100, a 2U appliance, could index up to 20,000,000 documents. The G500 5U appliance[1] could index up to 100,000,000 documents.\n\nGoogle sold a 2U appliance (GB-1001) capable of indexing up to 5 million documents, a half-rack cluster (GB-5005) of five 2U nodes capable of indexing up to 10 million documents, and a full-rack cluster (GB-8008) of eight―and later 12 nodes―capable of indexing up to 30 million documents. Some models were based on Dell PowerEdge 2950 2U rack mounted servers.\n\nThe Google \"Blue\" Mini was a smaller and lower-cost search solution that occupied 1U of rack space for small and medium-sized businesses to set up an Internet search engine that allowed them to index and search up to 300,000 documents. The hardware was manufactured by Gigabyte Technology then Super Micro Computer, Inc.[2] Manufacture and sale of the Google Mini were discontinued beginning in July 31, 2012.\n\nFor a brief period in 2008, Google offered a virtual version of the GSA aimed at developers. The virtual edition could be downloaded free of charge and index up to 50,000 documents. It was discontinued for unknown reasons.\n\nEarly in February 2016, Google sent a confidential letter[3] to its business partners and customers, stating that the GSA would not be available past 2018. It began with the discontinuation of GSA three-year contracts in 2016; in 2017 there would be only one-year renewal contracts and no hardware sales, followed by a complete shutdown in 2018.[4] Customers were expected to migrate to a cloud-based solution.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Inaccurate information presented in summaries, Guardian investigation finds\n\nPeople are being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google’s artificial intelligence summaries, a Guardian investigation has found.\n\nThe company has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.\n\nBut some of the summaries, which appear at the top of search results, served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm.\n\nIn one case that experts described as “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.\n\nIn another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they are healthy.\n\nGoogle searches for answers about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.\n\nA Google spokesperson said that many of the health examples shared with them were “incomplete screenshots”, but from what they could assess they linked “to well-known, reputable sources and recommend seeking out expert advice”.\n\nThe Guardian investigation comes amid growing concern that AI data can confuse consumers who may assume that it is reliable. In November last year, a study found AI chatbots across a range of platforms gave inaccurate financial advice, while similar concerns have been raised about summaries of news stories.\n\nSophie Randall, director of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, said the examples showed “Google’s AI Overviews can put inaccurate health information at the top of online searches, presenting a risk to people’s health”.\n\nStephanie Parker, the director of digital at Marie Curie, an end-of-life charity, said: “People turn to the internet in moments of worry and crisis. If the information they receive is inaccurate or out of context, it can seriously harm their health.”\n\nThe Guardian uncovered several cases of inaccurate health information in Google’s AI Overviews after a number of health groups, charities and professionals raised concerns.\n\nAnna Jewell, the director of support, research and influencing at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said advising patients to avoid high-fat foods was “completely incorrect”. Doing so “could be really dangerous and jeopardise a person’s chances of being well enough to have treatment”, she added.\n\nJewell said: “The Google AI response suggests that people with pancreatic cancer avoid high-fat foods and provides a list of examples. However, if someone followed what the search result told them then they might not take in enough calories, struggle to put on weight, and be unable to tolerate either chemotherapy or potentially life-saving surgery.”\n\nTyping “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” also served up misleading information, with masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients.\n\nPamela Healy, the chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said the AI summaries were alarming. “Many people with liver disease show no symptoms until the late stages, which is why it’s so important that they get tested. But what the Google AI Overviews say is ‘normal’ can vary drastically from what is actually considered normal.\n\n“It’s dangerous because it means some people with serious liver disease may think they have a normal result then not bother to attend a follow-up healthcare meeting.”\n\nA search for “vaginal cancer symptoms and tests” listed a pap test as a test for vaginal cancer, which is incorrect.\n\nAthena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said: “It isn’t a test to detect cancer, and certainly isn’t a test to detect vaginal cancer – this is completely wrong information. Getting wrong information like this could potentially lead to someone not getting vaginal cancer symptoms checked because they had a clear result at a recent cervical screening.\n\n“We were also worried by the fact that the AI summary changed when we did the exact same search, coming up with a different response each time that pulled from different sources. That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough.”\n\nLamnisos said she was extremely concerned. “Some of the results we’ve seen are really worrying and can potentially put women in danger,” she said.\n\nThe Guardian also found Google AI Overviews delivered misleading results for searches about mental health conditions. “This is a huge concern for us as a charity,” said Stephen Buckley, the head of information at Mind.\n\nSome of the AI summaries for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”, Buckley said.\n\nSome also missed out important context or nuance, he added. “They may suggest accessing information from sites that are inappropriate … and we know that when AI summarises information, it can often reflect existing biases, stereotypes or stigmatising narratives.”\n\nGoogle said the vast majority of its AI Overviews were factual and helpful, and it continuously made quality improvements. The accuracy rate of AI Overviews was on a par with its other search features like featured snippets, which had existed for more than a decade, it added.\n\nThe company also said that when AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed context, it would take action as appropriate under its policies.\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.”",

    "description": "Emrick Donadei said participating in a hackathon gave him hands-on experience and expanded his network at Google.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Emrick Donadei, a 32-year-old software engineer at Google, based in New York. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started at Google a few years ago, my role was completely unrelated to AI.\n\nWhen ChatGPT came out, Google started to focus more on LLMs and opened up more opportunities in the company to switch roles. Similar to others, I became more interested in exploring area.\n\nA few months ago, I switched to an AI role. Now I'm a software engineer working on AI safety. Fundamentally, it's similar to my last role, but instead of building software, I'm building LLMs, which requires data, training, and compute.\n\nInitially, I didn't think I could get a role working in AI. I didn't have the right credentials and when I spoke with other teams, I felt a disconnect because I hadn't even touched the products, let alone experimented with creating them.\n\nI was able to transition because I was at the right company at a time when demand was high — but also because I decided to participate in a hackathon. I think hackathons are the best way for everybody to get into AI.\n\nI'm completely switching my career and that's all because the hackathon forced me to get my foot in the door.\n\nI participated in hackathons orchestrated by Amazon in 2018 and 2019, which I won, and I grew a lot from it. When I saw an opportunity to compete with some of the most brilliant minds in the industry on the hottest topic in the industry, it felt like the perfect mix to both learn a lot and possibly redefine my career.\n\nI participated in Google's annual employee-only hackathon in 2024, which lasted seven days. During that time, I worked to create a new product and then do a demo of it at the end. I learned how to use the tools and started to understand the bottlenecks and gaps. It also taught me to understand more about the fundamental knowledge of AI, like how to build infrastructure for LLMs, how to create the algorithms to create agentic workflows — the things that are less sexy.\n\nI didn't do anything revolutionary. I built a small prototype that wasn't super useful — but it was a good way to get started. I experimented with concepts like creating agents and fine-tuning models.\n\nThe hackathon was a really good way to show myself that I could create something that I wasn't familiar with, and I ended up doing a second one in 2025, which unlocked even more opportunities. For example, I was able to publish a public technical disclosure with Google as a follow-up to my work in the second hackathon.\n\nI saw some colleagues transition to AI teams after the hackathon, but the vast majority didn't. You can't just do a hackathon and stop there. You have to actually leverage that experience.\n\nThere are thousands of people who participate, and you have to be really good to win. So, if you're not going to win, rather than letting your idea rot, you should use the opportunity to talk about what you created.\n\nMy team members and I did a lot of self-promotion. We presented the prototype and discussed it with a lot of teams. I usually reached out to group technical leads, because they tend to have a high-level view and they'll be able to tell you quickly if your hackathon project makes sense in their unit after a 30-minute presentation. If it doesn't, they'll give you the name of someone else to try.\n\nI created a lot of connections from these one-on-one meetings with people I didn't know to talk about my product. It helped me become way more proactive, and I got some really amazing opportunities from those conversations.\n\nI also continued to upskill outside the hackathon. I learned to leverage AI as much as possible to speed up my learning. I use tools like Claude Code to read code and documentation faster, Gemini and ChatGPT Deep Research for case studies, and NotebookLM to consume a lot of information at once.\n\nI also watched Andrej Karpathy's YouTube videos and run a podcast with a friend for software engineers and AI enthusiasts. We're doing it mostly because it's the most proactive way for us to keep learning.",

    "description": "Two DeepMind cofounders are now on the opposite sides of an intensifying AI talent war, as Microsoft lures away Google employees in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Google was not spared by this year's AI talent wars.\n\nThe Gemini creator lost employees from its AI and cloud business, even though the company also made significant hires from other Big Tech companies.\n\nUnlike Apple, which mostly lost AI talent to Meta, which splurged big on recruitment this year, most significant departures from Google ended up at Microsoft.\n\nGoogle DeepMind's rivalry with Microsoft's AI unit is one between two DeepMind cofounders who parted ways. Mustafa Suleyman, now steering Microsoft's consumer AI push, and Demis Hassabis, the current CEO of Google DeepMind, launched DeepMind alongside researcher Shane Legg in 2010. They built a research lab so influential that Google bought it for more than $500 million in 2014.\n\nBut a decade later, Suleyman departed Google and founded Inflection AI. He and most of his team were subsequently absorbed by Microsoft in a $650 million \"acqui-hire,\" which made him the AI lead of the company.\n\nThe competition for AI recruitment continues to intensify as hiring cools in the Big Tech job market. Here's a running list of the AI talent Google has lost this year and where they've ended up.\n\nIn July, Subramanya left his position as vice president of engineering at Google to join Microsoft as its corporate vice president of AI. He had been with Google for more than 15 years. In December, it was announced that he was joining Apple.\n\nSadovsky was a distinguished software engineer and senior director at Google for nearly 18 years before joining Microsoft as the corporate vice president of its AI division in June.\n\nGupta was a principal engineer at Google DeepMind before leaving for a position as technical staff on Microsoft's AI team. Prior to Google, Gupta also worked for Meta.\n\nThe former head of global customers engineering at Google left the company. Regini is now the senior vice president of the global solutions engineering unit at SentinelOne, which is a cybersecurity company that provides an AI-powered platform for enterprise security.\n\nRothfuss was a research scientist at Google DeepMind before leaving in May to join Microsoft as a member of technical staff on the company's AI team.\n\nLee was the senior director of corporate development for Google Cloud and DeepMind. He is widely credited for assisting with Google's high-profile acquisitions, including the $32 billion purchase of the cloud security startup Wiz in March. In December, Lee left for OpenAI as its new vice president of corporate development.\n\nFrank was a senior director of product management at Google, who was responsible for advertiser and customer engagement platforms. He joined Microsoft as the corporate vice president of AI monetization.\n\nPotti was the general manager of Google Cloud's security business for more than five years. He left in June and later joined a venture capitalist firm as a partner with a focus on cybersecurity.\n\nIn 2020, Hall made headlines after Amazon sued him for leaving his role as vice president of product marketing at Amazon to join Google. In September, Hall left his position as vice president of products for an undisclosed role, but wrote in a post on LinkedIn that he will be \"working in AI.\"\n\nCitron, a former senior director of product at Google DeepMind, joined Microsoft in August as corporate vice president of its AI group. In a LinkedIn post announcing his new role, he wrote that he is \"energized by Microsoft AI's pace, principles, and product craft.\"\n\nIn August, Barkley left as the head of product at Google Cloud to become the vice president of product management at Nvidia.",

Most didn't respond or declined to comment.\n\nAt Walmart, the largest private employer in the US, about 13.3% of the workforce — or over 200,000 employees — is over 60 years old, and more than 300,000 employees have a tenure of more than 10 years.\n\n\"We want to be a great place to work during every stage of life,\" a spokesperson said. \"People come here for a first job or a second career, and we have associates from 16 to 100.\"\n\nThomas Magnuson, 83, has worked as a yard driver at a Walmart facility in Wisconsin since 1999. A few years ago, he transitioned to an asset protection position, where he monitors fire systems and recertifies employees who use certain equipment. Magnuson said he doesn't have enough savings to retire. He described the work, which pays low six figures, as fulfilling.\n\nRuth Finkelstein, a professor of public health at Hunter College, said employers should provide mentorship and flexibility to workers of all ages.\n\n\"People reach their peak earnings in their 50s and then gradually decrease after that until they abruptly decrease after retirement,\" Finkelstein said. \"We should have retirement security adequate to meet people's needs without them having to work for their whole lives, and we should have legislation that's much stronger than that against employment discrimination.\"\n\nSome of the biggest names in the retail, entertainment, and food sectors have proposed age-friendly policies and initiatives to support older workers.\n\nCVS Health has developed programs to attract mature workers and develop their skills. Many of Disney's employees are in their second or third career, said Tami Garcia, executive vice president of people and culture at Disney Experiences. The company gives out the Walt Disney Legacy Award and holds service anniversary ceremonies.\n\n\"For many, having a role at one of our Disney parks is a second or even third career, and we deeply value the experience, wisdom, and mentorship that can bring,\" Garcia said. \"From celebrating milestone anniversaries — including 50+ years of service — to honoring those who embody Walt Disney's legacy through our recognition programs, we showcase respect, care, and appreciation for our Cast Members.\"\n\nSome companies have prioritized certain accommodations, such as flexible work schedules. A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the company's \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy has invested over $500 million in operational improvements and the workplace experience, which could benefit older workers looking for more flexibility. The spokesperson said that 85% of employees receive their preferred shifts.\n\nEllen Ernst Kossek, a professor at Purdue University who studies work-life relationships, said companies should consider reducing the workloads of older employees, helping these workers adapt to new technologies, and finding ways to challenge age-related stereotypes.\n\n\"There's a stereotype that older workers are not as current, but just as you would train new workers or encourage people to get a certificate, they could adapt their strategies to look for people with AI skills and encourage people to keep their skills up,\" Kossek said.\n\nSome companies told Business Insider that they've adopted certain benefits, such as greater access to medical care, which may help older workers stay healthy and avoid early retirement due to medical issues.\n\nThis can be beneficial to both companies and their workers. Older workers can increase corporate healthcare costs, since the majority of people aged 65 and older have a chronic disease, said Dr. Susan Mueller, senior director of health equity and well-being at global advisory firm WTW.\n\nWalgreens offers benefits for \"balancing work with caregiving responsibilities, preparing for retirement, or seeking proactive health and financial well-being support,\" a spokesperson said. UnitedHealth Group provides legal services for estate planning and family law, and supports workers navigating menopause or cancer diagnoses.\n\nA Google spokesperson said the company gives employees access to financial coaching for retirement and personalized assistance for managing caregiving. The company offers benefits such as cancer testing and support, no-cost medical second opinions, and no-cost virtual primary care.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson emphasized the company's paid time off for caregiving for loved ones with a serious illness and wraparound care to support healthy aging.\n\nFedEx has launched comprehensive medical benefits and support networks, such as its Choose Well Care Connect advocacy program, which guides members through life-altering diagnoses. FedEx launched a Fast Pass in certain markets to guarantee members a primary care appointment within 10 days or less. The company's corporate responsibility report notes that FedEx is testing home health capabilities in areas with limited healthcare opportunities.\n\nTopics like AI and climate change are garnering more attention in corporate America than the aging workforce, according to a Business Insider analysis of earnings calls, 10-Ks, and interviews.\n\nThat's a concern to some experts on aging, who say companies need to be doing more to prepare for shifting demographics.\n\nMueller said companies should develop programs that control costs for employees needing medical assistance; establish internal guidelines to help employees navigate the healthcare system; add virtual primary care; and hire external companies specializing in common medical conditions.\n\nMadonna Harrington Meyer, a sociology professor at Syracuse University, said that during economically hard times, older workers are often the first to be laid off and the last to be rehired.\n\nHarrington Meyer said companies should focus on accessibility and safety. They should arrange parking spots near office entrances, ensure good lighting and soundproofing for sensory needs, and maintain functional elevators.\n\nGraham Pearce, global defined benefit segment leader at the consulting firm Mercer, said some companies will need to confront an\"unconscious bias\" against older workers — often seen as less adaptable or more prone to illness. Progress may require legislative action, he said.\n\nThe bipartisan Protect Older Job Applicants Act was introduced in September to prohibit age-based applicant sorting for employers, ensure \"disparate impact\" protections apply to employees and applicants, and require government oversight on age discrimination claims.\n\nRep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia who co-led the bill, told Business Insider that he hopes age discrimination will be considered \"as illegal as discrimination based on race, color, creed, national origin, or sex.\" He added that if more people have employment opportunities later in life, it could stimulate the economy and help people age with dignity.\n\nIn September, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, introduced the bipartisan Protecting Older Americans Act, which would end forced arbitration clauses prohibiting victims of age discrimination from suing their employer.\n\n\"We know that forced arbitration often discriminates against the plaintiff, and for a lot of older Americans, they don't have the resources to mount significant litigations against an employer who discriminates against them,\" Gillibrand told Business Insider. \"We believe that if you have the right of the Constitution to go to a trial and to be judged by your peers, older Americans would do better in these lawsuits.\"\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, said that the separate Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act would help level the playing field for older workers and combat age discrimination.\n\n\"We need to do more to make sure that every American can plan and save for a secure retirement, but as more and more of our neighbors are forced to work later in life just to make ends meet, we need to make sure everyone — regardless of their age — has protections and dignity in the workplace,\" Baldwin said.",

    "description": "A whole bag of peanuts, half a jar of peanut butter, a can of sardines, and one fateful sneeze taught me more about Google's algorithm than 20 years in SEO.",
    "fullText": "I want to tell you about the worst day of my life, and how it relates to your website's traffic. Bear with me. This is going somewhere. Probably.\n\nIt started, as most disasters do, with a series of small decisions that seemed fine at the time.\n\nI ate a whole bag of peanuts. Not a small bag. The Costco bag. The one that's meant for a family of four over the course of a month. I ate it in one sitting because it was there, on my desk, and I was reading something online, and my hand just kept going back to the bag. You know how it is. You're not even hungry. You're just... consuming. The bag was open. The peanuts were salted. One leads to another leads to another leads to you're holding an empty bag and your fingers are coated in salt residue and you're wondering what happened to your afternoon.\n\nThen I ate half a jar of peanut butter. Different peanut product, same energy. I had a spoon. I had the jar. I had time. What was I supposed to do, exercise restraint? Close the jar like some kind of adult? No. I kept going. Spoonful after spoonful, watching the peanut butter level descend like a slow tide going out, until I'd crossed the halfway mark and the shame set in and I finally stopped.\n\nThen, because apparently I had decided that today was the day I would test the structural limits of my gastrointestinal system, I ate a can of sardines.\n\nWhy sardines? I don't know. They were in the pantry. They're healthy, I think. Omega-3s. Good for the brain. I needed the protein to balance out the peanuts. That was my reasoning, anyway. The reasoning of a man who had already consumed roughly 4,000 calories of legume-based products and was now adding small oily fish to the mixture like a scientist who has lost control of his experiment but can't stop adding reagents.\n\nI sat back down at my computer. I was reading Hacker News. Everything seemed fine.\n\nJust once. A single sneeze. The kind of sneeze that comes out of nowhere, that ambushes you, that gives you no time to prepare. One second I'm reading a comment thread about Rust versus Go, and the next second my body is convulsing with a violent involuntary exhalation that starts in my sinuses and ends...\n\nI felt it immediately. The warmth. The wetness. The wrongness. That unmistakable sensation that tells you something has happened in your pants that should not have happened. That tells you the structural integrity of your afternoon has been compromised.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the term, and God bless you if you are, a shart is when you attempt to fart and something more substantial comes out. It is a portmanteau of two words that I will not spell out because this is a professional website about search engine optimization and I have some standards. A shart is a betrayal by your own body. A miscommunication between your brain and your bowels. A failure of the internal systems that are supposed to distinguish between gas and catastrophe.\n\nThe sneeze had triggered it. Some kind of pressure cascade. The peanuts and the peanut butter and the sardines, all that matter compressed into my digestive tract, and then the sneeze adding just enough additional force to push everything past the point of no return.\n\nI sat there for a moment. Very still. Assessing the situation. Hoping, somehow, that I was wrong. That the sensation I was feeling was something else, anything else. A figment. A false alarm.\n\nI stood up carefully, like a man defusing a bomb, and began the wobble to the bathroom. Every step was a negotiation. Every movement a risk assessment. I had to get there without making things worse, without spreading the damage, without turning a localized incident into a regional disaster.\n\nI made it. I discovered the horror. I will spare you the details except to say that it was worse than I had hoped and better than I had feared. I cleaned myself up as best I could with the materials available. But my underwear was ruined. There was no saving them. They were casualties of the peanut-sardine conflict, and they had to be disposed of.\n\nThis meant I needed new underwear. The new underwear was upstairs. I was downstairs. The stairs were between us.\n\nSo I began the ascent. Pants around my ankles, because putting them back on seemed wrong and also they needed to be washed. I was shuffling up the stairs like a penguin, like a man in shackles, like someone who had made a series of poor decisions and was now living the consequences of those decisions one humiliating step at a time.\n\nMy foot caught on my bunched-up pants. I pitched forward. I reached for the banister and missed. I went down.\n\nI will not describe the next forty-five seconds except to say that they involved tumbling, flailing, cursing, the reopening of issues I had thought resolved, the involvement of the carpet, and a final resting position at the bottom of the stairs that would have been difficult to explain to anyone who happened to walk in at that moment.\n\nI lay there, on the floor, in conditions I will not describe, and I thought to myself:\n\nThis is what happens when you overconsume and then something sneezes.\n\nI'm going to tell you something now that I've never told anyone. As I lay there on that carpet, in that condition, something clicked in my brain. Something about SEO. Something I'd been trying to understand for months.\n\nI finally understood the Helpful Content Update.\n\nSee, here's what happened to me that day. I consumed too much. Way too much. More than my system could process. Peanuts and peanut butter and sardines, all crammed in there, more than I needed, more than was healthy, more than my body could reasonably be expected to handle. And for a while, nothing happened. The system held. I sat at my computer, functioning normally, reading my Hacker News comments. From the outside, everything looked fine.\n\nAnd then one small trigger. One sneeze. One tiny additional pressure. And the whole system failed catastrophically.\n\nAnd then, when I tried to fix it, I made it worse. Every step I took to recover from the initial disaster led to a new disaster. The wobble to the bathroom. The trip upstairs. The fall on the stairs. Each attempted fix cascading into a fresh catastrophe. The recovery was worse than the initial incident.\n\nThat's what I've watched happen to websites since August 2022.\n\nFor years, websites did what I did with those peanuts. They consumed and consumed and consumed. Not peanuts, but content. AI content. Programmatic content. Template content. \"How to [verb] a [noun]\" times ten thousand. \"Best [product] for [use case]\" times infinity. Content not because users needed it but because the algorithm rewarded volume. Content as peanuts. Handful after handful. The bag is open. The rankings are rising. What are you supposed to do, stop?\n\nThey added more. They added links. They added schema. They added internal linking strategies so aggressive that every page linked to every other page in a great tangled web of self-reference. They added FAQ sections that answered questions nobody asked. They added author bios for authors who didn't exist. They added \"Last Updated\" timestamps that updated automatically whether anything had changed or not.\n\nThey stuffed themselves. Like me with the peanut butter. Spoonful after spoonful. They couldn't stop. The metrics kept going up. The content kept ranking. They crossed the halfway mark and kept going.\n\nAnd then they added the sardines. The guest posts. The link schemes. The PBNs. The \"digital PR\" that was really just paid placements with extra steps. The toxic stuff that should have stayed in the pantry. But it's healthy, they told themselves. It's good for the domain authority. It's omega-3s for the backlink profile.\n\nAnd for a while, it worked. They sat at their computers, watching the traffic, watching the revenue. Everything seemed fine.\n\nAugust 2022. The Helpful Content Update. Just one algorithm adjustment. A single sneeze. A small additional pressure on a system that was already holding too much.\n\nAnd websites across the internet sharted.\n\nTraffic down 40%. 60%. 90%. The warmth. The wetness. The wrongness. That unmistakable sensation that something has happened to your analytics that should not have happened. That tells you the structural integrity of your business model has been compromised.\n\nThey didn't understand it. They hadn't done anything wrong, they thought. They were just doing what everyone else was doing. Consuming content. Adding pages. Building links. The bag was open. The jar was there. What were they supposed to do?\n\nBut that was the problem. They'd consumed too much, and it was all still in there, all that undigested content and those dubious links and those programmatic pages that existed to game the algorithm rather than help users. And when the sneeze came, all of it came out at once.\n\nAnd then they tried to fix it. Like me wobbling to the bathroom. Like me shuffling up the stairs with my pants around my ankles. Every step careful. Every movement a risk.\n\nThey deleted content. Not strategically, but in a panic. Mass deletions. Thousands of pages, gone. They didn't know which pages were the problem, so they deleted all of them. They didn't realize that deleting content creates its own problems. Broken internal links. 404 errors. Orphaned pages. The carpet was getting involved.\n\nThey disavowed links. All of them. The bad ones and the good ones. They didn't know which links were toxic, so they nuked the entire backlink profile. Years of legitimate link building, gone. They'd just kneecapped their own authority because they were panicking.\n\nThey rewrote their content. Added more E-E-A-T signals. Author bios for authors who still didn't exist, but now with LinkedIn profiles that were created last week. \"Expert\" quotes from \"industry professionals\" they'd invented. They were trying to fix the problem by adding more of the thing that had caused the problem. They were eating more peanuts to settle their stomach.\n\nThe September update hit. The October update hit. The November update hit. Each one catching them mid-recovery, each one sending them tumbling again, each one finding some new problem they'd created while trying to fix the last problem. They were at the bottom of the stairs now, in a condition they couldn't explain to anyone who walked in.\n\nHere's what I realized, lying on that carpet in my condition. Here's the thing that clicked.\n\nThe sneeze wasn't the problem. The fall on the stairs wasn't the problem. The problem was everything that came before. The problem was the consumption. The peanuts and the peanut butter and the sardines. The content and the links and the programmatic pages. All that stuff I'd crammed into my system because it was there, because it was easy, because everyone else was doing it, because it felt good in the moment.\n\nThe sneeze just revealed what was already true. The fall just accelerated what was already happening. The carpet just... look, I don't want to extend this metaphor any further than I already have.\n\nThe Helpful Content Update didn't break these websites. These websites were already broken. They were held together by algorithmic tolerance and competitor mediocrity. They were ranking not because they deserved to rank but because everyone else was doing the same thing and Google hadn't gotten around to fixing it yet.\n\nThe sneeze was coming. It was always coming. The only question was when.\n\nI eventually got up off that carpet. I cleaned myself up again. I found new underwear. I washed everything that needed washing, including the carpet. It took a while. It was unpleasant. But I recovered.\n\nI also changed my diet. Not because I'm some kind of health guru now, but because I learned something that day about what happens when you overconsume. When you cram things into your system just because they're there. When you optimize for short-term satisfaction at the expense of long-term structural integrity.\n\nThe websites that recovered from the Helpful Content Update did something similar. They didn't just delete and disavow and panic-rewrite. They fundamentally changed their approach. They stopped consuming content for consumption's sake. They stopped building links for link metrics' sake. They stopped stuffing themselves with peanuts just because the bag was open.\n\nThey started asking a question that seems obvious but apparently wasn't: does this actually help anyone?\n\nNot \"will this rank?\" Not \"will this build authority?\" Not \"will this fill out our content calendar?\" Just: does this help anyone? Would a human being, with a real question, find value in this?\n\nIf the answer was no, they didn't publish it. Revolutionary.\n\nI'm not proud of what happened to me that day. I don't tell this story at parties. I've never told it to anyone, actually, until now, to you, the stranger reading an SEO blog on the internet. I hope you appreciate the vulnerability involved here. I hope you understand what it costs me to share this.\n\nBut I'm telling you because I need you to understand something about the Helpful Content Update and all the updates that have come after it. Something that I didn't understand until I was lying on a carpet at the bottom of the stairs in a condition I still have nightmares about.\n\nThe problem is never the sneeze. The problem is what you've been putting into your system. The problem is the overconsumption. The problem is the peanuts and the peanut butter and the sardines, consumed not because you needed them but because they were there, because it was easy, because what were you supposed to do, stop?\n\nYes. You were supposed to stop.\n\nYou were supposed to look at the bag and think about whether you actually needed more peanuts. You were supposed to put down the spoon before you hit the halfway mark on the peanut butter. You were supposed to leave the sardines in the pantry, where they belong, because nobody needs that much protein and omega-3s are not worth what comes next.\n\nYou were supposed to build a website that helps people instead of a website that games algorithms. You were supposed to create content because you had something to say, not because you had a content calendar to fill. You were supposed to earn links because you made something worth linking to, not because you had a \"link velocity target.\"\n\nAnd if you didn't do those things, if you consumed and consumed and consumed until your system was packed full of stuff that had no business being in there, then the sneeze was coming. It was always coming. The only question was when.\n\nFor me, the sneeze came on a Tuesday, while reading Hacker News, after a regrettable series of dietary choices.\n\nFor your website, the sneeze came in August 2022. Or September 2023. Or March 2024. Or it's coming. It's still coming. Google keeps sneezing. And every time it sneezes, more websites discover what they've been holding inside them all along.\n\nI no longer eat whole bags of peanuts. I no longer follow half a bag of peanuts with half a jar of peanut butter. I definitely no longer add sardines to that combination. I've learned to consume in moderation. To stop before I'm overfull. To leave things in the pantry.\n\nThis has made me a healthier person. It has also dramatically reduced the number of carpet-related incidents in my life, which I think we can all agree is a good thing.\n\nI would recommend a similar approach to your SEO strategy.\n\nStop stuffing your site with content you don't need. Stop building links you can't justify. Stop adding pages just because your competitors have pages. Stop consuming just because the bag is open.\n\nBecause the sneeze is coming. It's always coming. And when it comes, you're going to find out what you're really made of.\n\nI found out what I was really made of that day on the stairs. Peanuts and peanut butter and sardines, mostly. It was not a pleasant discovery.\n\nI hope your website holds up better than my underwear did.\n\nThe author has since recovered fully, both digestively and psychologically. The carpet was professionally cleaned. The underwear was not salvageable.",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA) is in advanced talks to buy Israel-based AI startup AI21 Labs for as much as $3 ​billion, the Calcalist financial daily reported on Tuesday.\n\nNvidia declined to ‌comment, while AI21 was not immediately available to comment.\n\nA 2023 funding round valued AI21 at $1.4 ‌billion. Nvidia and Alphabet's Google participated in that funding.\n\nAI21, founded in 2017 by Amnon Shashua and two others, is among a clutch of AI startups that have benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence, attracting strong ⁠interest from venture capital ‌firms and other investors.\n\nShashua is also the founder and CEO of Mobileye, a developer of self-driving car technologies.\n\nCalcalist ‍said AI21 has long been up for sale and talks with Nvidia have advanced significantly in recent weeks. It noted that Nvidia's primary interest in AI21 ​appears to be its workforce of roughly 200 employees, most of ‌whom hold advanced academic degrees and \"possess rare expertise in artificial intelligence development.\"\n\nCalcalist said the deal to buy AI21 is estimated at between $2 billion and $3 billion.\n\nNvidia, which has become the most valuable company in history at more than $4 trillion, is planning a large expansion in Israel with a ⁠new R&D campus of up to 10,000 ​employees in Kiryat Tivon, just south ​of the port city of Haifa - Israel's third-largest city.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has described Israel as the company’s \"second home.\"\n\nNvidia has ‍said that when ⁠completed, the campus will include up to 160,000 square meters (1.7 million square feet) of office space, parks and common areas across ⁠90 dunams (22 acres), inspired by Nvidia's Santa Clara, California, headquarters. Nvidia expects construction to ‌begin in 2027, with initial occupancy planned for 2031.",

    "description": "Meta is seen as lagging  behind OpenAI and Google in the AI race. Its acquisition of Singapore-based AI startup Manus could help with that.",
    "fullText": "AI dealmaking isn't slowing down — and it's Meta's turn again.\n\nThe social media giant is buying Manus, a Singapore-based artificial intelligence startup, the companies announced on Monday.\n\nManus went viral in March when it previewed an AI agent that could autonomously perform tasks like screening résumés and stock analysis. Manus was created in China but relocated to Singapore in mid-2025. Meta paid more than $2 billion for Manus, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe deal is the latest in a flurry of red-hot AI investment and acquisitions this year, which includes Meta's $14 billion investment in Scale AI in June. From providing an instant AI revenue source to giving it a leg up in AI agents, here's why buying Manus could give Meta a much-needed boost in the AI race.\n\nManus said in December that it had processed more than 147 trillion tokens of text and said its users were in the \"millions.\" It also claimed to have crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, achieving both milestones eight months after launch.\n\nThose numbers tell us Meta is getting a startup with a built-in audience of paying users. Meta's business model to date has largely revolved around building free products and making money from collecting user data and targeted advertising. Manus offers a free tier for basic tasks, but charges users up to $200 a month for its pro tier.\n\n\"The purchase gives Meta a functioning business with paying customers, meaningful revenue and infrastructure already proven at scale,\" said Murthy Grandhi, company profiles analyst at research firm GlobalData, in a note.\n\nIn its announcement, Meta said it plans to continue selling the Manus service separately while also integrating Manus's technology into its existing platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta did not elaborate on which ones or how it might do so. Meta has poured billions into building up its internal AI teams and developing what is termed \"superintelligence,\" with so far little in terms of returns. Manus could be a way for Meta to start making money directly from AI while it continues to build out its internal efforts.\n\nMeta has struggled to wow consumers and developers as much as OpenAI and Google when it comes to raw model power. However, as these models become increasingly commoditized, there is a growing need to show AI can actually be useful. One such way is AI agents, a type of software that can proactively make decisions and take actions, such as creating a marketing campaign or monitoring and fixing bugs in apps.\n\nBuying Manus could prove a smart bet on the idea that the real value will lie in the programs that sit on top of the models. Manus primarily uses other companies' AI models, like Anthropic's Claude, as building blocks and layers its own software on top.\n\n\"People keep assuming a small update from OpenAI or Google will wipe out a lot of AI startups,\" wrote Yuchen Jin, CEO of the AI startup Hyperbolic, in an X post about Meta's Manus deal. \"But in reality, the AI application layer should be where most of the opportunity is.\"\n\nA Meta spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about which models Manus would support following the acquisition.\n\nOne of Meta's strengths is that its platforms are used by billions of people, which, like Google, gives it a distribution advantage. Its challenge is to find ways to keep them coming back.\n\nUnlike Google with Gemini 3, Meta has yet to have a buzzy AI breakthrough moment with its own in-house models. Combining Manus's \"general-purpose agents\" with Meta's distribution channels gives the social media company another shot at that, particularly as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged that Facebook has shifted from being a place for friends to view each other's content to a \"broad discovery and entertainment space.\"\n\n\"Manus offers a ready-made, high-margin software layer that can be sold directly and integrated across Meta's consumer and enterprise products,\" said GlobalData's Grandhi.",

    "fullText": "Our reporting revealed a symbiotic relationship between the IDF and Silicon Valley – with implications for the future of warfare\n\nIn January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms. Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.\n\nOne investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.\n\nI asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.\n\nHow did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?\n\nYuval Abraham: The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.\n\nHarry Davies: There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.\n\nWhat has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?\n\nYuval Abraham: As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.\n\nIf you remember the [Edward] Snowden revelations, many of them had to do with metadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.\n\nSo data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nTo send a message to Harry and Yuval please choose the ‘UK Investigations’ team.\n\nYou can message Harry using the Signal Messenger app. Use the ‘find by username’ option and type hfd.90\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email harry.davies@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nHarry Davies: Yossi Sariel, the former head of [Israel’s elite spy agency] Unit 8200, wrote a book under a pseudonym that we revealed to have been published by him. In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.\n\nSome of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nWe know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as you revealed, Yuval, and has also purchased AI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?\n\nYuval Abraham: What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] called Lavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.\n\nThese AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.\n\nAI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.\n\nHarry Davies: Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.\n\nMicrosoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?\n\nHarry Davies: I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have been protest groups which have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.\n\nYuval Abraham: And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.\n\nIt sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.\n\nYuval Abraham: Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for its Nimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.\n\nThese are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.\n\nMicrosoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhat’s your focus going to be in 2026?\n\nYuval Abraham: I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHarry Davies: We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.\n\nThere’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.\n\nAnd there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services. Post-Gaza, we have to look at these relationships and ask: what is the involvement of these companies and their technology in military decisions, in military operations and in warfare more broadly?\n\nYuval Abraham: Much of our reporting is based on whistleblowers, on individuals who are in proximity to power or hold positions of power.\n\nHarry Davies: Our confidential sources have remained confidential and we are always interested in hearing from new people. Our door is always open.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "Google's AI told me to make pizza with glue in 2024, so I tried it. Zing! But this year, Google got the last laugh. AI overviews are pretty good.",
    "fullText": "It truly brings me no joy to admit this, but now that it's the end of 2025, I can see that Google's AI Overviews, for as much as I goofed on them for being clumsy and bad, are having the last laugh.\n\nThis realization comes after, in 2024, I totally dunked on Google after its AI told me to use glue to help cheese stick to pizza. So, in a moment of internet infamy, I did just that: I made my glue pizza, and even ate a piece.\n\nThe other day, my editor and I were discussing the state of the AI Overviews. We thought the overviews were pretty abysmal at the start of the year — but we now admit to each other that we use them — instead of traditional search — a lot of the time these days.\n\nOf course, the fact that people (such as myself) are willing to use the AI Overview answer in Google instead of clicking on a link and sending traffic to a website that perhaps employs humans to make that content (such as myself) is not necessarily great.\n\nGoogle AI Overviews launched in the spring of 2024, and immediately, people noticed they often, uh, sucked. The answers they gave were full of absurd inaccuracies.\n\nOne example that went viral on social media was its answer for how to stop the cheese from sliding off your pizza — Google AI suggested adding glue to the sauce, which it seemed to have lifted from a joke on Reddit.\n\nAs a journalist with a commitment to seeking the truth, I actually made a pizza with glue in the sauce and ate it (I'm a trained professional idiot; don't try this at home).\n\nThis year, people noticed that Google AI Overviews still were full of problems. One particularly amusing issue was what we'll call the \"You can't lick a badger twice\" problem: give it a nonsense phrase, and it would accept this as a real idiom and try to explain it.\n\nSomeone on Threads noticed you can type any random sentence into Google, then add “meaning” afterwards, and you’ll get an AI explanation of a famous idiom or phrase you just made up. Here is mine\n\n[image or embed]\n\nTo test more, I made up a few of my own fake idioms like \"you can't fit a duck in a pencil\" and \"the road is full of salsa,\" and indeed, AI Overviews gave explanations for what those phrases meant. Here's what I wrote at the time, back in April:\n\nBut things are getting better. When I tried a fake idiom just the other day (\"you can't tell a yak not to dance\"), it gave a more reasonably accurate answer that it was \"not a common, established idiom, but rather a playful or poetic expression,\" and suggested potential interpretations. Fair enough.\n\nGoogle AI Overviews are getting less laughably bad, and just, well … useful.\n\nI've gotten more used to seeing them, and as I get used to them, I've also gotten better at predicting if the type of query I'm posing is the kind of thing an AI Overview can answer. And it's working more often than it isn't.",

    "description": "Gregor Konzett quit his dream job at Google and gave up his US visa to be part of a startup accelerator program. Here's how he took a calculated risk.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gregor Konzett, a 27-year-old former Google employee based in London. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I got relocated to work out of Google's Mountain View headquarters in 2024, it was a dream come true.\n\nI was raised in a small village in Austria, but I always dreamed of living in Silicon Valley. As a child who was excited about tech, I wanted to be where innovation happened.\n\nMy team was based in California, but I was working from London. Not even a year into my job, I was asking if I could be transferred.\n\nTwo years after getting hired as a software engineer, Google transferred me to Silicon Valley. Then, a year after that, I quit. I packed up my bags and moved back to London in just two weeks to participate in a startup accelerator program. It was worth the risk, even in this difficult job market.\n\nI joined Google in 2022 as a software engineer on the Google Pixel audio team. I enjoyed my job, but being in London, the physical distance turned minor questions into major delays. If I hit a blocker with a specific subsystem, I'd send a message and wait 24 hours for a reply due to time zone differences, or spend many late nights in chats with colleagues to unblock myself.\n\nAfter I was finally relocated to the Mountain View headquarters, living in the Bay Area was almost exactly as I had always imagined it from movies and TV. California is the most beautiful place I've ever been to, and being able to call it my home was incredible.\n\nIt was great to be part of an environment filled with so many other engineers. I remember going surfing with some people and just having the most Silicon Valley conversation ever about coding and deep tech. The only thing I didn't expect was that it's not this crazy, futuristic place. In reality, the infrastructure was just OK, and the internet speed wasn't even very reliable.\n\nThe work life at the Google headquarters was really nice. On average, it was a typical 9-to-5, and my team had a really great dynamic.\n\nFor the first few months, I was learning a lot, and everything ramped up quickly. My team gave me a lot of responsibility and trusted me to handle huge pieces of the system, which is amazing and rare for a company of its size.\n\nBeing in the office, I got to sit on the same floor as the teams building the specific subsystems I was coding for, and sit in meetings where product decisions were actually made. I could walk 10 feet, point at a whiteboard, and solve complex architectural issues in minutes. I learned \n\nHowever, after about a year, I felt like I had reached a natural ceiling in my work, and I wasn't learning much anymore. I wasn't super happy in my job, and my visa limited me from working on my own projects outside of Google, which was my real dream.\n\nOne of my closest friends got into a startup accelerator program in London and encouraged me to apply, with the plan of using it as an opportunity to cofound our own startup. When I got accepted with a start date only a month away, I knew I'd have to make a quick decision. I loved California, and leaving Google would mean leaving the country.\n\nThe job market has been terrible, and I questioned whether this was the right time to quit my job and potentially face unemployment. However, I felt confident in my technical background and having Google on my résumé, so I believed I could find another job.\n\nThe hardest part about deciding to quit was that it was objectively a really good job, and leaving meant giving up my path to a green card in the US. I was stuck in a dilemma: do I stay in a role I've outgrown for four, or potentially even more years, just to secure permanent residency, or do I quit to chase higher job satisfaction?\n\nI realized that staying for the sake of immigration meant stalling my career development.\n\nI figured now was the time to take a risk. I'm young and have a financial runway from my Google salary, and I don't have a mortgage to pay or a family to care for. So, I put in my two weeks at Google.\n\nIt's been a few months since I joined the program, and my friend and I are working on our startup, Vestry.ai, which fixes the observability gap for complex hardware. Our plan is to build while we're in the accelerator, get funding, and move back to California to live the startup life.\n\nCalifornia is ultimately the place to be for anything in the startup world. We want to be a part of the AI revolution, and that's just where you've got to be.\n\nI've been so busy with the program I haven't really had any time to think about whether I made the right choice, but I'm convinced I'm where I need to be.\n\nDo you have a story to share about quitting Big Tech? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Asia In Brief China’s Cyberspace Administration on Saturday posted draft rules governing the behaviour of AI companions that prohibit using them to serve as friends for the elderly.\n\nThe draft “Interim Measures for the Administration of Humanized Interactive Services Based on Artificial Intelligence” opens with a suggestion that China needs regulations to ensure the healthy development of AIs that “engage in emotional interaction with humans.”\n\nAs is always the case with China’s tech regulations, the draft calls for providers of companion AIs to ensure they are secure, don’t expose users to fraud, encrypt data, and reflect core socialist values. It also includes a requirement for parental controls, and for protection of data that describes minors.\n\nOne Article in the draft addresses how AI companions interact with the elderly:\n\nProviders shall guide elderly people to set up emergency contact persons for their services. If any elderly person is found to be in danger of losing their life, health or property during the use of the service, the provider shall promptly notify the emergency contact person and provide social and psychological assistance or emergency relief channels.\n\nProviders are prohibited from providing services that simulate the relatives or specific relationships of elderly users.\n\nThe draft also calls for AI companions to remind users they are not interacting with a human every two hours, and for providers of such systems to provide advance notice of outages.\n\nAlso among the draft requirements are calls for “mental health protection, emotional boundary guidance, and dependency risk warning, and should not use replacing social interaction, controlling users' psychology, or inducing addiction as design goals.”\n\nThe draft also prohibits using data gathered during interaction with AI companies to train models.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration wants feedback on the draft by January 25th.\n\nAustralia’s Department of Defence has tapped Google for an “enhanced, secure and air-gapped hyperscale cloud capability.”\n\n“Defence will have access to advanced global cloud solutions to deliver key sovereign capabilities,” states the department’s announcement of the deal. “The technology will support faster rollout of critical systems, ongoing upgrades and improved cooperation with international partners, while ensuring Australia retains control of critical Defence assets.”\n\nAustralia’s government already has a deal with AWS to operate three datacenters dedicated to government workloads, including information rated as the nation’s “most classified data.”\n\nThe Department said the sensitivities of the Google deal mean it will “refrain from providing further commentary … with all specific details remaining strictly confidential.”\n\nJapan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has published its initial analysis of the failed launch of its H3 rocket last week.\n\nThe agency found that when the rocket’s fairing separated, pressure in a fuel tank fell. When the engine that used the fuel tank ignited, it produced around 80 percent of expected pressure.\n\nThe rocket’s second stage and payload therefore could not reach the intended orbit. The report suggests both fell into Earth’s atmosphere and burned up safely.\n\n57 percent of components present in Huawei smartphones are now made in China, according to a product teardown reported by Japanese outlet Nikkei.\n\nWorking with Japanese teardown service Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, Nikkei analyzed the content of 2024’s Mate 70 Pro and this year’s Pura 80 Pro, and found 57 percent of components in both were made in China, and that those parts accounted for 60 percent of the phone’s value.\n\nNikkei reports that just 19 percent of components in Huawei’s 2020 models came from China, rising to 32 percent in 2023.\n\nPapua New Guinea’s (PNG’s) National Information & Communications Technology Authority has warned signatories to a petition calling for Starlink to be licensed for operations in the country that they risk prosecution.\n\nPNG is a rugged country with poor telecommunications infrastructure – a fine fit for Starlink’s satellite broadband service. Local netizens have campaigned for PNG to license Starlink, suggesting they email NICTA to express support for Starlink.\n\nOn December 16th NICTA demanded Starlink suspend services to the country.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, NICTA published a list of petitioners and warned “Individuals who have signed or participated in the petition may be regarded as potential offenders, and NICTA will not hesitate to pursue appropriate regulatory and legal action where non-compliance is established.”\n\nStarlink has since ended service in PNG.",

    "description": "A Hindi version of Google's support page suggests that Google is testing a service to let users change their Gmail addresses without sacrificing data.",
    "fullText": "It looks like you may soon be able to change that old email address you made in high school.\n\nGoogle account users have long been unable to change their email addresses without creating a whole new account, but Google seems to be quietly rolling out an option to update them. That's according to a support page published by the company, which outlines a new process to change the email or username used to identify your account.\n\nThe update on Google's account help page says certain account holders can now change their @gmail.com address without losing access to their data or services. The feature was first reported in the Google Pixel Hub Telegram group in a message that said the update is being gradually rolled out to users. As of Friday morning, the modified instructions were available on the Hindi version of Google's support page.\n\nThe support page suggests this option is currently only available in some regions, including Hindi-speaking areas.\n\nAccording to a translated version of the Hindi support page, the new email must end in @gmail.com, and it can only be changed up to three times. Once the address has been changed, it's irreversible.\n\nTo make the change, you would visit your Google Account page, click \"Personal Info,\" and go to the \"Email\" section, according to the Telegram message.\n\nIt's unclear when it will roll out more widely, and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. As of Friday morning, the English support page said usernames ending in @gmail.com usually can't be changed.\n\nOnce the change is made, the Hindi page said, your old Gmail address will be used as an alias to receive emails. You can reuse your old Google account email address at any time, but you can't create a new Gmail address for the next 12 months.\n\nYou can sign in to Google services like Gmail, YouTube, Google Play, or Drive with your old or new email address.",

    "description": "A new type of dealmaking is on the rise in Silicon Valley as Nvidia reaches a non-exclusive deal with a chip startup and hires its top engineers.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia is forging ahead with another bet on the AI boom, agreeing to a licensing deal with AI hardware startup Groq.\n\nGroq said Wednesday that some of its executives, including its founder and CEO, will join Nvidia as part of the deal. Groq is expected to continue operating independently following what it described as a non-exclusive licensing deal.\n\nGroq is known for its Language Processing Unit, which is a custom chip designed for AI inference, namely, the process by which a trained AI model makes predictions or decisions. The startup was valued at about $6.9 billion as of three months ago and raised around $750 million in its latest funding round.\n\nJonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other members of its team are expected to join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market cap north of $4.5 trillion.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told Business Insider on Wednesday that Nvidia is not acquiring the chip startup.\n\nNeither Nvidia nor Groq disclosed financial terms of the agreement.\n\nRoss and Douglas Wightman were engineers at Google who started the project that became Google's first TPU chips, before leaving to found Groq. The TPUs are custom-made to accelerate large-scale machine-learning tasks designed to handle AI workloads, and are a major rival to Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nThe deal between the two companies comes as a new type of dealmaking is on the rise in Silicon Valley. Whereas traditional startups either aim to go public or be acquired, new acqui-hire deals could leave some startup employees behind, only benefiting a small percentage of staff members with desirable AI skills and the founders.\n\nFor instance, in 2024, Google agreed to pay $2.5 billion to license Character.AI's technology but only hired its two superstar cofounders and 20% of the startup's employees. In the same year, AI developers Adept and Inflection also made similar deals with Amazon and Microsoft, respectively.\n\nMore recently, Meta's acqui-hire of Scale AI became one of the biggest bets on talent after the company agreed to invest roughly $14 billion for a 49% stake and to bring its CEO, Alexandr Wang, into the fold to lead the Meta Superintelligence Labs.\n\nThese acqui-hires don't always end well. Windsurf employees were left in limbo after the AI coding startup was nearly aquired by OpenAI for $3 billion, only for the deal to fall apart and the company to be split. Google spent billions to hire Windsurf's CEO and top engineers, while the remaining hundreds of employees were acquired by another startup, Cognition.",

    "fullText": "Blogging goes mainstream in 2003; and with the launch of Google AdSense, pro blogs emerge too. Also the iTunes store debuts, social networks ramp up, and Flash websites are everywhere.\n\nFlash at full volume: Jamiroquai’s website in 2003.\n\nBlogging and RSS moved into the mainstream in 2003, helped by the emergence of consumer-friendly RSS Readers like NetNewsWire and Bloglines. There was even now an economic model for blogging, with the launch of Google's AdSense in March. Also, online music went legit with Apple's iTunes store, and social networking began to take recognizable form with Friendster and MySpace.\n\n\"Social software\" was a geeky term being used in the blogosphere during this time. So there was an understanding that social aspects would underpin the next web era, even if the tech industry hadn't yet put all the pieces together.\n\nClay Shirky explaining \"social software\" in Esther Dyson's Release 1.0 newsletter; May 2003.\n\nIf there was one company that was putting together the jigsaw puzzle that would later be named Web 2.0, it was Google. In February, Google acquired the leading blogging service of the day: Blogger.\n\n“Google, which runs the Web's premier search site, has purchased Pyra Labs, a San Francisco company that created some of the earliest technology for writing weblogs, the increasingly popular personal and opinion journals,” wrote Silicon Valley reporter Dan Gillmor on February 15, 2003.\n\nNeedless to say, Google's purchase brought blogging even more into the mainstream. Other blogging tools, such as Movable Type, Radio Userland and LiveJournal, gained popularity over 2003 too.\n\nMeanwhile, there was also a revolution happening in reading software. RSS Readers (sometimes called \"news aggregators\") were increasingly being used. Two examples were FeedDemon and NetNewsWire — these were desktop readers, for Windows and Mac respectively. Then in mid-2003, a browser-based RSS Reader called Bloglines launched; by August I was a Bloglines user and have used browser-based readers ever since.\n\nPeople used these new reader apps to RSS became a crucial part of the blogging movement over 2003, because it enabled bloggers to be discovered and their content to be distributed across the internet.\n\nIn addition to buying Blogger, Google was starting to figure out its business model. The company had only recently begun to turn a profit, thanks to its AdWords online advertising platform — introduced in 2000. But when the company launched a contextual advertising system in March, we began to see why blogging was of such interest to Google.\n\nInitially given the descriptive, if clunky, name \"Content-Targeted Advertising,\" Google's new ad product was promoted as \"a new, automated system that matches advertising precisely to the information on content and community pages.\"\n\nGoogle's Content-Targeted Advertising system, 2003.\n\nAdSense opened the door to professional blogging. Nick Denton, previously cofounder of the news syndication company Moreover, was one of the first to take advantage. He'd launched Gawker in January 2003 and by November was telling the New York Times that AdSense was effectively guiding his topic selection:\n\n\"The way Mr. Denton determines the theme of his blogs has less to do with his own personal interests than with the demands of the market, as determined by Google. He relies on Google's AdSense program, which pays Web sites to publish text ads matched to the pages' content, for the bulk of his revenue. As a result, he picks blog subjects based on the rate Google pays for clicks on ads in specific topic areas. Among the topics of blogs he plans to start this year are computer gaming, travel and politics.\"\n\nGawker, a pioneering pro blog, in July 2003.\n\nFriendster launched publicly in March 2003. It wasn’t the first social networking site on the internet: Classmates.com had started in 1995, Six-Degrees.com the following year, and LiveJournal began in 1999 as a kind of blogging spin on the idea. But Friendster was the first of this kind of site to gain major traction in Silicon Valley. It was initially pitched as “a new way to meet people” for dating purposes, “or making new friends.”\n\nDespite its popularity — it had around three million registered users by the fall of 2003 — Friendster was slow and plagued by technical issues. That left the door open for other social networks to enter the market and offer a better product.\n\nMySpace did exactly that, when it launched in August 2003 as “an online community that lets you meet your friends' friends.”\n\nMySpace in September 2003, the month after its launch.\n\nMySpace grew quickly. By October, it had over one hundred thousand users. It was still small fry compared to Friendster, but MySpace users seemed to be having more fun than Friendster users. Partly this was because MySpace allowed people to edit the HTML in their profiles — which meant they could add colourful backgrounds and fonts, and use images and GIFs like on Geocities. This helped MySpace attract a youthful user base, which in turn helped it become the trendy new social network.\n\n2003 was really Friendster's year, but the immediate future would belong to MySpace...although it, too, would leave the door open for competitors. In late-2003, a little website called \"Facemash\" came online — it was created by a Harvard University student named Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nIn April 2003, Steve Jobs launched the iTunes Music Store at a special Apple music event. It offered over 200,000 songs, which you could buy for 99 cents each. Notably, the file format wasn't MP3, but a new format called AAC (Advanced Audio Encoding) encoded at 128 kilobits per second. The file quality was generally viewed favorably, although Sound on Sound commented in a November review:\n\n\"While AAC definitely offers better-quality encoding than MP3 at the same bit rate, Jobs' claim that AAC \"rivals CD quality\" was maybe a little bit of a liberty.\"\n\nThe iTunes store was initially available to Mac computers only; and also restricted to the US for licencing reasons. In October, the store was expanded to Microsoft Windows when iTunes for Windows was launched. But international expansion didn't begin happening until mid-2004 (my country, New Zealand, had to wait until 2005).\n\niTunes Music Store webpage, 29 April 2003.\n\nThe idea with the iTunes Store was that you downloaded the music and owned the file (albeit with DRM — Digital Rights Management). In time, online music would gravitate to the streaming model, which in 2003 was the domain of Rhapsody. But Apple's big advantage was the success of the iPod, which meant it had a complete hardware-software ecosystem. Also, you could listen to your music offline — a key feature in 2003, when internet connectivity was still largely restricted to PCs and laptops.\n\nIn mid-December 2003, Apple announced that more than 25 million songs had been sold from the iTunes store since its April launch. It had also doubled the song catalog to more than 400,000 songs.\n\niTunes user interface; via Sound on Sound, November 2003.\n\nAs game designer and net artist Nathalie Lawhead wrote in a later retrospective, Flash “started as a tool for bringing animations to the web,” but it “eventually grew to being used for building rich, immersive, and very animated websites.” 2003 was smack in the prime years of what Lawhead termed the “Flash website movement (when websites were ‘the new emerging artform’).”\n\nBowieNet version 3 was made entirely of Flash; screenshot circa September 2003.\n\nA showcase for Flash websites during this time was the Favourite Web Awards (FWA), run by Rob Ford. In his review of 2003, Ford highlighted tokyoplastic v1, an experimental Flash site designed by Sam Lanyon Jones and Drew Cope from the UK. \"One of those rare sites that gave you an adrenaline rush (or was that a fright?) when you clicked on the loaded graphic and the site swallowed you up,\" Ford wrote.\n\nJones and Cope later said that the site \"served no purpose just kooky animation, sound design and a bit of interaction.\" While that's underselling their clever use of vector graphics and 3D animation in tokyoplastic v1, it does sum up what Flash brought to the web: a sense of creativity and fun, albeit sometimes it \"served no purpose.\"\n\nSo by the end of 2003, the web felt primed for a new era: social software was going mainstream, web standards were stable while Flash brought the pizzazz, and business models were emerging. Could this be the second generation of the internet coming online?\n\nMore year-by-year overviews of internet history:\n\nMy Web 2.0 memoir, Bubble Blog: From Outsider to Insider in Silicon Valley's Web 2.0 Revolution, is now available to purchase:\n\nOr search for \"Bubble Blog MacManus\" on your local online bookstore.",

    "description": "Jon Rafman has been curating the images since 2008.",
    "fullText": "When Google Street View rolled out in 2007, it became the “world’s photographer.” Since then, artist Jon Rafman has been collecting moments captured by Google’s Street View cars.\n\nThe project is named Nine Eyes to reflect the nine cameras that are fitted to Street View cars. “Unlike traditional photography, these images have no author. The camera records everything but understands nothing,” says the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark, where Rafman is currently exhibiting his project.\n\nSince 2008, Rafman has been carefully selecting images from Street View, starting an archive taken from blogs and websites. He also joined the culture by finding pictures himself.\n\nRafman says that the cars with nine eyes are indifferent about what they photograph. But by curating them in this way, he develops the images in a way akin to how photographers used to develop photos in darkrooms.\n\n“There are the glitches in the technology that points to the artificiality of Street View, the happy accident of the error that creates something beautiful,” says Rafman. “There is also the more noir, hard-boiled street life scenes like the man with the gun, the prostitute, the drunks, all of the seedy underbelly. There is romantic imagery, the surreal, Jeff Wall-like images. There is ironic imagery, there’s the abject, there’s the beautiful, all the different poles of existence.”\n\nThe exhibition at the Louisiana is called Report a Concern, a nod to the message Google used to place in the corner of all its images. It is the first full presentation of the Nine Eyes archive, and as well as the images, it also features new AI-based pieces.\n\n“It explores how technology, surveillance, and memory shape our sense of reality in the digital age,” says the museum. “Nine Eyes invites the viewer to look again, not just at the world, but at the way technology sees it for us.’\n\nThe exhibit is at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlebaek, Denmark, until January 11, 2026.",

    "description": "This year saw new AI models, transformative products and new breakthroughs in science and robotics.",
    "fullText": "This was a year of AI agents, reasoning and scientific discovery.\n\n2025 has been a year of extraordinary progress in research. With artificial intelligence, we can see its trajectory shifting from a tool to a utility: from something people use to something they can put to work. If 2024 was about laying the multimodal foundations for this era, 2025 was the year AI began to really think, act and explore the world alongside us. With quantum computing, we made progress towards real-world applications. And across the board, we helped turn research into reality, with more capable and useful products and tools making a positive impact on people's lives today.\n\nHere’s a look back at some of the breakthroughs, products and scientific milestones that defined the work of Google, Google DeepMind and Google Research in a year of relentless progress.\n\nThis year, we significantly advanced our model capabilities with breakthroughs on reasoning, multimodal understanding, model efficiency, and generative capabilities, beginning with the release of Gemini 2.5 in March and culminating in the November launch of Gemini 3 and the December launch of Gemini 3 Flash.\n\nBuilt on a foundation of state-of-the-art reasoning, Gemini 3 Pro is our most powerful model to date, designed to help you bring any idea to life. It topped the LMArena Leaderboard and redefined multimodal reasoning with breakthrough scores on benchmarks like Humanity’s Last Exam — a fiendishly hard test for AI models to see if AI can truly think and reason like humans — and GPQA Diamond. It also set a new standard for frontier models in mathematics, achieving a new state-of-the-art of 23.4% on MathArena Apex. We followed shortly with Gemini 3 Flash, which combines Gemini 3's Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost, making it the most performant model for its size. Gemini 3 Flash's quality surpasses our previous Gemini 2.5 Pro-scale model's capabilities at a fraction of the price and substantially better latency, continuing our Gemini-era trend of 'the next generation's Flash model is better than the previous generation's Pro model'.\n\nLearn more about our progress on our world-class AI models this year:\n\nGemini 3 Flash price & benchmark table.\n\nWe’re committed to making useful AI technology accessible, with state-of-the-art open models. We built our Gemma family of models to be lightweight and open for public use; this year we were able to introduce multimodal capabilities, significantly increase the context window, expand multilingual capabilities, and improve efficiency and performance.\n\nLearn more about this year’s advances in Gemma models:\n\nThroughout 2025, we continued to advance the trajectory of AI from tool to utility, transforming our portfolio of products with new, powerful agentic capabilities. We reimagined software development by moving beyond tools that assist coding to introducing powerful, agentic systems that collaborate with developers. Key advances, such as the impressive coding capabilities in Gemini 3 and the launch of Google Antigravity, mark a new era in AI-assisted software development.\n\nLearn more about this year’s advances building developer tools:\n\nThis evolution was also clear across our core products, from AI-enabled features on the Pixel 10 and updates to AI Mode in Search, to AI-first innovations like the Gemini app and NotebookLM, which gained advanced features like Deep Research.\n\nLearn more about how we’ve transformed our products with AI:\n\n2025 was a transformative year for generative media, giving people new and unprecedented capabilities to realize their creative ambitions. Generative media models and tools for video, images, audio and worlds became more effective and broadly used, with breakouts Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro offering unprecedented capabilities for native image generation and editing. We worked with people in creative industries to develop tools like Flow and Music AI Sandbox, making them more helpful for creative workflows, and we expanded creative possibilities for people with new, AI-powered experiences in the Google Arts & Culture lab, major upgrades to image editing within the Gemini app, and the introduction of powerful new generative media models like Veo 3.1, Imagen 4 and Flow.\n\nLearn more about how we’re building AI to enhance creativity:\n\nAs research breakthroughs continue to expand AI’s capabilities, Google Labs is where we share AI experiments as we develop them – hearing from users and evolving as we learn. Some of this year’s most engaging experiments from Labs: Pomelli, an AI experiment for on-brand marketing content; Stitch, which introduced a way to turn prompt and image inputs into complex UI designs and frontend code in minutes; Jules, an asynchronous coding agent that acts as a collaborative partner for developers; and Google Beam, a 3D video communications platform that used AI to advance the possibilities of remote presence.\n\nLearn more about how we’re experimenting in Labs:\n\n2025 was also a banner year for scientific advances with AI, marked by breakthroughs in life sciences, health, natural sciences, and mathematics.\n\nIn the space of a year, we made progress in building AI resources and tools that empower researchers and help them understand, identify, and develop treatments in healthcare. In genomics, where we’ve been applying advanced technology to research for 10 years, we moved beyond sequencing, using AI to interpret the most complex data. We also marked the 5-year anniversary of AlphaFold, the Nobel-winning AI system that solved the 50-year-old protein folding problem. AlphaFold has been used by over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries, including over 1 million users in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to advance life sciences and health:\n\nGemini’s advanced thinking capabilities, including Deep Think, also enabled historic progress in mathematics and coding. Deep Think was able to solve problems that require deep abstract reasoning – achieving gold medal-standard in two international contests.\n\nLearn more about how we’re advancing natural sciences and mathematics:\n\nWe’re also leading major discoveries and shaping the future of science in areas like quantum computing, energy and moonshots. Research in this area drew new levels of public attention, with progress towards real-world applications of quantum computing as demonstrated by Quantum Echoes and, notably, Googler Michel Devoret becoming a 2025 Physics Nobel Laureate along with former Googler John Martinis and UC Berkeley’s John Clarke, for their foundational 1980s quantum research.\n\nLearn more about our work on space infrastructure and quantum computing:\n\nIn 2025, we continued to advance the core infrastructure that powers our AI, focusing on breakthroughs in hardware design and improving energy efficiency. This included the introduction of Ironwood, a new TPU built for the age of inference, which was designed using a method called AlphaChip, alongside a commitment to measuring the environmental impact of our technology.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to develop chips, infrastructure and improve energy efficiency:\n\nOur work in robotics and visual understanding brought AI agents into both the physical and virtual worlds, with advancements like the foundational Gemini Robotics models, the more sophisticated Gemini Robotics 1.5, and the introduction of Genie 3 as a new frontier for general-purpose world models.\n\nLearn more about our work with world models and robotics:\n\nOur work throughout 2025 demonstrates how AI-enabled scientific progress is being directly applied to address the world's most critical and pervasive challenges. By leveraging state-of-the-art foundational models and agentic reasoning, we are significantly increasing our understanding of the planet and its systems, while also delivering impactful solutions in areas vital to human flourishing, including climate resilience, public health and education.\n\nFor example, we are using state-of-the-art foundational models and agentic reasoning to help increase our understanding of the planet, helping enable work that is making a difference in people’s lives now from weather predictions to urban planning to public health. For example, our flood forecasting information now covers more than two billion people in 150 countries for severe riverine floods. And our most advanced and efficient forecasting model, WeatherNext 2 can generate forecasts 8x faster and with resolution up to 1-hour. Using this technology, we’ve supported weather agencies in making decisions based on a range of scenarios through our experimental cyclone predictions.\n\nLearn more about our work in weather, mapping and wildfires:\n\nWe are working with partners to apply AI-enabled scientific progress closer to patients, opening up new avenues for disease management and therapeutic discovery.\n\nLearn more about our health-related work:\n\nAI is proving to be a powerful tool in education, enabling new forms of understanding and expanding curiosity through initiatives like LearnLM and Guided Learning in Gemini. We brought Gemini’s most powerful translation capabilities to Google Translate, enabling much smarter, more natural and accurate translations and piloting new speech to speech translation capabilities.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to enable learning:\n\nWe couple our research breakthroughs with rigorous and forward-looking work on responsibility and safety. As our models grow more capable, we’re continuing to advance and evolve our tools, resources and safety frameworks to anticipate and mitigate risk. Gemini 3 demonstrated this approach in action: it's our most secure model yet, and has undergone the most comprehensive set of safety evaluations of any Google AI model to date. And we’re looking further ahead, exploring a responsible path to AGI, prioritizing readiness, proactive risk assessment, and collaboration with the wider AI community.\n\nLearn more about our responsibility and safety work:\n\nAdvancing the frontier of AI responsibly demands collaboration across all parts of society. In 2025, we worked with leading AI labs to help to form the Agentic AI Foundation and support open standards to ensure a responsible and interoperable future for agentic AI. In education, we’ve partnered with school districts like Miami Dade County and education groups like Raspberry Pi to equip students with AI skills. Our research partnerships with universities like UC Berkeley, Yale, the University of Chicago and many more have been instrumental to some of this year’s most exciting frontier research, and we’re working with the US Department of Energy’s 17 national laboratories to transform how scientific research is conducted. And we’re working with filmmakers and other creative visionaries to put the best AI tools in their hands and explore storytelling in the age of AI.\n\nLearn more about our work on frontier collaboration:\n\nAs we look towards 2026, we’re looking forward to continuing to advance the frontier, safely and responsibly, for the benefit of humanity.",

    "description": "PERM applications at Google will ramp up in 2026, affecting visa holders seeking green cards and permanent residency.",
    "fullText": "Google told employees it will be \"ramping up\" PERM applications in 2026 for eligible employees, a crucial step to securing a green card.\n\nThe company told staff in a December newsletter that employees eligible for PERM would hear from its outside lawyers in Q1, according to a copy of the memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nPERM allows employees to move from working on a visa to securing a green card. Tech companies commonly use it to transition staff from H-1 B status to a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US.\n\nTech employees on work visas have faced increased uncertainty this year due to policy changes, such as the rise in H-1B visa fees. Google's lawyers recently advised employees with work visas, such as the H-1B, to avoid international travel due to \"significant\" delays, Business Insider reported.\n\nAccording to the memo about PERM, only those who meet certain criteria will be eligible for the application. One requirement is that employees must work in a role that requires a degree and prior work experience.\n\nThe memo also said that staff must work from a Google office to be considered.\n\n\"Remote Googlers must agree to transfer to an office to be PERM eligible,\" the memo read.\n\nA Google spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe PERM process is designed to ensure that hiring foreign workers doesn't harm the job opportunities or working conditions of US workers. As such, the company sponsoring the worker must prove that there are no available qualified US citizens who can fill the role.\n\nGoogle paused PERM applications in January 2023, the same month it laid off 12,000 employees, Business Insider previously reported. Amazon, Meta, and other tech companies similarly put the brakes on PERM as a wave of job cuts made it harder to justify hiring outside the US, as per the program's terms.\n\nThe sweeping layoffs meant the market was flooded with people looking for work, making it harder for employers to hire foreign workers.\n\nGoogle applied for PERM for a small handful of employees throughout this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The announcement about 2026 marks a scaling up of the program, the person said.\n\nGoogle told staff in the memo that there is a bar to clear for PERM applications. Employees who are at Level 3 roles or below will be less likely to meet the requirements, the memo said.\n\nIt also said that Google employees would not be considered for PERM if they are \"not in good standing\" with the company.\n\n\"Googlers must have a MI rating or higher to be eligible for PERM,\" it read. MI means \"moderate impact\" — a rating Googlers can be given in their yearly performance reviews.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "The world's largest technology companies are scrambling to manage a growing crisis affecting thousands of their employees on work visas, as new social media screening requirements trigger delays at US embassies and consulates worldwide.\n\nGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, and ServiceNow have all sent advisories to visa-holding employees in recent days, warning them against international travel and describing appointment delays stretching up to a year.\n\nThe memos, sent by immigration law firms representing these companies or by their internal legal teams, paint a picture of mounting uncertainty for foreign workers who form a critical part of the tech industry's workforce.\n\nThe warnings come as American embassies have postponed routine visa stamping appointments, leaving some employees already abroad unable to return to work in the US for extended periods.\n\nFor H-1B holders, the primary work visa used by tech companies, the situation creates a particularly difficult bind. If their visa stamp expires and they travel abroad, they must obtain a new stamp at a consulate before re-entering the US. With appointments now being rescheduled months into the future, what would typically be a routine trip home has become a potential career disruption lasting up to a year.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for the Department of State told Business Insider it was now conducting \"online presence reviews for applicants.\" The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"While in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else,\" the State Department spokesperson said. Appointments in Ireland and Vietnam have also been postponed, according to immigration firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC.\n\nBelow are the full texts of the internal memos sent to employees at these companies, obtained by Business Insider, which reveal how corporate America is responding to the visa processing slowdown.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft declined to comment, while Apple and ServiceNow did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBelow is the text of a memo sent by Jack Chen, Microsoft's associate general counsel for immigration.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP (BAL), the immigration firm that represents Google.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Apple's immigration team.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by ServiceNow's Global Mobility Team.\n\nHave a tip?
