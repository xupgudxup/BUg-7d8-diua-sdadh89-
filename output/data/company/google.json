    "description": "An infographics feature has arrived to Google's NotebookLM.",
    "fullText": "Another day, another update to Google's NotebookLM, the versatile AI tool that functions like a personal assistant focused only on you and your needs. The latest update is for visual learners: You can turn your source materials into helpful infographics that give you a clear picture—literally—of what the PDFs, websites, videos, or other materials you're studying or organizing are about.\n\nTo use the new feature, open any of your NotebookLM Notebooks (the name given to folders full of specific materials you've uploaded) and navigate to the panel on the right side. It's the same panel where you find the other offerings like the video creator and flashcard maker.\n\nAs with those tools, you just tap the associated button to generate the corresponding product, making sure the sources from your left panel that you want to include are all checked off. I tried it out this morning, first using the NotebookLM account associated with my personal Chrome profile and what I'm studying in my private life, then using the one I have set up for work, which has a tester notebook full of materials about how to study for the SAT. (I am strict about using different Chrome profiles for various parts of my life and am now up to seven.)\n\nIn my personal account, the button was labeled BETA—and it acted like it. After two failed attempts, NotebookLM could not produce an infographic based on my materials. In my work account, though, the beta label was missing and it performed the function just fine, spitting this out:\n\nThis is rolling out in full functionality to accounts at different times, obviously, but I was glad to see one of mine had easy access because I thought the infographic was solid.\n\nI don't consider myself a visual learner and primarily use NotebookLM to refine ideas or generate educational audio clips I can listen to while I clean the house, so I wasn't expecting to like this. I don't like the mind map creator within NotebookLM at all, for instance; flowcharts just aren't how I learn best, and that's fine.\n\nBut the infographic was concise, engaging, and just detailed enough to keep me interested and looking at it. It's unlikely I'll use this to study or refine my work often, but I can absolutely see how it would be useful to someone who learns more visually, especially if all the lines and boxes of a mind map can get too convoluted to be useful.",

    "description": "Your Pixel 9 Pro's screen needs to be faulty in the \"right way.\"",
    "fullText": "Smartphone display issues are nothing new. Most of us have dropped our phones the wrong way one time or another, and had to deal with the pain (and cost) of getting them fixed. But when your smartphone's screen starts acting up for no particular reason, it's pretty frustrating—especially if the manufacturer still holds you accountable for the repair fees.\n\nIf that sounds like your experience with your Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, or Pixel 9 Pro Fold, there's good news: Google is now launching an Extended Repair Program for the Pixel 9 Pro line. According to Google's announcement on Monday, the company has identified a \"limited number\" of Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL units that might exhibit display issues that impact the user's experience with the device. Should your Pixel 9 Pro's display show these symptoms, Google will fix the display at no cost to you.\n\nThat doesn't mean any and all display issues on your Pixel 9 Pro device qualify here. Google has identified two specific problems that this Extended Repair Program actually covers. The first is a vertical line present on the display. The line has to run from the bottom of the screen to the top, so partial lines won't quality. The second is display flicker. If you notice your Pixel 9 Pro's display quickly getting brighter and darker, as if someone was flicking a switch back and forth, you qualify for the repair program.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Fold is another story altogether. Like the 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL, Google is offering a free repair program for the 9 Pro Fold. However, unlike the other devices, there are no specific issues identified here. The problems may be display-related, but since the company won't specify, you could bring your 9 Pro Fold in for just about anything that's going wrong with it—as long as you didn't cause the issue yourself. In addition, Google won't actually fix your foldable, but will instead replace it entirely.\n\nThe company is also being strict regarding the quality of the display outside of these issues across all Pixel 9 Pro devices. If your Pixel's display or cover-glass is cracked, that may disqualify you from the free repair. If Google finds liquid damage in your device, same story. In any of these cases, the company will still fix the display issues mentioned above, but they might charge you for it.\n\nAffected Pixel 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold units qualify for repair as of Dec. 8, and coverage will last for three years after the original purchase date of the device. You will need to have your device inspected at a Google walk-in center, Google-authorized center, or an online repair store before the company can confirm eligibility. You can get started on your claim from Google's official repair site.\n\nThis is good news for any Pixel 9 Pro users who have these specific issues—or any issues at all for Pixel 9 Pro Fold users. It joins a host of other Extended Repair Programs for Pixel devices, including the Pixel 4a battery program, the Pixel 6a battery program, the Pixel 7a repair program, and the Pixel 8 repair program,",

    "description": "Trolls are shitting all over our internet. You can hardly search for something as innocuous as \"dog\" on Google without coming across inflammatory attacks",
    "fullText": "Trolls are shitting all over our internet. You can hardly search for something as innocuous as “dog” on Google without coming across inflammatory attacks on every possible dog-related opinion under the sun. All horrible things have to crawl before they can walk/crush spirits, though. Even trolls.\n\nAnd while the term “troll” has become wildly muddied, it did have to come from somewhere. We decided to try and find out just where that dark, acerbic origin story began.\n\nThere were bulletin board systems. And Usenet. And newsgroups. And people just starting to realize the massive potential trembling beneath their fingertips. Anything was possible! Which, as it turns out, is not always a good thing.\n\nIn the early 90s, trolls had yet to come into mainstream public consciousness, at least according to the 1993 Big Dummy’s Guide to the Internet. Flame wars, on the other hand, were already an online staple.\n\nWhether or not you’re familiar with the term, you do know what flaming is. You’ve seen it under horrible political opinions on Facebook. You’ve seen it choking your Twitter stream. And you’ve seen it in every other comment in the vast wasteland that is YouTube. Put simply, a flame is a vicious, personal attack on someone made simply because you disagree with them.\n\nOf course, humans have always had this potential for the irrationally vindictive, but the advent of the internet finally allowed it to thrive. Because as soon as you stuck someone behind a computer, a dangerously insular shield of anonymity came down and, for those inclined, happily took over. In discussing the sort of negotiation tactics that precede a flame war, Norman Johnson, an Associate Professor at Bauer College at the University of Houston explains:\n\nThe literature suggests that, compared to face-to-face, the increased incidence of flaming when using computer-mediated communication is due to reductions in the transfer of social cues, which decrease individuals’ concern for social evaluation and fear of social sanctions or reprisals. When social identity and ingroup status are salient, computer mediation can decrease flaming because individuals focus their attention on the social context (and associated norms) rather than themselves.\n\nThe introduction of anonymity not only made users feel free from the repercussions that might otherwise give them pause, but it also dehumanized potential targets. In other words, the internet gave all our worst impulses just what they needed to thrive.\n\nBecause if someone disagreed with you in the real, live social realm, you might feel frustrated, sure, but you’ll also see that person’s as another human with human emotions—not just a jumble of inflammatory words for you to destroy. You’ll take time to reflect, because you’ll realize there are consequences to your actions. Whereas on the internet, a clean slate is a mere username change away.\n\nSome of the earliest flame wars went down on Usenet, which unbeknownst to these earlier warriors, was building a model for all the trolls to eventually come in its wake. According to Gaffin:\n\nPeriodically, an exchange of flames erupts into a flame war that begin to take up all the space in a given newsgroup (and sometimes several; flamers like cross-posting to let the world know how they feel). These can go on for weeks (sometimes they go on for years, in which case they become “holy wars,” usually on such topics as the relative merits of Macintoshes and IBMs). Often, just when they’re dying down, somebody new to the flame war reads all the messages, gets upset and issues an urgent plea that the flame war be taken to e-mail so everybody else can get back to whatever the newsgroup’s business is.\n\nSo presumably, these troll/flame wars all started earnestly. But watching two groups of people attempt to lambast each other in increasingly epic proportions is—as we all know and hate to admit—wildly entertaining. And once the war of words would simmer down, it’s not at all surprising that someone might start (forcefully, sensationalistically) poking and prodding the more tender of egos. All in hopes of revisiting that awful sort of thrill that comes in watching another human push the very boundaries of sanity, by freaking the fuck out.\n\nThe earliest documented form of internet troll was something called a net.weenie, who did what s/he does ”\n just for the hell of it.” In early internet usenet forums, they were the people being assholes simply for the sheer joy of being an asshole. According to the Guide:\n\nThese are the kind of people who enjoy Insulting others, the kind of people who post nasty messages in a sewing newsgroup.\n\nEven the Electronic Frontier Foundation—formed in 1990—was aware of (and acknowledged) net.weenies prevalence among the more public internet groups. In the group’s early internet guide to mailing lists, one of the main benefits of such a system was that “a mailing list can offer a degree of freedom to speak one’s mind (or not worry about net.weenies) that is not necessarily possible on Usenet.” This was, of course, before the sorts of emails in which an undead child’s wrath and/or Nigerian prince’s livelihood rested on the click of our mouse.\n\nAnd net.weenies sound obnoxious, sure, but the term still didn’t carry the sort of malevolence we now associate with modern trolling. In fact, quite the contrary—some of their games were absolutely incredible.\n\nWarlording was a very specific, beautiful type of early trolling performed by these net.weenies, particularly in the alt.fan.warlord newsgroup in Usenet (a sort of subreddit of early internet days). Considering the limitations of early 90s bandwidth and forums’ general readability issues, Usenet etiquette—netiquette, if you will—asked users to keep their signatures under four lines. This was dubbed the McQuary limit and was not a hard and fast rule. At least in the way that there weren’t actually any real character limits.\n\nThis rule was partially necessary due to new users’ predilections for employing what was called BUAGs (Big Ugly ASCII Graphics) and BUAFs (Big Ugly ASCII Fonts). So to both mock this habit and be the biggest assholes they could be (always reach for the stars, kids), net.weenies\n tore this rule apart in a game called warlording.\n\nThe term came from the user\n Death Star, War Lord of the West, “who featured in his sig[nature] a particularly large and obnoxious ASCII graphic resembling the sword of Conan the Barbarian in the 1981 John Milius movie.” Which, presumably, looked something like this:\n\nThe newgroup\n alt.fan.warlord was created as a sort of sarcastic tribute to the offending sigs, and the jokes spiraled from there. One particularly notable case of warlording was that of\n James Parry‘s signature (better know by the username Kibo) below. Bear in mind, this is all one, single sig.\n\nAlthough every part of this signature is brilliant and deserving of our appreciation and awe, I do have a few favorite sections. Namely, this absurd and not at all remotely helpful Twin Peaks chart:\n\nBecause if anything has ever been worthy of being called art, it is the beautiful, intricate, wholly insincere mess.\n\nIn the late 80s and early 90s there certainly did exist this notion of an internet user who merely enjoyed stirring up trouble—but then that person has for as long as humans themselves have existed. As Whitney Phillips, a media studies scholar and communication lecturer at Humboldt State University (who has\n a book on trolls forthcoming with MIT press) explained to us over email:\n\n[Organized, willful trolling did exist before 4chan and Anonymous came around], though at the time it wouldn’t (necessarily) have been called that. This was a point of fascination to many of the trolls I interviewed; while they engaged in similar behaviors in the pre-4chan years, they didn’t refer to their behaviors as trolling and in fact couldn’t remember what they called it, if they called it anything. They’ve since some to use the term retroactively, but at the time the subcultural definition of the term hadn’t yet taken hold, and so they didn’t think of themselves as trolls.\n\nPurportedly, the actual use of the term “troll” dates back to the 80s, but\n according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first instance of the term “troll” being used in an online capacity happened on December 14th, 1992 in the usenet group alt.folklore.urban, when someone wrote “Maybe after I post it, we could go trolling some more and see what happens.”\n\nInterestingly enough, it’s around the time that the actual term “trolling” started gaining steam in the mid 90s that the act itself began to evolve from causing annoyance as a result of your beliefs to simply believing in causing annoyance. And, of course, that’s just a single flavor of trolling—almost as soon as the term came into use, it started morphing into a blanket term of unwieldy proportions.\n\nFor instance, at least in retrospect, Brice Wellington was one of the more notorious troll incarnations. He spent much of his time “in alt.atheism, talk.origins, alt.christnet, and other newsgroups that he [would] troll and spam on a daily basis.” Now, whether his brand of trolling was sincere or satiric becomes a little more difficult to suss out. Usenet users at the time seemed certain that Brice was the “real deal,” so to speak, but in looking at some of his more insane rantings, it’s hard to see him as seeking anything more than what would soon be termed “the lulz.”\n\nHere we have Brice on the French:\n\nWhile Brice may have started blurring the line between being infuriating by nature and being infuriating by sheer force of well, alt.tasteless stepped firmly into the latter territory.\n\nIn a 1994 article with Wired, Usenet user Trashcan Man gave one of the first real insights into the prototypical troll mindset by describing alt.tasteless’ flamewar with the unsuspecting rec.pets.cats, a sort of haven for cat fanciers. In other words, prime bait.\n\nBecause for all intents and purposes, alt.tasteless was simply an early version of 4chan’s now-notorious /b/. As Wired explains:\n\nAlt.tasteless was created in the autumn of 1990 “as a place to keep the sick people away from rec.humor and other forums,” according to Steven Snedker, a Danish journalist for Denmark’s largest computer magazine. “Alt.tastelessers see this as an important turn in Usenet history, on a par with the creation of alt.sex. Both alt.tasteless and alt.sex are fine forums that serve their purpose to keep the other parts of Usenet clean, and to dig further into the stuff discussed.”\n\nWhich is all good and great, but being positively revolting certainly loses some of its appeal when you take away any potential foil. Which is why when someone suggested that alt.tasteless descend upon another Usenet group to incite chaos, the alt.tasteless users were delighted and ultimately decided on the cat newsgroup as a prime target. And alt.tasteless’ opening line was a doozy:\n\n… I’m not what you would call a real studly type guy (although I have a lot of women friends), so when I date it’s really important to me. Anyway, [my cat] Sooti goes into heat something fierce (sometimes it seems like it’s two weeks on, two weeks off). I had a date a while back, when she was really bad. Yowling and presenting all the time – not the most auspicious setting for a date. While dinner was cooking, I tried to stimulate her vagina with a Q-tip because I had heard that one can induce ovulation that way. My date came into the bathroom while I was doing this, and needless to say I don’t think she bought my explanation. The date was a very icy experience after that.\n\nWhat should I do. I love my cats, so I don’t want to get rid of them, but I can’t go on like this any more. It’s my love life, or them. Please help!!!\n\nThe earnest advice from rec.pets.cats was intermixed with decidedly more tasteless (naturally) advice from alt.tasteless including, but not limited to, providing “articles about topics such as vivisecting the cat and having sex with its innards.”\n\nWhich, of course, brings us to 4chan.\n\nFor better or worse, in 2003, 4chan entered the public consciousness and with it brought what Phillips refers to as “a very specific understanding of the term ‘troll,'” explaining in a Daily Dot article that “trolling was something that one actively chose to do. More importantly, a troll was something one chose to be.”\n\n4chan’s /b/ board in particular, being the spiritual successor to alt.tasteless, fostered this toxic mentality that if you don’t actually believe in the horrible things you’re saying that it magically becomes justified. As Phillips explained over email:\n\nGranted, the trolls might not really mean what they say. But who cares, they are not, and should not be regarded, as the ultimate arbiters of meaning. In other words, what these “trolls” think about what they do is irrelevant; even if they say they’re “just trolling,” their actions can have serious real-world consequences for the people they target.\n\nSo, say, when 4chan users found an 11-year-old girl’s address and phone number in 2010 and proceeded to call her home making death threats, it didn’t matter that they were “just doing it for the lulz.” Both that classic, deflective refrain and the term troll itself have succeeded in creating a potentially dangerous emotional distance from the actual consequences words can have—whether it’s trolls self-identifying as such or a media-assigned label. According to Phillips:\n\nI don’t accept the idea that assholes get to be assholes with impunity, as if we live exclusively in their world and there’s nothing we can do about it because “boys will be boys.”\n\nRather than defer blindly to the term “trolling,” I like to label behaviors based on what they do in the world. So, if someone is engaging in misogynist behavior, even if they believe they’re “just trolling” (whatever dude), that’s misogyny. And if that person doesn’t like the word misogynist, if that label makes them cry hot tears and feel bad about themselves, then how about not behaving like a misogynist.\n\nBecause even though the term may have gained notoriety on 4chan, the concept—however you may choose to define it—of “trolling” is more mainstream today than it has ever been.\n\nSearch “trolls” on Google and you’ll be hit with a deluge of articles defining the term in any number of ways. Whether it’s being defined as someone who believes what they’re saying in earnest, just wants to stir the pot, or is merely hopping on board a rage bandwagon—any rage bandwagon!—the only common thread is malicious intent. Which, according to Phillips, presents a major problem:\n\nCalling behaviors designed to threaten, intimidate, and silence “trolling” (so, lumping ALL aggressive online behavior under the same umbrella term) risks minimizing the emotional impact of the most extreme behaviors, particularly when those behaviors are piled on as viciously and relentlessly as they have been throughout Gamergate.\n\nClearly, for as long as the internet has been around, trolls have existed in some form—whether they were called that or not. There will always be agitators. There will always be people who want upset others. That’s not going to change.\n\nWhat we can change, though, is how we approach these situations in all their varied forms. Which, according to Phillips, “depends on whose voices platform administrators, advertisers, and other people on the business end choose to privilege—the targets of abusive, intimidating behaviors or those who are doing the intimidating.”\n\nIt’s not an issue of “feeding the trolls” (a problematic phrase in its own right), but rather whether or not we’re going to stop giving a platform to the trolls, the aggressors, and the antagonizers. Whether it be by not validating their behavior with concessions or dropping the catch-all term “troll” in favor of more accurate terminology—be it misogynist, sociopath, or straight-up dick.\n\nSo yes, assholes have and will always be around, as will their unfortunate victims. It’s just a matter of who we let hold the megaphone.",

    "fullText": "European Commission to assess whether Gemini owner is putting rival companies at a disadvantage\n\nThe EU has opened an investigation to assess whether Google is breaching European competition rules in its use of online content from publishers and YouTube creators for artificial intelligence.\n\nThe European Commission said on Tuesday it will examine whether the US tech company, which runs the Gemini AI model and is owned by Alphabet, is putting rival AI owners at a “disadvantage”.\n\n“The investigation will notably examine whether Google is distorting competition by imposing unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators, or by granting itself privileged access to such content, thereby placing developers of rival AI models at a disadvantage,” the commission said.\n\nIt said it was concerned that Google may have used content from web publishers to generate AI-powered services on its search results pages without appropriate compensation to publishers and without offering them the possibility to refuse such use of their content.\n\nThe commission said it was also concerned as to whether Google has used content uploaded to YouTube to train its own generative AI models without offering creators compensation or the possibility to refuse.\n\n“Content creators uploading videos on YouTube have an obligation to grant Google permission to use their data for different purposes, including for training generative AI models,” the commission said.\n\nGoogle does not pay YouTube content creators for their content, nor does it allow them to upload their content on YouTube without allowing Google to use such data, it said. The commission noted that rival developers of AI models are barred by YouTube policies from using YouTube content to train their own AI models.\n\nGoogle-owned YouTube says its terms and conditions allow Google to use creators’ work for making AI models. In September, YouTube said: “We use content uploaded to YouTube to improve the product experience for creators and viewers across YouTube and Google, including through machine learning and AI applications.”\n\nThe EU’s competition chief, Teresa Ribera, said: “AI is bringing remarkable innovation and many benefits for people and businesses across Europe, but this progress cannot come at the expense of the principles at the heart of our societies.”\n\nA spokesperson for Google said: “This complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever.\n\n“Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.”\n\nThe EU’s investigation is the latest in a series of challenges to US big tech companies in recent years.\n\nIn September, EU regulators issued a fine of almost €3bn (£2.6bn) against Google, claiming that it favoured its own digital advertising services over rivals. Donald Trump said the fine was “discriminatory”.\n\nElon Musk’s social media company X, formerly known as Twitter, was fined €120m by EU tech regulators last week for breaching online content rules. The breaches included what the EU said was a “deceptive” blue tick verification badge given to users and the lack of transparency of the platform’s advertising.\n\nThe fine also attracted criticism from US officials, including the secretary of state Marco Rubio, who wrote on X that the fine was “an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments”.\n\nThe European Commission opened an investigation earlier this year into Meta over its rollout of AI features on WhatsApp, its messaging platform. Last year it fined Meta €798m for abusive practices benefiting Facebook Marketplace.\n\nIn 2024, Apple lost a fight against an order by EU competition regulators to pay €13bn in back taxes to Ireland.\n\nLast month, the head of Google’s parent company said people should not “blindly trust” everything AI tools tell them.\n\nSundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, said AI models were “prone to errors” and urged people to use them alongside other tools. He also warned that no company would be immune if the AI bubble burst.",

    "description": "Hoffman, the billionaire LinkedIn cofounder, said he visited Epstein's island as part of his work fundraising for MIT.",
    "fullText": "Reid Hoffman said he once spent a night on Epstein's island in connection with MIT fundraising efforts.\n\nThe LinkedIn cofounder told the Newcomer podcast that he had been told a visit would make Epstein more likely to donate.\n\nHoffman has previously apologized publicly for his interactions with Epstein.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said he wishes he'd known a little more before agreeing to spend a night on Jeffrey Epstein's island.\n\nOn the Dec. 1 episode of Eric Newcomer's podcast, Hoffman said that he visited the island as part of his fundraising work for the MIT Foundation and was told the visit would make Epstein more likely to donate to MIT.\n\n\"Note to self: Google before going,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. He said he stayed on the island for one night, and that there was a pool, a \"bunch of guest rooms,\" and a courtyard.\n\nHoffman has maintained that he only interacted with Epstein, whose 2019 death while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges was ruled a suicide, through his work fundraising for the MIT Media Lab. On the \"Newcomer\" podcast, he called Epstein a \"masterful networker,\" and recalled a 2015 dinner he hosted for an MIT researcher in Palo Alto, California.\n\nHoffman said that Joi Ito, former director of the MIT Media Lab, asked him if Epstein could attend the dinner, which was also attended by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

    "description": "Hoffman, the billionaire LinkedIn cofounder, said he visited Epstein's island as part of his work fundraising for MIT.",
    "fullText": "LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said he wishes he'd known a little more before agreeing to spend a night on Jeffrey Epstein's island.\n\nOn the Dec. 1 episode of Eric Newcomer's podcast, Hoffman said that he visited the island as part of his fundraising work for the MIT Foundation and was told the visit would make Epstein more likely to donate to MIT.\n\n\"Note to self: Google before going,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. He said he stayed on the island for one night, and that there was a pool, a \"bunch of guest rooms,\" and a courtyard.\n\nHoffman has maintained that he only interacted with Epstein, whose 2019 death while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges was ruled a suicide, through his work fundraising for the MIT Media Lab. On the \"Newcomer\" podcast, he called Epstein a \"masterful networker,\" and recalled a 2015 dinner he hosted for an MIT researcher in Palo Alto, California.\n\nHoffman said that Joi Ito, former director of the MIT Media Lab, asked him if Epstein could attend the dinner, which was also attended by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Similar to his visit to the island, Hoffman said he was later told that the financier had said he was more likely to donate if he attended the dinner.\n\n\"He's kind of going through the network, trying to meet people and so forth,\" Hoffman said on the podcast.

    "fullText": "Google phones keep offering great value for the money, dropping in price very quickly after their release, including the latest Pixel. The Google Pixel 10, with the 128GB going for $599 (originally $799) and the 256GB for $699 (originally $899), are both at record low prices right now, according to price-tracking tools.\n\nThe Google Pixel 10 is the latest in the series to be released this year, back in September. It's the model under the Pixel 10 Pro, which is also at its lowest price right now and has a much faster chip. As Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt says in her review, the Pixel 10 features a telephoto lens, brings the Pixelsnap (Google's version of MagSafe), and has new AI features. However, the ultrawide lens gets weaker, and there are some problems with the chip for third-party apps (but it can be fixed).\n\nThis Pixel 10 has a lot of the same features you'll find in the Pixel Pro for $150 less, making it a great budget option for those who don't want or need all the fancy specs and features. It comes with a Google Tensor G5 chip, and the camera resolutions are 48MP, 13MP, and 10.8MP for the rear and 10.5MP for the front-facing one. You can expect about 24 hours of battery life, depending on your use.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Pixel phones is the ongoing support for many years. My Pixel 6A still gets all of the updates and tons of AI features that make the phone feel fresh many years later, with the latest ones dropping in September. With the Pixel 10, you'll be getting a quality phone with software updates for a while (as long as seven years).",

    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary.\n\nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",
