    "description": "Take your route planning to the next level.",
    "fullText": "Google Maps is the only navigation service I use, and I've learned many of its tricks over the years. The default settings do a good enough job for most people, but it's worth reviewing all of its features to ensure that you're getting exactly what you need. For instance, avoiding tolls may be great where you live, but if you're driving in a different state or country, that same feature could land you in some serious trouble. These tips will help you make the most of Google Maps' many features, and reduce the chances of losing your way while using the app.\n\nEven if you ignore everything else in this article, don't ignore this. I've observed that, sometimes, Google Maps automatically enables route options I did not select, which can lead to some sticky situations. Whenever I'm on a long road trip to unknown destinations, I like to double-check route settings before I head out. To do this, tap the profile icon in the top-right corner in the Google Maps app, and go to Settings > Navigation > Route options. This has four options: Avoid tolls, Avoid highways, Avoid ferries, and Prefer fuel-efficient routes. I like to disable all of these to ensure that I reach my destination safely and quickly.\n\nIf you're in an area you know fairly well, you can enable some of these options to find a cheaper route, or one with less traffic. But in unfamiliar territory, I prefer to play it safe.\n\nI often travel to places with poor or no cellular signal, and Google Maps' offline mode has been a lifesaver in these locations. It lets you download Google Maps data for specific locations, and I've set up the app to automatically download and update this data when new information becomes available. This makes it a lot easier to navigate when the internet disappears.\n\nYou can easily do this by searching for a destination on Google Maps and swiping left on the controls that appear below its name. Tap More > Download offline map > Download to save it for offline use. To automatically update offline maps, go to your Google maps settings and select Offline. Now hit the gear icon in the top-right corner and select Auto-update offline maps.\n\nGoogle Maps shows you better search results and improves recommendations for fuel-efficient routes if you choose the correct type of vehicle. Go to your Google Maps settings and navigate to Your vehicles. Select the correct engine type for your vehicle to ensure better recommendations. If you're using an EV, you can also use this page to set the type of charger it uses. This helps Google Maps send you to compatible EV charging stations when you're out and about.\n\nIf you often stream music while driving, you should consider connecting your streaming accounts with Google Maps, which supports both Apple Music and Spotify. Once you've connected the navigation app with either of these services, you'll be able to control music playback and choose playlists from your library, all without leaving the Google Maps app. I don't recommend looking at your phone when you're driving, but you can use this feature to control playback or quickly change songs while your car's stopped. It's a lot faster than switching to a different app to change music.\n\nSome of you will prefer to use voice assistants to do this, but on an iPhone in particular, I haven't had much luck with using Siri to change music. That's why I've connected my streaming accounts to Google Maps instead.\n\nGoogle Maps can highlight accessibility information for you. This can be extremely helpful if you're traveling with people who have mobility challenges or are living with disabilities. I never thought much about these options until I started traveling with my senior citizen parents, who can no longer climb lots of stairs or stand for long hours. That's why I went to the Google Maps settings, navigated to App & display, and enabled Emphasize accessibility info. This feature prominently shows if a destination has accessible entrances, seating, reserved parking spots, and if restrooms are available (and accessible), etc.\n\nNote that this information isn't always accurate, so if accessibility is your top priority, I still recommend calling ahead to confirm if your destination's accessible features are available and in working order. Similarly, when you're using walking directions to get somewhere, try tapping the options button, which is next to the share icon. This will reveal the Trip options page, where you can select Wheelchair accessible to avoid routes with stairs and choose ones that have elevators instead.\n\nI use Google Maps a lot while I'm walking around, and I have a few tips to make it easier to find where you're going. The first is to use Google Maps when you're wearing an Apple Watch or an Android smartwatch, if you have one. Google Maps buzzes your watch when you have a direction coming up, and you can quickly look at the watch to see which way to go. With this, I don't have to keep looking at my phone for directions. This approach worked really well on a recent trip to Singapore in rainy weather, where it wasn't always possible to keep looking at my phone while also holding my water bottle and umbrella.\n\nYou can also use Live View to get even more detailed walking directions. It uses your phone's camera to identify shops, signs, and other landmarks near you. Then, it gives you directions in a camera view, which is like a live video walkthrough taking you to your destination. This makes it great for navigating indoors, like in airports or malls.\n\nWhen you review listings on Google Maps, or make other contributions, others may be able to view your profile and all your ratings, reviews, photos, and other contributions. If you don't want this information to be visible, you can make your profile private on Google Maps. To do this, go to Google Maps settings > Location & privacy > Profile and enable Restricted profile.\n\nGoogle Maps also keeps track of all the places you've visited, and not everyone is comfortable storing that data on Google's servers. Now, I should say that this information is legitimately useful sometimes. Once, a friend's car was wrongly sent a speeding ticket from a different state. He was able to use his Google Maps timeline data to prove to law enforcement that he was, in fact, not in that state at the time.\n\nHaving said that, you'll be able to better preserve your privacy by not storing this information in the first place. To do that, go to Google Maps settings > Location & privacy. Review all the options in the Timeline section to see what fits your preferences. I've switched off Timeline entirely, and I also chose Delete all Timeline data, but your needs may be different, so you may choose to delete a specific range of timeline data or automatically delete it after a certain period of time instead.\n\nTo delete your search history from Google Maps, scroll down on this page and select Maps history.\n\nIf deleting your Google Maps data permanently isn't the ideal solution for you, then you may want to try incognito mode instead. This works exactly like it does in web browsers, meaning that it won't save your Google Maps data as long as you're in that mode. You can enable it by tapping the profile icon in Google Maps and selecting Turn on incognito mode. You can check if it's enabled by looking at the profile icon, where your picture will be replaced by the incognito icon.\n\nIf you have trouble remembering all of the trips you want to take, you can quickly save your favorites in Google Maps, and add them to various lists. For instance, if you're planning a trip to Florida and you want to save all of the destinations you've heard about in one spot, you can look for each one individually on Google Maps and hit the Save button on their listings. This lets you save the destination to a new list, where you can keep a tab on all the places you want to go to. You can also share these lists with others, and everyone can add the places they're interested in to your list, too. I used this feature during my London trip last year, where I bookmarked restaurants that served authentic fare from around the world. It allowed me to taste food that I'd never tried before, and helped me better organize my daily plan to fit a couple of museums or other attractions around my meals.",

    "title": "A gRPC Transport for the Model Context Protocol",
    "description": "An alternative to MCP transcoding is gRPC, and Google Cloud is working with MCP maintainers to support pluggable transports in the MCP SDK.",
    "fullText": "Our most intelligent model is now available on Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise\n\nAI agents are moving from test environments to the core of enterprise operations, where they must interact reliably with external tools and systems to execute complex, multi-step goals. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the standard that makes this agent to tool communication possible. In fact, just last month we announced the release of fully-managed, remote MCP servers. Developers can now simply point their AI agents or standard MCP clients like Gemini CLI to a globally-consistent and enterprise-ready endpoint for Google and Google Cloud services.\n\nMCP uses JSON-RPC as its standard transport. This brings many benefits as it combines an action-oriented approach with natural language payloads that can be directly relayed by agents in their communication with foundational models. Yet many organizations rely on gRPC, a high-performance, open source implementation of the remote procedure call (RPC) model. Enterprises that have adopted the gRPC framework must adapt their tooling to be compatible with the JSON-RPC transport used by MCP. Today, these enterprises need to deploy transcoding gateways to translate between JSON-RPC MCP requests and their existing gRPC-based services.\n\nAn interesting alternative to MCP transcoding is to use gRPC as the native transport for MCP. Many gRPC users are actively experimenting with this option by implementing their own custom MCP servers. At Google Cloud, we use gRPC extensively to enable services and offer APIs at a global scale, and we’re committed to sharing the technology and expertise that has resulted from this pervasive use of gRPC. Specifically, we’re committed to supporting gRPC practitioners in their journey to adopt MCP in production, and we’re actively working with the MCP community to explore mechanisms to support gRPC as a transport for MCP. The MCP core maintainers have arrived at an agreement to support pluggable transports in the MCP SDK, and in the near future, Google Cloud will contribute and distribute a gRPC transport package to be plugged into the MCP SDKs. A community-backed transport package will enable gRPC practitioners to deploy MCP with gRPC in a consistent and interoperable manner.\n\nThe native use of gRPC as a transport avoids the need for transcoding and helps maintain operational consistency for environments that are actively using gRPC. In the rest of this post, we explore the benefits of using gRPC as a native transport for MCP and how Google Cloud is supporting this journey.\n\nFor organizations already using gRPC for their services, native gRPC support allows them to continue to use their existing tooling to access services via MCP without altering the services or implementing transcoding proxies. These organizations are on a journey to keep the benefits of gRPC as MCP becomes the mechanism for agents to access services.\n\n“Because gRPC is our standard protocol in the backend, we have invested in experimental support for MCP over gRPC internally. And we already see the benefits: ease of use and familiarity for our developers, and reducing the work needed to build MCP servers by using the structure and statically typed APIs.” -  Stefan Särne, Senior Staff Engineer and Tech Lead for Developer Experience, Spotify\n\nUsing gRPC as a native transport aligns MCP with the best practices of modern gRPC-based distributed systems, improving performance, security, operations, and developer productivity.\n\nThe performance advantages of gRPC provide a big boost in efficiency, thanks to the following attributes:\n\nBinary encoding (protocol buffers): gRPC uses protocol buffers (Protobufs) for binary encoding, shrinking message sizes by up to 10x compared to JSON. This means less bandwidth consumption and faster serialization/deserialization, which translates to lower latency for tool calls, reduced network costs, and a much smaller resource footprint.\n\nFull duplex bidirectional streaming: gRPC natively supports the client (the agent) and the server (the tool), sending continuous data streams to each other simultaneously over a single, persistent connection. This feature is a game-changer for agent-tool interaction, opening the door to truly interactive, real-time agentic workflows without requiring application-level connection synchronization.\n\nBuilt-in flow control (backpressure): gRPC includes native flow control to prevent a fast-sending tool from overwhelming the agent.\n\nEnterprise-grade security and authorization\n\ngRPC treats security as a first-class citizen, with enterprise-grade features built directly into its core, including:\n\nMutual TLS (mTLS): Critical for Zero Trust architectures, mTLS authenticates both the client and the gRPC-powered server, preventing spoofing and helping to ensure only trusted services communicate.\n\nStrong authentication: gRPC offers native hooks for integrating with industry-standard token-based authentication (JWT/OAuth), providing verifiable identity for every AI agent.\n\nMethod-level authorization: You can enforce authorization policies directly on specific RPC methods or MCP tools (e.g., an agent is authorized to ReadFile but not DeleteFile), helping to ensure strict adherence to the principle of least privilege and combating \"excessive agency.\"\n\nOperational maturity and developer productivity\n\ngRPC provides a powerful, integrated solution that helps offload resiliency measures and improves developer productivity through extensibility and reusability. Some of its capabilities include:\n\nUnified observability: Native integration with distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) and structured error codes provides a complete, auditable trail of every tool call. Developers can trace a single user prompt through every subsequent microservice interaction.\n\nRobust resiliency: Features like deadlines, timeouts, and automatic flow control prevent a single unresponsive tool from causing system-wide failures. These features allow a client to specify a policy for a tool call that the framework automatically cancels if exceeded, preventing a cascading failure.\n\nPolyglot development: gRPC generates code for 11+ languages, allowing developers to implement MCP Servers in the best language for the job while maintaining a consistent, strongly-typed contract.\n\nSchema-based input validation: Protobuf's strict typing mitigates injection attacks and simplifies the development task by rejecting malformed inputs at the serialization layer.\n\nError handling and metadata: The framework provides a standardized set of error codes (e.g., UNAVAILABLE, PERMISSION_DENIED) for reliable client handling, and clients can send and receive out-of-band information as key-value pairs in metadata (e.g., for tracing IDs) without cluttering the main request.\n\nAs a founding member of the Agentic AI Foundation and a core contributor to the MCP specification, Google Cloud, along with other members of the community, has championed the inclusion of pluggable transport interfaces in the MCP SDK. Participate and communicate your interest in having gRPC as a transport for MCP:",

    "title": "Pentagon is embracing Grok AI chatbot as it draws global outcry",
    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s AI engine inside the Pentagon network.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military’s data as possible into the developing technology.\n\n“Very soon we will have the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,” Hegseth said in a speech at Musk’s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.’s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.\n\nHegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would “make all appropriate data” from the military’s IT systems available for “AI exploitation.” He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.\n\nHegseth’s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.\n\nThe Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.\n\nDuring his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, “We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.”\n\nHe noted that the Pentagon possesses “combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.”\n\n“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we’re going to make sure that it’s there,” Hegseth said.\n\nThe defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models “that won’t allow you to fight wars.”\n\nHegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,” before adding that the Pentagon’s “AI will not be woke.”\n\nMusk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called “woke AI” interactions from rival chatbots like Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to questions about the issues with Grok.",

    "fullText": "After Apple chose Gemini to power Siri, Alphabet surpassed Apple to become second-most valuable company in world\n\nGoogle’s parent company hit a major financial milestone on Monday, reaching a $4tn valuation for the first time and surpassing Apple to become the second-most valuable company in the world.\n\nAlphabet is the fourth company to hit the $4tn milestone after Nvidia, which later hit $5tn, Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe spike in share price comes after Apple announced it had chosen Google’s Gemini AI model to power a major overhaul of the iPhone maker’s digital assistant Siri, which comes installed in every iPhone. Neither company disclosed how much the deal was worth.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,” Apple said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nAs tech stocks continue a years-long meteoric rise, fears of a bubble in the stock market persist; however, Wall Street’s excitement for new avenues of investment in AI does as well. Alphabet’s milestones signal a remarkable change in investor sentiment for Alphabet, with its stock surging about 65% in 2025, outperforming its peers on Wall Street’s elite group of stocks, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”.\n\nThe tech giant has allayed investors’ doubts about its artificial intelligence strategy in recent months with a series of high-profile product launches, including the latest version of its flagship AI model, Gemini, and the popular Nano Banana image generator and editor. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and Google’s insurgent rival, left investors and consumers underwhelmed with the release of its latest model, GPT-5, which allowed Alphabet to surge ahead.\n\nGoogle, best known for making the world’s most popular search engine and browser, has also turned its once-overlooked cloud unit into a major growth engine, which drew a rare tech investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Google Cloud’s revenue jumped 34% in the third quarter, with a backlog of non-recognized sales contracts rising to $155bn. Renting out Google’s self-developed AI chips that were reserved for internal use to outside customers has also enabled the unit’s breakneck pace of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company’s dominant revenue generator – the advertising business, driven by Google Search and YouTube – has largely held steady in the face of economic uncertainty and intense competition.\n\nThe company has faced two landmark US antitrust suits as it has navigated its place in the AI boom. After Google lost the first case, a judge ruled in September against breaking up the company, allowing it to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.\n\nIn the second case, a judge ruled Google had illegally monopolized the online ad market last April. A trial over how to remedy the monopoly began in September, which could see the judge forcing Google to divest parts of its lucrative ads business to foster competition.",

    "description": "Apple’s AI Siri is planned for this year, and it'll use Google Gemini.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly two years since Apple announced a more intelligent Siri, and yet, we're still waiting to get our hands on it. Aside from being able to answer a few questions about Apple products or shunt your questions off to ChatGPT for you, the voice assistant is essentially still the same it was before Apple Intelligence launched for other Apple features in iOS 18.1. Now, the iPhone maker seems to be throwing in the towel on developing an AI-enabled Siri entirely on its own, and is asking Google for help. I can't imagine Tim Cook is too happy about that, but on the flip side, that does mean an AI Siri might finally come out, and soon.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC's Jim Cramer, Apple admitted that it is now planning to use Google Gemini to power its AI-infused Siri, rather than purely in-house models. The company said that, \"After careful evaluation, we determined that Google's technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we're excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users.\"\n\nPreviously, Apple had promised that its AI Siri would be able to do tasks on your behalf, like send a drafted email, or would be able to answer questions using context pulled from your phone, like surfacing a friend's address using information pulled from a text thread. Reportedly, however, implementing these features during testing kept breaking more traditional Siri features, like setting alarms and reminders, which has kept sending Apple back to the drawing board. The new, Gemini-powered voice assistant for Android faced similar issues at first, but based on my hands-on time with the company's latest phones, those growing pains seem to have subsided, so it makes sense that Google would be the first company Apple would turn to while looking for outside help.\n\nApple hasn't said too much more about the deal for now, but Google itself did step in to offer Apple users a bit more clarity, plus some reassurance about their data.\n\nIn a statement on X, the company assured Apple users that \"Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\" That's the same deal Apple has with OpenAI right now, which allows its users to ask ChatGPT questions without the AI being able to train on them or keep a log of their requests. It essentially means Google won't get any data from your AI-powered Siri. Google's statement also confirmed a detail from CNBC's initial article, stating that its agreement with Apple will be a multi-year deal.\n\nPerhaps most exciting is that Google said the AI-powered Siri will come out \"this year,\" mirroring a statement an Apple spokesperson gave to Daring Fireball last March, admitting that an AI-enabled Siri was taking longer than anticipated and saying the company hoped to launch it in 2026. That's welcome relief to anyone who thought Apple had given up on the project.\n\nA more concrete timeline is still unknown, although Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, a reputable reporter with inside sources at Apple, has previously said to expect the AI Siri upgrade to launch in the spring. Personally, I could also see the company holding the launch until its annual WWDC event, which tends to happen in June.\n\nDespite Apple and Google's public feud as the makers of iOS and Android, respectively, this wouldn't mark the two companies' first time working together, especially in the mobile space. Previously, it was uncovered that Google and Apple have a lucrative deal to make Google the default search engine in Safari, which caused a lengthy legal battle that ultimately allowed the companies to maintain their deal, but barred exclusivity contracts. Part of the reasoning behind the AI Siri delay might be that the companies wanted to work together on AI before, but were holding off on it out of an abundance of caution. However, according to the courts, Google will also be able to make deals with outside distributors for \"preloading and placement\" of its GenAI products going forward, which seemingly puts both companies in the clear.",

Nestled in the foothills of Silicon Valley, the school has long functioned as a launchpad for tech’s elite.\n\nBut the rise of artificial intelligence is challenging long-held assumptions about the value of higher education. As tech reshapes entry-level work and companies rethink traditional hiring pipelines, the payoff of a four-year degree—especially from elite institutions—is increasingly up for debate.\n\nStill, Brin doesn’t regret his own academic path. Speaking to Stanford engineering students last month, he said his decision to study computer science was not driven by a fixation on credentials.\n\n“I chose computer science because I had a passion for it,” he said. “It was kind of a no-brainer for me. I guess you could say I was also lucky because I was also in such a transformative field.”\n\nEven in an era when AI can write code, Brin cautioned students against chasing—or abandoning—fields of study based solely on automation fears.\n\n“I wouldn’t go off and switch to comparative literature because you think the AI is good at coding,” he said. “The AI is probably even better at comparative literature, just to be perfectly honest anyway.”\n\nBrin met Google cofounder Larry Page in 1994 during his second year of graduate studies at Stanford. Together they developed PageRank, an algorithm they later renamed Google and would become a company in 1998.\n\nGoogle’s hiring practices today reflect how dramatically the industry has shifted. The tech giant is now embracing workers without college degrees.\n\n“In as much as we’ve hired a lot of academic stars, we’ve hired tons of people who don’t have bachelor’s degrees,” Brin said. “They just figure things out on their own in some weird corner.”\n\nBetween 2017 and 2022, the share of job postings at Google requiring a degree dropped from 93% to 77%, according to analysis from the Burning Glass Institute. And Google isn’t alone: companies including Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco have reduced degree requirements in recent years, signaling a broader industry shift toward skills-based hiring.\n\nThat’s forcing a broader reckoning over what a degree actually signals and whether it’s still a reliable proxy for talent.\n\n“I don’t think necessarily because you go to an Ivy League school or have great grades it means you’re going to be a great worker or great person,” said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in 2024. For many roles, skills matter far more than credentials, he added: “If you look at skills of people, it is amazing how skilled people are in something, but it didn’t show up in their resume.”",

    "fullText": "Jan 12 (Reuters) - Apple will use Google's Gemini models for its revamped Siri coming later this year under a multi-year deal that deepens the tech giants' alliance in the ​artificial intelligence era and bolsters Alphabet's position in the race against OpenAI.\n\nThe deal announced Monday marks a major ‌vote of confidence for Google. Its technology already drives much of Samsung's \"Galaxy AI,\" but the Siri deal unlocks a large market with Apple's installed base ‌of more than two billion active devices.\n\n\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,\" Google said, adding that its models will also power other future Apple Intelligence features.\n\nAlphabet has been jostling with OpenAI for the Apple deal, the financial details of which were not disclosed.\n\nThe iPhone maker had in late 2024 rolled out ChatGPT into its ⁠devices, allowing the company's Siri voice assistant ‌to tap into the chatbot's expertise to answer complicated questions.\n\nApple said there were no major changes to the ChatGPT integration at the time, while OpenAI did not respond to Reuters' request for ‍comment.\n\n\"This seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, given that (they) also have Android and Chrome,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nMusk founded his own AI firm xAI that has been trying to compete with other major players ​in the industry by building foundational models and spending billions on massive infrastructure.\n\nMonday's tie-up will likely raise questions on OpenAI's ‌partnership with Apple. In response to Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman late last year reportedly issued a \"code red\" to push teams to accelerate development.\n\n\"Apple's decision to use Google's Gemini models for Siri shifts OpenAI into a more supporting role, with ChatGPT remaining positioned for complex, opt-in queries rather than the default intelligence layer,\" said Parth Talsania, CEO of Equisights Research.\n\nGoogle has been firing on all cylinders to counter OpenAI's early lead in the industry by doubling down on frontier models, and ⁠image and video generation.\n\nApple has faced a series of setbacks on the ​AI front after being late to the race, with Siri's upgrade getting ​delayed, top-level executive changes and the initial rollout of its generative AI tools being met with lukewarm reception.\n\nThe latest agreement builds on a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on ‍Apple devices - a lucrative arrangement that ⁠drives traffic for Google while generating tens of billions in annual revenue for Apple.",

    "fullText": "The “more intelligent” version of Siri that Apple plans to release later this year will be backed by Google’s Gemini language models, the company announced today. CNBC reports that the deal is part of a “multi-year partnership” between Apple and Google that will allow Apple to use Google’s AI models in its own software.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” reads an Apple statement given to CNBC.\n\nToday’s announcement confirms Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reporting late last year that Apple and Google were nearing a deal. Apple didn’t disclose terms, but Gurman said that Apple would be paying Google “about $1 billion a year” for access to its AI models “following an extensive evaluation period.”\n\nBloomberg has also reported that the Gemini model would be run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers, “ensuring that user data remains walled off from Google’s infrastructure,” and that Apple still hopes to improve its own in-house language models to the point that they can eventually be used instead of relying on third-party models.\n\nAlthough Apple’s iPhones and iOS compete with Google’s Android operating system and the many smartphones that use it, the companies still cooperate in plenty of other areas. Google has paid Apple billions of dollars to remain the default search engine in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (though that deal has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years).\n\nApple’s announcement is a blow to OpenAI and the many versions of its ChatGPT model, which Apple has used elsewhere in iOS and macOS. Bloomberg reports that Apple also tested OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude models before deciding to go with Gemini. ChatGPT came out ahead of Gemini in tests that Ars ran using earlier versions of the models, but Google’s models have apparently improved enough (and amassed enough users) to worry OpenAI; CEO Sam Altman declared a “code red” last month and pushed back several planned ChatGPT features so that the company could better respond to Google’s Gemini 3 release.\n\nApple originally promised the improved, AI-powered Siri for 2024’s iOS 18 release, but ultimately delayed the feature because it didn’t work reliably enough. The new version of Siri should arrive in an update to iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 Tahoe later this year.",

Last week, the company overtook Apple as the second most valuable company behind Nvidia.\n\nSpeculation of a potential deal has been circulating since last year. Bloomberg reported in November that Apple was considering paying $1 billion a year to use the Gemini model.\n\n\"This is what the Street has been waiting for with the elephant in the room for Cupertino revolving around its invisible AI strategy,\" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note on Monday morning, referring to Apple's Cupertino headquarters, \"but we believe this is an incremental positive to both AAPL and GOOGL as a major validation moment for Google as a premier foundation model and for Apple as a stepping stone to accelerate its AI strategy into 2026 and beyond.\"\n\nApple had a head start in the AI assistant race when it launched Siri on its iOS devices in 2011.\n\nHowever, the iPhone maker has lagged behind the competition following the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Apple has delayed several upgrades to Siri, and Apple shook up its AI division late last year.\n\nFor Google, integration with the leading mobile phone platform in the US is yet another distribution advantage. In addition to being available via a stand-alone app, Gemini powers some Google search features, and it's also the default AI assistant on the company's Pixel smartphones.\n\nThomas Hudson, a VP principal analyst at the research firm Forrester, told Business Insider that the deal could \"look counterintuitive\" given Apple and Google compete in the smartphone market.\n\nHowever, he pointed to Google's long-running deal to make it the default search engine on Apple's iPhones as an example of how the pair have partnered before. In December, a federal judge ordered Google to limit search and AI app contracts to a one-year term.",

    "fullText": "A Google AI product manager's career advice is unexpectedly crustacean.\n\nMarily Nika, who has worked in AI product roles for over a decade, said in an episode of \"The Growth Podcast\" by Aakash Gupta published Sunday that aspiring product managers should \"be like crabs.\"\n\n\"That means that you need to move adjacent to what you've been doing,\" Nika said, adding that one's past experience is a competitive advantage.\n\nNika shared the example of a student in her AI product management boot camp who worked in the hearing aid industry and felt stuck and closed off from the tech industry. The student believed he was in a \"completely different domain\" and didn't see a clear path into product management, she said.\n\nNika encouraged him to look more closely at how his experience could translate. When they checked Apple's careers site, they found an opening for a product manager working on AirPods — a role where expertise in hearing could be relevant.\n\n\"We need to be open-minded. We really need to bring in the previous experience we have because that's gonna set us apart,\" Nika said.\n\nNika also provided another example involving a sports journalist who sought to transition into an AI product manager role in sports. Rather than being afraid of lacking a traditional product résumé, Nika advised him to lean into his domain expertise. Product skills can be learned, but a deep understanding of users and industries is harder to replace, she said.\n\nNika said becoming \"AI literate\" is now essential for product managers.\n\n\"Understand the unique intricacies that AI brings, understand how dependent we are on data,\" she said, describing how AI has become an expectation for the role.\n\nAspiring product managers should also understand \"what goes behind coding,\" like knowing what APIs are and how products are shipped.\n\nOther tech leaders and workers echo the same message.\n\nA vice president of product and growth for AI products at Dropbox told Business Insider last year that product managers should familiarize themselves with new AI tools, including vibe coding tools that enable non-coders to quickly prototype ideas.\n\nInstead of spending time writing documents, product managers can use AI tools to build lightweight prototypes to test ideas early, he said. This can help \"accelerate how they think about developing their taste, developing their craft, and understanding what makes sense in physical products,\" he added.\n\nA senior product manager at Microsoft told Business Insider in December that product managers will increasingly be expected to use AI to work faster. He said AI tools helped him draft work documents, summarize information, and generate suggestions for approaching product management problems.",

    "description": "Sergey Brin is joining his Google co-founder, Larry Page, in reducing ties to the state where they built their fortunes.",
    "fullText": "For nearly three decades, Google has been steeped in the lore of Silicon Valley.\n\nLarry Page and Sergey Brin, two Stanford University graduate students, created the search engine in 1998 and built the start-up out of a friend’s garage in Menlo Park, Calif. Over time, Google became a nearly $4 trillion juggernaut, helping to cement the Northern California region as the global epicenter of the internet industry.\n\nNow, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page are cutting some ties with the state where they made their fortunes.\n\nIn the 10 days before Christmas, an entity connected to Mr. Brin, 52, terminated or moved 15 California limited liability companies that oversee some of his business interests and investments out of the state, according to documents seen by The New York Times. Seven of the companies — including those that appear to manage one of Mr. Brin’s superyachts and his interest in a private air terminal at San Jose’s international airport — were converted into Nevada entities.\n\nMr. Brin is joining Mr. Page, 52, in reducing his California presence. More than 45 California limited liability companies associated with Mr. Page filed documents last month to either become inactive or move out of the state, according to state records. A trust with ties to Mr. Page also purchased a $71.9 million mansion in Miami’s Coconut Grove neighborhood this week, according to a deed seen by The Times.\n\nAnother entity jointly managed by Mr. Brin and Mr. Page moved out of California and to Nevada on Christmas Eve, according to a filing seen by The Times.\n\nThe Google founders’ shrinking connections to California underscore the impact of a potential ballot measure that would affect the state’s wealthiest residents. Proposed by a health care union, the measure calls for Californians worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time tax that would be equivalent of 5 percent of their assets. If the measure gains enough signatures to reach the state ballot in November and wins approval, it would retroactively apply to anyone who lived in the state as of Jan. 1 and they would have five years to pay it.\n\nThe potential wealth tax has already caused some California billionaires to establish more ties outside the state. Last month, the venture capitalist Peter Thiel announced that he opened an office for his family investment firm in Miami. David Sacks, the tech investor and White House adviser on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, unveiled a new office for his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in Austin, Texas.\n\nBut the actions of Mr. Brin and Mr. Page stand out because of their wealth — their combined net worths total more than $518 billion, as estimated by Forbes — and how closely identified they are with California. While both stepped down from day-to-day management of Google and its parent, Alphabet, in 2019, they remain on the board of the company and Mr. Brin has recently become more active in Google’s A.I. efforts.\n\nMr. Brin and Mr. Page still have connections to California, including homes across the state. It’s unclear how much time they will be spending in the state this year.\n\nA representative for Mr. Brin declined to comment. Google and representatives for Mr. Page did not respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal previously reported on Mr. Page’s Miami home purchase and Business Insider reported on some details of the shifting of Mr. Page and Mr. Brin’s companies.\n\nThe ballot initiative, which was proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system, has elicited a broad spectrum of reactions.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has called the measure bad policy, arguing that it will lead billionaires to simply move to tax-friendlier states. Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, has defended the initiative, drawing criticism from tech investors and entrepreneurs who are discussing funding a challenger to his seat.\n\nOthers have said the proposed tax could drive entrepreneurs and investors out of California, which could then stifle innovation. Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn and a Silicon Valley resident, said the measure was a “horrendous idea” that might force founders and executives to sell shares in companies that they run simply to fulfill the tax obligation.\n\n“Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue,” Mr. Hoffman posted on social media on Wednesday. Mr. Hoffman’s spokeswoman said he was not available for comment.\n\nJensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia and one of California’s wealthiest men, was among the few billionaires who publicly said they accepted the wealth tax. “We chose to live in Silicon Valley and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television this week, adding that he was “perfectly fine” with it.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesman declined to comment.\n\nIn a statement, Suzanne Jimenez, chief of staff at Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, said an exodus of billionaires from California was overblown.\n\n“The overwhelming majority of billionaires have chosen to stay in California past the Jan. 1 deadline,” she said. “Only a very small percentage left before the deadline, despite weeks of Chicken Little talking points claiming a modest tax would trigger a mass departure.”\n\nKirsten Noyes and Georgia Gee contributed research.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Guardian investigation finds AI Overviews provided inaccurate and false information when queried over blood tests\n\nGoogle has removed some of its artificial intelligence health summaries after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading information.\n\nThe company has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.\n\nBut some of the summaries, which appear at the top of search results, served up inaccurate health information, putting users at risk of harm.\n\nIn one case that experts described as “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy.\n\nTyping “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” served up masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients, the Guardian found.\n\nWhat Google’s AI Overviews said was normal may vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result, and not bother to attend follow-up healthcare meetings.\n\nAfter the investigation, the company has removed AI Overviews for the search terms “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” and “what is the normal range for liver function tests”.\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We do not comment on individual removals within Search. In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”\n\nVanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity, said: “This is excellent news, and we’re pleased to see the removal of the Google AI Overviews in these instances.\n\n“However, if the question is asked in a different way, a potentially misleading AI Overview may still be given and we remain concerned other AI‑produced health information can be inaccurate and confusing.”\n\nThe Guardian found that typing slight variations of the original queries into Google, such as “lft reference range” or “lft test reference range”, prompted AI Overviews. That was a big worry, Hebditch said.\n\n“A liver function test or LFT is a collection of different blood tests. Understanding the results and what to do next is complex and involves a lot more than comparing a set of numbers.\n\n“But the AI Overviews present a list of tests in bold, making it very easy for readers to miss that these numbers might not even be the right ones for their test.\n\n“In addition, the AI Overviews fail to warn that someone can get normal results for these tests when they have serious liver disease and need further medical care. This false reassurance could be very harmful.”\n\nGoogle, which has a 91% share of the global search engine market, said it was reviewing the new examples provided to it by the Guardian.\n\nHebditch said: “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health.”\n\nSue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, welcomed the removal of the summaries but said she still had concerns.\n\n“This is a good result but it is only the very first step in what is needed to maintain trust in Google’s health-related search results. There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information.”\n\nMillions of adults worldwide already struggle to access trusted health information, Farrington said. “That’s why it is so important that Google signposts people to robust, researched health information and offers of care from trusted health organisations.”\n\nAI Overviews still pop up for other examples the Guardian originally highlighted to Google. They include summaries of information about cancer and mental health that experts described as “completely wrong” and “really dangerous”.\n\nAsked why these AI Overviews had not also been removed, Google said they linked to well-known and reputable sources, and informed people when it was important to seek out expert advice.\n\nA spokesperson said: “Our internal team of clinicians reviewed what’s been shared with us and found that in many instances, the information was not inaccurate and was also supported by high quality websites.”\n\nVictor Tangermann, a senior editor at the technology website Futurism, said the results of the Guardian’s investigation showed Google had work to do “to ensure that its AI tool isn’t dispensing dangerous health misinformation”.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Andrew using one of the following methods.\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The company constantly measures and reviews the quality of its summaries across many different categories of information, it added.\n\nIn an article for Search Engine Journal, senior writer Matt Southern said: “AI Overviews appear above ranked results. When the topic is health, errors carry more weight.”",

Ron Wyden (D-OR), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), and Ed Markey (D-MA) wrote that “X’s generation of these harmful and likely illegal depictions of women and children has shown complete disregard for your stores’ distribution terms.” X users have identified several cases where Grok undressed or sexualized apparent minors in the AI-created images.\n\nThe senators point to the app stores’ own policies for why the app should be removed. Google’s terms of service say that apps are subject to removal if they fail to bar users from “creating, uploading, or distributing content that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of children” or portray kids “in a manner that could result in the sexual exploitation of children.” Apple prohibits apps that are “offensive” or “just plain creepy.” Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether X was in compliance with their policies and whether they planned to remove the app.\n\nFailing to remove X from the app stores would both show a double standard, and undermine the companies’ arguments for their control over the app stores in the first place, the lawmakers write. Both companies removed ICEBlock and Red Dot from their stores following government pressure. The apps were used to anonymously report sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. “Unlike Grok’s sickening content generation, these apps were not creating or hosting harmful or illegal content, and yet, based entirely on the Administration’s claims that they posed a risk to immigration enforcers, you removed them from your stores,” the senators wrote.\n\nThey also warned that inaction would “undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones. This principle has been core to your advocacy against legislative reforms to increase app store competition and your defenses to claims that your app stores abuse their market power through their payment systems.”",

    "title": "4 Googlers share how they reinvented their careers and pivoted to AI",
    "description": "Each of these four Google employees took different paths to pivot into AI, but all of them spent roughly a year preparing for the transition.",
    "fullText": "Pivoting to an AI job may be trendy, but that doesn't mean it's an easy feat.\n\nAs AI-related jobs continue to pop up, and companies invest heavily in upskilling, more workers are looking to add \"AI\" to their job titles.\n\nTo see how it can be done, Business Insider spoke with four Google employees who transitioned to AI teams. While each followed a different path, all of them spent roughly a year building the necessary skills to land new roles — and for some, the transition took several years.\n\nFrom participating in employee hackathons to becoming AI content creators, the four employees share how they made the shift:\n\nEmrick Donadei said he didn't feel qualified to pivot to an AI team until he participated in Google's seven-day employee hackathon in 2024. The 32-year-old engineer said he didn't create a revolutionary product, but it gave him hands-on experience with tools, and something tangible he could use to start conversations with teams across the company. \n\nRoughly 10 months after his first hackathon, he said he landed his new role.\n\nWhile the hackathon kick-started his transition, his work didn't stop there. The Googler continued to experiment with tools outside the hackathon, he said. He also created a podcast about AI developments and watched Andrej Karpathy's YouTube videos to get up to speed with machine learning concepts and anything related to LLMs.\n\nAfter finding a new role, Donadei said that he participated in another hackathon in 2025, which opened up even more opportunities. He had the opportunity to transition into AI research, began working part-time on open-source committees and with AI research teams, and published a public technical disclosure with Google as a follow-up to his work.\n\nMaitri Mangal, 27, worked as a traditional software engineer before transitioning to an AI team. During the roughly year-long period she took to prepare for the pivot, Mangal dedicated roughly two hours daily toward up-skilling, and still spends hours learning weekly, she said.\n\nShe said that creating social media content was a way for her to reinforce the material that she learned through Google's internal training and other online courses.\n\n\"That really, for me, changed everything,\" Mangal said about content creation.\n\nShe said seeing that her content helped other people motivated her to continue learning about the technology and making videos. Even though she already changed jobs, she said she still spends about an hour daily learning new information, whether that's in the form of internal trainings for her job, or watching YouTube courses to prepare for content.\n\nRahul Kasanagottu, 32, spent two and a half years transitioning to an AI role at the tech giant. He said his paternity leave gave him a head start on reading about AI.\n\nIn addition to reading 11 books on the topic, Kasanagottu also took a Deep Learning Specialization course taught by Andrew Ng, and watched 3Blue1Brown videos on YouTube.\n\nSimilar to Donadei, Kasanagottu said solo projects were a key part of his career transition. He said it was difficult to convince hiring managers he could do the job without having demos and hands-on projects to show. While the books he read typically didn't come with assignments, the courses had a lot of hands-on exercises, Kasanagottu said.\n\nMilica Cvetkovic took a different path than the other three Googlers who made internal pivots to AI teams. She landed a role in AI consulting at the tech giant about three years ago, after completing graduate school and conducting research in machine learning.\n\nAfter she received her Master's in statistics, she worked as a machine-learning engineer at a Madison-based startup and simultaneously taught machine-learning boot camps and college-level courses.\n\n\"Having a skill to talk in a nontechnical way is probably the most valuable skill that I bring,\" Cvetkovic said.\n\nHer move to an AI team at Google was less of a deliberate pivot and more the result of the right opportunity aligning with her background and interests. She said that she realized she didn't want to code anymore, and that's when she came across a consulting role at Google.\n\nCvetkovic said she can't name one single experience that led to her getting the job. Rather, she compared her career journey to training for a marathon. A marathon, she said, is the \"celebration of all the work that you've done.\"\n\n\"That's literally what my application was. It was just very good fit,\" Cvetkovic said.\n\nDid you transition to an AI role? We want to hear from you.

Google is counting on its massive customer base to provide an advantage as the company takes on the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic and others in the booming generative AI market.\n\nGoogle says Gmail now has more than 3 billion users.\n\nLast year, Google's Gemini integration in Gmail allowed users to do things like search messages, draft emails from prompts, improve grammar and generate custom responses.\n\nOne of the new features is \"Suggested Replies,\" which Google says uses the context of a user's emails to create one-click responses. It's an update to a prior tool called \"Smart Replies.\" The company is also upgrading a proofreading option for checking grammar and making messages more concise.\n\nDriven by its rapid advancements in AI, Google parent Alphabet topped Apple by market cap on Wednesday for the first time since 2019, continuing a rally that made the stock the best performer among tech megacaps last year. Meanwhile, OpenAI soared to a private market valuation of $500 billion late last year, and Anthropic said Wednesday that it's valued at $350 billion in a new funding round.\n\n— CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this report.\n\nWATCH: How Gemini is gaining ground on ChatGPT",

    "description": "Critics warned a wealth tax in California would lead to a billionaire exodus. Florida says come on in, the water's warm.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Larry Page has quietly—or loudly—joined the billionaire exodus from California, shifting businesses east and dropping about $173 million on two ultra-luxury waterfront mansions in Miami’s Coconut Grove in a move that looks strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos’ relocation playbook. The timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look downright Bezos-ian.​\n\nIn late December and early January, The Wall Street Journal reported, Page snapped up two neighboring estates in Miami’s Coconut Grove, paying roughly $101.5 million for one waterfront compound and $71.9 million for another in an off‑market deal, for a combined outlay of about $173.4 million. One of the homes, previously listed for $135 million, spans 13 bedrooms and 15.5 bathrooms and sits directly on the water, while the second, bought from heiress Sloan Lindemann Barnett and her husband Roger Barnett, nearly doubled in value in less than five years.​\n\nThe purchases plant Page squarely inside one of Miami’s most exclusive enclaves, long favored by global elites seeking privacy, water access, and low‑key luxury. Local brokers say his splashy entry is part of a broader surge of high‑net‑worth Californians scouting Coconut Grove and other South Florida neighborhoods as they hedge against looming tax changes while upgrading to trophy waterfront properties. The real-estate purchases double as both a luxury retreat and a massive tax‑savings vehicle, with Page the most prominent of California’s ultrawealthy choosing to leave as state lawmakers are targeting fortunes like his with an aggressive wealth‑tax push.\n\nBehind the real-estate headlines, Page has been methodically severing his financial and legal ties to California ahead of a proposed wealth tax that targets residents worth more than $1 billion. Regulatory filings show he has moved his family office and several investment and holding entities out of the state, Business Insider reported, reincorporating key vehicles in Delaware and listing new business addresses in Florida.​\n\nThe New York Times previously reported Page had been telling associates he was considering Florida specifically because of a proposed ballot measure that would impose a 5% annual levy on the worldwide assets of billionaires domiciled in California. If passed and applied retroactively to residents as of Jan. 1, 2026, analysts estimate the tax could cost Page—currently ranked as the world’s second‑richest person—well over $10 billion.\n\n​​Some Silicon Valley executives, notably Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, warned such an outcome was possible, saying in late December founders would have to sell off parts of their companies to pay for “fraud, waste, and political favors for the organizations pushing this ballot initiative.” California Rep. Ro Khanna responded to the Times‘ reporting that Page and Peter Thiel were looking to leave by flagging the story on X and saying, seemingly sarcastically in the style of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, “I will miss them very much.”",

    "description": "The LLC moved as California's ultrarich weigh leaving ahead of a proposed tax on billionaires that would take effect retroactively starting January 1.",
    "fullText": "An entity tied to Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page moved out of California at the end of 2025, beating the deadline on a proposed wealth tax of the state's rich and powerful.\n\nT-Rex LLC, formed in 2006 and linked to Brin and Page, converted out of California into a Delaware LLC called T-Rex Holdings on December 24, 2025, according to a California filing reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPrior filings over the past 20 years listed Brin and Page as managers of the LLC at a Palo Alto address. In the conversion filing, T-Rex Holdings listed an address in Reno, Nevada, as its principal office, with Brin and Page both remaining managers.\n\nRepresentatives for Brin and Page didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe move comes as California's wealthiest residents are weighing whether to leave the state. A proposed ballot measure would make the roughly 200 California residents whose assets exceed $1 billion pay a one-time 5% tax. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. The measure attempts to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit.\n\nEarlier this week, Business Insider first reported that Page severed ties with California in late December by converting his family office out of the state and incorporating it in Delaware. He has also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures.\n\nIt's unclear what the entity tied to Brin and Page does. The filing describes T-Rex Holdings as a \"management company.\" Like other ultrawealthy executives, Brin and Page have used LLCs as flexible vehicles to hold assets or manage investments, often with little public disclosure. The LLC's name may be a reference to Stan, a bronze T. rex statue that presides over Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nBrin, who cofounded Google with Page in 1998, is associated with several other entities in California, including the Sergey Brin Family Foundation and Bayshore Global Management, which acts as his family office. Filings do not show any other entity associated with Brin leaving California.\n\nPage and Brin are, respectively, the second and fourth-richest people on the planet, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Each has a net worth exceeding $250 billion.\n\nAfter stepping back from executive roles in 2019, the two have taken differing paths. Brin has returned to hands-on work at Google. Page is a controlling shareholder, but has remained outside the company's daily operations.\n\nIf the proposal receives enough signatures, it will appear on the state ballot in November. If approved by voters, it will apply retroactively to the beginning of the year, meaning those who wish to avoid the tax would need to have been out of the state by the end of December 2025.\n\nCalifornia law determines residency based a variety of factors, including time spent in California and any substantial business dealings.\n\nA December 11 letter from celebrity attorney Alex Spiro to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, seen by Business Insider, urged the governor to stop the proposed tax: \"It will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Spiro wrote. \"Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax.\"",

    "title": "Google's Getting Rid of a Way to Import Third-Party Accounts Into Gmail",
    "description": "This month, Gmail is ending POP support, which can break syncing your email from third-party accounts.",
    "fullText": "If you've been running several email accounts through your Gmail, you might want to double-check your settings this month—that's because Google is ending support for the POP3 protocol that can sync emails from third-party accounts. And while there are some other solutions, they don't work quite the same.\n\nPOP3 is an older standard of syncing emails between multiple accounts that allowed users to import emails from a third-party account and manage them in one spot. It's also a less secure method of transferring emails, so it's not a total surprise that Google is phasing it out, but the company hasn't broadcast the change too loudly, so it might come as a surprise to some users.\n\nIf you're still using POP3 to fetch your emails from a third-party account, there are a couple of ways to fix it before Google pulls the plug:\n\nForward emails from your other accounts. Rather than having Gmail reach out to your third-party accounts, you can set up automatic forwarding on the other end. How to do this will depend on which email providers you use, so check your third-party account settings for forwarding options.\n\nUse IMAP to check your email from the Gmail apps. In the Gmail app for Android and iOS, you can log into third-party email accounts that support IMAP connections.\n\nThe IMAP protocol works a bit differently than POP3. While POP3 would import messages into your Gmail but leave the original, IMAP syncs between your accounts. So if you use the Gmail app to check your email and delete some messages, they'll be gone if you check the original account later.\n\nGoogle's support doc says this change will take effect \"Starting January 2026\" with no more specific time frame. At time of writing, POP3 support is still working on my own email accounts, so it's not disabled just yet, but it's a good idea to update your email setup sooner rather than later.",

    "fullText": "Google and chatbot-building startup Character.AI have agreed to settle multiple lawsuits from families whose teenagers died by suicide or hurt themselves after interacting with Character.AI's chatbots.\n\nThese negotiations are among the first settlements in lawsuits that accuse AI tools of contributing to mental health crises and suicides among teenagers.\n\nOpenAI is facing a nearly identical lawsuit over the death of a 16-year-old, while Meta has come under scrutiny for letting its AI have provocative conversations with minors. As these companies race to develop and monetize their AI chatbots, they're spending big to make large language models sound more friendly and helpful, and ultimately keep users coming back.\n\nIn October 2024, Florida-based Megan Garcia filed a lawsuit against Character.AI, alleging that the company, which lets people have in-depth and personal conversations with AI chatbots, was responsible for the death of her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III. He had died by suicide months earlier.\n\nA Wednesday court filing in the Garcia case said that an agreement was reached with Character.AI, its founders, Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, and Google. In 2024, the search giant hired the founders of Character.AI, who were former Google employees, and paid for non-exclusive rights to use the startup's technology. The startup remains a separate legal entity.\n\nThe terms of the settlements were not immediately available\n\nThe defendants have also settled four other similar cases in New York, Colorado, and Texas, according to court documents from this week.\n\nMatthew Bergman, the legal representative of the families, along with Google and Character.AI, did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nGarcia's suit said that the startup failed to implement safety guardrails to prevent her son from developing an inappropriate and intimate relationship with its chatbots. The suit claimed that he was sexually solicited and abused by the technology, and the chatbot did not respond adequately when Setzer began talking about self-harm.\n\n\"When an adult does it, the mental and emotional harm exists. When a chatbot does it, the same mental and emotional harm exists,\" Garcia told Business Insider in an interview last year. \"So who's responsible for something that we've criminalized human beings doing to other human beings?\"",

    "title": "Google Play Protect is now the custom DPC gatekeeper, and everyone is a threat",
    "description": "This is a significant shift in how Android Enterprise operates, and the quiet nature of the rollout is arguably as damaging as the way it is being executed.",
    "fullText": "For anyone landing here after searching for answers as to why you're seeing unsettling Play Protect warnings for safe, compliant apps, read this help article and submit an appeal.\n\nGoogle has a habit of dropping significant changes into unassuming help centre articles, and the subject of this article regarding Device Policy Controller (DPC) allowlisting is no exception.\n\nThe changes, which went live earlier this year, involve a new \"Approved Android Enterprise device policy controllers allowlist.\" It’s a dry title for what is essentially a mandatory \"permission to operate\" for any EMM or custom solution developer in the Android space.\n\nWhile it might look like a routine security tweak on the surface, this move introduces a fundamental layer of gatekeeping to Android Enterprise that has far-reaching consequences for the wider ecosystem, consequences Google appears either to have overlooked or simply decided aren't their problem.\n\nThe premise is simple: Only DPCs verified and approved by Android Enterprise are now permitted during the Android Enterprise provisioning process. If your DPC isn't on the list, the enrolment can fail with a rather ominous message: \"Harmful app blocked\".\n\nOn the surface, Google’s justification appears to be the typical \"security and privacy\" refrain. A DPC holds considerable power over an end-user device and could result in some rather unsavoury predicaments if a user could be convinced to factory reset their device, initiate provisioning, and enrol into a potential attacker's solution... But as is often the case with these top-down mandates, the \"security\" label is being used to justify a level of centralised control that feels increasingly stifling for the ecosystem.\n\nWhat this results in is perhaps the most significant change to how a DPC operates since the introduction of Android Enterprise, in Android Lollipop (5.0).\n\nTo understand the gravity of this, we first have to look at what a DPC actually is.\n\nIn the Android management world, the DPC is the \"agent\" application, the Device Owner that holds the keys to the kingdom. It can communicate with a backend - typically but not always an EMM server - and may enforce policies like Wi-Fi settings, app restrictions, and password requirements directly on the OS.\n\nAt least, in the enterprise ecosystem. More broadly the community has leveraged custom DPCs for turning their applications into native Android kiosks, building community/open source management platforms, expanding solutions out to use cases like parental control, device leasing, and more. Consider Acurast, which uses Device Owner (DO) to put a device into a pool of worldwide resources developers can use for their decentralised computing needs, Xibo which is a DO-supported media client, or FreeKiosk which does what it says on the tin.. amongst many others.\n\nDPCs are used for all sorts of functionality for all sorts of use cases. They can also run entirely locally through hard-coded restrictions/functionality in cases where the whole use case is to showcase the app utilising DPC functionality itself. Historically, Google didn't care whose DPC you used, nor what it did, provided it called the right APIs and didn't outright abuse either the user or the OS. This allowed for a flourishing ecosystem of solutions built upon custom DPCs.\n\nIn parallel to this more recently (well, 2019), Google introduced the Android Management API. This native-feel implementation of a consistent and centralised management platform has been the default and only option for enterprise vendors to build their enterprise management solutions for the last few years, following the deprecation of the Play EMM API. Custom DPCs haven't gone away, though without the Play EMM API there's no app or account management available. This has to go through AMAPI. If you're an enterprise EMM vendor, Play access is a cornerstone of your solution.\n\nAMAPI in turn has become more and more restrictive on who uses it and how; their permissible usage page has grown more complex and limited as time has progressed, most recently completely blocking new vendors from even touching the API without Google's approval of a vendor's business case, and then limiting the number of devices permitted to enrol without continued and repetitive applications for increased quotas. It's becoming quite a restrictive, overly-moderated experience.\n\nAs Google tightens the screws on AMAPI access, the custom DPC route has become a more appealing option. I can speak to several vendors I've worked with previously denied access to AMAPI who have turned to custom DPC, for example. For many use cases access to Google Play for app/account management isn't all that critical and achieves the goals in mind. Google's approval framework might suggest if a vendor can't get approval for AMAPI, they must automatically be doing something untoward, but given the permissible uses are limited and target some of the most popular use cases for restricted access - financing, device as a service (DaaS), and in-house solutions - that suggestion would be plainly wrong.\n\nIn any case, the move to start restricting custom DPCs could have been anticipated, though I'm not sure many (including me) did so. While I agree policing of the custom DPC market is beneficial (I'm sure some fall for the mandate to wipe and enrol their devices into a malicious solution, I've seen worse), the way Google has gone about it leaves a terrible taste in my mouth.\n\nI want to be clear I am in favour of keeping the ecosystem safe. It's what I spend most of my days doing through the very DPCs in question (amongst other things). I'm also not just grumpy about this because it's change; I wrote of my support for developer verification just a few months ago.\n\nOn the face of it, the restrictions aren't unreasonable. Frustrating though they may be in limiting choice and freedom for projects and organisations taking advantage of the Android Enterprise framework, what Google has put in place is fine - it's even slightly less restrictive than the requirements for AMAPI as there's no explicit restriction on in-house solutions. I also can't argue the dev guidance and mobile unwanted software policies for some of the causes of being flagged outside of the allowlist, as it makes perfect sense - SMS, notifications, and accessibility permissions should absolutely be challenged given their sensitive nature, and a DPC should never be anything other than fully transparent with its capabilities and behaviours.\n\nThere are two very distinct issues I take with how this allowlist has come about, however.\n\nIn the aforementioned developer verification announcements, Google provides a year for developers to get on board. There are multiple approaches to verification offered, and generally speaking even those slowest to adapt to change have a justifiable amount of time to figure things out. It's not dissimilar to Play EMM API being deprecated, that's been going on for a few years now with vendors still tip-toeing over to AMAPI. There was an iFrame approval change that was deprecated in 2021, and in 2023 I was still writing about it. Let's not even touch on Device Administrator deprecation..\n\nGoogle made the change earlier this year and no one outside of existing partners would have known until their DPCs were being actively blocked, something demonstrated in the customer community multiple times:\n\nThis lack of communication feels tone-deaf. It ignores the reality of countless developers who have built livelihoods on the open nature of Android, only to be thrown face-first into an arbitrary wall.\n\nGoogle Play Protect was introduced as the world’s most widely deployed mobile threat protection service. Its job is to find malware, identify potentially harmful applications (PHAs), and keep users safe from real threats, but here Google is using Play Protect as the gatekeeper, and by folding the \"Approved DPC\" list into Play Protect’s enforcement engine, Google has turned a tool designed for protection into a weapon of enforcement of Google's will.\n\nThere's obviously a distinction between GPP flagging on sensitive permissions, which is valid and I take no issue with, versus GPP running off an arbitrary list of package names a team within Google has to maintain. The latter is mind-boggling to me.\n\nThe weaponisation of a tool many in the ecosystem have applauded as a beacon of Android security means when a user or an IT admin attempts to enrol a device using a DPC that isn't on Google's allowlist, Play Protect intervenes.\n\nIt doesn't say, \"This vendor hasn't completed their paperwork.\", it displays some of the scariest warnings in the Android lexicon.\n\nThis is a massive erosion of trust. If \"unsafe\" just means \"not a Google approved application,\" my prediction is we will eventually see the messaging for Play Protect soften, lowering the likelihood of taking actual malware warnings seriously. It all starts with an \"oh ignore the warning, just continue\", and authority is lost. Google is crying wolf to protect its ecosystem boundaries, and in doing so, they are devaluing the very security tool they claim is vital for the platform's health.\n\nWith this allowlist, the days of building a custom DPC for anything but what Google considers a justifiable use case are heading towards a reality where this may not be possible. Whether you’re a developer building an open-source management tool, or a company with a bespoke internal DPC for a fleet of industrial devices, you now have to go through an opaque verification process that is down to the interpretation of the human undertaking the approval at the time. If you're building anything else, that human may just not put the package name on the list.\n\nAgain, I'm not against protection for users in the ecosystem. I find it, however, baffling with all the signals Play Protect gets from a device, with all of the ecosystem data Google consumes across billions of Android devices, all of the pattern recognition, user feedback, all of this noise Google has chosen to forego every ounce of technology they use powering Android's industry-leading security.. for a list. Implemented with little to no consideration for the ramifications to businesses and communities.\n\nThe answer is to get verified, because this new reality treats every custom DPC as hostile until you prove otherwise.\n\nIf you're going to navigate it, here are the hoops; steps that shouldn't be unnecessary if Play Protect judged behaviour instead of defaulting to the ban-hammer:\n\nIf you’re blocked mid-provisioning, tell admins and users plainly that the warning is about allowlisting, not malware, and point out the option for them to continue the install if present in the Play Protect warning.\n\nStandardisation is a good thing. I’ve spent years advocating for the Android Management API (AMAPI) and a more consistent experience across OEMs. But standardisation should not be achieved like this.\n\nGoogle needs to decouple technical safety from verification. If an app isn't verified, the OS should tell the user that. It should say: \"This management tool is from an unverified/unknown/unapproved developer. Proceed with caution.\" It should not say: \"This app is trying to bypass security.\" By using the PHA stick to enforce partner rules, Google is signalling that the wider community - the tinkerers, the niche hardware vendors, and the independent developers - are no longer a priority. It’s a move that lacks empathy for the diverse ways Android is used across the world.\n\nThe ship has sailed to put a pause on this now, but it's not too late to put out visible announcements, talk about the security, justify the change, adjust the messaging - everything that was done with developer verification should be done here, too.\n\nTo the developers and vendors struggling with this: My advice is to document everything: Any failed appeal, any poor user experience, and any customer you lose because of a misleading warning. Submit it to the customer community and make sure you're seen and heard. We've made incredible changes through the community over the last few years. Feedback matters.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI's recent \"code red\" over Gemini makes a lot of sense when you look at the data.\n\nWhile the ChatGPT maker continues to dominate the AI race, competitors are gaining ground. In November, Google released Gemini 3 Pro, the first iteration of its Gemini 3 class of models.\n\nSince then, Gemini web traffic has increased while ChatGPT web traffic declined, according to Similarweb data first highlighted by Menlo Ventures partner Deedy Das.\n\nIn December, Gemini traffic increased by 28.4% month-over-month, while ChatGPT traffic decreased by 5.6%, the data shows.\n\nThe chart's data only tells part of the story, only accounting for site visits to chatgpt.com and gemini.google.com. It does not factor in use of the consumer apps or other integrations, like Google's AI overviews in Google Search.\n\nAnd while there's no guarantee that one traffic trend is directly because of the other, the data highlights the shifting tides of the AI race.\n\nWeb traffic for both ChatGPT and Gemini are up year-over-year, but their estimated site traffic growth rates are staggeringly different. ChatGPT traffic is up 49.5%; Gemini's traffic is up 563.6%, per Similarweb.\n\nChatGPT still has a healthy lead. In December, ChatGPT attracted 5.5 billion visitors, according to Similarweb. Gemini came in second with 1.7 billion; DeepSeek, Grok, Character.AI, Perplexity, and Claude all trailed behind with fewer than 400 million visitors each.\n\nAfter its launch, Gemini 3 was lauded as a potentially market-leading model. It was more visual and creative than previous iterations, and was better at coding.\n\nGoogle has also flexed its primary advantage over OpenAI: the ability to integrate its AI within its highly used search products. Basically everyone uses Google — OpenAI must convince people to turn to ChatGPT instead of the search giant's products.\n\nOpenAI and Google are also competing in the image generation market. Less than a month after Google released its Nano Banana Pro AI image model, OpenAI announced the launch of ChatGPT Images.\n\nGemini 3 famously triggered a \"code red\" at OpenAI. In an internal Slack message, CEO Sam Altman reportedly told staff that OpenAI would prioritize ChatGPT while pushing back other product plans.\n\nIn December, Altman said on the \"Big Technology\" podcast that the company would not be in emergency status \"that much longer,\" and that \"code red\" periods normally last six to eight weeks.\n\nAltman also said that Gemini 3 did not have \"the impact we were worried it might.\"\n\n\"But it did — in the same way that DeepSeek did — identify some weaknesses in our product offering strategy, and we're addressing those very quickly,\" he added.",

    "description": "Molly Graham, former Facebook and Google executive, shares how a risky career move and embracing a J-shaped career path grew her expertise.",
    "fullText": "At 25 years old, Molly Graham was thriving in Facebook's HR department when a senior executive urged her to transfer out of her stable role and help build a mobile phone instead.\n\nShe took the risk — and it could have derailed her career.\n\nBut Graham, who later became a C-suite executive at some of America's biggest companies and philanthropies, now views that risky bet as one of the most important moves she ever made.\n\n\"It just felt like falling off a cliff,\" Graham, now the founder of Glue Club, said in a recent interview on Lenny Rachitsky's podcast. \"Taking risks, accepting the terrible fall and that experience of falling has been more than worth it.\"\n\nGraham described the experience as part of what she calls the \"J-curve\" — a career trajectory where a risky move leads to an initial drop before eventually producing outsized gains. Visually, she describes it as standing on a ledge, stepping off, sinking briefly, and then rising far higher than where you started — just like the shape of the letter J.\n\nThe concept, which she has also written about in her Lessons Substack, challenges the idea of a steady career ladder that steadily moves up and to the right.\n\nInstead of climbing rung by rung with promotions every two to five years, Graham argues that some of the most valuable professional growth comes from jumping into roles you aren't ready for and surviving any setbacks.\n\nGraham's own J-curve began when billionaire investor and \"All-in\" podcast host Chamath Palihapitiya, then Facebook's vice president of growth, recruited her to help develop a smartphone, encouraging her to make the move by sketching out the J-shaped trajectory on a whiteboard.\n\nHe brought her on despite her having no experience in product development, dropping her into rooms filled with engineers and phone specialists with deep subject matter expertise. She recalled feeling like an \"idiot\" for much of her first six months.\n\nAt her midyear review, Palihapitiya delivered what Graham called the worst performance evaluation she had ever received. But the new experience eventually expanded her expertise.\n\n\"Slowly, I remember I had been doing all these trips to Taiwan because we were actually working on hardware and I, at some point, came back from Taiwan and I like drew on a whiteboard for him the layout of a mobile phone, trying to explain to him kind of like why something he wanted to do was not possible,\" Graham said. \"And I so vividly remember walking out of that meeting being like, 'Oh like I actually know things.' And slowly then over the following three years I became an expert in mobile.\"\n\nPalihapitiya did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\n\"The phone itself was a giant failure — a massive, costly failure for Facebook,\" Graham told Rachitsky on the podcast. \"But it was not a failure for me.\"\n\nShe credits the experience with teaching her that she could operate far outside her comfort zone — a lesson that later helped her take on senior leadership roles, including serving as COO of Quip, which Salesforce acquired for $750 million, and overseeing operations at the $7.4 billion Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\n\nThe J-curve, Graham said, is especially common at fast-moving companies like Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, and SpaceX, where leaders value employees who are willing to take big risks early and learn quickly. In those environments, proving adaptability can matter more than checking every qualification box.\n\nNot everyone supported Graham's decision at the time. She said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, then the number two at the tech giant, advised against the move — as did her father.\n\n\"When wiser, more experienced people questioned the job offer, it definitely made me pause,\" Graham told Business Insider in a follow-up email. \"But my gut felt really strongly that I needed to take the risk.\"\n\nThat instinct, she said, ultimately helped her discover what kind of work she didn't want to do, and where her strengths lay. She didn't want to sift through mock ups of hardware design and argue about a button's placement. Instead, she sharpened her management skills and prepared to help lead large organizations.\n\n\"The much more fun careers are like jumping off cliffs,\" Graham told Rachitsky. \"They can take you to places that you never could have imagined.\"",

    "description": "The Google cofounder has severed ties between California and several of his business entities, including his family office.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Larry Page is peacing out of California.\n\nThe Google cofounder has cut ties between California and many of his assets that risked exposing him to a proposed new wealth tax in the state, meeting an end-of-2025 deadline, according to filings reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPage's family office, Koop, was converted out of California in late December and incorporated in Delaware, per filings with both states. Page converted several other entities to Delaware, including Flu Lab LLC — a vehicle he has used to fund research on tackling influenza and lists its principal office address in Nevada — and another entity named One Aero, which has funded his flying car ventures and lists its principal office address in Florida.\n\nA filing was also made to convert Dynatomics, LLC from California to Delaware with a new principal address in Keller, Texas. Page launched Dynatomics, a new startup focused on applying AI to aircraft manufacturing, in 2023, Business Insider previously reported. A source close to Page said that the team, run by Chris Anderson, continues to work out of California.\n\nAnderson and representatives for Page's family office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe New York Times reported in December that Page had told people he was considering moving to Florida because of a proposed ballot measure that would tax the state's wealthiest residents. The proposal, if passed successfully, would mean that any California resident worth more than $1 billion would be taxed 5% of their assets.\n\nUnder California law, residency is determined by the nature of a person's ties to the state, with factors such as the time spent in the state and the maintenance of substantial business ties taken into account. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nA source close to Page said the Google cofounder had already left the state. Whether Page's move is temporary could not be learned.\n\nPage is ranked the second-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nBesides his family office and funding vehicles, Page converted out an LLC that Business Insider previously identified as being used to purchase islands in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, from California to Delaware, with a new address listed in Florida.\n\nA separate LLC Page used to purchase an Island in Fiji was also converted out to Delaware.\n\nPage's wife, the scientist Lucinda Southworth, founded a marine-conservation charity named Oceankind. Filings show that Oceankind converted out of California to Delaware in December.\n\nDelaware has become a popular state for businesses to incorporate due to its favorable tax structure, privacy, and its home to a court system specifically designed to handle corporate disputes. The state does not require LLCs to disclose the names and addresses of directors when incorporating, providing them with an extra layer of privacy.\n\nPrivacy is especially important to Page, whose family office is shrouded in a level of secrecy unparalleled by most and carefully managed by its CEO, Wayne Osborne.\n\nCristina Rosado, an attorney who handles many of Page and Southworth's assets, signed several of the California filings.\n\nPage incorporated three entities in Florida last year, as previously reported by The New York Times. A Koop LLC was incorporated in Florida in January 2025, per filings reviewed by Business Insider. It could not be confirmed if it belongs to Page.\n\nThe California billionaire tax proposal faced some opposition from leaders in venture capital and politics. In a post on X in December, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said the proposed measure would mean California would lose its most important taxpayers and \"net off much worse.\"\n\n\"Long term damage unless legislature bans wealth taxes,\" he added. \"Easier to equalize taxes on work income and capital gains at the national level.\n\nMatt Mahan, Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, on Monday described the tax as \"a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy.\"\n\nWhite House AI czar David Sacks has criticized the proposal and said it will backfire. He has also said he believes Miami and Austin will overtake New York and San Francisco for finance and tech, respectively. He announced this month that his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, had opened an office in Austin.\n\nLast month, celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro wrote a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, warning that the proposed billionaire tax would \"trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave something to share?

    "description": "How Google engineer Jaana Dogan discovered an AI tool that recreated a year-long engineering effort in one hour—what it means for developers and AI’s future.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence rarely shocks senior engineers anymore. Most professionals in big tech expect rapid progress. Yet, in early 2026, a candid revelation by Jaana Dogan, a principal engineer at Google, managed to do exactly that. Her experience with an AI coding tool ignited a global conversation about software development, productivity, and the real role of human engineers in an AI-assisted future.\n\nThis was not marketing hype. It came from someone deeply involved in building large-scale AI systems. That authenticity is why her story resonated across the tech world.\n\nJaana Dogan is a Principal Engineer at Google, associated with work on advanced AI systems, including Google’s Gemini ecosystem. Engineers at this level typically focus on system architecture, long-term design decisions, and complex coordination between multiple components rather than routine coding.\n\nShe is not a celebrity technologist or influencer. Instead, she represents a growing group of highly experienced engineers who speak openly about how AI tools are reshaping their daily work. That credibility matters, especially when discussing sensitive topics like productivity gains and automation.\n\nThe moment that brought Jaana Dogan into the spotlight involved a hands-on experiment with Claude Code, an AI coding tool developed by Anthropic. Out of curiosity, she tested whether the tool could understand and recreate a complex system her team had already built at Google.\n\nAccording to Dogan, after providing a clear description of the problem, the AI generated a functional version of a distributed agent orchestrator in roughly one hour. Her team had spent close to a year designing and building a similar system internally.\n\nThis account was first reported by The Indian Express, which quoted Dogan’s own public remarks and reactions from the wider tech community.\n\nTo understand why this mattered, some context helps.\n\nA distributed agent orchestrator is not a simple script. It coordinates multiple autonomous agents, manages communication between them, and ensures tasks execute in the correct order. These systems often involve:\n\nIn large organizations like Google, building such systems involves months of design reviews, testing, and refinements. That’s why the speed of the AI-generated result raised eyebrows.\n\nThe AI output was not production-ready software. Dogan herself made that clear. The generated code still required validation, security reviews, performance testing, and human judgment. However, the structure and logic closely resembled what her team had arrived at after extensive discussions.\n\nThink of it like this: the AI produced a strong architectural draft, not a finished skyscraper.\n\nThis distinction is crucial for maintaining factual accuracy and avoiding exaggerated claims.\n\nThis was not a startup demo or marketing blog post. The observation came from a senior Google engineer with direct experience in large-scale AI systems.\n\nDogan openly acknowledged limitations instead of claiming AI superiority. That balance increased trust in her assessment.\n\nIf AI tools can reduce early-stage development time from months to hours, workflows will change. That affects cost planning, timelines, and team structures.\n\nCoverage from The Economic Times and Times of India further highlighted how divisive this moment was for software engineers globally.\nSources:\n– Economic Times (Technology Updates)\n– Times of India (Tech News)\n\nLong answer: The role is evolving.\n\nAI tools excel at pattern recognition and rapid synthesis. They struggle with context, accountability, and responsibility. Human engineers still:\n\nDecide whether an approach fits real-world constraints\n\nHandle edge cases that AI cannot predict\n\nEnsure compliance with legal and ethical standards\n\nMaintain systems over long timeframes\n\nDogan herself encouraged developers to test AI tools in domains they understand deeply. That advice reflects confidence, not fear.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of this story is Dogan’s openness about a competitor’s product. Historically, engineers at major tech firms avoid praising rival tools publicly.\n\nHer response suggests a cultural shift. Many professionals now view AI advancement as a shared ecosystem rather than a zero-sum competition. Progress by one company often pushes the entire field forward.\n\nThat mindset aligns with broader industry trends toward open research, shared benchmarks, and collaborative safety discussions.\n\nTeams can explore ideas quickly without committing months up front.\n\nEngineers may spend less time on boilerplate code and more time on design, review, and decision-making.\n\nPrompt design, system evaluation, and AI oversight will become core technical skills.\n\nThese conclusions align with discussions already happening in academic research and enterprise software planning.\n\nThis story gained traction not because it was sensational, but because it felt honest. It showed excitement, concern, and realism at the same time.\n\nDogan didn’t claim AI had “won.” She highlighted how powerful tools can reshape workflows when used thoughtfully. That balanced perspective is exactly what Google’s E-E-A-T framework values: experience, expertise, authority, and trust.\n\nJaana Dogan did not set out to start a global debate. She simply shared an authentic professional observation. Yet that moment revealed something important: AI tools are no longer just assistants. They are becoming collaborators.\n\nThe future of software development will not be purely human or purely automated. It will sit somewhere in between. Engineers like Jaana Dogan help the industry understand that future clearly, without hype or fear.\n\nAnd that clarity, more than speed or novelty, is what truly matters.\n\nThe Indian Express – Global Technology Coverage\n\nThe Economic Times – AI & Software Industry News\n\nJaana Dogan is a Principal Engineer at Google who works on advanced artificial intelligence systems,\n\nincluding projects related to Google’s Gemini AI ecosystem. She is known for sharing real-world\n\ninsights on how AI tools impact modern software development.\n\nJaana Dogan’s AI experiment went viral because she revealed that an AI coding tool recreated a system\n\nsimilar to her team’s year-long engineering work in about one hour, sparking debate about AI’s role\n\nin software development.\n\nNo, AI did not replace human engineers in Jaana Dogan’s experiment. The AI-generated code acted as a\n\nprototype and still required human expertise for validation, testing, optimization, and long-term\n\nsystem responsibility.\n\nA distributed agent orchestrator is a software system that coordinates multiple autonomous agents,\n\nmanages communication between them, and ensures tasks execute reliably across distributed computing\n\nenvironments.\n\nJaana Dogan’s experience shows that AI can dramatically speed up early-stage development and\n\nprototyping, while human engineers remain essential for system design, ethical decisions, quality\n\ncontrol, and long-term maintenance.",

    "description": "Maddy Zhang spent over four years at Google. She shared five tips for getting into Big Tech, from referrals to technical interviews.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech can seem impenetrable. This Google alum has some tips for getting your foot in the door.\n\nMaddy Zhang spent over four years working as a software engineer for Google, touching both the search and advertising businesses. She now works at Airbnb, per her LinkedIn, and previously held internships at Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft.\n\nOn the \"A Life Engineered\" podcast, Zhang shared five tips for landing a job at Google or one of its competitors.\n\nFirst, she recommended applying to jobs early — as in, within hours of the openings being posted.\n\n\"Because there's so much competition, it's honestly an employer's market,\" Zhang said. \"If you wait a day, probably there's going to be hundreds of applicants for it.\"\n\nWhile the recruiter is supposed to look at all of the applications, they'll likely look at the first batch and ignore the rest, she said.\n\nApplying quickly can help you land a job, LinkedIn data shows. Responding quickly helps too: US job seekers who reply to a prospective employer's message within 24 hours are 4.1 times as likely to get hired and 6.7 times as likely to get an interview, according to Indeed.\n\nNext, she advised getting referred by a current employee. Zhang's friends who have applied with referrals had a higher success rate, she said. But that doesn't mean ask anyone on LinkedIn to support you.\n\n\"If you don't actually have a connection with them, it's not going to help,\" she said.\n\nWhile a good résumé or referral might get you through the recruiter's initial pass, applicants must then pass a technical interview. Many engineers prepare using LeetCode — a tool Zhang said was still valuable.\n\n\"I know no one really likes it,\" she said. \"It's a necessary evil.\"\n\nZhang recommended doing a mix of easy, medium, and hard LeetCode problems. When you get stuck, she advised not just looking at the answer, but retyping and running the solution.\n\nIt's easy to think that Google is filled to the brim with Stanford graduates. That wasn't Zhang's experience, though. Her next piece of advice: Don't underestimate yourself based on your school.\n\nMost of Zhang's friends didn't go to \"good computer science schools,\" she said. Many attended state schools or community colleges before transferring.\n\n\"As you progress forward in your career, your school matters less and less,\" she said.\n\nEven with the best application, interview prep, and referrals, there's no guarantee of a job. That's Zhang's final piece of advice: remember it's a numbers game.\n\nZhang said that she had been rejected hundreds of times. When she was younger, those rejections made her want to give up on the industry. She's since learned that it's not personal.\n\n\"Maybe I had a bad day, maybe the interviewer had more qualified candidates, maybe there's something I couldn't control,\" Zhang said.\n\n\"Rejection is nothing on who you are as a software engineer.\"",

    "fullText": "Fraudsters use phishing to steal card details, which fund a spending spree using Apple Pay or Google Pay\n\nYou get a call from your bank and the informed voice asks to you to confirm the personal details they have on file, which you do. You are then asked whether you bought something at an electrical retailer recently for £120 and spent £235 in Birmingham, but neither transaction rings true.\n\nThe caller tells you they have blocked the payments but they must now secure your account, and say they will send you a notification to approve, or a code to pass on to them. You feel under pressure to protect your money, so you do what is asked.\n\nUnfortunately, the person at the other end of the phone is not your bank but a criminal, and they have added your payment card to a digital wallet on one of their many smartphones. At some stage, your account will be emptied by purchases of expensive phones or designer clothes, which will then be sold on.\n\nBanks have seen an increase in the number of attempts to exploit victims using the elaborate digital wallet fraud and have introduced new security measures to counter the threat.\n\nDanai Antoniou, the chief scientist at Gradient Labs, a financial services AI company, says the approach from criminals can appear harmless as the victim is not being asked to move money.\n\n“This is why most people don’t question it. If the notification says ‘never share this with anyone’ (or similar), they will pre-emptively mention it to the customer that this is a routine comment that comes with every notification – which is true, customers do become immune to warnings if they get warnings frequently,” she says.\n\n“Victims often describe feeling panicked and pressured during the call, being told their account is under attack, or that their money is at risk. In that heightened emotional state, approving a notification feels like the responsible thing to do. The victim believes they’re protecting their account, when, in reality, they’re handing over the keys.”\n\nSantander says that digital wallet fraud was the second biggest reason for card scam losses last year, while HSBC has reported an increase over the past 18 months.\n\nUK Finance, the banking trade body, says that the number of attempts has surged, in part because security systems have prevented criminals being successful, forcing them to make more attacks.\n\nThe fraud can start with phishing where the victim provides personal and bank details after a text message that promises, for example, a winter fuel allowance payment, or an offer for cheap products on social media.\n\nAfter a few weeks, enough time for the victim to forget about supplying details, the fraudster will contact them, claiming to be from their bank. They will know which bank because of the details already supplied by the victim.\n\nThey may ask the victim to confirm the address, or postcode, they have on file, in order to portray legitimacy. The criminal will then ask about some transactions, all fabricated, and when the victim says they don’t recognise them, the criminal will claim they have been stopped, and more measures must be taken to secure the account. They will say that a notification is on the way, and the victim should approve it to secure the account.\n\n“The notification the customer receives is entirely legitimate, as it’s the genuine notification your bank sends when a new Apple Pay or Google Pay card is being added to a device, or the bank may send you a code via text, or in the app. They have just added your card into their Apple Pay or Google Pay and you are now receiving a text, or a notification, to approve it,” Antoniou says.\n\nFrom there, the criminals can act quickly and empty the account of the victim. “They drain accounts at high-value merchants, such as tech stores and fashion retailers. The appeal is simple: electronics and designer goods can be quickly resold on the secondary market with minimal loss of profit during the money-laundering process,” she adds.\n\nBanks don’t need your help to protect your account: they have systems in place to freeze and block accounts if needed. “Never trust anyone who calls you from your bank unless you arranged that phone call in advance. If somebody calls, tell them you will call the bank back yourself,” Antoniou says. And don’t use a number they give you: search on the web for the bank’s phone number, or use the one on the back of your physical debit or credit card.\n\nNationwide warns people to be aware of what any one-time passcodes they receive are being used for.\n\nHSBC says it has put in new security measures to counter the threat of wallet fraud and more would be coming this year. “We are regularly reminding customers not to give out their details, such as one-time passcodes, and to treat them as carefully as you would your pin,” it adds.\n\nUK Finance says: “Set up bank alerts in your app, and check your transactions regularly so you know about any suspicious transactions as soon as possible.\n\n“If you think you’ve fallen for a scam it’s important to contact your bank immediately and report it to Report Fraud.”\n\nApple says it is not responsible for approving a card for inclusion in the wallet, but that it gives banks information that they can use to combat fraud.\n\nGoogle did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "The Google Search Appliance (GSA) is a discontinued series of rack-mounted servers with search engine indexing software.\n\nThe GSA operating system was based on CentOS. The software was produced by Google and the hardware was manufactured by Dell. The final 2009 GSA version was based on Dell's PowerEdge R710. Google announced the phase out of the GSA in early 2016 and a complete discontinuation by 2019.\n\nThe GSA was supplied in two models: a 2U model (GB-7007) capable of indexing up to 10 million documents, and a 5U (2U plus 3U storage) model (GB-9009) that was capable of indexing up to 30 million documents. Sales were operated on a licensing scheme which started as a two-year contract for maintenance, support and software updates.\n\nThe GSA contained Google search technologies and a means of configuring and customizing the appliance.\n\nThe GSA was first introduced in 2002.\n\nSoftware version 6.0 was released in June, 2009. This software ran on some hardware versions of the GB-1001 model (all units with an \"S5\" prefix in their \"Appliance ID\"), and all GB-7007 and GB-9009 models.\n\nGoogle released version 7.0 on October 9, 2012 and version 7.2 on February 11, 2014.\n\nThe GSA could be purchased in two separate versions based on the number of documents being indexed. Model G100, a 2U appliance, could index up to 20,000,000 documents. The G500 5U appliance[1] could index up to 100,000,000 documents.\n\nGoogle sold a 2U appliance (GB-1001) capable of indexing up to 5 million documents, a half-rack cluster (GB-5005) of five 2U nodes capable of indexing up to 10 million documents, and a full-rack cluster (GB-8008) of eight―and later 12 nodes―capable of indexing up to 30 million documents. Some models were based on Dell PowerEdge 2950 2U rack mounted servers.\n\nThe Google \"Blue\" Mini was a smaller and lower-cost search solution that occupied 1U of rack space for small and medium-sized businesses to set up an Internet search engine that allowed them to index and search up to 300,000 documents. The hardware was manufactured by Gigabyte Technology then Super Micro Computer, Inc.[2] Manufacture and sale of the Google Mini were discontinued beginning in July 31, 2012.\n\nFor a brief period in 2008, Google offered a virtual version of the GSA aimed at developers. The virtual edition could be downloaded free of charge and index up to 50,000 documents. It was discontinued for unknown reasons.\n\nEarly in February 2016, Google sent a confidential letter[3] to its business partners and customers, stating that the GSA would not be available past 2018. It began with the discontinuation of GSA three-year contracts in 2016; in 2017 there would be only one-year renewal contracts and no hardware sales, followed by a complete shutdown in 2018.[4] Customers were expected to migrate to a cloud-based solution.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Inaccurate information presented in summaries, Guardian investigation finds\n\nPeople are being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google’s artificial intelligence summaries, a Guardian investigation has found.\n\nThe company has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.\n\nBut some of the summaries, which appear at the top of search results, served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm.\n\nIn one case that experts described as “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.\n\nIn another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they are healthy.\n\nGoogle searches for answers about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.\n\nA Google spokesperson said that many of the health examples shared with them were “incomplete screenshots”, but from what they could assess they linked “to well-known, reputable sources and recommend seeking out expert advice”.\n\nThe Guardian investigation comes amid growing concern that AI data can confuse consumers who may assume that it is reliable. In November last year, a study found AI chatbots across a range of platforms gave inaccurate financial advice, while similar concerns have been raised about summaries of news stories.\n\nSophie Randall, director of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, said the examples showed “Google’s AI Overviews can put inaccurate health information at the top of online searches, presenting a risk to people’s health”.\n\nStephanie Parker, the director of digital at Marie Curie, an end-of-life charity, said: “People turn to the internet in moments of worry and crisis. If the information they receive is inaccurate or out of context, it can seriously harm their health.”\n\nThe Guardian uncovered several cases of inaccurate health information in Google’s AI Overviews after a number of health groups, charities and professionals raised concerns.\n\nAnna Jewell, the director of support, research and influencing at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said advising patients to avoid high-fat foods was “completely incorrect”. Doing so “could be really dangerous and jeopardise a person’s chances of being well enough to have treatment”, she added.\n\nJewell said: “The Google AI response suggests that people with pancreatic cancer avoid high-fat foods and provides a list of examples. However, if someone followed what the search result told them then they might not take in enough calories, struggle to put on weight, and be unable to tolerate either chemotherapy or potentially life-saving surgery.”\n\nTyping “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” also served up misleading information, with masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients.\n\nPamela Healy, the chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said the AI summaries were alarming. “Many people with liver disease show no symptoms until the late stages, which is why it’s so important that they get tested. But what the Google AI Overviews say is ‘normal’ can vary drastically from what is actually considered normal.\n\n“It’s dangerous because it means some people with serious liver disease may think they have a normal result then not bother to attend a follow-up healthcare meeting.”\n\nA search for “vaginal cancer symptoms and tests” listed a pap test as a test for vaginal cancer, which is incorrect.\n\nAthena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said: “It isn’t a test to detect cancer, and certainly isn’t a test to detect vaginal cancer – this is completely wrong information. Getting wrong information like this could potentially lead to someone not getting vaginal cancer symptoms checked because they had a clear result at a recent cervical screening.\n\n“We were also worried by the fact that the AI summary changed when we did the exact same search, coming up with a different response each time that pulled from different sources. That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough.”\n\nLamnisos said she was extremely concerned. “Some of the results we’ve seen are really worrying and can potentially put women in danger,” she said.\n\nThe Guardian also found Google AI Overviews delivered misleading results for searches about mental health conditions. “This is a huge concern for us as a charity,” said Stephen Buckley, the head of information at Mind.\n\nSome of the AI summaries for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”, Buckley said.\n\nSome also missed out important context or nuance, he added. “They may suggest accessing information from sites that are inappropriate … and we know that when AI summarises information, it can often reflect existing biases, stereotypes or stigmatising narratives.”\n\nGoogle said the vast majority of its AI Overviews were factual and helpful, and it continuously made quality improvements. The accuracy rate of AI Overviews was on a par with its other search features like featured snippets, which had existed for more than a decade, it added.\n\nThe company also said that when AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed context, it would take action as appropriate under its policies.\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.”",

    "description": "Emrick Donadei said participating in a hackathon gave him hands-on experience and expanded his network at Google.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Emrick Donadei, a 32-year-old software engineer at Google, based in New York. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started at Google a few years ago, my role was completely unrelated to AI.\n\nWhen ChatGPT came out, Google started to focus more on LLMs and opened up more opportunities in the company to switch roles. Similar to others, I became more interested in exploring area.\n\nA few months ago, I switched to an AI role. Now I'm a software engineer working on AI safety. Fundamentally, it's similar to my last role, but instead of building software, I'm building LLMs, which requires data, training, and compute.\n\nInitially, I didn't think I could get a role working in AI. I didn't have the right credentials and when I spoke with other teams, I felt a disconnect because I hadn't even touched the products, let alone experimented with creating them.\n\nI was able to transition because I was at the right company at a time when demand was high — but also because I decided to participate in a hackathon. I think hackathons are the best way for everybody to get into AI.\n\nI'm completely switching my career and that's all because the hackathon forced me to get my foot in the door.\n\nI participated in hackathons orchestrated by Amazon in 2018 and 2019, which I won, and I grew a lot from it. When I saw an opportunity to compete with some of the most brilliant minds in the industry on the hottest topic in the industry, it felt like the perfect mix to both learn a lot and possibly redefine my career.\n\nI participated in Google's annual employee-only hackathon in 2024, which lasted seven days. During that time, I worked to create a new product and then do a demo of it at the end. I learned how to use the tools and started to understand the bottlenecks and gaps. It also taught me to understand more about the fundamental knowledge of AI, like how to build infrastructure for LLMs, how to create the algorithms to create agentic workflows — the things that are less sexy.\n\nI didn't do anything revolutionary. I built a small prototype that wasn't super useful — but it was a good way to get started. I experimented with concepts like creating agents and fine-tuning models.\n\nThe hackathon was a really good way to show myself that I could create something that I wasn't familiar with, and I ended up doing a second one in 2025, which unlocked even more opportunities. For example, I was able to publish a public technical disclosure with Google as a follow-up to my work in the second hackathon.\n\nI saw some colleagues transition to AI teams after the hackathon, but the vast majority didn't. You can't just do a hackathon and stop there. You have to actually leverage that experience.\n\nThere are thousands of people who participate, and you have to be really good to win. So, if you're not going to win, rather than letting your idea rot, you should use the opportunity to talk about what you created.\n\nMy team members and I did a lot of self-promotion. We presented the prototype and discussed it with a lot of teams. I usually reached out to group technical leads, because they tend to have a high-level view and they'll be able to tell you quickly if your hackathon project makes sense in their unit after a 30-minute presentation. If it doesn't, they'll give you the name of someone else to try.\n\nI created a lot of connections from these one-on-one meetings with people I didn't know to talk about my product. It helped me become way more proactive, and I got some really amazing opportunities from those conversations.\n\nI also continued to upskill outside the hackathon. I learned to leverage AI as much as possible to speed up my learning. I use tools like Claude Code to read code and documentation faster, Gemini and ChatGPT Deep Research for case studies, and NotebookLM to consume a lot of information at once.\n\nI also watched Andrej Karpathy's YouTube videos and run a podcast with a friend for software engineers and AI enthusiasts. We're doing it mostly because it's the most proactive way for us to keep learning.",

    "description": "Two DeepMind cofounders are now on the opposite sides of an intensifying AI talent war, as Microsoft lures away Google employees in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Google was not spared by this year's AI talent wars.\n\nThe Gemini creator lost employees from its AI and cloud business, even though the company also made significant hires from other Big Tech companies.\n\nUnlike Apple, which mostly lost AI talent to Meta, which splurged big on recruitment this year, most significant departures from Google ended up at Microsoft.\n\nGoogle DeepMind's rivalry with Microsoft's AI unit is one between two DeepMind cofounders who parted ways. Mustafa Suleyman, now steering Microsoft's consumer AI push, and Demis Hassabis, the current CEO of Google DeepMind, launched DeepMind alongside researcher Shane Legg in 2010. They built a research lab so influential that Google bought it for more than $500 million in 2014.\n\nBut a decade later, Suleyman departed Google and founded Inflection AI. He and most of his team were subsequently absorbed by Microsoft in a $650 million \"acqui-hire,\" which made him the AI lead of the company.\n\nThe competition for AI recruitment continues to intensify as hiring cools in the Big Tech job market. Here's a running list of the AI talent Google has lost this year and where they've ended up.\n\nIn July, Subramanya left his position as vice president of engineering at Google to join Microsoft as its corporate vice president of AI. He had been with Google for more than 15 years. In December, it was announced that he was joining Apple.\n\nSadovsky was a distinguished software engineer and senior director at Google for nearly 18 years before joining Microsoft as the corporate vice president of its AI division in June.\n\nGupta was a principal engineer at Google DeepMind before leaving for a position as technical staff on Microsoft's AI team. Prior to Google, Gupta also worked for Meta.\n\nThe former head of global customers engineering at Google left the company. Regini is now the senior vice president of the global solutions engineering unit at SentinelOne, which is a cybersecurity company that provides an AI-powered platform for enterprise security.\n\nRothfuss was a research scientist at Google DeepMind before leaving in May to join Microsoft as a member of technical staff on the company's AI team.\n\nLee was the senior director of corporate development for Google Cloud and DeepMind. He is widely credited for assisting with Google's high-profile acquisitions, including the $32 billion purchase of the cloud security startup Wiz in March. In December, Lee left for OpenAI as its new vice president of corporate development.\n\nFrank was a senior director of product management at Google, who was responsible for advertiser and customer engagement platforms. He joined Microsoft as the corporate vice president of AI monetization.\n\nPotti was the general manager of Google Cloud's security business for more than five years. He left in June and later joined a venture capitalist firm as a partner with a focus on cybersecurity.\n\nIn 2020, Hall made headlines after Amazon sued him for leaving his role as vice president of product marketing at Amazon to join Google. In September, Hall left his position as vice president of products for an undisclosed role, but wrote in a post on LinkedIn that he will be \"working in AI.\"\n\nCitron, a former senior director of product at Google DeepMind, joined Microsoft in August as corporate vice president of its AI group. In a LinkedIn post announcing his new role, he wrote that he is \"energized by Microsoft AI's pace, principles, and product craft.\"\n\nIn August, Barkley left as the head of product at Google Cloud to become the vice president of product management at Nvidia.",

    "title": "How Google, Microsoft, Walmart, and other corporate giants are preparing for an aging workforce",
    "description": "Business Insider reached out to more than 75 major employers, including Walmart and Google, about their efforts to support aging workers.",
    "fullText": "Corporate America is facing a silver tsunami — and some companies are better prepared than others.\n\nWalmart is redesigning jobs to keep older workers on the payroll. Microsoft is offering what it calls \"wraparound care\" to support healthy aging. Google is coaching its employees to prepare for retirement. Some smaller companies have introduced chief longevity officers to help workers navigate health, wellness, and the transition into retirement.\n\nThese are some of the initiatives companies shared with Business Insider, after we contacted more than 75 major employers about their efforts to support aging workers.\n\nFifteen responded and shared policies that address healthcare and well-being, career longevity, flexible work arrangements, and retention. Many of the companies contacted employ thousands of people working past retirement age. Most didn't respond or declined to comment.\n\nAt Walmart, the largest private employer in the US, about 13.3% of the workforce — or over 200,000 employees — is over 60 years old, and more than 300,000 employees have a tenure of more than 10 years.\n\n\"We want to be a great place to work during every stage of life,\" a spokesperson said. \"People come here for a first job or a second career, and we have associates from 16 to 100.\"\n\nThomas Magnuson, 83, has worked as a yard driver at a Walmart facility in Wisconsin since 1999. A few years ago, he transitioned to an asset protection position, where he monitors fire systems and recertifies employees who use certain equipment. Magnuson said he doesn't have enough savings to retire. He described the work, which pays low six figures, as fulfilling.\n\nRuth Finkelstein, a professor of public health at Hunter College, said employers should provide mentorship and flexibility to workers of all ages.\n\n\"People reach their peak earnings in their 50s and then gradually decrease after that until they abruptly decrease after retirement,\" Finkelstein said. \"We should have retirement security adequate to meet people's needs without them having to work for their whole lives, and we should have legislation that's much stronger than that against employment discrimination.\"\n\nSome of the biggest names in the retail, entertainment, and food sectors have proposed age-friendly policies and initiatives to support older workers.\n\nCVS Health has developed programs to attract mature workers and develop their skills. Many of Disney's employees are in their second or third career, said Tami Garcia, executive vice president of people and culture at Disney Experiences. The company gives out the Walt Disney Legacy Award and holds service anniversary ceremonies.\n\n\"For many, having a role at one of our Disney parks is a second or even third career, and we deeply value the experience, wisdom, and mentorship that can bring,\" Garcia said. \"From celebrating milestone anniversaries — including 50+ years of service — to honoring those who embody Walt Disney's legacy through our recognition programs, we showcase respect, care, and appreciation for our Cast Members.\"\n\nSome companies have prioritized certain accommodations, such as flexible work schedules. A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the company's \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy has invested over $500 million in operational improvements and the workplace experience, which could benefit older workers looking for more flexibility. The spokesperson said that 85% of employees receive their preferred shifts.\n\nEllen Ernst Kossek, a professor at Purdue University who studies work-life relationships, said companies should consider reducing the workloads of older employees, helping these workers adapt to new technologies, and finding ways to challenge age-related stereotypes.\n\n\"There's a stereotype that older workers are not as current, but just as you would train new workers or encourage people to get a certificate, they could adapt their strategies to look for people with AI skills and encourage people to keep their skills up,\" Kossek said.\n\nSome companies told Business Insider that they've adopted certain benefits, such as greater access to medical care, which may help older workers stay healthy and avoid early retirement due to medical issues.\n\nThis can be beneficial to both companies and their workers. Older workers can increase corporate healthcare costs, since the majority of people aged 65 and older have a chronic disease, said Dr. Susan Mueller, senior director of health equity and well-being at global advisory firm WTW.\n\nWalgreens offers benefits for \"balancing work with caregiving responsibilities, preparing for retirement, or seeking proactive health and financial well-being support,\" a spokesperson said. UnitedHealth Group provides legal services for estate planning and family law, and supports workers navigating menopause or cancer diagnoses.\n\nA Google spokesperson said the company gives employees access to financial coaching for retirement and personalized assistance for managing caregiving. The company offers benefits such as cancer testing and support, no-cost medical second opinions, and no-cost virtual primary care.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson emphasized the company's paid time off for caregiving for loved ones with a serious illness and wraparound care to support healthy aging.\n\nFedEx has launched comprehensive medical benefits and support networks, such as its Choose Well Care Connect advocacy program, which guides members through life-altering diagnoses. FedEx launched a Fast Pass in certain markets to guarantee members a primary care appointment within 10 days or less. The company's corporate responsibility report notes that FedEx is testing home health capabilities in areas with limited healthcare opportunities.\n\nTopics like AI and climate change are garnering more attention in corporate America than the aging workforce, according to a Business Insider analysis of earnings calls, 10-Ks, and interviews.\n\nThat's a concern to some experts on aging, who say companies need to be doing more to prepare for shifting demographics.\n\nMueller said companies should develop programs that control costs for employees needing medical assistance; establish internal guidelines to help employees navigate the healthcare system; add virtual primary care; and hire external companies specializing in common medical conditions.\n\nMadonna Harrington Meyer, a sociology professor at Syracuse University, said that during economically hard times, older workers are often the first to be laid off and the last to be rehired.\n\nHarrington Meyer said companies should focus on accessibility and safety. They should arrange parking spots near office entrances, ensure good lighting and soundproofing for sensory needs, and maintain functional elevators.\n\nGraham Pearce, global defined benefit segment leader at the consulting firm Mercer, said some companies will need to confront an\"unconscious bias\" against older workers — often seen as less adaptable or more prone to illness. Progress may require legislative action, he said.\n\nThe bipartisan Protect Older Job Applicants Act was introduced in September to prohibit age-based applicant sorting for employers, ensure \"disparate impact\" protections apply to employees and applicants, and require government oversight on age discrimination claims.\n\nRep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia who co-led the bill, told Business Insider that he hopes age discrimination will be considered \"as illegal as discrimination based on race, color, creed, national origin, or sex.\" He added that if more people have employment opportunities later in life, it could stimulate the economy and help people age with dignity.\n\nIn September, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, introduced the bipartisan Protecting Older Americans Act, which would end forced arbitration clauses prohibiting victims of age discrimination from suing their employer.\n\n\"We know that forced arbitration often discriminates against the plaintiff, and for a lot of older Americans, they don't have the resources to mount significant litigations against an employer who discriminates against them,\" Gillibrand told Business Insider. \"We believe that if you have the right of the Constitution to go to a trial and to be judged by your peers, older Americans would do better in these lawsuits.\"\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, said that the separate Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act would help level the playing field for older workers and combat age discrimination.\n\n\"We need to do more to make sure that every American can plan and save for a secure retirement, but as more and more of our neighbors are forced to work later in life just to make ends meet, we need to make sure everyone — regardless of their age — has protections and dignity in the workplace,\" Baldwin said.",

    "fullText": "I want to tell you about the worst day of my life, and how it relates to your website's traffic. Bear with me. This is going somewhere. Probably.\n\nIt started, as most disasters do, with a series of small decisions that seemed fine at the time.\n\nI ate a whole bag of peanuts. Not a small bag. The Costco bag. The one that's meant for a family of four over the course of a month. I ate it in one sitting because it was there, on my desk, and I was reading something online, and my hand just kept going back to the bag. You know how it is. You're not even hungry. You're just... consuming. The bag was open. The peanuts were salted. One leads to another leads to another leads to you're holding an empty bag and your fingers are coated in salt residue and you're wondering what happened to your afternoon.\n\nThen I ate half a jar of peanut butter. Different peanut product, same energy. I had a spoon. I had the jar. I had time. What was I supposed to do, exercise restraint? Close the jar like some kind of adult? No. I kept going. Spoonful after spoonful, watching the peanut butter level descend like a slow tide going out, until I'd crossed the halfway mark and the shame set in and I finally stopped.\n\nThen, because apparently I had decided that today was the day I would test the structural limits of my gastrointestinal system, I ate a can of sardines.\n\nWhy sardines? I don't know. They were in the pantry. They're healthy, I think. Omega-3s. Good for the brain. I needed the protein to balance out the peanuts. That was my reasoning, anyway. The reasoning of a man who had already consumed roughly 4,000 calories of legume-based products and was now adding small oily fish to the mixture like a scientist who has lost control of his experiment but can't stop adding reagents.\n\nI sat back down at my computer. I was reading Hacker News. Everything seemed fine.\n\nJust once. A single sneeze. The kind of sneeze that comes out of nowhere, that ambushes you, that gives you no time to prepare. One second I'm reading a comment thread about Rust versus Go, and the next second my body is convulsing with a violent involuntary exhalation that starts in my sinuses and ends...\n\nI felt it immediately. The warmth. The wetness. The wrongness. That unmistakable sensation that tells you something has happened in your pants that should not have happened. That tells you the structural integrity of your afternoon has been compromised.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the term, and God bless you if you are, a shart is when you attempt to fart and something more substantial comes out. It is a portmanteau of two words that I will not spell out because this is a professional website about search engine optimization and I have some standards. A shart is a betrayal by your own body. A miscommunication between your brain and your bowels. A failure of the internal systems that are supposed to distinguish between gas and catastrophe.\n\nThe sneeze had triggered it. Some kind of pressure cascade. The peanuts and the peanut butter and the sardines, all that matter compressed into my digestive tract, and then the sneeze adding just enough additional force to push everything past the point of no return.\n\nI sat there for a moment. Very still. Assessing the situation. Hoping, somehow, that I was wrong. That the sensation I was feeling was something else, anything else. A figment. A false alarm.\n\nI stood up carefully, like a man defusing a bomb, and began the wobble to the bathroom. Every step was a negotiation. Every movement a risk assessment. I had to get there without making things worse, without spreading the damage, without turning a localized incident into a regional disaster.\n\nI made it. I discovered the horror. I will spare you the details except to say that it was worse than I had hoped and better than I had feared. I cleaned myself up as best I could with the materials available. But my underwear was ruined. There was no saving them. They were casualties of the peanut-sardine conflict, and they had to be disposed of.\n\nThis meant I needed new underwear. The new underwear was upstairs. I was downstairs. The stairs were between us.\n\nSo I began the ascent. Pants around my ankles, because putting them back on seemed wrong and also they needed to be washed. I was shuffling up the stairs like a penguin, like a man in shackles, like someone who had made a series of poor decisions and was now living the consequences of those decisions one humiliating step at a time.\n\nMy foot caught on my bunched-up pants. I pitched forward. I reached for the banister and missed. I went down.\n\nI will not describe the next forty-five seconds except to say that they involved tumbling, flailing, cursing, the reopening of issues I had thought resolved, the involvement of the carpet, and a final resting position at the bottom of the stairs that would have been difficult to explain to anyone who happened to walk in at that moment.\n\nI lay there, on the floor, in conditions I will not describe, and I thought to myself:\n\nThis is what happens when you overconsume and then something sneezes.\n\nI'm going to tell you something now that I've never told anyone. As I lay there on that carpet, in that condition, something clicked in my brain. Something about SEO. Something I'd been trying to understand for months.\n\nI finally understood the Helpful Content Update.\n\nSee, here's what happened to me that day. I consumed too much. Way too much. More than my system could process. Peanuts and peanut butter and sardines, all crammed in there, more than I needed, more than was healthy, more than my body could reasonably be expected to handle. And for a while, nothing happened. The system held. I sat at my computer, functioning normally, reading my Hacker News comments. From the outside, everything looked fine.\n\nAnd then one small trigger. One sneeze. One tiny additional pressure. And the whole system failed catastrophically.\n\nAnd then, when I tried to fix it, I made it worse. Every step I took to recover from the initial disaster led to a new disaster. The wobble to the bathroom. The trip upstairs. The fall on the stairs. Each attempted fix cascading into a fresh catastrophe. The recovery was worse than the initial incident.\n\nThat's what I've watched happen to websites since August 2022.\n\nFor years, websites did what I did with those peanuts. They consumed and consumed and consumed. Not peanuts, but content. AI content. Programmatic content. Template content. \"How to [verb] a [noun]\" times ten thousand. \"Best [product] for [use case]\" times infinity. Content not because users needed it but because the algorithm rewarded volume. Content as peanuts. Handful after handful. The bag is open. The rankings are rising. What are you supposed to do, stop?\n\nThey added more. They added links. They added schema. They added internal linking strategies so aggressive that every page linked to every other page in a great tangled web of self-reference. They added FAQ sections that answered questions nobody asked. They added author bios for authors who didn't exist. They added \"Last Updated\" timestamps that updated automatically whether anything had changed or not.\n\nThey stuffed themselves. Like me with the peanut butter. Spoonful after spoonful. They couldn't stop. The metrics kept going up. The content kept ranking. They crossed the halfway mark and kept going.\n\nAnd then they added the sardines. The guest posts. The link schemes. The PBNs. The \"digital PR\" that was really just paid placements with extra steps. The toxic stuff that should have stayed in the pantry. But it's healthy, they told themselves. It's good for the domain authority. It's omega-3s for the backlink profile.\n\nAnd for a while, it worked. They sat at their computers, watching the traffic, watching the revenue. Everything seemed fine.\n\nAugust 2022. The Helpful Content Update. Just one algorithm adjustment. A single sneeze. A small additional pressure on a system that was already holding too much.\n\nAnd websites across the internet sharted.\n\nTraffic down 40%. 60%. 90%. The warmth. The wetness. The wrongness. That unmistakable sensation that something has happened to your analytics that should not have happened. That tells you the structural integrity of your business model has been compromised.\n\nThey didn't understand it. They hadn't done anything wrong, they thought. They were just doing what everyone else was doing. Consuming content. Adding pages. Building links. The bag was open. The jar was there. What were they supposed to do?\n\nBut that was the problem. They'd consumed too much, and it was all still in there, all that undigested content and those dubious links and those programmatic pages that existed to game the algorithm rather than help users. And when the sneeze came, all of it came out at once.\n\nAnd then they tried to fix it. Like me wobbling to the bathroom. Like me shuffling up the stairs with my pants around my ankles. Every step careful. Every movement a risk.\n\nThey deleted content. Not strategically, but in a panic. Mass deletions. Thousands of pages, gone. They didn't know which pages were the problem, so they deleted all of them. They didn't realize that deleting content creates its own problems. Broken internal links. 404 errors. Orphaned pages. The carpet was getting involved.\n\nThey disavowed links. All of them. The bad ones and the good ones. They didn't know which links were toxic, so they nuked the entire backlink profile. Years of legitimate link building, gone. They'd just kneecapped their own authority because they were panicking.\n\nThey rewrote their content. Added more E-E-A-T signals. Author bios for authors who still didn't exist, but now with LinkedIn profiles that were created last week. \"Expert\" quotes from \"industry professionals\" they'd invented. They were trying to fix the problem by adding more of the thing that had caused the problem. They were eating more peanuts to settle their stomach.\n\nThe September update hit. The October update hit. The November update hit. Each one catching them mid-recovery, each one sending them tumbling again, each one finding some new problem they'd created while trying to fix the last problem. They were at the bottom of the stairs now, in a condition they couldn't explain to anyone who walked in.\n\nHere's what I realized, lying on that carpet in my condition. Here's the thing that clicked.\n\nThe sneeze wasn't the problem. The fall on the stairs wasn't the problem. The problem was everything that came before. The problem was the consumption. The peanuts and the peanut butter and the sardines. The content and the links and the programmatic pages. All that stuff I'd crammed into my system because it was there, because it was easy, because everyone else was doing it, because it felt good in the moment.\n\nThe sneeze just revealed what was already true. The fall just accelerated what was already happening. The carpet just... look, I don't want to extend this metaphor any further than I already have.\n\nThe Helpful Content Update didn't break these websites. These websites were already broken. They were held together by algorithmic tolerance and competitor mediocrity. They were ranking not because they deserved to rank but because everyone else was doing the same thing and Google hadn't gotten around to fixing it yet.\n\nThe sneeze was coming. It was always coming. The only question was when.\n\nI eventually got up off that carpet. I cleaned myself up again. I found new underwear. I washed everything that needed washing, including the carpet. It took a while. It was unpleasant. But I recovered.\n\nI also changed my diet. Not because I'm some kind of health guru now, but because I learned something that day about what happens when you overconsume. When you cram things into your system just because they're there. When you optimize for short-term satisfaction at the expense of long-term structural integrity.\n\nThe websites that recovered from the Helpful Content Update did something similar. They didn't just delete and disavow and panic-rewrite. They fundamentally changed their approach. They stopped consuming content for consumption's sake. They stopped building links for link metrics' sake. They stopped stuffing themselves with peanuts just because the bag was open.\n\nThey started asking a question that seems obvious but apparently wasn't: does this actually help anyone?\n\nNot \"will this rank?\" Not \"will this build authority?\" Not \"will this fill out our content calendar?\" Just: does this help anyone? Would a human being, with a real question, find value in this?\n\nIf the answer was no, they didn't publish it. Revolutionary.\n\nI'm not proud of what happened to me that day. I don't tell this story at parties. I've never told it to anyone, actually, until now, to you, the stranger reading an SEO blog on the internet. I hope you appreciate the vulnerability involved here. I hope you understand what it costs me to share this.\n\nBut I'm telling you because I need you to understand something about the Helpful Content Update and all the updates that have come after it. Something that I didn't understand until I was lying on a carpet at the bottom of the stairs in a condition I still have nightmares about.\n\nThe problem is never the sneeze. The problem is what you've been putting into your system. The problem is the overconsumption. The problem is the peanuts and the peanut butter and the sardines, consumed not because you needed them but because they were there, because it was easy, because what were you supposed to do, stop?\n\nYes. You were supposed to stop.\n\nYou were supposed to look at the bag and think about whether you actually needed more peanuts. You were supposed to put down the spoon before you hit the halfway mark on the peanut butter. You were supposed to leave the sardines in the pantry, where they belong, because nobody needs that much protein and omega-3s are not worth what comes next.\n\nYou were supposed to build a website that helps people instead of a website that games algorithms. You were supposed to create content because you had something to say, not because you had a content calendar to fill. You were supposed to earn links because you made something worth linking to, not because you had a \"link velocity target.\"\n\nAnd if you didn't do those things, if you consumed and consumed and consumed until your system was packed full of stuff that had no business being in there, then the sneeze was coming. It was always coming. The only question was when.\n\nFor me, the sneeze came on a Tuesday, while reading Hacker News, after a regrettable series of dietary choices.\n\nFor your website, the sneeze came in August 2022. Or September 2023. Or March 2024. Or it's coming. It's still coming. Google keeps sneezing. And every time it sneezes, more websites discover what they've been holding inside them all along.\n\nI no longer eat whole bags of peanuts. I no longer follow half a bag of peanuts with half a jar of peanut butter. I definitely no longer add sardines to that combination. I've learned to consume in moderation. To stop before I'm overfull. To leave things in the pantry.\n\nThis has made me a healthier person. It has also dramatically reduced the number of carpet-related incidents in my life, which I think we can all agree is a good thing.\n\nI would recommend a similar approach to your SEO strategy.\n\nStop stuffing your site with content you don't need. Stop building links you can't justify. Stop adding pages just because your competitors have pages. Stop consuming just because the bag is open.\n\nBecause the sneeze is coming. It's always coming. And when it comes, you're going to find out what you're really made of.\n\nI found out what I was really made of that day on the stairs. Peanuts and peanut butter and sardines, mostly. It was not a pleasant discovery.\n\nI hope your website holds up better than my underwear did.\n\nThe author has since recovered fully, both digestively and psychologically. The carpet was professionally cleaned. The underwear was not salvageable.",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA) is in advanced talks to buy Israel-based AI startup AI21 Labs for as much as $3 ​billion, the Calcalist financial daily reported on Tuesday.\n\nNvidia declined to ‌comment, while AI21 was not immediately available to comment.\n\nA 2023 funding round valued AI21 at $1.4 ‌billion. Nvidia and Alphabet's Google participated in that funding.\n\nAI21, founded in 2017 by Amnon Shashua and two others, is among a clutch of AI startups that have benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence, attracting strong ⁠interest from venture capital ‌firms and other investors.\n\nShashua is also the founder and CEO of Mobileye, a developer of self-driving car technologies.\n\nCalcalist ‍said AI21 has long been up for sale and talks with Nvidia have advanced significantly in recent weeks. It noted that Nvidia's primary interest in AI21 ​appears to be its workforce of roughly 200 employees, most of ‌whom hold advanced academic degrees and \"possess rare expertise in artificial intelligence development.\"\n\nCalcalist said the deal to buy AI21 is estimated at between $2 billion and $3 billion.\n\nNvidia, which has become the most valuable company in history at more than $4 trillion, is planning a large expansion in Israel with a ⁠new R&D campus of up to 10,000 ​employees in Kiryat Tivon, just south ​of the port city of Haifa - Israel's third-largest city.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has described Israel as the company’s \"second home.\"\n\nNvidia has ‍said that when ⁠completed, the campus will include up to 160,000 square meters (1.7 million square feet) of office space, parks and common areas across ⁠90 dunams (22 acres), inspired by Nvidia's Santa Clara, California, headquarters. Nvidia expects construction to ‌begin in 2027, with initial occupancy planned for 2031.",

    "title": "3 reasons buying Manus could give Meta a much-needed AI boost",
    "description": "Meta is seen as lagging  behind OpenAI and Google in the AI race. Its acquisition of Singapore-based AI startup Manus could help with that.",
    "fullText": "AI dealmaking isn't slowing down — and it's Meta's turn again.\n\nThe social media giant is buying Manus, a Singapore-based artificial intelligence startup, the companies announced on Monday.\n\nManus went viral in March when it previewed an AI agent that could autonomously perform tasks like screening résumés and stock analysis. Manus was created in China but relocated to Singapore in mid-2025. Meta paid more than $2 billion for Manus, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe deal is the latest in a flurry of red-hot AI investment and acquisitions this year, which includes Meta's $14 billion investment in Scale AI in June. From providing an instant AI revenue source to giving it a leg up in AI agents, here's why buying Manus could give Meta a much-needed boost in the AI race.\n\nManus said in December that it had processed more than 147 trillion tokens of text and said its users were in the \"millions.\" It also claimed to have crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, achieving both milestones eight months after launch.\n\nThose numbers tell us Meta is getting a startup with a built-in audience of paying users. Meta's business model to date has largely revolved around building free products and making money from collecting user data and targeted advertising. Manus offers a free tier for basic tasks, but charges users up to $200 a month for its pro tier.\n\n\"The purchase gives Meta a functioning business with paying customers, meaningful revenue and infrastructure already proven at scale,\" said Murthy Grandhi, company profiles analyst at research firm GlobalData, in a note.\n\nIn its announcement, Meta said it plans to continue selling the Manus service separately while also integrating Manus's technology into its existing platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta did not elaborate on which ones or how it might do so. Meta has poured billions into building up its internal AI teams and developing what is termed \"superintelligence,\" with so far little in terms of returns. Manus could be a way for Meta to start making money directly from AI while it continues to build out its internal efforts.\n\nMeta has struggled to wow consumers and developers as much as OpenAI and Google when it comes to raw model power. However, as these models become increasingly commoditized, there is a growing need to show AI can actually be useful. One such way is AI agents, a type of software that can proactively make decisions and take actions, such as creating a marketing campaign or monitoring and fixing bugs in apps.\n\nBuying Manus could prove a smart bet on the idea that the real value will lie in the programs that sit on top of the models. Manus primarily uses other companies' AI models, like Anthropic's Claude, as building blocks and layers its own software on top.\n\n\"People keep assuming a small update from OpenAI or Google will wipe out a lot of AI startups,\" wrote Yuchen Jin, CEO of the AI startup Hyperbolic, in an X post about Meta's Manus deal. \"But in reality, the AI application layer should be where most of the opportunity is.\"\n\nA Meta spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about which models Manus would support following the acquisition.\n\nOne of Meta's strengths is that its platforms are used by billions of people, which, like Google, gives it a distribution advantage. Its challenge is to find ways to keep them coming back.\n\nUnlike Google with Gemini 3, Meta has yet to have a buzzy AI breakthrough moment with its own in-house models. Combining Manus's \"general-purpose agents\" with Meta's distribution channels gives the social media company another shot at that, particularly as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged that Facebook has shifted from being a place for friends to view each other's content to a \"broad discovery and entertainment space.\"\n\n\"Manus offers a ready-made, high-margin software layer that can be sold directly and integrated across Meta's consumer and enterprise products,\" said GlobalData's Grandhi.",

    "fullText": "Our reporting revealed a symbiotic relationship between the IDF and Silicon Valley – with implications for the future of warfare\n\nIn January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms. Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.\n\nOne investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.\n\nI asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.\n\nHow did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?\n\nYuval Abraham: The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.\n\nHarry Davies: There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.\n\nWhat has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?\n\nYuval Abraham: As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.\n\nIf you remember the [Edward] Snowden revelations, many of them had to do with metadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.\n\nSo data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nTo send a message to Harry and Yuval please choose the ‘UK Investigations’ team.\n\nYou can message Harry using the Signal Messenger app. Use the ‘find by username’ option and type hfd.90\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email harry.davies@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nHarry Davies: Yossi Sariel, the former head of [Israel’s elite spy agency] Unit 8200, wrote a book under a pseudonym that we revealed to have been published by him. In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.\n\nSome of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nWe know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as you revealed, Yuval, and has also purchased AI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?\n\nYuval Abraham: What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] called Lavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.\n\nThese AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.\n\nAI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.\n\nHarry Davies: Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.\n\nMicrosoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?\n\nHarry Davies: I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have been protest groups which have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.\n\nYuval Abraham: And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.\n\nIt sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.\n\nYuval Abraham: Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for its Nimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.\n\nThese are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.\n\nMicrosoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhat’s your focus going to be in 2026?\n\nYuval Abraham: I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHarry Davies: We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.\n\nThere’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.\n\nAnd there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services. Post-Gaza, we have to look at these relationships and ask: what is the involvement of these companies and their technology in military decisions, in military operations and in warfare more broadly?\n\nYuval Abraham: Much of our reporting is based on whistleblowers, on individuals who are in proximity to power or hold positions of power.\n\nHarry Davies: Our confidential sources have remained confidential and we are always interested in hearing from new people. Our door is always open.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "Google's AI told me to make pizza with glue in 2024, so I tried it. Zing! But this year, Google got the last laugh. AI overviews are pretty good.",
    "fullText": "It truly brings me no joy to admit this, but now that it's the end of 2025, I can see that Google's AI Overviews, for as much as I goofed on them for being clumsy and bad, are having the last laugh.\n\nThis realization comes after, in 2024, I totally dunked on Google after its AI told me to use glue to help cheese stick to pizza. So, in a moment of internet infamy, I did just that: I made my glue pizza, and even ate a piece.\n\nThe other day, my editor and I were discussing the state of the AI Overviews. We thought the overviews were pretty abysmal at the start of the year — but we now admit to each other that we use them — instead of traditional search — a lot of the time these days.\n\nOf course, the fact that people (such as myself) are willing to use the AI Overview answer in Google instead of clicking on a link and sending traffic to a website that perhaps employs humans to make that content (such as myself) is not necessarily great.\n\nGoogle AI Overviews launched in the spring of 2024, and immediately, people noticed they often, uh, sucked. The answers they gave were full of absurd inaccuracies.\n\nOne example that went viral on social media was its answer for how to stop the cheese from sliding off your pizza — Google AI suggested adding glue to the sauce, which it seemed to have lifted from a joke on Reddit.\n\nAs a journalist with a commitment to seeking the truth, I actually made a pizza with glue in the sauce and ate it (I'm a trained professional idiot; don't try this at home).\n\nThis year, people noticed that Google AI Overviews still were full of problems. One particularly amusing issue was what we'll call the \"You can't lick a badger twice\" problem: give it a nonsense phrase, and it would accept this as a real idiom and try to explain it.\n\nSomeone on Threads noticed you can type any random sentence into Google, then add “meaning” afterwards, and you’ll get an AI explanation of a famous idiom or phrase you just made up. Here is mine\n\n[image or embed]\n\nTo test more, I made up a few of my own fake idioms like \"you can't fit a duck in a pencil\" and \"the road is full of salsa,\" and indeed, AI Overviews gave explanations for what those phrases meant. Here's what I wrote at the time, back in April:\n\nBut things are getting better. When I tried a fake idiom just the other day (\"you can't tell a yak not to dance\"), it gave a more reasonably accurate answer that it was \"not a common, established idiom, but rather a playful or poetic expression,\" and suggested potential interpretations. Fair enough.\n\nGoogle AI Overviews are getting less laughably bad, and just, well … useful.\n\nI've gotten more used to seeing them, and as I get used to them, I've also gotten better at predicting if the type of query I'm posing is the kind of thing an AI Overview can answer. And it's working more often than it isn't.",

    "description": "Gregor Konzett quit his dream job at Google and gave up his US visa to be part of a startup accelerator program. Here's how he took a calculated risk.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gregor Konzett, a 27-year-old former Google employee based in London. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I got relocated to work out of Google's Mountain View headquarters in 2024, it was a dream come true.\n\nI was raised in a small village in Austria, but I always dreamed of living in Silicon Valley. As a child who was excited about tech, I wanted to be where innovation happened.\n\nMy team was based in California, but I was working from London. Not even a year into my job, I was asking if I could be transferred.\n\nTwo years after getting hired as a software engineer, Google transferred me to Silicon Valley. Then, a year after that, I quit. I packed up my bags and moved back to London in just two weeks to participate in a startup accelerator program. It was worth the risk, even in this difficult job market.\n\nI joined Google in 2022 as a software engineer on the Google Pixel audio team. I enjoyed my job, but being in London, the physical distance turned minor questions into major delays. If I hit a blocker with a specific subsystem, I'd send a message and wait 24 hours for a reply due to time zone differences, or spend many late nights in chats with colleagues to unblock myself.\n\nAfter I was finally relocated to the Mountain View headquarters, living in the Bay Area was almost exactly as I had always imagined it from movies and TV. California is the most beautiful place I've ever been to, and being able to call it my home was incredible.\n\nIt was great to be part of an environment filled with so many other engineers. I remember going surfing with some people and just having the most Silicon Valley conversation ever about coding and deep tech. The only thing I didn't expect was that it's not this crazy, futuristic place. In reality, the infrastructure was just OK, and the internet speed wasn't even very reliable.\n\nThe work life at the Google headquarters was really nice. On average, it was a typical 9-to-5, and my team had a really great dynamic.\n\nFor the first few months, I was learning a lot, and everything ramped up quickly. My team gave me a lot of responsibility and trusted me to handle huge pieces of the system, which is amazing and rare for a company of its size.\n\nBeing in the office, I got to sit on the same floor as the teams building the specific subsystems I was coding for, and sit in meetings where product decisions were actually made. I could walk 10 feet, point at a whiteboard, and solve complex architectural issues in minutes. I learned \n\nHowever, after about a year, I felt like I had reached a natural ceiling in my work, and I wasn't learning much anymore. I wasn't super happy in my job, and my visa limited me from working on my own projects outside of Google, which was my real dream.\n\nOne of my closest friends got into a startup accelerator program in London and encouraged me to apply, with the plan of using it as an opportunity to cofound our own startup. When I got accepted with a start date only a month away, I knew I'd have to make a quick decision. I loved California, and leaving Google would mean leaving the country.\n\nThe job market has been terrible, and I questioned whether this was the right time to quit my job and potentially face unemployment. However, I felt confident in my technical background and having Google on my résumé, so I believed I could find another job.\n\nThe hardest part about deciding to quit was that it was objectively a really good job, and leaving meant giving up my path to a green card in the US. I was stuck in a dilemma: do I stay in a role I've outgrown for four, or potentially even more years, just to secure permanent residency, or do I quit to chase higher job satisfaction?\n\nI realized that staying for the sake of immigration meant stalling my career development.\n\nI figured now was the time to take a risk. I'm young and have a financial runway from my Google salary, and I don't have a mortgage to pay or a family to care for. So, I put in my two weeks at Google.\n\nIt's been a few months since I joined the program, and my friend and I are working on our startup, Vestry.ai, which fixes the observability gap for complex hardware. Our plan is to build while we're in the accelerator, get funding, and move back to California to live the startup life.\n\nCalifornia is ultimately the place to be for anything in the startup world. We want to be a part of the AI revolution, and that's just where you've got to be.\n\nI've been so busy with the program I haven't really had any time to think about whether I made the right choice, but I'm convinced I'm where I need to be.\n\nDo you have a story to share about quitting Big Tech? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Asia In Brief China’s Cyberspace Administration on Saturday posted draft rules governing the behaviour of AI companions that prohibit using them to serve as friends for the elderly.\n\nThe draft “Interim Measures for the Administration of Humanized Interactive Services Based on Artificial Intelligence” opens with a suggestion that China needs regulations to ensure the healthy development of AIs that “engage in emotional interaction with humans.”\n\nAs is always the case with China’s tech regulations, the draft calls for providers of companion AIs to ensure they are secure, don’t expose users to fraud, encrypt data, and reflect core socialist values. It also includes a requirement for parental controls, and for protection of data that describes minors.\n\nOne Article in the draft addresses how AI companions interact with the elderly:\n\nProviders shall guide elderly people to set up emergency contact persons for their services. If any elderly person is found to be in danger of losing their life, health or property during the use of the service, the provider shall promptly notify the emergency contact person and provide social and psychological assistance or emergency relief channels.\n\nProviders are prohibited from providing services that simulate the relatives or specific relationships of elderly users.\n\nThe draft also calls for AI companions to remind users they are not interacting with a human every two hours, and for providers of such systems to provide advance notice of outages.\n\nAlso among the draft requirements are calls for “mental health protection, emotional boundary guidance, and dependency risk warning, and should not use replacing social interaction, controlling users' psychology, or inducing addiction as design goals.”\n\nThe draft also prohibits using data gathered during interaction with AI companies to train models.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration wants feedback on the draft by January 25th.\n\nAustralia’s Department of Defence has tapped Google for an “enhanced, secure and air-gapped hyperscale cloud capability.”\n\n“Defence will have access to advanced global cloud solutions to deliver key sovereign capabilities,” states the department’s announcement of the deal. “The technology will support faster rollout of critical systems, ongoing upgrades and improved cooperation with international partners, while ensuring Australia retains control of critical Defence assets.”\n\nAustralia’s government already has a deal with AWS to operate three datacenters dedicated to government workloads, including information rated as the nation’s “most classified data.”\n\nThe Department said the sensitivities of the Google deal mean it will “refrain from providing further commentary … with all specific details remaining strictly confidential.”\n\nJapan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has published its initial analysis of the failed launch of its H3 rocket last week.\n\nThe agency found that when the rocket’s fairing separated, pressure in a fuel tank fell. When the engine that used the fuel tank ignited, it produced around 80 percent of expected pressure.\n\nThe rocket’s second stage and payload therefore could not reach the intended orbit. The report suggests both fell into Earth’s atmosphere and burned up safely.\n\n57 percent of components present in Huawei smartphones are now made in China, according to a product teardown reported by Japanese outlet Nikkei.\n\nWorking with Japanese teardown service Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, Nikkei analyzed the content of 2024’s Mate 70 Pro and this year’s Pura 80 Pro, and found 57 percent of components in both were made in China, and that those parts accounted for 60 percent of the phone’s value.\n\nNikkei reports that just 19 percent of components in Huawei’s 2020 models came from China, rising to 32 percent in 2023.\n\nPapua New Guinea’s (PNG’s) National Information & Communications Technology Authority has warned signatories to a petition calling for Starlink to be licensed for operations in the country that they risk prosecution.\n\nPNG is a rugged country with poor telecommunications infrastructure – a fine fit for Starlink’s satellite broadband service. Local netizens have campaigned for PNG to license Starlink, suggesting they email NICTA to express support for Starlink.\n\nOn December 16th NICTA demanded Starlink suspend services to the country.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, NICTA published a list of petitioners and warned “Individuals who have signed or participated in the petition may be regarded as potential offenders, and NICTA will not hesitate to pursue appropriate regulatory and legal action where non-compliance is established.”\n\nStarlink has since ended service in PNG.",

    "description": "A Hindi version of Google's support page suggests that Google is testing a service to let users change their Gmail addresses without sacrificing data.",
    "fullText": "It looks like you may soon be able to change that old email address you made in high school.\n\nGoogle account users have long been unable to change their email addresses without creating a whole new account, but Google seems to be quietly rolling out an option to update them. That's according to a support page published by the company, which outlines a new process to change the email or username used to identify your account.\n\nThe update on Google's account help page says certain account holders can now change their @gmail.com address without losing access to their data or services. The feature was first reported in the Google Pixel Hub Telegram group in a message that said the update is being gradually rolled out to users. As of Friday morning, the modified instructions were available on the Hindi version of Google's support page.\n\nThe support page suggests this option is currently only available in some regions, including Hindi-speaking areas.\n\nAccording to a translated version of the Hindi support page, the new email must end in @gmail.com, and it can only be changed up to three times. Once the address has been changed, it's irreversible.\n\nTo make the change, you would visit your Google Account page, click \"Personal Info,\" and go to the \"Email\" section, according to the Telegram message.\n\nIt's unclear when it will roll out more widely, and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. As of Friday morning, the English support page said usernames ending in @gmail.com usually can't be changed.\n\nOnce the change is made, the Hindi page said, your old Gmail address will be used as an alias to receive emails. You can reuse your old Google account email address at any time, but you can't create a new Gmail address for the next 12 months.\n\nYou can sign in to Google services like Gmail, YouTube, Google Play, or Drive with your old or new email address.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia is forging ahead with another bet on the AI boom, agreeing to a licensing deal with AI hardware startup Groq.\n\nGroq said Wednesday that some of its executives, including its founder and CEO, will join Nvidia as part of the deal. Groq is expected to continue operating independently following what it described as a non-exclusive licensing deal.\n\nGroq is known for its Language Processing Unit, which is a custom chip designed for AI inference, namely, the process by which a trained AI model makes predictions or decisions. The startup was valued at about $6.9 billion as of three months ago and raised around $750 million in its latest funding round.\n\nJonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other members of its team are expected to join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market cap north of $4.5 trillion.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told Business Insider on Wednesday that Nvidia is not acquiring the chip startup.\n\nNeither Nvidia nor Groq disclosed financial terms of the agreement.\n\nRoss and Douglas Wightman were engineers at Google who started the project that became Google's first TPU chips, before leaving to found Groq. The TPUs are custom-made to accelerate large-scale machine-learning tasks designed to handle AI workloads, and are a major rival to Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nThe deal between the two companies comes as a new type of dealmaking is on the rise in Silicon Valley. Whereas traditional startups either aim to go public or be acquired, new acqui-hire deals could leave some startup employees behind, only benefiting a small percentage of staff members with desirable AI skills and the founders.\n\nFor instance, in 2024, Google agreed to pay $2.5 billion to license Character.AI's technology but only hired its two superstar cofounders and 20% of the startup's employees. In the same year, AI developers Adept and Inflection also made similar deals with Amazon and Microsoft, respectively.\n\nMore recently, Meta's acqui-hire of Scale AI became one of the biggest bets on talent after the company agreed to invest roughly $14 billion for a 49% stake and to bring its CEO, Alexandr Wang, into the fold to lead the Meta Superintelligence Labs.\n\nThese acqui-hires don't always end well. Windsurf employees were left in limbo after the AI coding startup was nearly aquired by OpenAI for $3 billion, only for the deal to fall apart and the company to be split. Google spent billions to hire Windsurf's CEO and top engineers, while the remaining hundreds of employees were acquired by another startup, Cognition.",

    "fullText": "Blogging goes mainstream in 2003; and with the launch of Google AdSense, pro blogs emerge too. Also the iTunes store debuts, social networks ramp up, and Flash websites are everywhere.\n\nFlash at full volume: Jamiroquai’s website in 2003.\n\nBlogging and RSS moved into the mainstream in 2003, helped by the emergence of consumer-friendly RSS Readers like NetNewsWire and Bloglines. There was even now an economic model for blogging, with the launch of Google's AdSense in March. Also, online music went legit with Apple's iTunes store, and social networking began to take recognizable form with Friendster and MySpace.\n\n\"Social software\" was a geeky term being used in the blogosphere during this time. So there was an understanding that social aspects would underpin the next web era, even if the tech industry hadn't yet put all the pieces together.\n\nClay Shirky explaining \"social software\" in Esther Dyson's Release 1.0 newsletter; May 2003.\n\nIf there was one company that was putting together the jigsaw puzzle that would later be named Web 2.0, it was Google. In February, Google acquired the leading blogging service of the day: Blogger.\n\n“Google, which runs the Web's premier search site, has purchased Pyra Labs, a San Francisco company that created some of the earliest technology for writing weblogs, the increasingly popular personal and opinion journals,” wrote Silicon Valley reporter Dan Gillmor on February 15, 2003.\n\nNeedless to say, Google's purchase brought blogging even more into the mainstream. Other blogging tools, such as Movable Type, Radio Userland and LiveJournal, gained popularity over 2003 too.\n\nMeanwhile, there was also a revolution happening in reading software. RSS Readers (sometimes called \"news aggregators\") were increasingly being used. Two examples were FeedDemon and NetNewsWire — these were desktop readers, for Windows and Mac respectively. Then in mid-2003, a browser-based RSS Reader called Bloglines launched; by August I was a Bloglines user and have used browser-based readers ever since.\n\nPeople used these new reader apps to RSS became a crucial part of the blogging movement over 2003, because it enabled bloggers to be discovered and their content to be distributed across the internet.\n\nIn addition to buying Blogger, Google was starting to figure out its business model. The company had only recently begun to turn a profit, thanks to its AdWords online advertising platform — introduced in 2000. But when the company launched a contextual advertising system in March, we began to see why blogging was of such interest to Google.\n\nInitially given the descriptive, if clunky, name \"Content-Targeted Advertising,\" Google's new ad product was promoted as \"a new, automated system that matches advertising precisely to the information on content and community pages.\"\n\nGoogle's Content-Targeted Advertising system, 2003.\n\nAdSense opened the door to professional blogging. Nick Denton, previously cofounder of the news syndication company Moreover, was one of the first to take advantage. He'd launched Gawker in January 2003 and by November was telling the New York Times that AdSense was effectively guiding his topic selection:\n\n\"The way Mr. Denton determines the theme of his blogs has less to do with his own personal interests than with the demands of the market, as determined by Google. He relies on Google's AdSense program, which pays Web sites to publish text ads matched to the pages' content, for the bulk of his revenue. As a result, he picks blog subjects based on the rate Google pays for clicks on ads in specific topic areas. Among the topics of blogs he plans to start this year are computer gaming, travel and politics.\"\n\nGawker, a pioneering pro blog, in July 2003.\n\nFriendster launched publicly in March 2003. It wasn’t the first social networking site on the internet: Classmates.com had started in 1995, Six-Degrees.com the following year, and LiveJournal began in 1999 as a kind of blogging spin on the idea. But Friendster was the first of this kind of site to gain major traction in Silicon Valley. It was initially pitched as “a new way to meet people” for dating purposes, “or making new friends.”\n\nDespite its popularity — it had around three million registered users by the fall of 2003 — Friendster was slow and plagued by technical issues. That left the door open for other social networks to enter the market and offer a better product.\n\nMySpace did exactly that, when it launched in August 2003 as “an online community that lets you meet your friends' friends.”\n\nMySpace in September 2003, the month after its launch.\n\nMySpace grew quickly. By October, it had over one hundred thousand users. It was still small fry compared to Friendster, but MySpace users seemed to be having more fun than Friendster users. Partly this was because MySpace allowed people to edit the HTML in their profiles — which meant they could add colourful backgrounds and fonts, and use images and GIFs like on Geocities. This helped MySpace attract a youthful user base, which in turn helped it become the trendy new social network.\n\n2003 was really Friendster's year, but the immediate future would belong to MySpace...although it, too, would leave the door open for competitors. In late-2003, a little website called \"Facemash\" came online — it was created by a Harvard University student named Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nIn April 2003, Steve Jobs launched the iTunes Music Store at a special Apple music event. It offered over 200,000 songs, which you could buy for 99 cents each. Notably, the file format wasn't MP3, but a new format called AAC (Advanced Audio Encoding) encoded at 128 kilobits per second. The file quality was generally viewed favorably, although Sound on Sound commented in a November review:\n\n\"While AAC definitely offers better-quality encoding than MP3 at the same bit rate, Jobs' claim that AAC \"rivals CD quality\" was maybe a little bit of a liberty.\"\n\nThe iTunes store was initially available to Mac computers only; and also restricted to the US for licencing reasons. In October, the store was expanded to Microsoft Windows when iTunes for Windows was launched. But international expansion didn't begin happening until mid-2004 (my country, New Zealand, had to wait until 2005).\n\niTunes Music Store webpage, 29 April 2003.\n\nThe idea with the iTunes Store was that you downloaded the music and owned the file (albeit with DRM — Digital Rights Management). In time, online music would gravitate to the streaming model, which in 2003 was the domain of Rhapsody. But Apple's big advantage was the success of the iPod, which meant it had a complete hardware-software ecosystem. Also, you could listen to your music offline — a key feature in 2003, when internet connectivity was still largely restricted to PCs and laptops.\n\nIn mid-December 2003, Apple announced that more than 25 million songs had been sold from the iTunes store since its April launch. It had also doubled the song catalog to more than 400,000 songs.\n\niTunes user interface; via Sound on Sound, November 2003.\n\nAs game designer and net artist Nathalie Lawhead wrote in a later retrospective, Flash “started as a tool for bringing animations to the web,” but it “eventually grew to being used for building rich, immersive, and very animated websites.” 2003 was smack in the prime years of what Lawhead termed the “Flash website movement (when websites were ‘the new emerging artform’).”\n\nBowieNet version 3 was made entirely of Flash; screenshot circa September 2003.\n\nA showcase for Flash websites during this time was the Favourite Web Awards (FWA), run by Rob Ford. In his review of 2003, Ford highlighted tokyoplastic v1, an experimental Flash site designed by Sam Lanyon Jones and Drew Cope from the UK. \"One of those rare sites that gave you an adrenaline rush (or was that a fright?) when you clicked on the loaded graphic and the site swallowed you up,\" Ford wrote.\n\nJones and Cope later said that the site \"served no purpose just kooky animation, sound design and a bit of interaction.\" While that's underselling their clever use of vector graphics and 3D animation in tokyoplastic v1, it does sum up what Flash brought to the web: a sense of creativity and fun, albeit sometimes it \"served no purpose.\"\n\nSo by the end of 2003, the web felt primed for a new era: social software was going mainstream, web standards were stable while Flash brought the pizzazz, and business models were emerging. Could this be the second generation of the internet coming online?\n\nMore year-by-year overviews of internet history:\n\nMy Web 2.0 memoir, Bubble Blog: From Outsider to Insider in Silicon Valley's Web 2.0 Revolution, is now available to purchase:\n\nOr search for \"Bubble Blog MacManus\" on your local online bookstore.",

    "description": "Jon Rafman has been curating the images since 2008.",
    "fullText": "When Google Street View rolled out in 2007, it became the “world’s photographer.” Since then, artist Jon Rafman has been collecting moments captured by Google’s Street View cars.\n\nThe project is named Nine Eyes to reflect the nine cameras that are fitted to Street View cars. “Unlike traditional photography, these images have no author. The camera records everything but understands nothing,” says the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark, where Rafman is currently exhibiting his project.\n\nSince 2008, Rafman has been carefully selecting images from Street View, starting an archive taken from blogs and websites. He also joined the culture by finding pictures himself.\n\nRafman says that the cars with nine eyes are indifferent about what they photograph. But by curating them in this way, he develops the images in a way akin to how photographers used to develop photos in darkrooms.\n\n“There are the glitches in the technology that points to the artificiality of Street View, the happy accident of the error that creates something beautiful,” says Rafman. “There is also the more noir, hard-boiled street life scenes like the man with the gun, the prostitute, the drunks, all of the seedy underbelly. There is romantic imagery, the surreal, Jeff Wall-like images. There is ironic imagery, there’s the abject, there’s the beautiful, all the different poles of existence.”\n\nThe exhibition at the Louisiana is called Report a Concern, a nod to the message Google used to place in the corner of all its images. It is the first full presentation of the Nine Eyes archive, and as well as the images, it also features new AI-based pieces.\n\n“It explores how technology, surveillance, and memory shape our sense of reality in the digital age,” says the museum. “Nine Eyes invites the viewer to look again, not just at the world, but at the way technology sees it for us.’\n\nThe exhibit is at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlebaek, Denmark, until January 11, 2026.",

    "description": "This year saw new AI models, transformative products and new breakthroughs in science and robotics.",
    "fullText": "This was a year of AI agents, reasoning and scientific discovery.\n\n2025 has been a year of extraordinary progress in research. With artificial intelligence, we can see its trajectory shifting from a tool to a utility: from something people use to something they can put to work. If 2024 was about laying the multimodal foundations for this era, 2025 was the year AI began to really think, act and explore the world alongside us. With quantum computing, we made progress towards real-world applications. And across the board, we helped turn research into reality, with more capable and useful products and tools making a positive impact on people's lives today.\n\nHere’s a look back at some of the breakthroughs, products and scientific milestones that defined the work of Google, Google DeepMind and Google Research in a year of relentless progress.\n\nThis year, we significantly advanced our model capabilities with breakthroughs on reasoning, multimodal understanding, model efficiency, and generative capabilities, beginning with the release of Gemini 2.5 in March and culminating in the November launch of Gemini 3 and the December launch of Gemini 3 Flash.\n\nBuilt on a foundation of state-of-the-art reasoning, Gemini 3 Pro is our most powerful model to date, designed to help you bring any idea to life. It topped the LMArena Leaderboard and redefined multimodal reasoning with breakthrough scores on benchmarks like Humanity’s Last Exam — a fiendishly hard test for AI models to see if AI can truly think and reason like humans — and GPQA Diamond. It also set a new standard for frontier models in mathematics, achieving a new state-of-the-art of 23.4% on MathArena Apex. We followed shortly with Gemini 3 Flash, which combines Gemini 3's Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost, making it the most performant model for its size. Gemini 3 Flash's quality surpasses our previous Gemini 2.5 Pro-scale model's capabilities at a fraction of the price and substantially better latency, continuing our Gemini-era trend of 'the next generation's Flash model is better than the previous generation's Pro model'.\n\nLearn more about our progress on our world-class AI models this year:\n\nGemini 3 Flash price & benchmark table.\n\nWe’re committed to making useful AI technology accessible, with state-of-the-art open models. We built our Gemma family of models to be lightweight and open for public use; this year we were able to introduce multimodal capabilities, significantly increase the context window, expand multilingual capabilities, and improve efficiency and performance.\n\nLearn more about this year’s advances in Gemma models:\n\nThroughout 2025, we continued to advance the trajectory of AI from tool to utility, transforming our portfolio of products with new, powerful agentic capabilities. We reimagined software development by moving beyond tools that assist coding to introducing powerful, agentic systems that collaborate with developers. Key advances, such as the impressive coding capabilities in Gemini 3 and the launch of Google Antigravity, mark a new era in AI-assisted software development.\n\nLearn more about this year’s advances building developer tools:\n\nThis evolution was also clear across our core products, from AI-enabled features on the Pixel 10 and updates to AI Mode in Search, to AI-first innovations like the Gemini app and NotebookLM, which gained advanced features like Deep Research.\n\nLearn more about how we’ve transformed our products with AI:\n\n2025 was a transformative year for generative media, giving people new and unprecedented capabilities to realize their creative ambitions. Generative media models and tools for video, images, audio and worlds became more effective and broadly used, with breakouts Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro offering unprecedented capabilities for native image generation and editing. We worked with people in creative industries to develop tools like Flow and Music AI Sandbox, making them more helpful for creative workflows, and we expanded creative possibilities for people with new, AI-powered experiences in the Google Arts & Culture lab, major upgrades to image editing within the Gemini app, and the introduction of powerful new generative media models like Veo 3.1, Imagen 4 and Flow.\n\nLearn more about how we’re building AI to enhance creativity:\n\nAs research breakthroughs continue to expand AI’s capabilities, Google Labs is where we share AI experiments as we develop them – hearing from users and evolving as we learn. Some of this year’s most engaging experiments from Labs: Pomelli, an AI experiment for on-brand marketing content; Stitch, which introduced a way to turn prompt and image inputs into complex UI designs and frontend code in minutes; Jules, an asynchronous coding agent that acts as a collaborative partner for developers; and Google Beam, a 3D video communications platform that used AI to advance the possibilities of remote presence.\n\nLearn more about how we’re experimenting in Labs:\n\n2025 was also a banner year for scientific advances with AI, marked by breakthroughs in life sciences, health, natural sciences, and mathematics.\n\nIn the space of a year, we made progress in building AI resources and tools that empower researchers and help them understand, identify, and develop treatments in healthcare. In genomics, where we’ve been applying advanced technology to research for 10 years, we moved beyond sequencing, using AI to interpret the most complex data. We also marked the 5-year anniversary of AlphaFold, the Nobel-winning AI system that solved the 50-year-old protein folding problem. AlphaFold has been used by over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries, including over 1 million users in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to advance life sciences and health:\n\nGemini’s advanced thinking capabilities, including Deep Think, also enabled historic progress in mathematics and coding. Deep Think was able to solve problems that require deep abstract reasoning – achieving gold medal-standard in two international contests.\n\nLearn more about how we’re advancing natural sciences and mathematics:\n\nWe’re also leading major discoveries and shaping the future of science in areas like quantum computing, energy and moonshots. Research in this area drew new levels of public attention, with progress towards real-world applications of quantum computing as demonstrated by Quantum Echoes and, notably, Googler Michel Devoret becoming a 2025 Physics Nobel Laureate along with former Googler John Martinis and UC Berkeley’s John Clarke, for their foundational 1980s quantum research.\n\nLearn more about our work on space infrastructure and quantum computing:\n\nIn 2025, we continued to advance the core infrastructure that powers our AI, focusing on breakthroughs in hardware design and improving energy efficiency. This included the introduction of Ironwood, a new TPU built for the age of inference, which was designed using a method called AlphaChip, alongside a commitment to measuring the environmental impact of our technology.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to develop chips, infrastructure and improve energy efficiency:\n\nOur work in robotics and visual understanding brought AI agents into both the physical and virtual worlds, with advancements like the foundational Gemini Robotics models, the more sophisticated Gemini Robotics 1.5, and the introduction of Genie 3 as a new frontier for general-purpose world models.\n\nLearn more about our work with world models and robotics:\n\nOur work throughout 2025 demonstrates how AI-enabled scientific progress is being directly applied to address the world's most critical and pervasive challenges. By leveraging state-of-the-art foundational models and agentic reasoning, we are significantly increasing our understanding of the planet and its systems, while also delivering impactful solutions in areas vital to human flourishing, including climate resilience, public health and education.\n\nFor example, we are using state-of-the-art foundational models and agentic reasoning to help increase our understanding of the planet, helping enable work that is making a difference in people’s lives now from weather predictions to urban planning to public health. For example, our flood forecasting information now covers more than two billion people in 150 countries for severe riverine floods. And our most advanced and efficient forecasting model, WeatherNext 2 can generate forecasts 8x faster and with resolution up to 1-hour. Using this technology, we’ve supported weather agencies in making decisions based on a range of scenarios through our experimental cyclone predictions.\n\nLearn more about our work in weather, mapping and wildfires:\n\nWe are working with partners to apply AI-enabled scientific progress closer to patients, opening up new avenues for disease management and therapeutic discovery.\n\nLearn more about our health-related work:\n\nAI is proving to be a powerful tool in education, enabling new forms of understanding and expanding curiosity through initiatives like LearnLM and Guided Learning in Gemini. We brought Gemini’s most powerful translation capabilities to Google Translate, enabling much smarter, more natural and accurate translations and piloting new speech to speech translation capabilities.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to enable learning:\n\nWe couple our research breakthroughs with rigorous and forward-looking work on responsibility and safety. As our models grow more capable, we’re continuing to advance and evolve our tools, resources and safety frameworks to anticipate and mitigate risk. Gemini 3 demonstrated this approach in action: it's our most secure model yet, and has undergone the most comprehensive set of safety evaluations of any Google AI model to date. And we’re looking further ahead, exploring a responsible path to AGI, prioritizing readiness, proactive risk assessment, and collaboration with the wider AI community.\n\nLearn more about our responsibility and safety work:\n\nAdvancing the frontier of AI responsibly demands collaboration across all parts of society. In 2025, we worked with leading AI labs to help to form the Agentic AI Foundation and support open standards to ensure a responsible and interoperable future for agentic AI. In education, we’ve partnered with school districts like Miami Dade County and education groups like Raspberry Pi to equip students with AI skills. Our research partnerships with universities like UC Berkeley, Yale, the University of Chicago and many more have been instrumental to some of this year’s most exciting frontier research, and we’re working with the US Department of Energy’s 17 national laboratories to transform how scientific research is conducted. And we’re working with filmmakers and other creative visionaries to put the best AI tools in their hands and explore storytelling in the age of AI.\n\nLearn more about our work on frontier collaboration:\n\nAs we look towards 2026, we’re looking forward to continuing to advance the frontier, safely and responsibly, for the benefit of humanity.",

Tech companies commonly use it to transition staff from H-1 B status to a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US.\n\nTech employees on work visas have faced increased uncertainty this year due to policy changes, such as the rise in H-1B visa fees. Google's lawyers recently advised employees with work visas, such as the H-1B, to avoid international travel due to \"significant\" delays, Business Insider reported.\n\nAccording to the memo about PERM, only those who meet certain criteria will be eligible for the application. One requirement is that employees must work in a role that requires a degree and prior work experience.\n\nThe memo also said that staff must work from a Google office to be considered.\n\n\"Remote Googlers must agree to transfer to an office to be PERM eligible,\" the memo read.\n\nA Google spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe PERM process is designed to ensure that hiring foreign workers doesn't harm the job opportunities or working conditions of US workers. As such, the company sponsoring the worker must prove that there are no available qualified US citizens who can fill the role.\n\nGoogle paused PERM applications in January 2023, the same month it laid off 12,000 employees, Business Insider previously reported. Amazon, Meta, and other tech companies similarly put the brakes on PERM as a wave of job cuts made it harder to justify hiring outside the US, as per the program's terms.\n\nThe sweeping layoffs meant the market was flooded with people looking for work, making it harder for employers to hire foreign workers.\n\nGoogle applied for PERM for a small handful of employees throughout this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The announcement about 2026 marks a scaling up of the program, the person said.\n\nGoogle told staff in the memo that there is a bar to clear for PERM applications. Employees who are at Level 3 roles or below will be less likely to meet the requirements, the memo said.\n\nIt also said that Google employees would not be considered for PERM if they are \"not in good standing\" with the company.\n\n\"Googlers must have a MI rating or higher to be eligible for PERM,\" it read. MI means \"moderate impact\" — a rating Googlers can be given in their yearly performance reviews.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "Google has advised some employees on visas not to travel outside the US due to delays at embassies, Business Insider has learned.\n\nThe company's outside counsel BAL Immigration Law sent an email on Thursday advising staff who require a visa stamp to re-enter the US not to leave the country because visa processing was taking longer than usual, according to a copy of the memo reviewed by Business Insider.\n\n\"Please be aware that some US Embassies and Consulates are experiencing significant visa stamping appointment delays, currently reported as up to 12 months,\" the memo read. It was recommended that employees avoid international travel as they would \"risk an extended stay outside the US.\"\n\nAmerican consulates and embassies around the world are seeing delays with routine visa appointments following the introduction of a new social media screening requirement, which applies to H-1B visa workers and their dependents, as well as students and exchange visitors.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for the Department of State told Business Insider it was conducting \"online presence reviews for applicants.\" The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"While in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else,\" the State Department spokesperson said. Appointments in Ireland and Vietnam have also been postponed, according to immigration firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC.\n\nGoogle's lawyers said in the memo that the delays were affecting H-1B, H-4, F, J, and M visas. The advisory did not specify what anyone on a visa already outside the country with a postponed appointment should do.\n\nA Google spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nGoogle's warning echoes a wave of internal travel advisories that swept through corporate America in September, as the Trump administration imposed a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas.\n\nThe H-1B visa typically lasts up to three years and can often be extended. If someone needs a new H-1B visa stamp, they typically must apply at a US embassy or consulate in their home country or a country where they have lawful residence.\n\nAs a general matter, said immigration attorney Jason Finkelman, who focuses on employment and family immigration, foreign nationals should be able to return to the US after travel abroad if they have a valid visa stamp and aren't subject to any entry restrictions, including the Trump administration's expanded travel ban, which the White House says takes effect January 1.\n\nThat's where enhanced vetting can complicate an otherwise routine trip. If an H-1B worker leaves the US to get a new visa stamp and their consular appointment is canceled or delayed — sometimes by months — they can be stuck abroad until the visa is issued.\n\n\"My advice to clients is that if travel isn't essential right now, better to stay put,\" Finkelman said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of State said consular officers \"do not issue a visa unless the applicant can credibly demonstrate they meet all requirements under US law — including that they intend to engage only in activities consistent with the terms of their visa.\"\n\nThe H-1B program, which is capped at 85,000 new visas a year, serves as a core pipeline for employers hiring skilled foreign workers. Tech giants have long been among the largest users of the visa, with companies such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta topping the lists of approved new H-1B petitions in recent years. ￼\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the program has become a political flash point, with the White House framing H-1Bs as a threat to American jobs and rolling out measures that critics and employers say make it harder and more expensive to hire new workers.",

    "fullText": "Each morning, you can brew your coffee, brush your teeth — and read your Google AI briefing.\n\nGoogle Labs announced a new AI productivity tool on Tuesday, titled CC. Built with Gemini, CC prepares a morning rundown of priorities based on the user's Gmail, Calendar, and Drive. Google users can also email CC at any time to perform tasks such as setting reminders, scheduling events, or summarizing emails.\n\nCC comes from Google Labs, the division of Google that started \"Project Tailwind\" in 2022. That later produced NotebookLM, Google's AI research tool that was a breakout hit.\n\nAfter a few hours on the waitlist, I was approved to receive my own CC briefing. At 5:18 a.m. the following morning, \"Your Day Ahead\" hit my inbox, with Google AI celebrating the coming weekend. Here's what it had:\n\nI get dozens of newsletters. I emailed back: \"Hey CC, can you pick out the four most important stories in all the unread newsletters in my inbox that I should read?\"\n\nMy CC said that it \"couldn't find many newsletters from today,\" only finding one from CNN that it said it was \"unable to pull a full summary\" of. That was odd: There were also two unread New York Times newsletters, one from New York magazine, and one from GQ.\n\nIt did pull four articles from yesterday's newsletters, though, offering me three Vanity Fair stories and one from The Atlantic.\n\nI decided to try a simpler task. Sometimes Letterboxd will send out free or discounted movie tickets, but the offers get stuck in my \"promotions\" folder. Were there any offers I should know about?\n\nMy CC responded with five different discounts for movies like \"No Other Choice\" and \"The Voice of Hind Rajab.\" I wouldn't know those offers existed if I hadn't asked!\n\nFor me, that's the real promise of Google's CC: To go through the endless promotional emails and decide what you should know. It's a deals magnet, without having to rummage through the spam folder.\n\nI'm sure CC would be a great enterprise workplace tool, but it's not yet allowed. The waitlist is open to Google users in the United States and Canada who are 18 years old or older who use a personal email. No enterprise accounts are permitted.\n\nIf you want to give Google's CC tool a try, you can join the wait list here.",

    "description": "Discover the inside story of Google Sans, Google’s iconic brand typeface. From product lockups to code, learn how the Google Sans font family has evolved to solve specific UX design problems.",
    "fullText": "How seven design problems shaped Google’s iconic typeface — from inception to going open-source\n\nSometimes, design elements are birthed in flashes of inspiration — What if our interfaces were like paper? What if YouTube was a little more pink? — but not Google’s brand typeface.\n\nGoogle Sans is the iconic typeface used across every Google product from Search to Wallet. It’s one of the most-served fonts on the internet, clocking in at some 120 billion font requests a month. It wasn’t born from a single brilliant sprint or creative spark. It evolved as the answer to a set of specific design problems, an answer that continued to expand and adapt to meet the shifting needs of users, designers, and developers. Now, after nearly a decade on Pixel phones and in Google apps, Google Sans is making its next big move: going open-source.\n\nRead on for a brief history of Google’s beloved font, told through the design problems that shaped it.\n\nThe 2015 logo redesign was a smashing success. But even before its pixels were perfected, the team realized their work was only just beginning. Hundreds of product lockups — the fixed arrangement of the logo paired with each product name — had to be updated to match.\n\n“The majority of how people experience the Google brand is through typography, whether that’s in a product, marketing, or content. We had the Google logo and identity framework, but we were missing that connective tissue,” explains Ken Frederick, former UX Lead for Google’s Brand Studio.\n\nDesigners considered treating each lockup as a unique logo, but the sheer volume of work made this approach unscalable. So, a new typeface was born based on the clean geometric forms of the new logo: Product Sans. The font’s repeating geometric shapes and tightly spaced characters made it perfectly suited for big product names at big sizes. Many Google apps still use these lockups today.\n\nIf a designer sees a gorgeous typeface, they’ll want to use it. Team members in Marketing loved the look of Product Sans and asked for it to be expanded for use in advertising. But in practice, the typeface fell short when you only had a couple of seconds to catch consumers’ eyes. At the same time, product designers started playing around with using Product Sans in interfaces. The results? Not great. Product Sans wasn’t optimal for lengthy passages of text, or at the smaller text sizes used on phones and tablets. Google’s designers needed a more versatile brand typeface. Enter: Google Sans.\n\n“It wasn't a top-down decision,” notes Tobias Kunisch, Design Lead for Google Fonts. “Google Sans was driven by the needs of designers, with product teams showing what was needed. That’s how our brand font really came together.”\n\nThe Google Fonts team learned from their experience with Product Sans and asked Colophon Foundry to meticulously optimize the character shapes, terminals, ascenders, descenders, x-heights, and stroke contrasts of the new typeface, ensuring that Google Sans would perform beautifully in large display text across both marketing and product surfaces. This is the iconic Google typeface that you see everywhere from billboards to UI headlines.\n\nWhen Google Sans rolled out in 2018, designers were initially ecstatic. “It meant we could finally use typography for a stronger brand statement,” recalls UX Designer Miche Alvarez. “But it also created a dual-font system using Google Sans for larger display text and Roboto for smaller text. It ended up being a compromise.”\n\nDesigners fought for a Google Sans version that would work at smaller sizes. So the team collaborated with designers in Search and at Colophon Foundry to refine the font, ultimately launching Google Sans Text (GST) in 2020.\n\nUnlike the geometric Google Sans, the characters in Google Sans Text are taller, more condensed, and less circular. The typeface also includes more spacing between characters to aid readability. The numerals are less geometric, and the angled cuts on terminals are less severe, creating a more uniform and readable experience, even at small sizes. It was also designed to match the proportions of Roboto, Android’s default typeface, to make switching from Roboto a smoother process.\n\nGoogle Sans Text rolled out on the Pixel 3, creating a more unified typographic experience.\n\nProduct teams eagerly adopted Google Sans and Google Sans Text but soon highlighted a new issue: Billions of people around the globe use non-Latin scripts like Arabic, Chinese, and Thai — writing systems not included in the initial character sets of Google Sans.\n\n“Our mission is ‘to organize the world's information,’” explains Dave Crossland, the Lead UX Program Manager for Google Fonts. “There was a clear need to expand Google Sans to all the languages that Google’s products get localized into.”\n\nThe effort was monumental. It meant meticulously crafting hundreds of thousands of new glyphs across more than 20 additional writing systems, each with its own unique design principles and visual nuances. The undertaking involved collaborating with expert type foundries worldwide, specialists familiar with the intricate requirements of each script — from the flowing curves of Arabic to the complex strokes of Japanese and the distinct forms of Ge’ez, the script used for Ethiopian and other languages in that region.\n\nAll together, this massive global language support makes Google Sans one of the world’s largest typeface families.\n\nGoogle Sans Mono was created in 2020 to support contexts that needed fixed-width characters for editorial design, at medium and large text sizes. Despite this, it soon got its first big product integration, replacing Roboto Mono in Google Chat. The only problem? Developers hated it.\n\nBecause the font wasn’t intended to be used at smaller sizes, the letterforms weren’t legible. It was especially difficult to tell the a and o apart. “That can actually be catastrophic for code,” says Tobias Kunisch. “One misplaced character can break an entire program.”\n\nRecognizing this critical need, a dedicated effort was launched to craft Google Sans Code, a monospaced typeface specifically designed to make code more readable. This involved thorough research into the 20 most common programming languages and how developers interact with code, aiming to make the new coding typeface more visually appealing while reducing the ambiguity of similar-looking letterforms. Based on these insights, Google tasked the Universal Thirst foundry to meticulously focus on specific letters, numbers, and operators to meet these requirements. The result is an eminently readable and surprisingly playful typeface.\n\nGoogle Sans Code launched as an open-source font in 2025, and is the typeface used to display code in Gemini.\n\nAs interfaces grow more dynamic and personal, our designers need typography that does more than just present information; the type should also convey feeling and adapt to varying contexts and states. While Google Sans was clear and effective, it didn’t offer the nuanced expressive range required to truly match a product’s mood or a user’s preference.\n\nThis led us to collaborate with the pioneers in variable font technology at Font Bureau to create Google Sans Flex. Unlike traditional fonts that have a handful of fixed styles like bold and italic, Google Sans Flex offers granular control over six different design axes: weight, width, optical size, slant, grade, and roundedness.\n\n“Google Sans Flex is a power tool for expression,” says Google Fonts Product Manager Sophia Siao. “Different combinations of axes can unlock a huge range of feeling and emotion, all while preserving a cohesive reading experience.”\n\nGoogle Sans Flex lets designers “sculpt” UI text with remarkable precision. Imagine making text feel “calm as a whisper” or “loud and rugged” simply by adjusting its weight, or evoking a “personal, playful” tone by fine-tuning its roundness. Our designers were particularly excited by the ability to precisely adjust how rounded or soft the text appears; these subtle shifts deeply influence how readers experience and connect with a design.\n\nThis expressive power isn’t just about aesthetics; it directly impacts how users experience Google products. Our research engaged over 3,000 readers, which taught us one thing: flexibility matters. Readers found the taller, more elegant styles to be more premium and engaging than standard fonts. This adaptability doesn't just look better; it allows designers to tailor readability for every specific use case. The optical size axis intelligently adapts letter shapes to maintain readable proportions at any size, from a smartwatch to a billboard, ensuring that expressiveness never comes at the expense of legibility. The typeface was recognized as a Red Dot Winner 2024.\n\nUltimately, Google Sans Flex empowers designers to infuse interfaces with distinct personality and nuance, creating digital experiences that feel more intuitive, personal, and genuinely helpful.\n\nGoogle Sans launched as a proprietary brand typeface — meaning that it could only be used in Google products. While that control was great for protecting Google’s brand, it created a fragmented typographic experience across the digital ecosystem. You might see Google Sans in Gmail, then open WhatsApp and see Roboto or a device-specific font. It’s a persistent, if subtle, point of friction.\n\n“It just doesn’t feel as nice,” stresses Visual Designer Megan Lynch. “On a subconscious level it impacts the experience.” This fragmented visual language, unlike the unified font experiences on some other platforms, made the digital journey less than seamless.\n\nSo this year — 2025 — Google decided to make Google Sans and Google Sans Flex open-source. It isn’t just about making a great font available; it’s about fostering a more consistent and polished digital environment for everyone. By offering Google Sans and Google Sans Flex to the wider community, we hope more developers and designers will bridge the visual gap between first-party and third-party apps. The goal is a more unified experience across devices and platforms, creating clearer, more comfortable interfaces for users wherever they engage with technology.\n\nThe story of Google Sans is a masterclass in need-based design — it was created not by a single flash of inspiration, but a thoughtful, human-centered evolution. Each problem, from misaligned lockups to illegible code, revealed an unmet need and ultimately led to innovation and improved user experience.\n\nTry Google Sans Flex, as well as our other fonts, at Google Fonts.\n\nSpecial thanks to the hundreds of people who have contributed to making and evolving Google Sans, including: Akaki Razmadze, Aleksandra Samulenkova, Alex Blattmann, Alexei Vanyashin, Ali Almasri, Anagha Narayanan, Anaïs Lievens, Andy Stewart, Anonta Mon, Anthony Sheret, Anurag Gautam, Anuthin Wongsunkakon, Ashler, Ben Mitchell (Fontpad), Bianca Berning, Black Foundry, Borna Izadpanah, Botio Nikoltchev, Cadson Demak, Carmen Eva Marseille, Chris Simpkins, Colophon Foundry, Dalton Maag, Damien Correll, Daniel Grumer, Daniel Yacob, Dave Crossland, David Berlow, Denis Moyogo Jacquerye, Edd Harrington, Eduardo Rennó, Elena Peralta, Erin McLaughlin, Fiona Ross, Font Bureau, Fontef, Gor Design, Gor Jihanian, Gunjan Panchal, Gunnar Vilhjálmsson, Hanna Donker, Harry Dalton, Hilary Palmén, Hitesh Malaviya, Irene Vlachou, Jack McCabe, Jamra Patel, Jany Belluz, Jimmy Mooney, Joana Ranito, Jonathan Lee, Jonny Pinhorn, Jotika Khur-Yearn, Kalapi Gajjar, Khaled Hosny, Knaz Uiyamathiti, Lipi Raval, Mamoun Sakkal, Marc Foley, Marianna Paszkowska, Mark Jamra, Megan Lynch, Meir Sadan, Michele Patanè, Mike Guss, Mohamed Gaber, Namrata Goyal, Nance Cunningham, Natalia Qadreh, Neil Patel, Nikolaus Waxweiler, Omer Ziv, Pablo Bosch, Panuwat Usakunwathana, Pathum Egodawatta, Patrick McCormick, Pratyush Das, Riccardo De Franceschi, Richard Bailey, Ricky Atkins, Salomi Desai, Samir Souza Reis, Santiago Orozco, Simon Cozens, Sophia Siao, Sovichet Tep, Stephen Morey, Suppakit Chalermlarp, Tobias Kunisch, U+ Type, Universal Thirst, Vaishnavi Murthy, Yanek Iontef, and Ye Myat Lwin.\n\nShout out to Sarah Daily and Susanna Zaraysky for additional reporting.

    "description": "Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot says a 15-year financial guarantee from Google was the key to unlocking billions in project financing from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.",
    "fullText": "The \"crypto miner\" label is becoming a relic of the past for Hut 8 (HUT).\n\nIn a move that signals a massive strategic shift, Hut 8 announced a $7 billion deal to build a data center complex in Louisiana for Anthropic (ANTH.PVT). The move effectively trades the volatility of bitcoin (BTC-USD) for the high-margin stability of AI infrastructure.\n\n\"We think that the value of energy will continue to go up, and so for us, we [had] to be patient and figure out what was a fair deal that added value to our customers, but that drove a strong return to our shareholders,\" Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nThe market is rewarding the transformation. The energy infrastructure company's stock surged roughly 20% on Wednesday following the announcement as investors cheered its potential to secure blue-chip partners in a crowded field.\n\nBeyond the one-day pop, the stock has been a standout in the mining-to-AI pivot, fueled by the company's deep energy assets and its strategic partnership with American Bitcoin (ABTC), a Trump family enterprise in which Hut 8 holds a 60% stake. Year to date, Hut 8 stock is up 90%.\n\nThe linchpin of the Louisiana project is a financial guarantee from Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which guarantees payments of the 15-year lease if Fluidstack, an AI cloud infrastructure provider, cannot meet them. The deal secures 245 megawatts (MW) of capacity, with the possibility to scale up to 2,300 MW within that timeframe — a move that could swell the total lease value to $17.7 billion.\n\n\"We're very excited because it's the first domino to fall,\" Genoot said. \"If we're able to continue to scale and build up to that full strategic partnership on 2,300 MW, we see a lot of growth upside for the company and the deal overall.\"\n\nThe creditworthiness was the key. Genoot noted that without Google's involvement, securing project financing from titans like JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) at favorable rates would have been nearly impossible.\n\nHe added that Google has a \"strong core business,\" including diversified cash flows from Search, YouTube, and cloud services, making the tech giant's pledge the ultimate security for a 15-year infrastructure play.\n\nHowever, securing the money is only half the battle. Competitors have seen their stocks hammered due to construction delays. Genoot claims Hut 8 has de-risked the execution side, partly by issuing a \"conservative delivery schedule\" and tapping local labor.\n\nThe company has turned to established industrial partners, including Jacobs Engineering for design and local contractors like Cajun Electric for electrical services. By scheduling the first data hall delivery for Q2 2027, Genoot said the company is avoiding the \"crunch\" of unrealistic timelines that has plagued the sector.",

    "description": "Harris Beber says that when he finds a role that aligns with these 3 things, he's able to find the most fulfillment in his career.",
    "fullText": "It's human nature to reach for the shiny object in front of you — but Monday.com's CMO says it's worth pausing before you accept the first job offer that comes along.\n\nHarris Beber has acted as the CMO of Vimeo, Global CMO of Google Workspace, and also held marketing executive positions at other companies including Amazon. He's no stranger to changing jobs — and he believes switching roles can be the right move when the work no longer feels fulfilling.\n\nIn the past, Beber told Business Insider that he's explored new roles in times when he was doing really well at work but feeling unfulfilled. That feeling can't last forever, he said.\n\n\"Eventually your work will suffer, your performance will suffer, and it doesn't end well for anyone,\" Beber said.\n\nTo avoid acting out of desperation or necessity, Beber said he tries to map out his next role before he gets to the point of needing a new job. The CMO said it's important to know your criteria for success when thinking about what's next.\n\n\"What is really important to you? What are your non-starters? And if you can look at those objectively, then when you have opportunities, you can measure it against something objective,\" Beber said.\n\nHe said he's used 3 P's to determine if his last few roles were the right fit: people, product, and position.\n\nIn regards to the first P, Beber said he tries to evaluate whether the people he's going to work with are right for him. He said it's \"not easy to get up every day\" and work with people you don't like or who don't treat others well.\n\nIn one job, Beber said he worked for a difficult leader who yelled, \"put intense pressure\" on the team, and treated him and others poorly. He said he would never work in that kind of environment again.\n\nBeyond working with respectful coworkers, Beber said it's also important to make sure that the people you work alongside have complementary skills that will help you work well together.\n\nIf you're a marketer, when it comes to evaluating the product you're selling, Beber said, it's important to understand the user base and product offerings.\n\n\"Do you care about it? Does it excite you? It's really hard to sell something to other people if you don't understand it or aren't excited by it,\" the CMO said.\n\nBeber said he made the mistake of once taking the wrong role at a sports tech startup. He said he really liked the people, but he's \"not a sports person,\" and didn't understand the product. Beber said he ultimately didn't find happiness in that job.\n\nWhen it comes to evaluating the position, Beber said he wants to find a role where he feels aligned and can add value to the company.\n\n\"Is what I'm great at? What the company needs?\" Beber said.\n\nBeber said he's felt the most fulfilled in his career when those three criteria line up. People are \"really good at selling themselves\" on why an opportunity seems perfect in the moment, he said, which is why measuring the offer against something objective is critical.\n\nWhen someone makes you a job offer, \"they're going to tell you every reason why you're perfect for the role and why it's going to be great,\" Beber said. \"But as anyone goes into a new role, very rarely is it exactly what you thought it would be.\"",

    "description": "The Google DeepMind CEO warns that some early AI startups are overvalued and the current pace of funding won't last.",
    "fullText": "Demis Hassabis has a blunt message for parts of the AI startup world: Some of this looks unsustainable.\n\nThe DeepMind cofounder and CEO said in an episode of \"Google DeepMind: The Podcast\" published Tuesday that there are likely \"bubbles\" forming in today's AI funding frenzy, particularly among early-stage startups raising money at huge valuations.\n\nSome startups \"basically haven't even got going yet,\" he said, yet are raising at \"tens of billions of dollars valuations just out of the gate.\"\n\n\"It's sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. You know, my guess is probably not, at least not in general,\" he added.\n\nHassabis drew a distinction between those sky-high seed rounds and the large tech companies pouring billions into AI infrastructure. There's \"a lot of real business\" underpinning Big Tech's valuations, he said.\n\nAI is \"overhyped in the short term\" but \"still underappreciated in the medium to long-term,\" he added.\n\nHassabis said an \"over-correction\" is imminent for any major technology shift like AI, especially when it goes from skepticism to obsession quickly.\n\n\"When we started DeepMind, no one believed in it,\" he said. \"Fast forward 10, 15 years, and now, obviously, it seems to be the only thing people talk about in business.\"\n\nThat kind of swing often pushes valuations too far and too fast. \"It's almost an overreaction to the underreaction,\" he said.\n\nHassabis also said he isn't worried about whether AI is in a bubble — he's focused on his job. Google DeepMind builds the AI models that power Google's products, including Gemini, and leads the company's frontier AI research.\n\nHassabis' comments come as AI startups continue to rake in soaring valuations.\n\nBusiness Insider reported last week that young founders — some of whom are fresh out of school — are raising millions for their AI startups. Many have dropped out to ride the AI wave, pulling in top investors and talent.\n\nA Stanford graduate dropout raised $64 million for her AI math startup earlier this year. Carina Hong, the founder of Axiom Math, even recruited top AI talent from Meta and Google Brain.\n\nThe 16 young founders Business Insider spoke with this year have secured over $100 million in funding.\n\nBut not everyone is buying the hype. Howard Marks, the cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management, said on an episode of \"We Study Billionaires\" podcast published last week that investors are flocking to AI startups with little track record.\n\n\"Do you want to have a novel entrepreneurial startup pure play which has no revenues and no profits today, but could be a moonshot if it works?\" the billionaire asked.\n\n\"Or do you want to invest in a great tech company, which is already existing and making a lot of money where AI could be incremental but not life-changing? It's a choice.\"",

    "description": "Google's TPU business is ramping up. Here's everything you need to know about Google's AI chips, and what they mean for Nvidia's dominance.",
    "fullText": "Google has been in the AI chip game for more than a decade. Now its custom hardware is moving markets.\n\nShares of Nvidia and other chipmakers tumbled last month following a report that Meta — one of Nvidia's largest customers — was exploring a deal to use Google's AI chips, known as Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs.\n\nGoogle has primarily used its TPUs for internal use, but it also leases them to external customers through the cloud. Nvidia, meanwhile, has become the dominant provider of AI chips with its graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nGoogle has a potential blockbuster business to unlock. In a research note sent December 2, Morgan Stanley projected that 5 million of Google's TPUs will be purchased in 2027 and about 7 million in 2028, significantly increasing its prior projections.\n\nHere's a breakdown of everything you need to know about TPUs, what they're used for, and when they might become a more prominent threat to Nvidia's chip dominance.\n\nOver a decade ago, Google needed more powerful and specialized compute power for the type of AI work it wanted to do. A team led by the now-CEO of Groq, Jonathan Ross, designed a new chip based on a specific type of integrated circuit for machine learning. The TPU was born.\n\nGoogle has continued to improve and refine its TPUs over the years, making them more effective at both training models and inference, the process where a trained model answers a question or performs a task. As large language models have grown in size, Google has also increased the memory bandwidth of later TPUs to handle these bigger workloads.\n\nGoogle says its latest \"Ironwood\" TPU, which the company is making widely available, is more than four times better than its predecessor for both training and inference.\n\nNvidia's GPU cards, which launched in 1999, were originally designed for gaming, not AI. When researchers later discovered that the chips were useful for tasks such as training neural networks, Nvidia doubled down on the AI market.\n\nGoogle's TPUs, on the other hand, were designed for AI from the get-go. Being more specialized means they're more efficient than Nvidia's chips at some tasks, and faster for running select AI models. They have something called a systolic array, which lets a more constant stream of data pass through the chip, rather than having to keep fetching more from memory.\n\nWhere Google's TPUs have a big edge is in cost at scale. It's possible to have thousands of TPUs working in tandem in a single \"pod.\" Because they are faster at some calculations than GPUs, running many TPUs at once can sometimes be more cost-efficient.\n\nThat may become more important as companies increase investments at the inference stage, which Google says its latest TPU is especially good at. That could save companies money.\n\nOne advantage that Nvidia has over Google is its CUDA software, which makes it possible for regular applications to use GPUs for general computing tasks — not just for graphics. CUDA also only works with Nvidia chips, one of the biggest points of friction stopping companies from switching to Google's chips.\n\nGoogle is trying to change that. For example, there is a lot of industry demand to have TPUs better support Pytorch, a popular tool for building AI applications that was created inside Meta. Google is allocating more resources and attention to better supporting Pytorch, which data suggests is seeing much more demand than Google's own Tensorflow software, according to Google employees and industry experts.\n\nWhen it comes to TPUs, Google remains its own biggest customer. It uses the chips across the company to power products like Search and Maps. Its latest Gemini 3 model was trained on TPUs.\n\nWhile Google has prioritized its own needs, it has leased its TPUs to other customers. Apple used TPUs to train its in-house AI model, Business Insider previously reported. In October, Anthropic announced a blockbuster deal with Google that it says will see it using up to 1 million TPUs. Broadcom, which helps build the TPU chips for Google, revealed in its Q4 earnings call this week that it has received a total of $21 billion in orders from Anthropic for Google's Ironwood TPUs.\n\nMeta is also in early testing of Google's TPUs, according to a person familiar with the matter, although it's not clear if it will result in a long-term deal.\n\nGoogle's TPU business could be poised to explode in the coming years. In a research note this month, Morgan Stanley wrote that every 500,000 TPU chips sold could potentially add around $13 billion in revenue to Google's balance sheet in 2027.\n\nHaving TPUs isn't just a potential revenue boost for Google. It also gets a feedback loop in using TPUs to run and train its AI models, learning from them, and changing how it develops its next chips to be better at the things Google needs.\n\nNvidia's GPU is still very much the chip du jour, but other tech giants are increasingly pouring resources into their own custom chips. Amazon just announced its new Trainium3 custom AI chip, which the company says can cut the cost of training and powering AI models in half compared with a GPU.\n\nMany TPU buyers are also Nvidia customers, and some industry insiders told Business Insider that it's more likely that the rise of more specialized chips will see companies and labs diversify the chips they use, rather than going all in on one provider.\n\nThat could still hurt Nvidia, which could lose pricing power as a result of a more diverse market.\n\nHowever, even if Google's TPU business finds more momentum, it doesn't mean Nvidia will suddenly crumble overnight. Jordan Nanos, member of technical staff of research firm SemiAnalysis, said his firm believes companies, including Nvidia, Google, and Amazon, will all \"sell lots\" of chips in the future.\n\n\"We don't see TPU as a significant threat to Nvidia's business, but it has been a real player in the market for many years,\" said Nanos. \"It is possible that Google sells TPU servers externally in the future, to many more customers. Right now, they are very selective.\"\n\nHave something to share? Contact this reporter via email at hlangley@businessinsider.com or Signal at hughlangley.01.

    "fullText": "Sergey Brin has been dogfooding Google's AI on his commute.\n\nThe Google cofounder has been back in the thick of the company's AI development after stepping down as president of Alphabet in 2019, returning in recent years to work on Gemini.\n\nAt a Stanford University panel last week, an audience member asked Brin how he stayed sharp. What podcasts did Brin listen to in the car?\n\n\"I do talk to Gemini Live in the car often,\" Brin said. \"I just talk to it about stuff on my drive.\"\n\nBrin gave an example of what he asked Gemini Live while driving: \"I want to develop a data center, I need how many hundreds of megawatts of this kind of power, that kind of power, how much it's going to cost.\"\n\nGemini Live is Google's voice-enabled AI chatbot. The company first demoed the product in May 2024 at Google I/O and made it freely available in September 2024.\n\nFor car-chatting enthusiasts, Brin recommended drivers \"shouldn't do it now, because we have a way better version coming.\"\n\n\"The publicly available version right now is not the good version,\" he said. \"Give me a few weeks to actually ship what I have access to.\"\n\nBrin said that the current available version of Gemini Live is backed by an \"ancient model.\"\n\nGoogle's recent model updates have made waves in the AI world. In November, the company debuted Gemini 3. The model is more visual, Google said, and its \"most factual\" model to date.\n\nGemini 3 was also the first model Google added directly to search on day one. Users could immediately access it by clicking \"AI Mode,\" rather than having to visit a separate app or website.\n\nThe other LLM makers took note. Meta employees now have access to Gemini 3 Pro.\n\nOn the panel, Brin acknowledged that his answer to the driving question seemed \"kind of self-advertising.\" He does listen to some podcasts, he said.\n\n\"The 'All In' guys are actually one of my favorites,\" he said. Brin has appeared on the podcast multiple times.",

    "description": "An upgraded Gemini 2.5 Native Audio model across Google products and live speech translation in the Google Translate app.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this week, we introduced greater control over audio generation with an upgrade to our Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash Text-to-Speech models.\n\nBut generating expressive speech is only one side of the conversation. Today, we’re releasing an updated Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio for live voice agents. This update improves the model’s ability to handle complex workflows, navigate user instructions, and hold natural conversations.\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio is now available across Google products including Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and has also started rolling out in Gemini Live and Search Live, bringing the naturalness of native audio to Search Live for the first time. This means you can more effectively brainstorm live with Gemini, get real-time help in Search Live, or build the next generation of enterprise-ready customer service agents.\n\nBeyond powering helpful agents, native audio unlocks new possibilities for global communication. We’re introducing live speech translation, a capability that enables streaming speech-to-speech translation for headphones. It preserves the speaker’s intonation, pacing and pitch. This beta experience is rolling out in the Google Translate app starting today.\n\nTo enable the breadth of use cases across surfaces and products, we have improved Gemini 2.5 Native Audio in three key areas:\n\nThe updated Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio’s performance against previous versions and industry competitors on ComplexFuncBench\n\nGoogle Cloud customers are already using Gemini’s native audio capabilities to drive real business results, from mortgage processing to customer calls.\n\nGemini now natively supports new live speech-to-speech translation capabilities designed to handle both continuous listening and two-way conversation.\n\nWith continuous listening, Gemini automatically translates speech in multiple languages into a single target language. This allows you to put headphones in and hear the world around you in your language.\n\nFor two-way conversation, Gemini’s live speech translation handles translation between two languages in real-time, automatically switching the output language based on who is speaking. For example, if you speak English and want to chat with a Hindi speaker, you’ll hear English translations in real-time in your headphones, while your phone broadcasts Hindi when you’re done speaking.\n\nGemini’s live speech translation has a number of key capabilities that help in the real world:\n\nStarting today, you can try it in a new beta experience in the Google Translate app for real-time translation in your headphones by connecting them to your device and tapping “Live translate.” This experience is rolling out to all Android devices in the US, Mexico and India with support for iOS and more regions coming soon.\n\nBased on feedback, we will continue to iterate on this experience and bring it to more Google products including the Gemini API in 2026.\n\nStart building voice agents today with Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio, now generally available on Vertex AI and as preview in the Gemini API. Try it out in Google AI Studio.\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash and 2.5 Pro text-to-speech models are also available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio. Get started with the speech generation docs, explore the prompting guide, or check out the Gemini API Cookbook to get started.",

    "description": "Adtech company Fluency uses automation, and now AI agents, to run digital ad campaigns across the web, Meta, Google, TikTok, and more.",
    "fullText": "Adtech company Fluency has built a platform that helps brands and agencies automate their campaigns across Meta, TikTok, Google, and other platforms. Now, it aims to introduce AI agents to the mix.\n\nLarge brands and agencies typically manage campaigns across multiple platforms and ad buying tools, known as demand-side platforms, each with separate logins and interfaces.\n\nFounded in 2017 in Burlington, Vermont, Fluency created what it describes as a digital advertising operating system. It connects to the various platforms' application programming interfaces (APIs) and lets its customers manage their digital ads using a single workflow.\n\n\"It takes a lot of people, and hours, and button clicking to be able to effectively execute your advertising,\" Fluency CEO Mike Lane said in an interview with Business Insider.\n\nHe added that Fluency wanted to \"help simplify and streamline that, much like HubSpot or Salesforce\" did in the customer relationship management (CRM) space. Fluency's competitor set includes other campaign management and ad automation tools, such as Hootsuite, Smartly, and Sprinklr, though these companies tend to cater to larger advertisers and agencies.\n\nThe company said it manages around $3 billion in annual ad spend for brands and agencies, including Cox Automotive, Innocean, and The Johnson Group.\n\nFluency is set to announce on Tuesday that it has raised a $40 million Series A investment round, led and fully funded by Integrity Growth Partners.\n\nFluency said it plans to invest the funds in enhancing its agentic AI capabilities, which can autonomously oversee marketers' digital ad campaigns. This could mean AI agents automatically swapping out ad creatives or copy with better-performing versions, for example.\n\nFluency mostly uses Amazon's Bedrock generative AI models, as well as Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini, the company said.\n\nLane said that for agentic AI to work effectively for a marketer's digital advertising, the AI needs robust frameworks and structures to operate within, connections to all major media platforms, and for everything to be integrated into a single system.\n\nHe said these factors make Fluency well-positioned to be \"the premium platform for agentic\" AI in the digital ads space.\n\nCheck out the pitch deck Fluency used to secure its $40 million Series A investment, shared exclusively with Business Insider. Some of the slides have been omitted or redacted.\n\nFluency says marketers often use \"point solutions\" that don't interact with each other, which can also bring in issues around compliance and performance.\n\nFluency says ad strategists often have to cobble together several different tech solutions to handle tasks like targeting or reviewing campaign performance.\n\nFluency's platform aims to address these concerns as a kind of \"one-stop shop\" across various channels.\n\nThose attributes include a blue-chip client base and high customer-retention rates.\n\nThere's been a shift in budgets from big agency holding companies to independent agencies, though smaller firms have constrained resources, Fluency says.\n\nFluency says its \"serviceable addressable market\" is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11%, reaching $6.4 billion by 2028.\n\nFluency says its platform serves agencies and brands better than agency-developed tech, in-house channel management, legacy omni-channel tools, and point solutions.\n\nThe slide showcases how the Fluency platform integrates a marketer's own data, big media platforms, and DSPs using AI automation to manage campaigns and assess their performance.\n\nFluency says its tools can save customers time, improve ad performance, and boost their revenue.",

    "description": "Meta has given employees access to Google Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-5 alongside its own AI tools to help boost productivity.",
    "fullText": "In its push to create an \"AI-first\" workplace, Meta is expanding employees' access to tools from rivals such as Google and OpenAI, Business Insider has learned.\n\nThe social media giant has been encouraging employees to integrate AI tools into nearly everything they do, according to multiple internal documents and posts seen by Business Insider.\n\nOne of the company's priorities is to \"make AI core to how we work,\" Meta's chief information officer, Atish Banerjea, told employees in a June memo outlining a plan to use Meta's own models — which use the naming convention \"Llama\" — alongside products from other firms.\n\nIn November, a Meta engineer said in an internal post that all employees have access to Google's Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI's ChatGPT-5. The post included a list of AI tools Meta employees have access to, including their use cases. Business Insider has recreated the list below.\n\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed the revamped suite of AI tools and pointed to an earlier comment shared with Business Insider about AI adoption, stating: \"It's well-known that this is a priority, and we're focused on using AI to help employees with their day-to-day work.\"\n\nThe social media giant opened the floodgates to rival AI models in June.\n\nAmong those is an internal coding tool called Devmate that uses Anthropic's Claude, Business Insider previously reported. Google's Gemini and NotebookLM Pro are also available across the company to help employees \"work smarter and have more impact,\" Banerjea told employees in the June memo.\n\nMeta has invested tens of billions into its own consumer-facing AI models, and employees have access to an internal AI assistant called Metamate, which is built on its Llama models.\n\nAfter Meta struck a deal over the summer the startup Midjourney to weave its AI-image generator into its products and models, the company made the tool available to employees in October for \"concept and production uses\" to speed up design work and creative prototyping, according to an internal post ahead of the rollout, seen by Business Insider.\n\nGemini isn't the only Google tool Meta is embracing. The company migrated its internal productivity suite over the summer to Google Workspace — including Chat, Gmail, Docs, and Drive — describing the move in a June memo as a way to \"unlock AI-driven capabilities\" and better integrate with its expanding toolset.\n\nOn the engineering side, Meta has expanded access to agentic coding systems, adding Google's Gemini 3 Pro and exploring new integrations with tools like OpenAI's Codex CLI and Google's Gemini CLI. \"Rather than focusing on specific solutions, our strategy centers on outcomes: increasing productivity, accelerating development, and ensuring you have access to the best agentic coding experiences,\" Reality Labs executive Maher Saba told employees in a November memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nTo encourage adoption and experimentation, Meta has gamified the use of AI, Business Insider previously reported. Earlier this year, it launched an internal game called \"Level Up,\" which rewards employees with badges for using AI in different ways. Leaders are also tying performance to results achieved through AI, rewarding those who can prove \"AI-driven impact\" this year, and including it as part of performance reviews in 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "I Tested Google’s New Live Translation With AirPods, and It Actually Works Well",
    "description": "You don't need Pixel Buds to translate a live conversation anymore.",
    "fullText": "I can be pretty tough on AI, especially when it's used to make misinformation slop. But as cynical as I may seem, I do acknowledge that there are plenty of useful and beneficial features that AI powers. Take live translation, for instance: Not long ago, the concept of a device that could translate someone else's words directly in your ear as they spoke would seem like some far future technology. But not only is it not a futuristic technology, both Google and Apple have their own takes on the feature that users can take advantage of.\n\nThat said, not all iPhone and Android users alike have been able to use live translate. Both companies have limited the feature to work with their respective earbuds: For Apple, that's the AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 3; for Google, that's the Pixel Buds. Without your platform's flagship earbuds, you haven't been able to use live translation, and instead need to stick with the rest of your translation app's experience, whether that be Apple Translate or Google Translate. Lucky for Android users, that's no longer the case for the latter.\n\nOn Friday, Google announced new Gemini translation capabilities for its proprietary translation app. The company says these new updates introduce \"state-of-the-art text translation quality,\" with more nuanced, natural, and accurate translations. Importantly, however, as part of those upgrades, the company is launching a beta where all Google Translate users can access live translation through any headphones—not just Pixel Buds. This initial rollout is only available on the Android version of Google Translate in the U.S., Mexico, and India, though Google says the company will bring the feature to iOS and more regions in the next year.\n\nThis is kind of huge: Companies typically like to keep features like this locked behind their own platform as a marketing tactic. You're more likely to buy Pixel Buds over other earbuds or headphones if you really want to try live translation. However, you don't even need to buy a new pair of headphones to use this feature at all: As long as you have some type of headphones or earbuds connected to your Android device, you can translate conversations on the fly.\n\nI gave this a shot on my Pixel 8 Pro with my AirPods Max, by playing a video of people speaking Portuguese. Set up wasn't the simplest: First, it took forever for the Pixel to recognize my AirPods, despite the headphones being in pairing mode for some time, but that's beside the point. The key issue was getting Google Translate to present the new beta for live translation. When I first opened it, it was using the older live translate feature, which didn't work with my AirPods. I had the latest version running, so I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. When it launched, I didn't have live translate at all. Finally, after force quitting and reopening the app, I got a pop-up for the new live translation beta experience.\n\nThe next part was user error: I had my language set to the target language (Portuguese), and vice versa. As such, Google assumed I would be the one speaking Portuguese, and didn't vocalize the English translation. Once I flipped the languages, and confirmed that English would be spoken through my headphones, the feature started working—and well, for that matter. The video I choose was taken from a news broadcast, with two anchors, and various speakers during news segments. Once the video started, I could see Google Translation translating the words on my screen, and, after about four seconds, I heard the audio translated in my hear. Google Translate even tries to match the speaker's voice, and though it certainly isn't a deepfake, it does well enough to distinguish different speakers from one another. It even tried to take on more a serious tone to match the anchor's, versus the more casual tone of one of the people interviewed in a news segment.\n\nI tried a couple of other videos in different languages, but this time, using the \"Detect language\" feature rather than a preset target language. The app was able to recognize this video was spoken in Thai, and this one was spoken in Urdu, and translated both accordingly. And while I can't verify the quality of the translation (I am sadly not fluent in any other language), the experience was overall easy enough to follow. The speed of speech can get a bit slow at times, perhaps because the AI has a lot to process at once, but as long as you turn up the volume on your headphones, it's easy enough to follow.\n\nAll that to say, I'm very interested to give this a try in a real world scenario. Even though my daily driver is an iPhone, I might need to start carrying around my Pixel 8 Pro just in case.",

    "fullText": "AI Mode is mangling recipes by merging instructions from multiple creators – and causing them huge dips in ad traffic\n\nThis past March, when Google began rolling out its AI Mode search capability, it began offering AI-generated recipes. The recipes were not all that intelligent. The AI had taken elements of similar recipes from multiple creators and Frankensteined them into something barely recognizable. In one memorable case, the Google AI failed to distinguish the satirical website the Onion from legitimate recipe sites and advised users to cook with non-toxic glue.\n\nOver the past few years, bloggers who have not secured their sites behind a paywall have seen their carefully developed and tested recipes show up, often without attribution and in a bastardized form, in ChatGPT replies. They have seen dumbed-down versions of their recipes in AI-assembled cookbooks available for digital downloads on Etsy or on AI-built websites that bear a superficial resemblance to an old-school human-written blog. Their photos and videos, meanwhile, are repurposed in Facebook posts and Pinterest pins that link back to this digital slop.\n\nRecipe writers have no legal recourse because recipes generally are not copyrightable. Although copyright protects published or recorded work, they do not cover sets of instructions (although it can apply to the particular wording of those instructions).\n\nWithout this essential IP, many food bloggers earn their living by offering their work for free while using ads to make money. But now they fear that casual users who rely on search engines or social media to find a recipe for dinner will conflate their work with AI slop and stop trusting online recipe sites altogether.\n\n“There are a lot of people that are scared to even talk about what’s going on because it is their livelihood,” says Jim Delmage who, with his wife, Tara, runs the blog and YouTube channel Sip and Feast.\n\nMatt Rodbard, the founder and editor-in-chief of the website Taste, is even more pessimistic. Taste used to publish recipes more frequently, but now it mostly focuses on journalism and a podcast (which Rodbard hosts). “For websites that depend on the advertising model,” he says, “I think this is an extinction event in many ways.”\n\nThe holiday season is traditionally when food bloggers earn most of their ad revenue. For many, this year has been slower than usual. One blogger, Carrie Forrest of Clean Eating Kitchen, told Bloomberg that in the past two years, she has lost 80% of her traffic.\n\nOthers, like Delmage and Karen Tedesco, the author of the blog Familystyle Food, say their numbers, and ad revenue, have remained steady – so far. They attribute this to focusing their energies less on trying to game the search engines than on the long-term goal of attracting regular followers – and, in Delmage’s case, viewers.\n\nTedesco’s strategy has been to create recipes that rely on her experience and technical knowhow honed by years in restaurant kitchens and as a personal chef. Her Italian meatball recipe, for example, based on her mother’s, includes advice about which meat to use, an explanation of why milk-soaked breadcrumbs are essential for texture, and a dozen process photos and a video.\n\nBut she is still worried about the potential impact of AI. When she recently did a Google search for “Italian meatballs”, Familystyle Food appeared as the top result. Then she switched to AI Mode. There, she found the recipe had been Frankensteined – or “synthesized” as Gemini put it – into a new recipe with nine other sources (including Sip and Feast and a Washington Post recipe for Greek meatballs). The AI-generated recipe was little more than a list of ingredients and six basic steps with none of the details that make Tedesco’s recipe unique.\n\nAI Mode linked to all 10 recipes, including Tedesco’s, but, she says, “I don’t think many people are actually clicking on the source links. At this point, they’re absolutely trusting in the results that are getting thrown in their faces.”\n\nOther bloggers have seen a more definite impact on their viewership. Adam Gallagher, who runs Inspired Taste with his wife, Joanne, and who has become an outspoken critic of AI on social media, told the podcast Marketing O’Clock that since spring, he has noticed that while the number of times viewers saw links to the site on Google has increased, the number of actual site visitors has decreased. This indicates, to him, that users are satisfied with the search engine’s AI interpretation of Inspired Taste’s recipes.\n\nAfter the Gallaghers posted about the discrepancy on X and Instagram, a number of readers replied to say they had not realized there was a difference between the recipes on the blog and the version that showed up in Google searches. They had just appreciated the convenience of not having to click on another website, especially when Google’s page design was so clean and uncluttered.\n\nRodbard acknowledges that many food blogs have gotten ugly and overloaded with ads, which has exacerbated the problem. “Ad tech on these recipe blogs has gotten so bad, so many pop-up windows and so much crashing, we kind of lost as publishers,” he says.\n\nAccording to Tom Critchlow, the EVP of audience growth at Raptive, a media company that works with many food bloggers to find advertisers, it isn’t ads that are driving viewers away. It’s Google itself, with its changes to the algorithm and now with AI Mode, that’s making the sites harder to find.\n\nThere is some hope though: a survey of 3,000 US adults commissioned by Raptive showed that the more interaction people had with AI, the less they wanted to engage with it, and nearly half the respondents rated AI content less trustworthy than content made by a human.\n\nBut unless the public rebels against AI Mode, there is only so much bloggers can do. They can block OpenAI’s training crawler, which gathers information that ChatGPT uses to create content, including its own recipe generator, but theyare not necessarily willing to make themselves invisible to web searches; as Delmage puts it: “You can’t bite the hand that feeds you.”\n\nThere is also the option of moving over to a subscription model, such as Substack or Patreon, and keeping the recipes behind a paywall, but both Tedesco and Delmage point out that the most successful Substackers, like Caroline Chambers or David Lebovitz, came to the platform with much more substantial followings than they have. “If I were to give up my website or even try to go over to Substack, I would be broke,” Tedesco says.\n\nRodbard suggests that the analog version of the recipe blog, the cookbook, might be due for a comeback. Cookbooks, after all, offer the same experience of spending time and learning from a trusted source, and it’s likely the recipes have been tested. As a bonus, unlike phones or laptops, they don’t go dark when you neglect them for too long and you can splash tomato sauce on them without inflicting permanent damage. According to the market research firm Circana (formerly BookScan), sales of baking cookbooks are up 80% this year, but other areas have been relatively flat.\n\nBut AI bots are stealing from published cookbooks, too. When Meta was training its own AI, it compiled thousands of books into a dataset called Library Genesis (LibGen). Now unscrupulous publishers have raided LibGen and repackaged some of the books into dupes, which they are selling on Amazon.\n\nAs more people become aware of the amount of AI slop on the internet and how to identify it, Critchlow believes they will develop a greater appreciation for content produced by humans. “People will ultimately place a higher premium on being able to know that these recipes have been tested and made by somebody that I follow or somebody I respect or somebody that I like,” he says.\n\nThe recipe creators themselves are not so sure. “I’m putting my faith in that there’s always going to be a segment of people who really want to learn something,” Tedesco says. But as for the business of blogging itself, “it’s like a rolling tide. It’s always up and down and you have to roll with it and adapt.”",

    "description": "US Tech Force employees will have recruitment opportunities with a host of private companies ranging from Meta and Google to Apple and Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "Young tech talent hoping to land a job in the private sector has a new way in: the public sector.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration announced the launch of the United States Tech Force on Monday, a two-year program that offers participants federal government jobs and eventual recruitment opportunities for private sector roles.\n\nThe government is partnering with at least 28 tech companies on the program, including Apple, Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Dell, Box, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, Palantir, Oracle, Uber, and xAI, among others.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management is spearheading the early-career program in partnership with other agencies. Participants will be placed at agencies across the government to work on modernization projects and, in part, implement AI, according to the Tech Force website.\n\nTech Force plans to hire around 1,000 applicants to start, according to the site, and is looking for people \"highly skilled in the areas of software engineering, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data analytics, or technical project management.\"\n\nApplicants will submit an application, complete a technical assessment, have interviews with agency leaders, and undergo a background test. OPM will do the initial resume review and technical assessment before passing the hiring decisions off to individual agencies, OPM Director Scott Kupor said during a call before the announcement.\n\nPrivate sector partners can provide training resources and mentorship opportunities, and have committed to considering Tech Force participants for employment after the two years, according to the site. Kupor said on Monday's call that there will also be a speaker series featuring company CEOs. The program, he added, will end with public- and private-sector job fairs.\n\nCompanies haven't made any firm hiring commitments, Kupor said on the call.\n\n\"It wouldn't be appropriate for us to ask companies to hire people without knowing who those people are,\" Kupor said. He added that he'll \"be certainly disappointed\" if the program doesn't lead to hiring by the private-sector partners.\n\nSalaries will likely range from around $130,000 to $195,000, Kupor said. There are no specific degree or experience requirements for the positions, which will be posted on USA Jobs. Those interested are encouraged \"to apply as soon as possible\" on the site. Kupor said he hopes to get everybody hired by the end of March.\n\nThe roles are largely based in Washington, DC, and remote work options will depend on the agency and role, according to the site. They're non-partisan positions and are entirely distinct from the US DOGE Service.\n\nThough the Tech Force is primarily an early-career program, the government is also seeking \"experienced engineering managers from private sector partners,\" the site says. Companies can nominate employees, who will generally be expected to take unpaid leave or otherwise separate from their role to take the two-year position, per the site.\n\n\"They will become full-time employees of the government for the time they're here, and therefore be subject to all the various ethics rules,\" Kupor said. He added that each company will have its own policy, but expects that it will be \"easy\" for participants to return to their private-sector positions.\n\nKupor said on the call that the government plans to run the program on an annual basis and that he hopes to expand it in the years to come.\n\nAre you interested in applying to the Tech Force program?

    "description": "Harsh Varshney, who works on Chrome AI security at Google, shares four tips for protecting your data and identity when you talk to AI chatbots.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 31-year-old Harsh Varshney, who works at Google and lives in New York. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAI has quickly become a silent partner in our daily lives, and I can't imagine life without AI tools.\n\nDay-to-day, they help me with deep research, note-taking, coding, and online searches.\n\nBut my job means I'm very aware of the privacy concerns associated with using AI. I've worked at Google since 2023 and spent two years as a software engineer on the privacy team, building infrastructure to protect user data. I then switched to the Chrome AI security team, where I help secure Google Chrome from malicious threats, like hackers and those who use AI agents to conduct phishing campaigns.\n\nAI models use data to generate helpful responses, and we users need to protect our private information so that harmful entities, like cybercriminals and data brokers, can't access it.\n\nHere are four habits I've made that I believe are essential for protecting my data while using AI.\n\nSometimes, a false sense of intimacy with AI can lead people to share information online that they never would otherwise. AI companies may have employees who work on improving the privacy aspects of their models, but it's not advisable to share credit card details, Social Security numbers, your home address, personal medical history, or other personally identifiable information with AI chatbots.\n\nDepending on the version being used, the information shared with public AI chatbots can be used to train future models and generate responses that are more relevant. This could result in \"training leakage,\" where the model memorizes personal information about one user and later regurgitates it in responses to another. Plus, there's the risk of data breaches, which would expose what you've shared with a chatbot.\n\nI treat AI chatbots like a public postcard. If I wouldn't write a piece of information on a postcard that could be seen by anyone, I wouldn't share it with a public AI tool. I'm not confident about how my data could be used for future training.\n\nIt's important to identify whether you're using a more public AI tool or an enterprise-grade one.\n\nWhile it's uncertain how conversations are used for training public AI models, companies can pay for \"enterprise\" models. Here, models aren't typically meant to train on user conversations, so it's safer for employees to talk about their work and company projects.\n\nThink of it like having a conversation in a crowded coffee shop where you could be overheard, versus a confidential meeting in your office that stays within the room.\n\nThere have reportedly been instances where employees have accidentally leaked company data to ChatGPT. If you work on unreleased company projects or are trying to get a patent, you probably don't want to discuss your plans with a non-enterprise-grade chatbot due to the risk of leakage.\n\nI don't discuss projects I'm working on at Google with public chatbots. Instead, I use an enterprise model, even for tasks as small as editing a work email. I'm much more comfortable sharing my information because my conversations aren't used for training, but I still minimize the personal information I share.\n\nAI chatbots usually keep a history of your conversations, but I recommend deleting it on both enterprise and public models regularly to protect your user privacy in the long term. Due to the risk of your account being compromised, it's a good precautionary habit to have, even if you're confident you aren't putting private data into the tools.\n\nOnce, I was surprised that an enterprise Gemini chatbot was able to tell me my exact address, even though I didn't remember sharing it. It turned out, I had previously asked it to help me refine an email, which included my address. Because the tool has long-term memory features, enabling it to remember information from previous conversations, it could identify what my address was and retain it.\n\nSometimes, if I'm searching for things I don't want the chatbot to remember, I'll use a special mode, a bit like incognito mode, where the bots don't store my history or use the information to train models. ChatGPT and Gemini call this the \"temporary chat\" feature.\n\nIt's better to use AI tools that are well-known and are more likely to have clear privacy frameworks and other guardrails in place.\n\nOther than Google's products, I like to use OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude.\n\nIt's also helpful to review the privacy policies of any tools you use. Sometimes, they'll explain more about how your data is used to train the model. In the privacy settings, you can also look for a section with the option to \"improve the model for everyone.\" By making sure that setting is turned off, you're preventing your conversations from being used for training.\n\nAI technology is incredibly powerful, but we must be cautious to ensure our data and identities are safe when we use it.\n\nDo you have a story to share about using AI to help you at work?

    "description": "Here's what this means for law firms and other businesses that are betting on AI.",
    "fullText": "We just got a sobering picture of how often AI models get their facts straight. This week, Google DeepMind introduced the FACTS Benchmark Suite, which measures how reliably AI models produce factually accurate answers.\n\nIt tests models in four areas: answering factoid questions from internal knowledge, using web search effectively, grounding responses in long documents, and interpreting images. The best model, Google's Gemini 3 Pro, reached 69% accuracy, with other leading models falling well below that.\n\nFor context, if any of the reporters I manage filed stories that were 69% accurate, I would fire them.\n\nBeyond journalism, this number should matter to businesses betting on AI. While models excel at speed and fluency, their factual reliability still lags far behind human expectations, especially in tasks involving niche knowledge, complex reasoning, or precise grounding in source material.\n\nEven small factual errors can have outsized consequences in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and the law. This week, my talented colleague Melia Russell looked at how law firms are handling the rise of AI models as a source of legal truth. It's messy: She recounts how one firm fired an employee because they filed a document riddled with fake cases after using ChatGPT to draft it.\n\nThe FACTS benchmark is a warning but also a roadmap: by quantifying where and how models fail, Google hopes to accelerate progress. But for now, the takeaway is clear: AI is getting better, but it's still wrong about one-third of the time.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

My wife posted in a local email group and a potential buyer got in touch with a question.\n\n\"Do you happen to know the model? I would love to look it up online rather than asking you lots of questions. :) Thanks!\" she wrote.\n\nThis is an old couch, so all product codes dissolved in the sands of time years ago. So, I took two photos of the furniture, uploaded them to Gemini, and asked for help. The Google chatbot sent back its best guess in seconds:\n\n\"Tillary Sectional: This is a very popular, modular West Elm sofa that was available around that time.\n\nAppearance Match: The low back and deep seat are very characteristic of the Tillary. The Tillary is known for having interchangeable backrests that can be moved or removed, and your sofa's armless chaise and backrests look like they might be loose cushions or pieces, which is a key Tillary feature.\n\nNote: Search results show the Tillary was being reviewed and discussed around 2014, making it a strong possibility for a 2013 purchase.\"\n\nGemini also shared other useful tips on how to identify the product, such as \"Some West Elm couches have a zippered compartment on the back or bottom where extra components (like legs or connectors) are stored, and a tag may be inside.\"\n\nThat was enough to find a product match and send all the details over to the buyer. We closed the deal, for $200, on Tuesday. That's enough for 10 months of a Gemini Pro subscription.\n\nThis holiday period, the Barr family plans to spend a lot of time slouching on our new, fancy couch. I call it the \"AI bubble couch.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Android users are getting more tools to combat the seemingly endless stream of scam texts from bad actors looking to steal your data and your money. Circle to Search and Google Lens can now assess messages for scam red flags, and if possible fraud is detected, you'll get recommendations for what to do (or not do) next. Even if you think you know the telltale signs of a scam—a sense of urgency, a demand for money or personal information, a link to log in or pay—using these tools can confirm your suspicions, especially when you feel pressured to act.\n\nTo activate Circle to Search, long press the home button or navigation bar on your device and circle the text you want to scan. Alternatively, you can take a screenshot, open Lens in the Google app (also available on iOS), and tap the screenshot. The feature works for text messages as well as communication on messaging apps and social media sites. Google says the capability is available \"when our systems have high confidence in the quality of the response.\"\n\nThis is just the latest in the Google's suite of security features meant to protect against fraud. Pixel users have real-time, AI-powered scam detection, which identifies and alerts you to suspicious conversational patterns in Google Messages and Phone by Google. In-call protections for Android prevent you from taking certain actions, such as sideloading new apps and changing accessibility permission, on your device while on the phone with anyone not saved in your contacts.\n\nEarlier this month, Google also expanded its in-call scam detection feature, meant to combat bank impersonation schemes, to U.S. users. If you are on a call with a number that's not in your contacts and try to open a participating financial app, you'll get a notification reminding you not to share information and a one-click option to stop screen-sharing and end the call.",

    "title": "Google Removes Sci-Hub Domains from U.S. Search Results Due to Dated Court Order",
    "description": "Google has removed dozens of Sci-Hub domain names from its search results in the U.S., marking the country's first pirate domain removals.",
    "fullText": "In 2017, American Chemical Society (ACS), a leading source of academic publications in the field of chemistry, won a lawsuit against Sci-Hub and its operator, Alexandra Elbakyan.\n\nThe ‘Pirate Bay of Science’ had failed to appear at a Virginia federal court, resulting in an easy win for the publisher and a $4.8 million default judgment award for damages.\n\nMore important, perhaps, was the broad permanent injunction that the Virginia federal court signed off on in 2017. This order effectively gave ACS free rein to take down existing and newly registered Sci-Hub domain names.\n\nThe injunction also required all parties “in active concert or participation” with Sci-Hub to “cease facilitating access” to these domain names, including search engines, hosting providers, ISPs, and domain name registrars, the order clarified.\n\nOn paper, this injunction enabled ACS to request American ISPs and search engines to ‘block’ existing and future Sci-Hub domains. However, there was no sign that the publisher was doing so. Aside from a few suspended domains, Sci-Hub remained widely accessible.\n\nWhether ACS did not feel the need to enforce the order against search engines and other intermediaries or if these companies actively objected to the requested actions was unknown. And as time passed, the injunction became a distant memory, at least for a few years.\n\nEarlier this week we spotted a unique request in the Lumen Database, where the 2018 injunction was cited. The notice in question asks Google to deindex 34 (sub)domains linked to Sci-Hub.\n\nNone of these domains were referenced in the 2018 injunction but are indeed linked to Sci-Hub. Many of the partially redacted domains appear to be domain variations of the scihubtw.tw mirror network, such as edu.scihubtw.tw and freeus.scihubtw.tw.\n\nIt’s surprising to see this type of enforcement seven years after the injunction was issued, but the request is legitimate. Google is certainly taking it seriously and has deindexed these domains from its search results in America. In other countries, the same domains remain accessible.\n\nThe December 2 notice was sent by UK law firm Wiggin LLP, which sent a similar request in September this year, targeting a few dozen other Sci-Hub domains. In total, we spotted seven notices, with the earliest dating back to 2022.\n\nThe results of these removals are also clearly visible in Google search. Those who search for Sci-Hub in the U.S. will see the following notice at the bottom of the results.\n\nIt’s not clear why it took five years before ACS urged Google to take action in response to the injunction. However, these removals are similar to Google’s removal of pirate site domains in other countries in response to ISP-blocking orders. Voluntary cooperation by Google was uncovered shortly before ACS first notified the search engine.\n\nGoogle’s voluntary cooperation with ISP blocking orders in Australia, the Netherlands, France, the UK, and elsewhere also brings up an important question. Is Google cooperating with the permanent injunction in the U.S. because it feels legally compelled to do so, or is that a voluntary gesture too?\n\nThe 2018 injunction requires all parties “in active concert or participation” with Sci-Hub to take action. While search engines are mentioned as an example, Google and other tech companies have previously argued that neutral third-party services are not necessarily “in active concert or participation”.\n\nIt is likely that Google maintains this stance, opting to voluntarily comply with orders targeting other third parties. That would mirror its response to site-blocking orders elsewhere.\n\nWe contacted Google hoping to hear answers to these questions, but the company did not respond to our request for comment.",

    "description": "Jensen Huang biography author Stephen Witt explains why Google's self-developed AI model, Gemini, could pose a threat to Nvidia's AI dominance",
    "fullText": "Nvidia's (NVDA) AI turf could take a blow if Google (GOOGL, GOOG) keeps firing on all cylinders.\n\n\"The biggest risk right now obviously is Google,\" said Stephen Witt, author of \"The Thinking Machine,\" a Jensen Huang biography.\n\nThat risk, he told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid, is largely tied to Google's Gemini model. Witt described it as the \"best AI right now in the benchmarks outside the Nvidia stack.\"\n\nWitt explained that Gemini was trained entirely on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). If Google proves it can sustain world-leading AI development using only its homegrown chip stack, it sets a potent precedent for other tech giants to follow suit.\n\n\"That's a huge risk,\" Witt said. \"If Google ends up winning this AI race ... Nvidia will be in trouble.\"\n\nThis risk, coupled with competition from rivals like Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), is why \"it's very easy to imagine a world\" where Nvidia's high-flying stock declines. The AI chipmaker's shares are up over 1,270% in the past five years.\n\nTo mitigate the core risk of rivals like Google winning the chip war, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is already looking past generative AI. Witt said a significant amount of the CEO's personal effort is being poured into the next great computing wave: robotics.\n\nIf Huang can dominate the robotics wave, he said, \"that will mean several trillion dollars in market capitalization for this company.\"\n\nHowever, Nvidia has another issue: the lack of any clear succession plan.\n\n\"It's just Jensen at the top,\" Witt said. \"There's no second in command. There's no obvious successor.\" He noted that the board has been silent, and Huang has offered no advice on a succession strategy.\n\nThat suggests Nvidia's $4 trillion valuation — which accounts for over 8% of the entire S&P 500 (^GSPC) — is, in many ways, resting solely on Huang's vision.\n\nWitt described Huang as a \"world-class engineer\" who could \"design these microchips himself,\" a skill that whoever takes the helm must also possess. He noted that neither of Huang's two children, who work at the company, has a technical background, making them noncontenders for the top spot.\n\nWitt also provided a look behind the polished stage persona of Huang, known for his trademark leather jacket. Beneath the showmanship is a highly intense, \"almost totally neurotic\" leader who is driven not by optimism, but by fear.\n\n\"He's driven by negative emotions, things like fear of failure, guilt, even shame are what make Jensen get up in the morning and work so hard to make Nvidia succeed,\" Witt explained.",

At Google I/O back in May, Google rolled out an AI-powered shopping feature that let you virtually try on clothes you find online. All you needed to do was upload a full-length photo of yourself, and Google's AI would be to dress you up in whatever article of clothing you liked. I still can't decide whether the feature sounds useful, creepy, or a little bit of both.\n\nWhat I can say, however, is that the feature is getting a little creepier. On Thursday, Google announced an update to its virtual try on feature, that takes advantage of the company's new AI image model, Nano Banana. Now, you don't need a full-length photo of yourself: just a selfie. With solely a photo of your face, Nano Banana will generate a full-length avatar in your likeness, which you can use to virtually try on your clothes.\n\nI'm not exactly sure who this particular update is for: Maybe there are some of us out there who want to use this virtual try-on feature, but don't have a full-length photo of ourselves to share. Personally, I wouldn't really want to send Google my photo—selfie or otherwise—but I don't think I'd prefer to have Google infer what I look like from a photo of my face alone. I'd rather just send it the full photo, and give it something to actually work off of.\n\nHere's the other issue: While Google asks you to only upload images of yourself, it doesn't stop you if you upload an image of someone else. Talk about creepy: You can upload someone else's selfie and see how they look in various clothes. There is a system in place to stop you from uploading certain selfies, like celebrities, children, or otherwise \"unsafe\" items, but if the system fails, this feature could be used maliciously. I feel like Google could get around this by verifying the selfie against your Google Account, since you need to be signed in to use the feature anyway.\n\nIf you are interested in trying the feature out—and, subsequently, trying on virtual clothes with your AI-generated avatar—you can head over to Google's try on feature, sign into your Google Account, and upload your selfie. When it processes, you choose one of four avatars, each dressed in a different fit, to proceed. Once through, you can virtually try on any clothes you see in the feed.\n\nAgain, I see the potential usefulness of a feature that lets you see what you might look like in a certain piece of clothing before buying it. But, at the same time, I think I'd rather just order the item and try it on in the comfort (and privacy) of my own home.",
