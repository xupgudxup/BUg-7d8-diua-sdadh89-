    "description": "Hoffman, the billionaire LinkedIn cofounder, said he visited Epstein's island as part of his work fundraising for MIT.",
    "fullText": "Reid Hoffman said he once spent a night on Epstein's island in connection with MIT fundraising efforts.\n\nThe LinkedIn cofounder told the Newcomer podcast that he had been told a visit would make Epstein more likely to donate.\n\nHoffman has previously apologized publicly for his interactions with Epstein.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said he wishes he'd known a little more before agreeing to spend a night on Jeffrey Epstein's island.\n\nOn the Dec. 1 episode of Eric Newcomer's podcast, Hoffman said that he visited the island as part of his fundraising work for the MIT Foundation and was told the visit would make Epstein more likely to donate to MIT.\n\n\"Note to self: Google before going,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. He said he stayed on the island for one night, and that there was a pool, a \"bunch of guest rooms,\" and a courtyard.\n\nHoffman has maintained that he only interacted with Epstein, whose 2019 death while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges was ruled a suicide, through his work fundraising for the MIT Media Lab. On the \"Newcomer\" podcast, he called Epstein a \"masterful networker,\" and recalled a 2015 dinner he hosted for an MIT researcher in Palo Alto, California.\n\nHoffman said that Joi Ito, former director of the MIT Media Lab, asked him if Epstein could attend the dinner, which was also attended by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Similar to his visit to the island, Hoffman said he was later told that the financier had said he was more likely to donate if he attended the dinner.\n\n\"He's kind of going through the network, trying to meet people and so forth,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. Hoffman also reiterated previous apologies for his involvement with Epstein.\n\nIn 2019, a spokesperson for Zuckerberg confirmed the dinner to Business Insider and said it was the only time the Facebook cofounder met Epstein. A spokesperson for Musk also confirmed the Tesla CEO's attendance.\n\nIn a 2019 email to Axios, Hoffman acknowledged multiple interactions with Epstein, which he said were strictly for fundraising purposes, and said he had been told MIT had vetted and approved the convicted sex offender's participation. He said in the email he was \"deeply regretful\" of the involvement.\n\n\"I went and kind of made a, you know, very public apology because it was like, okay I realized this and I'd already at that point had ramped down connection with him, right, to like no meetings and all the rest of the stuff, under any context,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. \"And I think he still would drop me an email every so often and say, 'Hey, can we get on the phone?' I say, 'Oh, maybe sometime,' which is, you know, code for never, right?\"\n\nHoffman said that justice for the late pedophile's victims is important, and urged the government to release, unredacted, \"every single piece of intel that they have about Epstein.\"\n\nIn November, President Donald Trump signed a bill that will release the Department of Justice's files on Epstein after months of pressure from Congress, including some fellow Republicans. The department has until Saturday, December 19, to comply with the order.\n\nTrump has also ordered the DOJ to investigate Hoffman, along with other individuals he views as political enemies, including former President Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, over their ties to Epstein.\n\nHoffman, a billionaire and major Democratic donor, has previously said that he had to hire security after Musk fueled conspiracy theories about his relationship with Epstein.",

    "description": "It's the latest Pixel series, now with Pixelsnap (Google's version of MagSafe), new AI features, and the new telephoto lens.",
    "fullText": "Google phones keep offering great value for the money, dropping in price very quickly after their release, including the latest Pixel. The Google Pixel 10, with the 128GB going for $599 (originally $799) and the 256GB for $699 (originally $899), are both at record low prices right now, according to price-tracking tools.\n\nThe Google Pixel 10 is the latest in the series to be released this year, back in September. It's the model under the Pixel 10 Pro, which is also at its lowest price right now and has a much faster chip. As Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt says in her review, the Pixel 10 features a telephoto lens, brings the Pixelsnap (Google's version of MagSafe), and has new AI features. However, the ultrawide lens gets weaker, and there are some problems with the chip for third-party apps (but it can be fixed).\n\nThis Pixel 10 has a lot of the same features you'll find in the Pixel Pro for $150 less, making it a great budget option for those who don't want or need all the fancy specs and features. It comes with a Google Tensor G5 chip, and the camera resolutions are 48MP, 13MP, and 10.8MP for the rear and 10.5MP for the front-facing one. You can expect about 24 hours of battery life, depending on your use.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Pixel phones is the ongoing support for many years. My Pixel 6A still gets all of the updates and tons of AI features that make the phone feel fresh many years later, with the latest ones dropping in September. With the Pixel 10, you'll be getting a quality phone with software updates for a while (as long as seven years).",

    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary.\n\nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",
