    "title": "Inside Meta's 'year of intensity' as its AI overhaul, culture wars, and crackdowns collide",
    "description": "Meta's AI overhaul, culture shifts, layoffs, and performance crackdowns have sparked internal clashes, employee exits, and morale concerns in 2025.",
    "fullText": "When CEO Mark Zuckerberg warned Meta employees in January to \"buckle up\" for an \"intense\" year, he meant it.\n\nDetermined to dominate the next era of AI, Meta has spent the past year in blitz mode. Zuckerberg has overhauled divisions, reallocated resources to new products, and poured billions into the AI arms race with OpenAI, Google, and others. Zuckerberg's push came with a marked shift in leadership tone as well, including his public celebration of what he described as more \"masculine energy.\"\n\nAlong the way, the company has trimmed its metaverse ambitions, raised performance expectations, and cut thousands of jobs, all while chasing Zuckerberg's grand vision of \"personal superintelligence.\"\n\nIn some ways, the moves have boosted efficiency and led to faster innovation. In others, some divisions have been roiled by internal tensions, including clashes resulting from AI reorganizations and Zuckerberg flaming the AI talent wars, according to current and former employees. Some also said Meta's layoffs earlier this year were unnecessarily demoralizing when Zuckerberg branded the affected employees as \"low performers.\"\n\nThe company's transformation comes at a time when Big Tech is rewriting its playbook, cutting costs, toughening its tone with employees, and making massive bets that AI will determine who leads in the next decade.\n\nMeta is wagering that moving harder and faster will help give the company an edge over its rivals. After months of a cultural reset in early 2025, employee sentiment improved in recent months, a Meta spokesperson said, citing a recent internal employee sentiment questionnaire.\n\nInvestors are worried about the company's strategy, particularly its plan to sink tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and talent. The question is whether Meta is overdoing it. Shares have risen 7.5% this year, less than half that of the S&P 500, and have underperformed most of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies.\n\n\"The company must articulate its vision, show how its pieces fit together, and, most importantly, demonstrate steady growth,\" said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester, who covers Meta.\n\nThis account of Meta's \"year of intensity\" is based on interviews conducted by Business Insider with more than a dozen current and former employees, analysts, and academic researchers.\n\nOver the summer, Zuckerberg sought to change the perception that Meta was trailing behind its AI rivals. In June, the company made a $14 billion investment in AI training company Scale AI and hired its 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, as chief AI officer. Two months later, it rebranded its team focused on AI efforts to Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL).\n\nAs Meta's leadership sought to reorganize teams and recruit top talent from competitors, some ex-employees went public with the view that the company lacked a coherent AI strategy.\n\nJoena Zhang, a former Meta Superintelligence Labs employee, said in a November LinkedIn post that \"nobody really knew what anyone was doing\" during the first half of the year at MSL — then called GenAI. She said there were \"endless\" meetings that didn't result in \"actual decisions.\" And in a July Substack post, former Meta researcher Tijmen Blankevoort wrote that Meta had \"a wavering vision that was tough for team members to enthusiastically rally behind.\"\n\nMeta began offering massive compensation packages to attract top AI talent from rival labs, including OpenAI and Google's AI division, DeepMind.\n\nThis created rifts between the \"old guard\" and newer hires by offering outsiders significantly more compensation than existing employees got. It fueled a quiet competition to prove whose ideas for AI features were more valuable, according to two MSL employees.\n\nThe tensions also revolved around access to computing resources and the prestige of being associated with the elite team at the center of MSL, as one researcher previously told Business Insider.\n\nIn August, Meta undertook its fourth major reorganization in six months to streamline its AI efforts, dividing MSL into four teams: a new TBD Lab (short for \"to be determined\"), a product team overseeing the Meta AI assistant, an infrastructure team, and the company's long-standing Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab.\n\nAfter the shake-up, it was unclear who owned which projects, and people were reassigned between teams, according to the two MSL employees, one of whom added that the flow of information between TBD and MSL wasn't always even.\n\nAsked about the internal shake-up, a Meta spokesperson pointed Business Insider to an X post from Andy Stone, a Meta communications executive, describing previous reporting about the company's AI restructuring as \"navelgazing.\"\n\nAt least eight of Meta's AI staffers, including researchers, engineers, and a senior product leader, left the company within two months of MSL's formation. Meta said most had been with the company for years, and that some attrition is normal for an organization of its size.\n\nTwo months after the August shuffle, Meta cut about 600 jobs as part of a wider reorganization of the MSL division. Wang told employees that the cuts were designed to speed up decision-making.\n\nShay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities, told Business Insider that the changes have helped Meta move faster in model releases and in integrating its AI across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\n\"Meta is now one of the only companies training frontier-class models and deploying them to billions of users, which is exactly where I want it to be,\" he said.\n\nMeta also shook up its leadership ranks in Reality Labs, the division responsible for developing its virtual and mixed reality products.\n\nThe company is considering budget cuts for the metaverse unit that sits within Reality Labs, which could result in job cuts, a person familiar with the matter previously told Business Insider. A Meta spokesperson said that it is reallocating some of its investment \"from Metaverse toward AI glasses and wearables\" to match momentum, adding that the company \"wasn't planning any broader changes than that.\"\n\nThe MSL layoffs were part of a broader effort by Meta to tighten operational efficiency this year, as the company reduced layers of management and implemented a stricter performance review process than in previous years.\n\nZuckerberg told employees in January he had \"decided to raise the bar on performance management\" and would move quickly to cut about 5% of \"low performers.\" The company cut about 3,600 jobs in February from its workforce of about 78,450 employees.\n\nMultiple employees said the revised system created a pressure-cooker environment and encouraged more cutthroat competition between staff. Managers and employees described a shift toward short-term projects as teams looked to protect themselves from landing at the bottom of the ranking.\n\nThe requirement to place more staff in lower performance tiers saw some managers strategically leave positions open or hire employees solely to place them in the bottom tier, two managers said.\n\nThe company says employee sentiment improved in the second half of the year. Its latest internal employee sentiment questionnaire, which ran from October 20 to November 3, showed \"optimism\" rose to 80%, \"pride\" at 71% and \"confidence in leadership\" at 68%, according to data Meta shared with Business Insider.\n\nEach of those metrics was up between 10 and 12 percentage points compared to the last survey, which ran April 21 through May 5, the spokesperson said. The latest survey had a 91% participation rate, Meta said.\n\nThe combination of policy shifts, reorganizations, job cuts, and stricter performance expectations triggered a wave of departures in 2025, according to five internal farewell posts reviewed by Business Insider. Some employees said Meta's evolving political posture and internal governance changes no longer aligned with their values.\n\n\"Meta in 2025 is a very different company from what Oculus & Facebook were in 2017,\" one engineer, who left Meta in August after nearly eight years at the company, wrote in an internal farewell message, viewed by Business Insider. These types of notes are known internally as \"badge posts.\"\n\nHe cited a \"matter of principles\" for his departure, adding that the \"sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit alignment with the new US government\" clashed with his personal values.\n\nSimilar themes surfaced in other employee departures this year.\n\n\"The unnecessary pressure, lack of empathy, and occasional lack of fairness,\" one former employee wrote in another farewell post from January, seen by Business Insider. \"Fighting for scope. Narratives. Oh, the narratives - I'm so looking forward to not hearing that word for a while. Smart and kind people bending their values to survive because they've been on the edge of their seats for too long.\"\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the resignations represent a small slice of the company. Meta has 78,450 employees, and head count is up 8% year-over-year.\n\nSome departing employees told Business Insider that they no longer had a meaningful outlet to share feedback with leadership on topics such as DEI and embracing \"masculine energy\" because questions for Q&A sessions were preselected, and that posts critical of leadership decisions were sometimes removed from the platform.\n\n\"We will skip questions that we expect might be unproductive if they leak or things like people-related questions that have already been answered,\" Meta's VP of internal communications, Jonny Oser, informed employees in an internal post earlier this year.\n\nIn a January poll titled \"Measuring workplace fear,\" dozens of Meta employees voted anonymously on how afraid they were that speaking openly about working conditions could lead to disciplinary action. The winning responses were \"extremely afraid\" and \"very afraid,\" according to a screenshot of the poll viewed by Business Insider.\n\nEven as some employees headed for the exits, others say they are optimistic about the new environment.\n\nTwo current employees told Business Insider that Meta can be a rewarding place to work, particularly for individuals accustomed to operating in high-pressure environments.\n\n\"I would say that people who are confident in their skills and are high performers generally thrive,\" one senior engineer said.\n\nAnother Meta veteran said the company used to \"coddle its staff\" — but \"that's changing.\"\n\nAn engineer said there are reasons to stay put. \"The positives are that we are still on the frontier in R&D,\" they said. \"There are a lot of cool AI, wearables, and robotics things going on,\" giving high-performing employees a chance to learn and build \"a lot of good skills.\"\n\n\"Also, we get paid a lot, still, and get free food and snacks,\" they said. \"That helps.\"",

    "title": "An 18-year-old brings in $300,000 a month selling 3D printed 'reload can holders.' Here's how he comes up with unique product ideas.",
    "description": "\"I didn't know if it was that good of an idea, but I just posted it on Instagram to see how it would do. The video went wild.\"",
    "fullText": "Earlier this year, Michael Satterlee posted a video chugging a Dr Pepper from his \"tactical reload can holder.\" It's like a coozie, but more fun.\n\nIn the video, as he finishes the beverage, another soda can slides into the frame. He slams the can holder on top of it, sending the original Dr Pepper can flying, and proceeds to chug the second soda.\n\nThe video has more than 50 million views on Instagram.\n\nWhen asked why it went viral, the 18-year-old entrepreneur points to the novelty factor: \"I think it's just, they hadn't seen anything like it before.\" Viewers were also astounded by how quickly he could chug a Dr Pepper, according to the thousands of comments. That part was just good acting, though. Satterlee told Business Insider that he'd drained the can beforehand and \"pretended to drink it in like a second.\"\n\nA post shared by CruiseCup™️ (@cruisecup)\n\nSatterlee's viral video has contributed to the quick success of his e-commerce business, Cruise Cup, which sells a variety of 3D printed products, including the top-selling can holder. In November 2025 alone, he generated $300,000 in sales, which Business Insider verified by reviewing a screenshot of his Shopify dashboard.\n\nHe was poised to capitalize on the viral moment. Satterlee has been building businesses since he was 10, when he went door-to-door asking neighbors if he could mow their lawns. Nearly everyone declined.\n\n\"I knocked on doors every day for like a month straight, and I think I had one client,\" he said. However, he had more success with e-commerce, creating and selling a sand-repellent product, which funded his next project: a clog accessory company called Solefully.\n\n\"I was no stranger to the orders flooding in and what it's like as soon as a viral video goes off,\" said Satterlee, who scaled Solefully's Instagram account to more than 100,000 followers. However, he did need to buy more 3D printers to keep up with the demand for Cruise Cup products.\n\n\"When you're printing a big product, it could take 10 hours, so if you get 10 orders, then you're going to need 100 hours' worth of print time,\" he explained. \"For Solefully, I was able to maintain all my orders with around 50 printers, but when Cruise Cup hit, it just got so insane. I'd be buying batches of 30 printers and still not being able to keep up.\"\n\nSatterlee, who learned about 3D printing in a design class he took his freshman year of high school, said that one of the main benefits of printing products, rather than going through a manufacturer, is the low barrier to entry.\n\n\"Anybody could do it. You could get a 3D printer for like 100 bucks, and a roll of filament costs like $20. They make the modeling software so easy now; there's even AI where you could just type in a prompt, and it will come up with a model for you that'll be ready to 3D print.\"\n\nSatterlee's company has outgrown his childhood home in Clifton Park, New York. The operation \"took over my entire house,\" he recalled. \"My basement was all 3D printers, my dining room was my shipping area, and then my room was my studio.\"\n\nWhile he still lives there, he's shifted operations to a nearby warehouse that houses more than 130 printers. He's also in the process of setting up a mold with a manufacturer and expects to produce stainless steel products by mid-2026.\n\nBefore the viral can holder, Satterlee experimented with a variety of products, including a one-can cooler that was performing well. It prompted him to look at the most dominant player in the cooler space — Yeti — and see if there were any products he could innovate.\n\n\"I was looking at a standard Yeti coozie, and I was like, 'How can I make this better?'\" he said.\n\n\"A couple of things popped into my mind: I can make it easier to load. Instead of having to twist the top off, why couldn't you just be able to slide a drink in through the bottom and then drink it through the top? If I tighten the caps up a little bit, then I can make it so when you put a new can in, the empty will fly out like a shell case.\"\n\nHe figured he was onto something, and Instagram confirmed his suspicions.\n\n\"I didn't know if it was that good of an idea, but I just posted it on Instagram to see how it would do,\" he said. \"The video went wild.\"\n\nThen, he paid close attention to what his audience was saying about the product. One comment popped up over and over again: \"Make it hold two cans,\" he said. \"So that's what I did from there, and that did even better.\"\n\nSatterlee believes in creating a product quickly and iterating from there, rather than spending months trying to perfect it. That's a major advantage of working with a 3D printer: you can create products quickly and at a low cost, and then test the market before deciding to invest time, money, and materials in producing something at scale.\n\n\"Just make whatever idea you have exist first, and then make it good later,\" he said. \"People would tell me all the time, 'What's the point of a can cooler if it's 3D printed? It's not insulated. It's not going to keep the drink cold.' But I didn't care. I had the vision. If you have an idea, just bring it to life as fast as you can, and then go from there.\"\n\nDon't expect your first product, or even first several products, to succeed, he added.\n\n\"You have to be super, super resilient because you're going to fail a ton of times. I just listed to you the companies that I had that made some money. I've lost money on a bunch of businesses, a bunch of ventures — and then sometimes you just get lucky, and it hits.\"",

    "fullText": "The talent wars continue to rage across Silicon Valley as companies vie for the best and brightest minds in AI. There is, however, one major AI company that says it is not giving in to pressure.\n\nMicrosoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said on Bloomberg Podcasts that he doesn't plan to compete with tech giants like Meta by offering top dollar for talent.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's matching those things,\" Suleyman said of the $100 million signing bonuses Meta has been offering engineers, and the $250 million packages it's been using to lure top AI researchers.\n\n\"I think that Zuck's taken a particular approach that involves sort of hiring a lot of individuals rather than maybe creating a team, and I don't really think that's the right approach,\" he said.\n\nSuleyman said he was \"very selective\" about new hires when he previously worked at DeepMind. At Microsoft, he said he has hired \"incrementally,\" prioritizing candidates who aligned with the team's culture and had the right skills, and let go of those who did not.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, the top ranks of AI talent are commanding pay packages in the millions.\n\nIn June, Meta spent $14.3 billion on an investment in Scale AI — a deal widely seen as an acquihire of its CEO, Alexandr Wang. Google also made a similar move, acquiring the leaders of Windsurf, an AI coding platform. in a deal worth $2.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said that Meta tried to lure his employees away with $100 million signing bonuses, which Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth said OpenAI later offered to match.\n\nEven at smaller startups, someone in an AI leadership role can command between $300,000 and $400,000 in base pay, Shawn Thorne, managing director at executive search firm True Search, previously told Business Insider.\n\nSuleyman said \"rotation\" is part of the industry, given the small pool of talent. He cited Microsoft's corporate vice president of AI, Amar Subramanya, decamping to Apple earlier this month as an example.\n\nMicrosoft recently brought in several new hires from DeepMind and OpenAI, he said.\n\n\"There's certainly no 'no poach' agreements, that would not be legal,\" he added. \"People can go work for whoever they want to work for.\"",

    "fullText": "LinkedIn is full of corporate braggarts. But don't expect the best engineers to flaunt their success on the platform — or even have an account, according one former Meta employee.\n\nMichael Novati spent almost eight years at Meta, back when it was still called Facebook and hadn't yet doubled down on AI. He reached the rank of principal software engineer and earned the nickname \"coding machine.\"\n\nOn the \"A Life Engineered\" podcast, host Steve Huynh asked Novati about his claim that the top five engineers aren't on LinkedIn. Novati stood by it.\n\n\"When I was at Facebook, the top engineers were like, 'If you had a LinkedIn account, people would be wondering if you're job hunting,'\" he said.\n\nNovati said these engineers don't need to publicly job hunt because of tech's extensive recruiting arm, which he called the \"secrets of the industry.\"\n\n\"There are very senior, very highly paid recruiters that work at the top companies who have very strong long-term social relationships with a lot of top engineers,\" he said.\n\nHow do these engineers and recruiters meet? Novati gave the example of an engineer who spends a week doing campus recruiting at Stanford, bonding with the company's recruiter in the process.\n\nHe referred to these as the \"secret backroom dealings of Silicon Valley.\"\n\n\"These engineers' names are nowhere, but they are the ones that are the most desirable by these recruiters,\" he said. \"The $100 million engineer is not on LinkedIn with a tagline that's like, #100millionengineer.\"\n\nTech recruiting has long been a large, lucrative industry. Big Tech companies both employ in-house recruiters and outside agencies to stay close to key talent.\n\nMeanwhile, talent is becoming increasingly competitive, particularly in the field of AI. Meta shelled out large contracts for its Superintelligence Labs, poaching engineers from its competitors.\n\nSometimes CEOs even get involved. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly made a list of the top AI talent to poach. OpenAI's chief research officer said that Zuckerberg hand-delivered soup to an employee he was trying to recruit.\n\nOne AI worker told Business Insider they got a personal call from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, pitching them to join the company. They accepted.\n\nBeing offline may not be the golden key to tech recruiting, though. These top-tier engineers are a \"specific case,\" Novati said on the podcast.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that your strategy should be: delete LinkedIn and all the offers will come,\" he said.\n\nIt's a rarified class, Novati said, but one that stays away from all semblances of personal branding.\n\n\"I don't know any of those top engineers, who get special equity grants and special dinners with Bezos or whatever stuff like that, who have big personal brands,\" he said.",

    "description": "Meta's lines of code, shared meals, a familiar melodies, and the All the Smoke podcast, are finding ways to bring people together by a common thread.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES –– Indelible connections often unassumingly begin. They make their marks on out hearts and psyches with the whisper of a question: What if?\n\nWhat if a link could be more than a link?\n\nWhat if sharing a favorite podcast episode felt less like a broadcast and more like an invitation?\n\nEarlier this month, Threads answered. Meta introduced features that let podcasters and their afficianados plant their flags, pinning their work to their profile with pride.\n\nThey made episode shares not just visible, but vibrant. This was the technical seed. But the true story is about the soil where it was planted.\n\nThis is about the community that formed around a restaurant called Somerville.\n\nTo cross its threshold was to slip through time. Its decoration is an homage to the loving spectral echoes of Black excellence speakeasies that defined the Harlem Renaissance. This was no mere venue; it was a vessel.\n\nWooden beams, skeletal and sincere, stretched overhead like the bare ribs of a great, welcoming beast, married to the soft glow of romantic lighting.\n\nThe air hummed with a latent energy, the quiet thrill of a secret too good to keep. Plush brown seats held bodies leaning in, not back. This was the clubhouse for a playground's elite, and on Thursday, the NBA was the conversation.\n\nOn delicate plates, the philosophy of connection was served in edible metaphors.\n\nScrumptious tuna tartare, a diminutive masterpiece, its ginger-soy dressing performing a delicate dance on the palate. A sesame ice cream cone waltzed in perfect, savory harmony with shallots and chives.\n\nTruffle-flavored popcorn bursts with umami —a complex chorus of garlic, pepper, and a unique woodsy blend—each bite a tiny explosion of crafted communion.\n\nAnd weaving through it all, the sultry, sinuous voice of Briana Washington at the piano, wrapping around ballads like \"A Lovely Day.\" This was the soundtrack of shared humanity.\n\nBecause some truths are universal. Food, music, sports—these are the ancient, unbreakable codes that bypass borders, beliefs, every arbitrary self-absorbed monument that we build.\n\nThey are the common tongue. And in this temple of that truth, Threads made its stand, not with a mere press release, but with a party.\n\nAt the center sat Connor Hayes, Head of Threads, a man whose love for basketball was the engine of this experiment. His was not a corporate passion. It was born in the upper deck of the old Boston Garden, a childhood etched with the struggles of a bad Celtics team and the singular obsession with a player like Ron Mercer.\n\n\"I've been watching…I could watch all 82 games of that team,\" Hayes said. His fan's heart still beats beneath a builder's hoodie.\n\nFor him, Threads was a chance to rebuild the digital arena as it should be: a \"second screen\" where the community's roar during a Wembanyama highlight feels electric, intimate.\n\n\"I have a ton of people that I've met through Threads who are also Celtics fans,\" Hayes shared, describing a group chat that spanned from the Philippines to Brazil. \"One person… made Joe Mazzulla magnets for everybody and mailed them to them. That's the kind of magic we're trying to create.\"\n\nHis vision is to formalize the fellowship fans have already forged. To add the flair of team loyalty, so \"you know who you're dealing with.\"\n\nTo move from hot takes to heartfelt bonds.\n\nThis event, Hayes noted, was about \"the intersection of podcasts that are growing, communities that are growing on Threads, and commentators that we think speak to us.\"\n\nAnd into this curated crucible stepped the day's hosts. Matt Barnes. Stephen Jackson. And their guest, the formidable, unfiltered Kendrick Perkins.\n\nThe podcast taping of \"All the Smoke\" became a séance.\n\nThe proverbial smoke cleared not to obscure, but to reveal.\n\nPerkins, the ESPN persona known for volcanic takes, softened into something more vulnerable, more valuable.\n\nHe spoke of the athlete's tunnel vision, a poignant regret that hung in the perfumed air.\n\n\"One of my biggest regrets as a player,\" Perkins confessed, \"we may pass people up, they may give us their business cards. We keep it moving… Now we're in this space… those business cards actually mean something.\"\n\nIt was a stunning admission of life deferred, of human connections missed in the single-minded pursuit of the game.\n\nHe dissected the alchemy of team chemistry not with cold stats, but with the warmth of memory. He shared where things went awry in Oklahoma City.\n\n\"After you won a championship, man, you think you was the reason why. Everybody in the locker room think they was the reason.\"\n\nHis analysis was layered, empathetic, and born of experience. This was the content Threads dreamed of housing: not just debate, but depth. Not just reaction, but reflection.\n\nMeta's Jocelyn Jones, from Threads, watched it fuse into her soft manifesto.\n\n\"We think that Threads can be the place,\" Jones said. \"Where's the conversation that happens around podcasts? There's not a natural place… So, like, why not there be a place for that to happen?\"\n\nSomerville was the answer. It was the \"why not.\"\n\nIt was the physical manifestation of a digital thesis: that discovery is not a fleeting feeling, that discussion is a meal, that community is a melody you feel in your bones.\n\nThe new features on the app are mere signposts. Still, this—this warmth, this whiskey-washed wisdom, the collective silence of onlookers who hung on to every word as \"Big Perk\" peeled back layers of his persona, exposing a vulnerable underbelly, was the destination.\n\nAs Meta updates their code, users of the platform will find convenants in their conversations.\n\nIn a room lit by the glow of screens and content creators, where common threads formed the smells of truffles and heritage wafted, uncommon connections.\n\nThe joy of discovery has found its home. And this, as they say, is just the opening act.",

    "title": "Instagram Is Adding AI-Generated Headlines to Some Posts",
    "description": "No one asked for this.",
    "fullText": "Few of us are under the illusion that we own the content that we post on Instagram, but we do get a say in how that content is presented—we can choose which photos and videos we share, what captions appear (or don't appear) on each post, as well as whether or not we include where the image was taken or shared from. We might not control the platform, but we can control the content of our posts—unless those posts are found on search engines like Google.\n\nAs reported by 404 Media, Instagram is now experimenting with AI-generated SEO titles for users' posts—without those users' input or permission. Take this post for example: Author Jeff VanderMeer uploaded a short video of rabbits eating a banana to his Instagram. The video was posted as-is: There was no caption, location tag, or any other public-facing information. It's just a couple of rabbits having a bite.\n\nA post shared by Jeff VanderMeer (@jeff_vandermeer123)\n\nInstagram, however, took it upon itself to add a headline to the post—at least when you stumble upon it on via Google. Rather than display a link featuring Jeff's Instagram handle and some metadata about the video, the Google entry comes back with the following headline: \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas, A Nutritious Snack for...\" (the rest of the headline cuts off here).\n\nVanderMeer was less than pleased with the discovery. He posted a screenshot of the headline to Bluesky, writing, \"now [Instagram] appears to generate titles [and] headlines via AI for stuff I post...to create [clickbait] for [Google] wtf do not like.\"\n\nThis was not the only AI-generated headline VanderMeer was roped into. This post from the Groton Public Library in Massachusetts, which advertises VanderMeer's novel Annihilation as the library's December book group pick, was also given the clickbait treatment on Google. Just as with VanderMeer's post, the Groton Public Library didn't include any text in its Instagram post—just an image showing off the book. But if you see the post within a Google search, you'll see the following partial headline: \"Join Jeff VanderMeer on a Thrilling Beachside Adventure...\"\n\n404 Media's Emanuel Maiberg says that they've confirmed that Instagram is also generating headlines for other users on the platform, all without permission or knowledge. Google told Maiberg the headlines are not coming from its AI generators—though it has been using deceptive AI-generated headlines of its own on Google Discover. In fact, the company says its search engine is simply pulling the text from Instagram itself. Maiberg found that these headlines do appear under title tags for Instagram posts when using Google's Rich Result Test tool. When digging through the code, Maiberg also discovered AI-generated descriptions for each post, which could be what Instagram is ultimately using to generate the headlines.\n\nI reached out to Meta for comment, and this story originally published before they responded. However, a Meta spokesperson has since confirmed to me that Instagram has recently started generating these titles using AI. The goal, according to the spokesperson, is to make it easier to know what a post is about before you click the link. They also noted that these headlines might not be totally correct, as with all AI products. In addition, the spokesperson explained that search engine optimization indexing is not necessarily new. The company has been doing this for years in the U.S. to increase visibility for posts from professional accounts.\n\nThat last point is all fine and good, of course. No one is surprised that Instagram is indexing posts for search engines: Most social media platforms do that. Otherwise, you'd never find any of their posts on platforms like Google. The issue is generating fake headlines with AI without letting anyone know about it. Just because Meta AI is capable of generating headlines doesn't mean it is good at it, or even that it should—especially when users never consented to this practice in the first place. It'd be one thing if Instagram had an option before you post—something like \"Generate a headline for me using Meta AI that will appear in search engines for my post.\" Most of us would opt out of that, but it'd at least be a choice. However, it appears that Instagram decided that users like VanderMeer weren't capable of writing a headline as clever as \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas.\"\n\nThe worst part is, the AI doesn't even accurately describe the posts, a risk the Meta spokesperson readily admits to. That Groton Public Library post was only about a book club meeting featuring VanderMeer's novel, but the headline says \"Join Jeff VanderMeer,\" as if he'd be making an appearance. Not only did Instagram add a headline without VanderMeer's consent, it spread misinformation about his whereabouts. And for what? Some extra engagement on Google?\n\nIf Instagram wants its posts to appear as headlines on search engines, it should include the actual posters in the conversation. As VanderMeer told 404 Media: \"If I post content, I want to be the one contextualizing it, not some third party.\"\n\nWhile Meta has yet to add a dedicated on/off switch for these headlines, one thing you can do to ensure your posts don't get an AI clickbait makeover is to opt out of indexing as a whole. If you run an account that relies on discoverability, this might not be worth it, since you'll be impacting how users find your posts outside of Instagram. However, if you don't care about that, or you don't need the SEO at all, you can stop Instagram from making your posts available on search engines—and putting an end to the AI-generated headlines, at that.\n\nThere are three ways to accomplish this, according to Instagram:\n\nMake your account private: Head to Instagram's in-app settings, then choose Account privacy. Here, tap the Private account toggle.\n\nSwitch your account from professional to private: Open Instagram's in-app settings, scroll down and tap Account type and tools. Here, choose \"Switch to personal account.\"\n\nManually opt out of indexing: Head to Instagram's in-app settings, then choose Account privacy. You should see an option to stop your public photos and videos from appearing in search engines.",

    "description": "The mysterious algorithm is now (somewhat) customizable.",
    "fullText": "After years of suffering from a crippling TikTok addiction, I decided enough was enough: I quit the app cold turkey and deleted it from my phone. Then, I discovered Instagram Reels, and my attention span hasn't been the same since.\n\nTikTok's algorithm is infamous, but we don't give Instagram's enough credit. This platform is addicting. I hardly use the app to keep up with friends and family anymore: Reels grabs my attention and doesn't let go, and before I know it, it's midnight, and I've done nothing with my evening. How many videos did I watch? What did I even watch? Whatever Meta has going on in that algorithm is dangerous stuff.\n\nYou can influence the algorithm, of course: The decisions you make in the app—likes, comments, watch time, sharing—tell the algorithm which videos you like, which you don't, and inform its fraction-of-a-second decisions about what to show you next. But until now, you haven't been able to see what's driving those decisions. You're kind of flying blind—you can try to steer the algorithm in a new direction, but you'll never know exactly what direction you're really going in.\n\nThat's now changing. As reported by Wired, Meta is rolling out a new tab for Reels viewers that will let us see why the algorithm is delivering us these particular videos. This tab, called, appropriately, \"Your Algorithm,\" is now rolling out, first in the U.S., but soon to the rest of the world—at least, only to English speakers. It seems reminiscent of TikTok's \"Manage Topics\" feed, which lets you adjust the content types that appear in your For You feed.\n\nWhen \"Your Algorithm\" hits your phone, you'll find it in the top right corner of the Reels feed: two lines with heart icons placed on each. (I had to update the app and force quit it a couple times to get it to appear.) Once you open this tab, you'll see a short summary of the type of content the algorithm says you've liked recently. In Meta's example, it says, \"Lately you've been into creativity, sports hype, fitness motivation, [and] skateboarding.\" Mine says, \"Lately you've been into classic video games, laughing at comedy clubs, and making beats in the studio.\"\n\nBeneath this summary, you'll find the \"What you want to see more of\" section. Here, you can choose specific content categories you'd like to appear in your feed more often. Instagram will populate some choices here based on your past interests—Meta's example from above shows things like \"Sports,\" \"GRWM,\" \"Thrifting,\" and \"Horror movies\"—but you can tap an \"Add\" button to contribute your own requests. You can tap any of these content types to find the option to watch Reels in that category, in case you want to test drive any before locking in your choices.\n\nBeneath this, you'll find \"What you want to see less of.\" This is the same concept, but the reverse: You can choose any content types you don't want in your feed anymore. If you're sick of seeing hiking videos, but Instagram continues to show them to you, here's your chance to directly tell the algorithm to cut it out.\n\nIf you tap the three dots in the top right, you'll find some shortcuts to existing content controls, too, like whether to suggest political content on your feed, \"sensitive\" content controls, and specific words and phrase filters, to name a few. You can also tap the share button to share your algorithm summary to your story. I'm not sure who would want to do that, but I guess I shared my summary here, so who am I to judge.\n\nWired highlights how these changes come as the European Commission is pushing Meta to present more data controls to EU users: These users have so far been able to pay to not see ads, but since the European Commission didn't think that was enough, Meta will allow users to choose whether to allow all their data to be used for personalized ads, or only a small percentage.\n\nThat's not happening here in the U.S., but that doesn't mean Meta is staying the same, either. \"Your Algorithm\" is launching as Meta is facing criticism over how it handles younger users on its platforms. Reports suggest Meta understands how addictive its apps are, especially to teens, and the company's internal policies for chatbot interactions with minors was, frankly, appalling. The company has rolled out Teen Accounts across apps like Instagram and Facebook, which offer limits on communications and interactions, and new AI parental controls are also on their way. \"Your Algorithm\" seems to be the latest in a string of efforts to make it easier for users to control the experience on Meta platforms. Theoretically, you could even use these controls to make your Reels experience less addicting.\n\nThose are all good developments as far as I'm concerned, but I fear there's still quite a lot of work to do to make Meta's products—as well as many other social media products—less addictive, and, overall, better for us. Case in point: I opened the app to test out \"Your Algorithm,\" and not only did I not find it at first, I ended up losing five minutes of my life watching the first video that appeared in my feed. I need to delete Instagram from my phone.",

    "description": "Five months after Meta's $14 billion deal, Scale AI has lost some of its gleam, with workers sniping about pay, and rivals coming for its clientele.",
    "fullText": "This summer, after Meta made a $14 billion investment in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, and after A-list clients like OpenAI and Google halted work with the startup, a worker for Scale AI anxiously asked ChatGPT what it thought of his company's fate. He knew the chatbot well, having tested it for vulnerabilities. Its prognosis was grim.\n\n\"Scale AI will no longer exist as a credible independent entity within 24 months,\" ChatGPT, which isn't any kind of official authority, wrote. \"Its infrastructure will be repurposed for Meta's internal needs. Its client base will evaporate. Its role as a neutral red teamer or external evaluator is effectively over.\"\n\nThe contractor shared the chat logs with fellow workers at Scale AI. In one reply reviewed by Business Insider, one worker said that they were already on their way out, describing the startup as a ticking time bomb.\n\nThe chatbot was drawing from a storm of headlines about Scale AI, which until this summer had been touted as one of the most ascendant startups in tech — the place Big Tech companies vying for AI supremacy went to when they wanted their chatbots stress-tested and perfected. Lately, it's lost some of its gleam, with investors significantly lowering valuations, workers sniping about pay, and rivals coming for its clientele.\n\nThe vast army of human data labelers that made Scale AI a juggernaut are chafing at what they say are pay cuts, lengthy unpaid onboarding sessions to join new AI projects, and thinning workloads — and are increasingly leaving the platform altogether, according to interviews with five current and former contractors and internal correspondence obtained by Business Insider.\n\nActivity in the main internal chatroom for Outlier — Scale AI's flagship gig work platform, which touts more than 100,000 taskers — has plummeted since the Meta investment, with weekly discussion threads drawing dozens instead of the usual hundreds of replies, according to screenshots reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nOne tasker said that they'd spent close to 40 hours in a single month in unpaid onboarding sessions without landing any actual work, noting that other platforms like Scale AI's rival Mercor do pay for this kind of work. Elizabeth Boyd, another tasker, says she rarely does work for Outlier anymore after seeing effective pay rates for some projects slashed to around $20 an hour — down from the $50 she used to make. One gig that advertised $20 an hour only allowed three minutes of working time every two days, or a 99-cent payout, according to screenshots obtained by Business Insider.\n\nJoe Osborne, a Scale AI spokesperson, says the balance sheets show the company is on the right path. \"This quarter is on track to be our biggest of 2025, our data business is more profitable today than it was before the Meta deal, and our applications business, which includes work with Fortune 500 companies and governments, has doubled revenue\" in the second half of the year compared to the first, Osborne wrote in an email. He also noted there has been an increase in active users on Outlier since the Meta deal, and that pay rates are based on the skills for each project and contributors always see the rates upfront, and have the option of declining any gig.\n\nThe company is also looking to diversify. The startup has embraced fields like robotics, announcing a new lab to meet booming demand for robot training data this fall. It's doubling down on its US military and other government work, winning up to $199 million worth of defense contracts since the Meta deal.\n\nSome investors are bullish. In one current investor's view, Meta has mostly left Scale alone, letting it operate as an independent company. With around $1 billion on the balance sheet, the investor added, there are no plans to fundraise. And an IPO could still be on the table at some point.\n\nOther investors see Scale AI as more like a gutted fish. The Meta investment — which valued Scale AI at $29 billion — has dented Scale AI's valuation in private markets where people buy and sell equity from pre-IPO startups. Noel Moldvai, Augment's CEO, tells Business Insider his platform used to process millions of dollars' worth of transactions in Scale AI stock before the Meta deal, but that dried up as sellers waited to see if the startup rebounded. Activity is picking up again, he said, but at lower valuations of around $15 billion to $9 billion. The underlying message of Meta's semi-acquisition is clear to Moldvai. \"It seems like Meta was just after Alexandr Wang, and so this is probably the structure that let them get him,\" he says. He adds that Scale AI's valuation could still bounce back.\n\nOn another marketplace, Caplight, Scale's valuation has dropped to $7.3 billion. Osborne says that the valuation is not accurate because there have been no sales of stock at that price and multiples of comparable companies would yield a higher valuation.\n\nIf the company doesn't pull it off, it could become the latest example of a once-promising startup that morphed into a \"zombie\" after being invested in by a tech giant.\n\nThis summer, Scale AI painted a rosy picture of the Meta investment, describing it as a major cash infusion and source of future work in its official statement at the time of the deal. That messaging was also conveyed to the startup's corporate workforce, says another former member of Scale AI's red team, which tests chatbots for flaws and vulnerabilities. Just a few weeks after the investment, he was laid off as part of a major downsizing that saw 14% of Scale AI's full-time staff of 1,400 let go.\n\nOsborne said the layoffs were aimed at making the data division profitable, which it now is.\n\nThose weren't the only cuts. In September, Scale AI terminated 12 contractors on its red team, citing performance issues. Two ex-red teamers told Business Insider that the team's work had been drying up since the Meta deal, blaming thinning workloads for the cuts. Later that month, Scale AI shuttered a team in Dallas of contractors focused on generalist AI work as it moved towards more specialized fields.\n\nOsborne said the 12 contractors were part of Scale's temporary workforce and represented a small fraction of its overall red team, which the company is still committed to investing in. He said the Dallas cuts were part of an industry shift towards higher skilled work and represent a small fraction of its overall workforce.\n\nMeanwhile, a swarm of AI training startups has rushed in to poach Scale AI's workers and clients. Some are now raising capital at soaring valuations. Surge AI hit a valuation of $24 billion while Mercor, which is run by three 22-year-olds, announced in October it had raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation.\n\nMercor has won at least one major AI training project from Meta, Scale AI's 49% shareholder. In September, Scale AI filed a lawsuit in California against Mercor alleging it hired one of its sales employees to poach its biggest customers, allegations Mercor denies.\n\nOne Scale AI investor said he'd been frustrated with Scale AI's leadership losing customers to Surge AI in particular, which reportedly brought in more revenue than Scale in 2024, despite never having raised outside funding. (Scale AI had raised more than $1.5 billion before the Meta deal.)\n\nBrendan Foody, Mercor's CEO, has publicly criticized Scale AI for what he claims are low pay rates and data quality issues. \"Scale lost the focus on product, on scaling quality,\" Foody said in a September podcast appearance. In response, a Scale AI spokesperson told Business Insider its quality metrics are at \"record highs.\"\n\nIt's not just rival CEOs making that point. Tammy Hartline, who managed projects for Scale AI as a consultant until the summer of 2025, said Scale grew so quickly that the work became more about needing bodies than skills. \"Spam and low quality data became accepted as a cost of doing business,\" she said. Hartline joined Mercor in September.\n\nScale AI has also been beset with security issues that predate Meta's investment. In June, Business Insider reported that Scale AI routinely used public Google Docs to track work for high-profile customers, including Google, Meta, and xAI. That practice left AI training documents labeled \"confidential\" accessible to anyone with the link and exposed reams of personal information, like private emails and pay details, about contractors. \"We take data security seriously,\" Osborne said. \"We conducted a thorough investigation and disabled any user's ability to publicly share documents from Scale managed systems.\"\n\nSloppy security isn't uncommon in the AI training space — Surge AI similarly left open sensitive work for its client Anthropic. But the exposed documents seen by Business Insider show that for a project for Google, Scale AI faced security and quality issues throughout 2023 and 2024. Thousands of taskers were flagged for being \"suspected spammers,\" \"cheaters,\" with hundreds of workers listed in spreadsheets with titles like \"Good and Bad Folks\" and \"suspicious non-US taskers.\" Meta recently removed more than 40 groups buying and reselling AI training accounts, including from Scale AI, in response to a recent Business Insider investigation. Osborne said Scale's data quality metrics are the highest they've ever been.\n\nThe company has notched some recent wins. It once appeared bogged down by litigation, but recently agreed to settle multiple lawsuits filed by ex-workers in California who alleged they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors. (Scale no longer accepts gig workers from the state.) The big question remains whether Scale AI can thrive in the increasingly competitive AI training industry it helped give birth to. For many former workers, it'll be too late to find out.\n\nCharles Rollet is Business Insider's tech correspondent in San Francisco.

    "fullText": "A startup nabbing a $14 billion investment from one of the top tech companies seems like a good thing. The reality is a lot more complicated.\n\nScale AI has faced a turbulent five months since Meta purchased a 49% stake in the startup, write BI's Charles Rollet and Ben Bergman. Once a leader in the field of stress testing and perfecting AI models for Big Tech, Scale AI has faced pay cuts, poaching, and pivots since the Meta deal.\n\nIt's representative of how dealmaking with big players can be a double-edged sword in the age of AI.\n\nFor some, like Scale AI cofounder Alexandr Wang, who's now a high-level Meta exec, the deal was a windfall. However, according to interviews with five current and former contractors and internal correspondence obtained by BI, Scale AI has faced some inner turmoil following the Meta deal.\n\nJoe Osborne, a Scale AI spokesperson, strongly disputed that the startup's business has been in trouble since the Meta investment and said this quarter is on track to be the company's biggest of the year.\n\nNot all of Scale AI's issues are related to the Meta deal. A BI investigation this June found Scale AI routinely used public Google Docs for work with its Big Tech clients. (There was no indication of a breach, and Scale did lock down the documents after BI's report about the issue.) It also faced litigation over claims it misclassified and underpaid contract workers.\n\nBut one of the larger problems stems from some Big Tech companies pausing work with Scale now that one of their competitors — Meta — is its biggest backer.\n\nThe AI environment means more startups could encounter similar issues.\n\nThe Scale AI-Meta deal was unique in many ways, but there are still lessons to be learned from the aftermath.\n\nThe top-heavy ecosystem of the AI marketplace means there are a limited number of landing spots for startups looking for exit opportunities. Add in the ultra-competitive nature of the space, and a deal with one company could mean the end of business with the others.\n\nOf course, not every startup will get acquired by a tech giant. And yes, some startups will have products that companies will need to use regardless of their backers. But for the vast majority of young AI companies, that's not a reality.\n\nSo, if the industry faces a bit of turmoil and funding dries up, startups may have some difficult decisions about who they cut deals with and which doors could close to them.",

    "description": "Meta is planning to raise prices for its VR devices, citing tariffs and a shift to sustainable business models for long-term growth.",
    "fullText": "Meta is planning to raise prices for its virtual reality devices, executives said in an internal memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nMetaverse leaders Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns told employees that the company must \"make a shift\" in its business model to ensure long-term sustainability. This will include measures such as price increases, accounting for new costs like tariffs, and extending the replacement cycle of its in-market devices, per the memo.\n\n\"Our devices will be more premium in price going forward, but we'll have a healthier business to anchor on and free ourselves from feeling existential about any singular device's success,\" Aul and Cairns wrote in the memo, shared with staff on December 4.\n\nThey also called for delivering high-quality software experiences to customers that can match the \"excellence\" of its devices, adding that this may mean \"we ship new hardware at a slower cadence going forward.\"\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe company's flagship virtual reality (VR) headset, the Meta Quest 3, retails for $499.99, while its entry-level model retails at $299.99.\n\nThe move comes as Meta pushed back the release of its new mixed reality glasses, codenamed \"Phoenix,\" from the second half of 2026 to the first half of 2027, as outlined in a product strategy note to staff that Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThe memo announcing the price increases from Aul and Cairns did not refer to its mixed reality glasses. The document outlined three major themes derived from a recent Reality Labs strategy meeting with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CTO Andrew Bosworth. They included how Meta can build a sustainable VR business for the long term, how it can build \"world-class\" software experiences, and how it can accelerate its pace on mobile.\n\nThey also sought to reassure staffers that it remains focused on VR. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Meta plans to make budget cuts of up to 30% to Reality Labs, the division responsible for Meta's hardware.\n\n\"We're committed to VR for the long-haul so we need to align our business model and roadmap to an approach that will make this possible,\" they wrote in the memo. \"We've been working hard to bend the curve and accelerate ahead of the category's natural growth rate, which means running multiple programs in parallel as well as carrying costs like tariffs and subsidies for content, GTM, and devices.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Instagram May Be Quietly Adding AI-Generated Headlines to Your Posts",
    "description": "No one asked for this.",
    "fullText": "Few of us are under the illusion that we own the content that we post on Instagram, but we do get a say in how that content is presented—w can choose which photos and videos we share, what captions appear (or don't appear) on each post, as well as whether or not we include where the image was taken or shared from. We might not control the platform, but we do control the content of our posts—unless those posts are found on search engines like Google.\n\nAs reported by 404 Media, it appears that Instagram is experimenting with AI-generated SEO titles for users' posts—without those users' input or permission. Take this post for example: Author Jeff VanderMeer uploaded a short video of rabbits eating a banana to his Instagram. The video was posted as-is: There was no caption, location tag, or any other public-facing information. It's just a couple of rabbits having a bite.\n\nA post shared by Jeff VanderMeer (@jeff_vandermeer123)\n\nInstagram, however, took it upon itself to add a headline to the post—at least when you stumble upon it on via Google. Rather than display a link featuring Jeff's Instagram handle and some metadata about the video, the Google entry comes back with the following headline: \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas, A Nutritious Snack for...\" (the rest of the headline cuts off here).\n\nVanderMeer was less than pleased with the discovery. He posted a screenshot of the headline to Bluesky, writing, \"now [Instagram] appears to generate titles [and] headlines via AI for stuff I post...to create [clickbait] for [Google] wtf do not like.\"\n\nThis was not the only AI-generated headline VanderMeer was roped into. This post from the Groton Public Library in Massachusetts, which advertises VanderMeer's novel Annihilation as the library's December book group pick, was also given the \"clickbait\" treatment on Google. Just as with VanderMeer's post, the Groton Public Library didn't include any text in its Instagram post—just an image showing off the book. But if you see the post within a Google search, you'll see the following partial headline: \"Join Jeff VanderMeer on a Thrilling Beachside Adventure with Mesta...\"\n\n404 Media's Emanuel Maiberg says that they've confirmed that Instagram is also generating headlines for other users on the platform, all without permission or knowledge. Meta did not return 404 Media's request for comment. (I have also reached out for comment.) Google, on the other hand, did return 404 Media's messages, and confirmed the headlines are not coming from its AI generators—though it has been using deceptive AI-generated headlines of its own on Google Discover. In fact, the company says its search engine is simply pulling the text from Instagram itself. Maiberg found that these headlines do appear under title tags for Instagram posts when using Google's Rich Result Test tool. When digging through the code, Maiberg also discovered AI-generated descriptions for each post, which could be what Instagram is ultimately using to generate the headlines.\n\nI'll update this post if I hear back from Instagram regarding these AI-generated headlines. Until then, I can only speculate on their intended purpose (assuming Instagram is the one generating these headlines in the first place). And the likeliest reason is to boost engagement: Instagram probably wants to increase the visibility of its users' posts in search, which means giving Google more information to work with. If the user doesn't provide their own details about the image, Instagram's AI appears to be filling in the blanks, first generating a description, and from there, sticking a \"clicky\" headline onto it.\n\nThe results aren't actually all that appealing, though. Just because Meta AI may be capable of generating headlines, doesn't mean it is good at it, or even that it should—especially when users never consented to this practice in the first place. It'd be one thing if Instagram had an option before you post—something like \"Generate a headline for me using Meta AI that will appear in search engines for my post.\" Most of us would opt out of that, but it'd at least be a choice. However, it appears that Instagram decided that users like VanderMeer weren't capable of writing a headline as clever as \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas.\"\n\nThe worst part is, the AI doesn't even accurately describe the posts. That Groton Public Library post was only about a book club meeting featuring VanderMeer's novel, but the headline says \"Join Jeff VanderMeer,\" as if he'd be making an appearance. Not only did Instagram add a headline without VanderMeer's consent, it spread misinformation about his whereabouts. And for what? Some extra engagement on Google?\n\nIf Instagram wants its posts to appear as headlines on search engines, it should include the actual posters in the conversation. As VanderMeer told 404 Media: \"If I post content, I want to be the one contextualizing it, not some third party.\"",

    "title": "Australia’s world-first social media ban begins as millions of children and teens lose access to accounts",
    "description": "Accounts held by users under 16 must be removed on apps that include TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube, Snapchat, Reddit, Kick, Twitch and Threads under...",
    "fullText": "Accounts held by users under 16 must be removed on apps that include TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube, Snapchat, Reddit, Kick, Twitch and Threads under ban\n\nHow is Australia’s social media ban affecting you and your family?\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nAustralia has enacted a world-first ban on social media for users aged under 16, causing millions of children and teenagers to lose access to their accounts.\n\nFacebook, Instagram, Threads, X, YouTube, Snapchat, Reddit, Kick, Twitch and TikTok are expected to have taken steps from Wednesday to remove accounts held by users under 16 years of age in Australia, and prevent those teens from registering new accounts.\n\nPlatforms that do not comply risk fines of up to $49.5m.\n\nThere have been some teething problems with the ban’s implementation. Guardian Australia has received several reports of those under 16 passing the facial age assurance tests, but the government has flagged it is not expecting the ban will be perfect from day one.\n\nAll listed platforms apart from X had confirmed by Tuesday they would comply with the ban. The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said it had recently had a conversation with X about how it would comply, but the company had not communicated its policy to users.\n\nBluesky, an X alternative, announced on Tuesday it would also ban under-16s, despite eSafety assessing the platform as “low risk” due to its small user base of 50,000 in Australia.\n\nChildren had spent the past few weeks undertaking age assurance checks, swapping phone numbers and preparing for their accounts to be deactivated.\n\nThe Australian chief executive and co-founder of the age assurance service k-ID, Kieran Donovan, said his service had conducted hundreds of thousands of age checks in the past few weeks. The k-ID service was being used by Snapchat among others.\n\nParents of children affected by the ban shared a spectrum of views on the policy. One parent told the Guardian their 15-year-old daughter was “very distressed” because “all her 14 to 15-year-old friends have been age verified as 18 by Snapchat”. Since she had been identified as under 16, they feared “her friends will keep using Snapchat to talk and organise social events and she will be left out”.\n\nAnother parent said the ban had forced him to teach his child how to break the law. “I’ve shown her how VPNs work and other methods on bypassing age restrictions,” he said. “I’ve had to set her up with her own adult YouTube account and have assisted her in bypassing TikTok’s age-estimation and will keep doing so each time it asks.”\n\nOthers said the ban “can’t come quickly enough”. One parent said their daughter was “completely addicted” to social media and the ban “provides us with a support framework to keep her off these platforms”.\n\nThe Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said in an opinion piece on Sunday: “From the beginning, we’ve acknowledged this process won’t be 100% perfect. But the message this law sends will be 100% clear … Australia sets the legal drinking age at 18 because our society recognises the ­benefits to the individual and the community of such an ­approach.\n\n“The fact that teenagers occasionally find a way to have a drink doesn’t diminish the value of having a clear, ­national standard.”\n\nPolling has consistently shown that two-thirds of voters support raising the minimum age for social media to 16. The opposition, including leader Sussan Ley, have recently voiced alarm about the ban, despite waving the legislation through parliament and the former Liberal leader Peter Dutton championing it.\n\nThe ban has garnered worldwide attention, with several nations indicating they will adopt a ban of their own, including Malaysia, Denmark and Norway. The European Union passed a resolution to adopt similar restrictions, while a spokesperson for the British government told Reuters it was “closely monitoring Australia’s approach to age restrictions”.\n\nInman Grant told the Guardian that from Thursday, she would be sending notices to the platforms covered by the ban to find out how the implementation was progressing.\n\nQuestions included “how many accounts [they’ve] deactivated or removed, what challenges they’re finding, how they’re preventing recidivism and preventing circumvention, whether or not their abuse or reporting abuse and the appeals processes are working as planned”, she said.\n\nAlbanese said the information gathered in this process would be made public.\n\nThe regulator would need to assess whether platforms were taking reasonable steps. If they were not, it could take that platform to court to seek fines.\n\nThere would be an independent evaluation of the ban conducted by an academic advisory group examining the short-term, medium-term and longer-term impacts of the ban.\n\n“It will look at the benefits over time, but also the unintended consequences,” Inman Grant said.\n\n“Everything from are sleeping? Are they interacting or are they actually getting out on the sports fields? Are they reading books? Are they taking less medication like antidepressants? Are their Naplan scores improving over time?” Inman Grant said.\n\nPotential unintended consequences to be investigated included whether children were moving on to “darker areas of the internet”, learning how to bypass the bans through VPNs, or moving on to other platforms, she said.\n\nTeens on Snapchat affected by the ban had been publicly sharing their mobile numbers in their profiles ahead of their accounts being shut down.\n\nA spokesperson for Snapchat said the platform understood under-16s were disappointed by the ban but “would strongly encourage any teens using Snapchat not to publicly share their personal contact information”.\n\nInman Grant said she had sent notices to 15 companies not initially included in the ban, asking them to self-assess whether they should be.\n\nYope and Lemon8, which shot up the app store rankings as teens looked for alternatives, were among those contacted.",

And doing great things, especially young entrepreneurs,\" Jena said.\n\nAt the same time, children watching adult content online \"has a very bad effect\".\n\nAt a Mumbai park, cricket coach Pratik Bhurke, 38, said Australia's move would encourage children to spend time outdoors and could have \"great benefits\" in India too.\n\nIn the chilly German capital, Luna Drewes, 13, is watching selfie-style TikTok clips posted by other young people.\n\n\"Actually a good thing in some ways because social media often portrays a certain image of how people should look, like girls have to be thin,\" she said of the ban.\n\nAnother teenager, Enno Caro Brandes, said: \"I'm 15 so for me the ban would definitely come into effect. I can't really imagine giving it up completely.\n\n\"A ban is a bit extreme, but it could definitely help to do a detox.\"\n\nAn AI baby singing and answering interview questions are among the videos served up to Firdha Razak, 16, as she scrolls in her room.\n\nRazak is not in favour of a ban. \"It's really stupid, honestly,\" although \"there's not really much we can do as 16-year-olds\" if governments decide to act, she said.\n\nThe families of many people in Qatar live abroad, so \"it's going to be so much harder to talk to them\".\n\nAlso in Doha, Youssef Walid, 16, said bans like Australia's were \"a bit harsh\" and hard to enforce.\n\n\"We can use VPN. We can easily bypass the security and easily make new accounts,\" he said.\n\n- Lagos: 'We were born with it' -\n\nAt a Nigerian high school, Mitchelle Okinedo is revising for exams, checking over her hand-written notes. In the classroom -- where phones are banned -- students in uniform sit at separate desks.\n\n\"I see where the (Australian) government is coming from. Students nowadays, they are really distracted,\" Okinedo said.\n\nEven so, \"we were born with it\", the 15-year-old added. \"And I don't think it's something I want to stop.\"\n\nHer mother, 50-year-old event planner Hannah Okinedo, agrees with a social media ban for under-16s, saying most parents \"don't have time to monitor their children all day\".\n\n- Mexico City: 'Express yourself' -\n\nYoung Mexico City resident Aranza Gomez, 11, has had a smartphone with access to social media for one year.\n\nWithout it, \"I would honestly feel sad. I wouldn't really have a good way to spend my time,\" she said.\n\nSantiago Ramirez Rojas, 16, is sitting on a bench in the Tabacalera district, scrolling through posts containing news about Argentina and tour dates for a musician.\n\n\"Social media today is very important for expressing yourself, no matter how old you are,\" said Rojas.\n\nBut \"there are many kidnappings that begin online\" and \"younger kids, around 10 or 12, are much more vulnerable\".\n\n- Sydney: 'Not going to have any impact' -\n\nIn Australia one family has diverging ideas on how the law will go.\n\n\"I don't think the government really knows what they're doing and I don't think it's going to have any impact on children of Australia,\" said 15-year-old Layton Lewis.\n\nBut his mother Emily Lewis hopes it will help children \"have better, more authentic relationships\".\n\n\"They'll make proper plans, like we used to, to meet up with their friends face-to-face and have proper conversations as opposed to these illusive friendships online,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "As midlife audiences turn to digital media, the 55 to 64 age bracket is an increasingly important demographic\n\nIn 2022, Caroline Idiens was on holiday halfway up an Italian mountain when her brother called to tell her to check her Instagram account. “I said, ‘I haven’t got any wifi. And he said: ‘Every time you refresh, it’s adding 500 followers.’ So I had to try to get to the top of the hill with the phone to check for myself.”\n\nA personal trainer from Berkshire who began posting her fitness classes online at the start of lockdown in 2020, Idiens, 53, had already built a respectable following.\n\nBut after one video offering guidance on getting toned summer arms was picked up by a US fitness account, that number rocketed to 50,000 – and beyond. “I post it every year now as a bit of a tribute,” she jokes. “It was that reel that launched me into a whole new market.”\n\nToday, as @carolinescircuits, she has 2.3 million followers on Instagram, more than 70,000 on Tiktok and 50,000 on YouTube, and a book, Fit at 50, that was a recent Sunday Times bestseller – making her a key influencer in an increasingly important demographic for social media platforms: those in midlife and older.\n\nIf you want to grow your reach on social media, figures suggested this week, you could do worse than target the over-55s.\n\nResearch from media analysts Ampere found it was people in the 55 to 64 age bracket who were delivering the highest growth in YouTube traffic, up 20% since 2020 in the US and 14% in the UK. Tiktok, too, has had a 16% rise in British users in this age bracket in the past year.\n\n“We’ve been seeing this trend over the last few years where older audiences who have traditionally [focused on] linear and broadcast TV have been digitising,” says Minal Modha, the head of Ampere’s consumer research division.\n\n“And by getting access to things like smartphones and smart TVs in particular, it’s opening up a whole new world for them.” More than half of US adults in the age bracket now watch influencer videos weekly.\n\nSome of them will be tuning in to Valerie Mackay from Inverness, who as @embracingfifty has gained 312,000 followers on Tiktok and almost 1 million on Instagram since she started her warmly chatty account eight years ago.\n\n“In hindsight, I wouldn’t have picked that name ’cause I’m now 62 and stuck with it. But the point of the name was I was embracing life over 50. I had two children, they had both left home and I was enjoying life with myself and my husband, it was like freedom.”\n\nShe founded her account after overhearing a woman asking what was the point of makeup and style after a certain age. “I just thought, well, what’s the point in life? Just dress and be who you want to be.”\n\nMackay says she tries not to think about the huge numbers watching her from around the world – many of whom share an interest in the Scottish weather.\n\n“I get asked a lot: ‘I’m coming to Scotland, what do I wear?’ Which it’s difficult for me to answer because I might be flitting about in a trench coat and they might need big coats.”\n\nMark Lidster is a 62-year-old from north London who posts videos as FitnessGeezer on YouTube and Instagram, attracting up to 1m views. “There are a lot of guys out there getting to 40, through to 70, 80 – who relate and take inspiration from what I’m doing,” he says.\n\nLike Mackay, Lidster says actively engaging with his audience is crucial. As well as becoming more savvy with tech, he says, “people of that age are feeling more disconnected from society, and getting lonelier. Social media is another way of feeling part of something – I try to create that community feel.”\n\nThe crucial thing with 50-somethings and older is “to keep it genuine”, says Idiens, who is 53.\n\n“The biggest thing about social media in this age bracket is trust,” she says.\n\n“It has to be genuine – we are a little bit older and wiser, and what the audience are really looking for are people that they can trust with advice. For the midlife demographic, they also really love that sense of community.\n\n“Even with an audience of 2 million, I still think, when I’m putting up a post, that it’s going to my friends and family group. And the feedback I get is that [my followers] still feel like I’m a PT [personal trainer] in their sitting room – which, for me, is everything. That’s what I want.”",
