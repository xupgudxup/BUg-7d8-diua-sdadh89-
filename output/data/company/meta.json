    "fullText": "US law enforcement officers say Meta and Snapchat routinely delay or reject warrants. The companies disagree\n\nMax Osterman was 18 when he connected with a drug dealer on Snapchat who used the handle skyhigh.303. Max would message him whenever he wanted to buy Percocet, and they would meet. After about a year, and just days after their last exchange, Max collapsed. The pills he ordered had been laced with fentanyl. He died from the overdose in February 2021 at his home in Broomfield, Colorado.\n\nThe dealer continued selling prescription painkillers until 2023, when he was jailed on two drug distribution convictions. When handing down the sentence, the judge said he was responsible for four deaths, yet he never faced charges for supplying the pills that killed Max.\n\n“Snapchat never gave this critical evidence, never took action, never stopped the dealer who had been selling drugs on their platform for years before Max’s death and even after,” said Kim Osterman, his mother. “It took three separate requests from law enforcement for Snapchat to even respond, and when they did, they claimed there was no information.”\n\nA police report reviewed by the Guardian shows a delay in obtaining data from the dealer’s Snapchat account, which investigators said they needed to definitively link him to Max’s death. The report also states that Snapchat did not provide law enforcement with any content from Max’s account apart from his user information. When Colorado detectives first sent Snap Inc, the app’s parent company, a production of records request for account information on skyhigh.3o3, it took more than two months to receive a reply. When the response did arrive, Snap said it would not comply, citing a grammar technicality in the order. The inclusion of a “/,” the company argued, made the request “ambiguous”, according to a field case report from the Broomfield police department. The company eventually sent detectives information on the drug dealer’s account, skyhigh.303, in response to several separate warrants law enforcement filed in the year after Max’s death. No content from Max’s Snapchat account was ever provided to law enforcement, the police report states.\n\nThe Guardian has reviewed four cases where Snap Inc and Meta have delayed or declined to comply with warrants and subpoenas requesting information related to serious crimes linked to their platforms. Eight law enforcement officers interviewed have said multiple cases reviewed by the Guardian are emblematic of a wider problem they face with the companies, which often delay or decline to comply with warrants and subpoenas requesting information related to serious crimes on their platforms. According to court records, police reports and interviews with law enforcement officials, these refusals and lags can derail investigations into crimes ranging from fentanyl deaths to child sexual exploitation.\n\nA Snap Inc statement reads: “Our deepest sympathies go out to the families who have suffered such heartbreaking loss. A critical part of our efforts to help keep our community safe includes our longstanding and crucial engagement with law enforcement to help bring criminals to justice for the harm they cause our community. In both instances, Snap responded to multiple legal requests relating to the cases, so the suggestion that we did not support these investigations is simply inaccurate.”\n\nMeta said in a statement: “We strongly disagree with the assertions made in this story, and our fast cooperation with law enforcement led to arrests in the cases in question. Last year, we received over 9,000 emergency requests from US authorities and resolved them within an average of 67 minutes – and even more quickly for cases involving child safety and suicide. To protect user privacy, it’s important that we follow appropriate legal processes and request clarifications where necessary, but we work to support law enforcement as much as we can.”\n\nThe spokesperson added that Meta produced data in 88% of the nearly 75,000 requests it received from US authorities between July and December last year.\n\nIn a statement, the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC) called for clearer rules, faster processes and collaboration between law enforcement, lawyers and tech leaders reaching across the aisle.\n\n“Every day of delay puts a child at risk. It can exacerbate damage and even cost lives. We can’t afford to let the delays continue,” said Shawnna Hoffman, chief executive of ICMEC and a former legal technology expert witness. “But the problems now are real, and if cooperation and alignment can’t rapidly make these processes happen faster, then we would in principle support new regulations to force greater urgency.”\n\nWhen platforms are not responsive, suspects can go unidentified and arrests can be postponed, giving perpetrators more opportunities to offend and putting the public at risk, said eight federal and state law enforcement officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\n“These suspects are often transient. They might be at college for a semester, or just crashing with a friend, and by the time we get the data, they’ve already moved on,” said one officer with the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) taskforce, a national network of law enforcement agencies dedicated to combating online child exploitation. “If we’d had the information in time, they would have been arrested. Instead, we show up and hear, ‘They moved out a few weeks ago.’”\n\nFor ICAC officers pursuing cases of online exploitation, two companies stand out for their lack of cooperation: Meta and Snap. Investigators say some refusals are based on minor technicalities. “It can be something as minimal as a dash or comma,” said another ICAC officer. “It feels like they’re playing legal games. We’ve had objections from companies over clerical details that delay cases for a while.”\n\nSuch lags can be especially devastating in cases of online child sexual exploitation and the production and distribution of child sexual abuse material, said members of law enforcement specializing in cases of crimes against children.\n\nIn June, a Boston court sentenced Charlese Horton, a registered sex offender, to at least 25 years in prison for kidnapping and assaulting a boy lured to meet them through Facebook. Investigators say solving the case was made more difficult when Meta did not fully comply with the subpoenas they sent as exigent requests for information they urgently needed to identify Horton.\n\n“It can be weeks or months when we send a search warrant for data before companies get back to us,” said a current ICAC commanding officer. “When we are finally able to knock on the door and find the child victim, we determine that there has been additional abuse since we were waiting on that search warrant return.”\n\nSubpoenas and warrants form the backbone of these investigations, allowing law enforcement to obtain evidence from social media profiles. Subpoenas can be issued by a court or government agency without needing a judge’s approval. With regards to social media, these legal orders can compel a company to provide basic account information such as a user’s name, email address or IP login records. They generally cannot access private communications. Warrants, which require judicial approval and a demonstration of probable cause, permit investigators to obtain sensitive material, such as private messages, photos and videos.\n\nPart of the tension between police and tech platforms stems from the legal framework that governs digital privacy and access to communications in the United States.\n\nThe fourth amendment, which prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures” by the government, requires law enforcement to show probable cause and secure a judge’s approval before accessing private communications. In practice, that means investigators must obtain a search warrant before companies like Meta and Snap release sensitive material such as private messages.\n\nLayered on top of that barrier is the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) and its Stored Communications Act (SCA) provision, which set rules for how companies store and disclose user data. Advocates for digital privacy say this law serves as one of the only federal protections in a country that relies on a haphazard patchwork of statutes to govern online behavior.\n\nCritics say the law is outdated, as it was written decades before social media or smartphones existed and includes ambiguities that tech companies use to slow-walk or reject requests.\n\n“They are looking for reasons not to give information,” said a former commander of a state ICAC taskforce, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Big tech is going to protect their companies first. Their priority it’s not to share information. It’s to protect themselves from any liability.”\n\nOfficials say this resistance is unique to big tech. Law enforcement officials characterized the response of industries like banking as much quicker, a matter of days rather than weeks or months. While entities that refuse could theoretically be held in contempt, tech firms bank on low appetite from law enforcement to take them on, said law enforcement officials.\n\n“You send a grand jury subpoena to them, and they don’t give anything back,” said a lieutenant from ICAC. “Or sometimes they say, ‘We don’t have anything for what you requested, or we can’t find anything based on your request,’ and they won’t tell you why.”\n\nIn May, the Colorado governor, Jared Polis, vetoed a state bill on children’s online safety in the face of heavy lobbying from across industries. He cited the bill’s potential to “erode privacy, freedom and innovation” as the reason for his veto. The bill included a mandate for a 72-hour deadline for social media companies to respond to police requests, and to provide direct hotlines for law enforcement.\n\nTestifying in support of the bill before the state’s Senate judiciary committee in April, Brian Mason, the district attorney for Adams and Broomfield counties, where Max Osterman lived, stated that social media companies “regularly” failed to respond to legal documents they had been served in Colorado. Warrants, he said, often vanish into “a black hole”.\n\n“They’re massive social media companies that don’t seem to care when they get a valid warrant from a jurisdiction like mine in Colorado,” said Mason.\n\nIn child sex trafficking cases, limited access to digital records not only deepens the trauma for victims but also makes it harder to investigate crimes, members of law enforcement said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials note that when cases involve traumatized victims, their cooperation with investigations can be temporary. To avoid the investigation relying solely on the victim’s testimony, law enforcement focuses on building cases through digital evidence.\n\nEven in emergency cases – when police have reasonable grounds to believe someone is in imminent danger and file what they dub an “exigent request”, which is a legal demand meant to trigger immediate compliance – tech companies often pick and choose which requests to honor, according to five members of law enforcement. Investigators say those decisions come at a cost to public safety.\n\nBoston police’s investigation into Charlese Horton began after a 14-year-old boy was kidnapped and assaulted at gunpoint in an alley in the city’s Dorchester neighborhood. Four months later, the same boy was kidnapped again. He reported the attacks to police, and two more boys soon came forward with similar accounts. None of the victims knew each other, but all had been contacted through Facebook accounts tied to four aliases the attacker controlled, according to court documents.\n\nDetectives subpoenaed Meta for data on four accounts. Meta refused to honor the exigency requests for two of the accounts being used, without explanation, said two members of law enforcement. That decision, investigators said, likely allowed additional victims to go undiscovered.\n\n“Meta shouldn’t be the arbiter of what is and isn’t exigent,” said one member of law enforcement dealing with the case. “This was the company making its own judgment about whether we had an exigency case.”\n\nA statement from Meta asserts the company fully cooperated with the Boston police investigation.\n\n“Meta scrutinizes every law enforcement request, as bad actors have been known to use social engineering to access government email accounts so they can request information from tech companies,” a spokesperson said.\n\nIn a statement, Meta asserted that the two accounts it did not provide information on were actually duplicate requests. Law enforcement officers interviewed, however, dispute that characterization.\n\nLaw enforcement has no direct line to communicate with some companies to question decisions or press their case further. For Meta and Snap, requests are routed through a web portal that offers no phone number and no direct access to the employees deciding whether to release evidence, a point of frustration mentioned by almost all members of law enforcement who spoke to the Guardian.\n\n“We make it as easy as possible for law enforcement to submit legal requests via an online portal and provide regular training sessions to the FBI and US local law enforcement on how to send in valid requests,” said a Meta spokesperson. “Our dedicated law enforcement response team in the US is also in ongoing contact with law enforcement to support them on live cases as needed, and our legal teams are regularly in touch with prosecutors and investigators to help with legal issues.”\n\nWhen Michigan teen Jordan DeMay died by suicide after being targeted by Nigerian sextortion scammers on Instagram in 2022, Meta initially declined the Marquette county sheriff’s detectives’ requests, filed as exigent, for the transcripts of DeMay’s direct messages on the platform. This meant his family had to wait 48 hours for crucial details about why he died, and the sextortionists were able to continue to target other victims.\n\n“Possibly it wasn’t considered an emergency because Jordan was already dead,” said John DeMay, Jordan’s father. “It was only when the FBI got involved that the warrant was accepted.”\n\nDeMay, who now has a copy of the transcript of the conversation between Jordan and the sextortionists, said it is obvious from the dialogue how urgent the situation was.\n\n“They wrote to Jordan, ‘I’m gonna watch you die a miserable death.’ And, Jordan replies to say, ‘I’m killing myself.’ And they say, ‘Good, do it now,’” said DeMay. “After reading that transcript and knowing that the sextortionist’s account was still active, and somebody had already died, there’s no reason that Meta should have not given that information. There’s zero reason for that.”\n\nIn its statement, Meta noted that the justice department had publicly praised the company for cooperating with the FBI investigation into Jordan’s sextortionists. The company did not, however, address the early delays in the case, when the investigation was still being handled by local police.\n\nEven when companies do comply with warrants, the information they provide can be of little use. On 19 December 2024, 16-year-old Avery Ping died in Olympia, Washington, of a drug overdose after buying what he thought was ecstasy over Snapchat. The pills turned out to be a lethal mix of fentanyl, amphetamine and methamphetamine.\n\nAvery’s drug dealer had been under law enforcement surveillance since October 2024 in relation to other narcotics cases. Local police sent a warrant for the dealer’s Snapchat account data to Snap Inc on 5 November 2024 and waited 10 days. They did not receive a response from Snap until 25 November, when the company sent a file that law enforcement couldn’t open, said Aaron Ping, Avery’s father.\n\n“The detective told me they needed specific software to open it, and Snap didn’t give instructions on this,” said Ping. Ultimately, law enforcement could not open the file until early December.\n\n“Snap impeded on a big investigation on the dealer before Avery died. This guy was a prolific dealer, and had surveillance on his house, and they just were waiting for the Snapchat records,” said Ping. “The guy should have been in jail. Avery should be alive.”\n\nSnap Inc did not provide a response to these allegations.\n\n“Every day of delay means children remain in danger who could have been rescued, and there’s no legal consequence for dragging their feet,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project. “We need public visibility into how these companies perform. We need mandatory public reporting on response times and compliance rates. Self-regulation has failed – it’s time for lawmakers to act.”",

    "fullText": "From celebrity endorsements to digital fatigue, the once-obsolete white wire has become a fashion statement and a quiet act of opting out\n\nWith white-wired headphones endorsed by celebrities including Lily-Rose Depp, Paul Mescal, Bella Hadid and Apple Martin, a growing number of people are breaking away from wireless listening.\n\nFor inspiration, there is the Instagram account @wireditgirls, or a Balenciaga campaign featuring the model Mona Tougaard reclining bed, wired headphones in place.\n\nDaniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at British Vogue, is familiar with the trend. “[It says] ‘I’m very effortless. I’m very nonchalant,” he says. “It’s become a real styleable accessory.”\n\nBut in a culture where the forward march of technology is often treated as compulsory, wired headphones represent more than aesthetics. “It’s an analogue way of opting out – of both tech but also life,” says Rodgers. “They’re visible in a way that AirPods aren’t. There is a sense of ‘do not disturb’.”\n\nThat symbolism is on full display on the cover of New York magazine’s latest issue, which features celebrities riding the subway: Debbie Harry with the Geese frontman Cameron Winter, Ben Stiller with the Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns and Macaulay Culkin with the SubwayTakes presenter Kareem Rahma. The real story, however, is not the star power but the shared accessory in each image: wired headphones.\n\nThe pictures were taken by Hannah La Follette Ryan, the Brooklyn-based photographer behind the Instagram account @SubwayTakes, which documents New Yorkers on public transport. She says: “I see the revival as an extension of digital fatigue. Who wants another glitchy expensive gadget to charge?”\n\nPrice is clearly part of the appeal of wired headphones – Apple’s EarPods cost £17 compared with £99 for AirPods – but nostalgia is also a factor.\n\n“We’re seeing retro tech come back,” says Tom Morgan-Freelander, the deputy editor of the technology magazine Stuff. “And as part of that, brands are starting to bring back wired headphones.”\n\nHe says some younger consumers are switching to wired for sound quality, which is typically better with cables. “Bluetooth became the norm, and there was an acceptance that, for wireless convenience, you’re going to lose a bit of quality,” he adds.\n\nThen there is the issue of tangles. While wireless headphones are stored neatly in a case, wired varieties are often found in a knot at the bottom of a bag.\n\nLa Follette Ryan suggests this is part of the appeal. “The tangle is inevitable,” she says. “Think of a headphone knot as a more user-friendly Rubik’s Cube. Relish the opportunity to slow down and solve a little puzzle.”\n\nIf wired headphones have become the choice of the fashion-conscious despite these inconveniences, that could change soon. AirPods remain the bestseller at Currys but the retailer reports sales of Beats Solo 4 over-ear headphones have risen by 193% since last year.\n\nMorgan-Freelander also points to the £20 FiiO Snowsky Wind, a design that looks like the earphones worn with a Sony Walkman in the 1980s.\n\nRodgers still believes wired headphones have the edge. “Even though we are constantly being [sold upgrades], there’s a sort of disengagement [with wired headphones], which is always really hot, right?” he says. “You never want to look like you’re too into anything.”\n\nLa Follette Ryan, however, thinks there is room for every option. “I just bought a Discman and Sony headphones,” she says, “but I will always keep my wired headphones for sharing an earbud with a friend.”",

    "description": "Teenagers, Alexandr Wang argues, have a built-in edge.",
    "fullText": "Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk.\n\nAlexandr Wang—who became the world’s youngest self-made billionaire at 24—is now, at 28, running one of the most ambitious AI efforts in Silicon Valley. In his first 60 days at Meta, he built a 100-person lab he described to TBPN hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays as “smaller and more talent dense than any of the other labs.”\n\nHis goal: nothing less than superintelligence.\n\nWang, with his aerial view of the industry, has advice for kids, especially those in Gen Alpha now entering middle school: Forget gaming, sports, or traditional after-school hobbies.\n\n“If you are like 13 years old, you should spend all of your time vibe coding,” he said in his recent TBPN interview. “That’s how you should live your life.”\n\nFor Wang, the reasoning is simple. Every engineer, himself included, is now writing code he believes will be obsolete within five years.\n\n“Literally all the code I’ve written in my life will be replaced by what will be produced by an AI model,” he said.\n\nThat realization has left him, in his words, “radicalized by AI coding.” What matters most now isn’t syntax, or learning a particular language, but time spent experimenting with and steering AI tools.\n\n“It’s actually an incredible moment of discontinuity,” Wang said. “If you just happen to spend 10,000 hours playing with the tools and figuring out how to use them better than other people, that’s a huge advantage.”\n\nTeenagers have a clear advantage over adults: time and freedom to immerse themselves in new technology. And while in the past, entrepreneurial teenagers leveraged this time to be “sneaker flippers” or run Minecraft servers, Wang says the focus should now be on the code.\n\nHe compares the moment to the dawn of the PC revolution. The Bill Gateses and Mark Zuckerbergs of the world had an “immense advantage” simply because they grew up tinkering with the earliest machines.\n\n“That moment is happening right now,” Wang said. “And the people who spend the most time with it will have the edge in the future economy.”\n\nWang isn’t coy about Meta’s ambitions. He calls the company’s infrastructure, scale, and product distribution unmatched.\n\n“We have the business model to support building literally hundreds of billions of dollars of compute,” he said.\n\nHis team, just over 100 people, is deliberately designed to be “smaller and more talent dense” than rivals. “The other labs are like 10 times bigger,” Wang said, but their lab had “cracked” coders.\n\nThe lab is split into three pillars: research, product, and infrastructure. Research builds the models Wang says will “ultimately be superintelligent.” Product ensures they get distributed across billions of users through Meta’s platforms. And infrastructure focuses on what he calls “literally the largest data centers in the world.”\n\nWang is particularly excited about hardware. Like many Meta executives now, he points to the company’s new smart glasses, which had a hilariously foppish demo, as the “natural delivery mechanism for superintelligence.”\n\nPlaced right next to the human senses, they will merge digital perception with cognition.\n\n“It will literally feel like cognitive enhancement,” Wang said. “You will gain 100 IQ points by having your superintelligence right next to you.”\n\nVibe coding is the shorthand for this shift: using natural language prompts to generate and iterate on code. Rather than writing complex syntax, users describe their intent, and AI produces functioning prototypes.\n\nThe concept is spreading across Silicon Valley’s C-suites. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has said he can now test ideas in 20 minutes, instead of burning weeks of engineering cycles. Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed that AI already generates more than 30% of new code at the company, calling it the biggest leap in software creation in 25 years.\n\nWang takes that further. For him, vibe coding isn’t just a productivity hack, but a future cultural mandate. What matters isn’t the code itself — it’s the hours of intuition-building that come from pushing AI tools to their limits, which is why he urges Gen Alpha to start early.\n\n“The role of an engineer is just very different now than it was before,” he said.\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on September 19, 2025.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Lawsuit is the first UK case of its kind, with Ros and Mark Dowey accusing Meta of ‘putting profit before our young people’\n\nThe parents of a 16-year-old who took his own life after he fell victim to a sextortion gang on Instagram are suing Meta for the alleged wrongful death of their son, in the first UK case of its kind.\n\nMurray Dowey died in December 2023 at his family home in Dunblane, after being tricked into sending intimate pictures to an Instagram contact. He thought it was a girl his own age, but it turned out to be overseas criminals involved in financially motivated sexual extortion.\n\nSpeaking as the lawsuit was filed in Delaware, where Meta Platforms is incorporated, Murray’s parents Ros and Mark said: “We know what we’re up against. But it’s time social media companies took accountability for what they’ve done to our young people.\n\n“It’s not just sextortion, they’re causing multiple harms, and they’ve been allowed to get away with it.”\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Delaware superior court by the US-based Social Media Victims Law Center on behalf of the Doweys, as well as the family of Levi Maciejewski, a 13-year-old from Pennsylvania who was also a victim of sextortion.\n\nIt states that the boys’ deaths were “the foreseeable result of Meta’s design decisions and repeated refusals to implement affordable, available and identified safety features due to Meta’s prioritisation of engagement over user safety”.\n\nAccording to the complaint, these design flaws include “collection of personal data without informed consent”, and use of that data to program recommendation products “it knew [were] operating in a manner that recommended teen Instagram users to sextortionists who Meta itself already had identified as predators”.\n\nThe suit alleges Meta’s “failure to safeguard user privacy, including through its continued sharing of Follower and Following data … even after Meta knew that this engagement-focused product feature was resulting in sextortion-related deaths of teen users across the world”.\n\nIt also contends that Meta made “false and misleading statements designed to convince children and parents that Instagram was safe for teens at the same time that internal testing showed that Instagram was matchmaking children to adult predators”.\n\nWhile four British parents are suing TikTok for the alleged wrongful deaths of their children as a result of attempting the viral “blackout challenge” in 2021, this is the first UK case to centre on the crime of sextortion.\n\nCases have risen sharply in recent years across the UK, US and Australia, with teenage boys and young men typically the victims of loosely organised cybercriminal gangs often based in south-east Asia and west Africa.\n\nEarlier this year, the Guardian reported that children as young as 11 to 13 were being targeted for the first time, as criminals behind extortion attempts cast their nets wider in an attempt to trap victims.\n\nThe Doweys’ lawyer, Matthew Bergman, who set up the Social Media Victims Law Center in 2021, said Meta was involved in all the US-based sextortion cases that he had filed to date.\n\n“There are reasons for that. It is a product defect issue and Meta knows it. This complaint cites Meta records only recently made known to the public through [previous joint civil proceedings] and those documents make the deliberateness of these design defects, lack of safeguards, and failures to warn clear,” he said.\n\nReflecting on the two years since his son’s passing, Mark Dowey said: “Nothing’s really changed since Murray died. These predators can still get at our children.”\n\nAs well as their battle to hold Meta to account, Ros and Mark have regularly spoken out about the dangers of sextortion in the hope of raising awareness among parents and young people.\n\nRos said: “As a parent who has first-hand experience of how devastating the flaws can be, you have a duty to warn other parents. You think your kids are safe looking at pictures on Instagram and they’re not.”\n\nMark said that the lawsuit was “a way to get a wee bit of justice for Murray”: “There has to be accountability here because those statements are absolutely damning. [Meta] have known that their products are killing children by their unsafe design and they haven’t done anything about it. They chose to put profit before our young people.”\n\nInstagram, which has previously condemned sextortion as a “horrific” crime, rolled out new safety features – which included preventing screenshots or screen recordings of disappearing images and videos – specifically to protect children from scammers in October 2024.\n\nMeta announced last October that accounts it detects as showing signals of suspicious behaviour would not be able to see people’s follower or following lists, removing their ability to exploit this feature, and would be blocked from being able to request to follow teens.\n\nIn June alone, accounts were blocked one million times. This July, it introduced new block and report features for direct messages.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta said: “Sextortion is a horrific crime. We support law enforcement to prosecute the criminals behind it and we continue to fight them on our apps on multiple fronts.\n\n“Since 2021, we’ve placed teens under 16 into private accounts when they \n\n“We work to prevent accounts showing suspicious behaviour from following teens and avoid recommending teens to them.\n\n“We also take other precautionary steps, like blurring potentially sensitive images sent in DMs and reminding teens of the risks of sharing them, and letting people know when they’re chatting to someone who may be in a different country.”",

    "fullText": "Creators and publishers have long worried about Meta's ability to throttle links to outside content. Now, the company is testing out a new scheme that effectively puts link-sharing behind a paywall for creators on Facebook.\n\nUnder the test, a Meta Verified subscription will determine how many links a creator can share another profile per month. According to a screenshot shared by social meda consultant Matt Navarra, creators in the test recently received a notification from Meta informing them that \"certain Facebook profiles without Meta Verified, including yours, will be limited to sharing links in 2 organic posts per month.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Meta confirmed the test to Engadget. The test is currently affecting an unspecified number of creators and pages using \"professional mode\" on Facebook. Publishers aren't affected for now. \"This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nWhile Meta seems to be trying to downplay the significance of the test, it's a notable shift for the company. Many creators and businesses rely on Facebook and reducing their ability to send traffic to outside websites could be a significant hit. Many creators are already frustrated that the company puts its better customer service features behind the Meta Verified subscription, which starts at $14.99/month. Making link-sharing a premium feature as well would be even more unpopular.\n\nHave a tip for Karissa?

    "fullText": "As winter temps drop, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski is sharing some cold, hard facts.\n\nThe 57-year-old fast-food executive recently shared his top career tip in a viral Instagram video, warning that it might \"hurt your feelings.\"\n\n\"Remember, nobody cares about your career as much as you do,\" Kempczinski said.\n\n\"This idea that there's somebody out there who's looking out for you, who's going to make sure that you get that opportunity, who puts you in the right thing — great if it happens,\" he said. \"You've got to make things happen for yourself.\"\n\nA post shared by Chris Kempczinski (@chrisk_mcd)\n\nKempczinski is, of course, not the first corporate leader to make this observation.\n\nSeveral, including Business Insider founder Henry Blodget, have for years recommended that workers \"be the CEO of your career.\"\n\n\"When people enter the workforce, they often imagine that their job and career success and satisfaction is someone else's responsibility,\" Blodget wrote in 2023.\n\nBlodget said that some school and early-career situations involve predictable requirements and progressions, often with a mentor whose job it is to help you succeed. However, that model often stops working sooner or later, leaving the individual solely responsible for their own direction.\n\nKempczinski's comments also come amid a broader shift away from loyalty between employees and employers, a shift that was probably best summarized earlier this year in a memo from AT&T CEO John Stankey.\n\n\"I understand that some of you may have started your tour with this company expecting an 'employment deal' rooted in loyalty, tenure, and conformance with the associated compensation, work structure, and benefits,\" Stankey said. \"We have consciously shifted away from some of these elements and towards a more market-based culture — focused on rewarding capability, contribution, and commitment.\"\n\nIn an earlier video, Kempczinski shared a key tip to help workers get control over their time, energy, and attention: \"Be organized.\"\n\nKempczinski said he keeps a tidy email inbox, computer, and workspace.\n\n\"Staying organized is a way to make me stay focused,\" he said.\n\nTaken together, it's safe to say that you should keep track of what you need to do for your own life and career because nobody else is going to do it for you.",

    "fullText": "If you miss the days of gathering around the TV surfing channels, you're in luck.\n\nInstagram launched Instagram for TV on Tuesday, bringing its popular Reels content to the big screen via Amazon Fire TV devices.\n\nThe app, which is first being rolled out in the US, groups Reels into channels, including trending comedy, sports, or hidden travel gems. Users can choose a channel and start watching, with the Reels playing automatically.\n\nInstagram for TV is part of the platform's ongoing effort to adapt to the ways users are connecting via the app. The company said in a press release that it has heard from its community that \"watching Reels together is more fun,\" so the product was designed with that social aspect in mind.\n\nTessa Lyons, VP of product at Instagram, told Business Insider that the team heard from users who were finding ways to cast their Reels to the TV so they could watch them with friends.\n\n\"People already want to get together and connect with each other over Reels on the TV,\" she said, adding that this allows them to actually share with friends. \"Not just DMing them, but actually be together enjoying them.\"\n\nLyons said she personally felt the need for this feature when she realized, while on the couch watching TV with her husband, she was often actually watching Reels on her phone instead.\n\nInstagram for TV is in a testing phase, with plans to eventually expand to more devices and countries. Instagram said this early test is designed to learn which features are best for shared viewing on a TV screen.\n\nFuture features could include using your phone as a remote, more intuitive ways to surf channels, and channels that combine your and your friends' interests into one shared feed, like Instagram's Blend feature.\n\nUp to five Instagram accounts can be connected to the Amazon Fire TV device. Once you click into your account, Instagram will automatically group Reels into a channel based on your interests.\n\nLyons said Instagram's North Star has always been \"helping people connect with their friends over creativity,\" adding that the goal has remained even as the platform and the way people use it have changed.\n\n\"The way in which people share evolves,\" she said. \"I think that's natural.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Meta is testing an Instagram TV app, starting with Amazon devices.",
    "fullText": "As I write this, I'm coming off a lunch break that lasted a little too long because I couldn't stop watching YouTube Shorts on my TV. And if Instagram Reels are your own vertical video poison—and you own an Amazon Fire TV device—you can now do the same. Starting today, you can download the new Instagram for TV app to watch Reels on your big screen via a dedicated interface that should be way more natural than simply casting the mobile app from your phone.\n\nCurrently exclusive to Amazon devices, the Instagram for TV app supports up to five accounts and comes with full functionality for searching for Reels and profiles, as well as liking Reels and browsing comments or reactions (although text posts and photo posts are not included). Unlike on the standard mobile feed, Amazon says \"Reels are organized into channels tuned to your interests,\" which you can see from a horizontal home screen.\n\nThese channels are somewhat similar to the YouTube Shorts interface that's baked into the standard YouTube TV app, showing you a small selection of shorts you can choose from based on a thumbnail. Examples include \"For you\" and \"Popular with Friends,\" but you're also still able to swipe past any Reel to your heart's content, and let the algorithm take you for a ride. A post from Meta also says channels could include Reels tailored to a specific topics that match your interests, like \"sports highlights\" or \"hidden travel gems,\" although the company hasn't provided any screenshots or videos showing this off quite yet.\n\nAccording to Meta, the new app is currently \"an early test.\" It's starting with U.S.-based Amazon devices, and the company says it will \"expand to more devices and countries\" as it learns more (Amazon also says it's the \"first\" company to get the app, implying others will get their own versions in the future).\n\nCurrently, the Instagram for TV app is available in the Amazon Appstore for the following devices:\n\nFire TV Stick 4K Max (1st and 2nd Gen)\n\nIn addition to adding channels to the Reels experience, Meta says that future updates may also add ways to use your phone as a remote, share feeds with friends, and explore \"a more intuitive way to channel surf.\"\n\nInstagram for TV leaves TikTok as the last major short form video platform without a dedicated TV app, although The Information reported earlier this Summer that TikTok is looking to catch up soon.\n\nWhile official Instagram for TV support is currently limited to Amazon devices, that doesn't mean you're out of luck if you don't have a Fire TV stick or display. To watch Instagram Reels on your TV without using the Instagram for TV app, open Instagram Reels on your phone and start browsing. Next, pull up your phone's quick settings menu by swiping down from the top-right corner.\n\nOn iOS, search for the screen mirroring button (which looks like two overlapping screens), and on Android, search for a button that says something like \"Cast\" (it will vary depending on your device). Tap it to see any compatible wireless screen mirroring devices nearby, which will let you view the mobile Instagram app on a TV screen, and even send audio over with it. It's not foolproof—my LG OLED TV works with iOS Screen Mirroring but not Pixel casting—but it's worth a shot.",

    "description": "Companies like AT&T, Amazon, JPMorgan, and Instagram have a RTO problem: there's not enough places for workers to sit.",
    "fullText": "Your mileage may vary on Instagram's recent corporate culture updates (to the extent you care at all). Fewer meetings: excellent. Faster decisions: great. Return-to-office five days a week: woof, but such is life. Return-to-office five days a week when there aren't enough places for people to sit: What??? At least Instagram chief Adam Mosseri is aware of the issue — in a memo to staff, he said New York employees get a pass on the butts-in-seats mandate until the company figures out where all those butts will go. The timeline is TBD.\n\nAfter the pandemic-driven wave of remote work, many employees are being dragged, kicking and screaming, back into the office. For workers at companies such as Amazon, JPMorgan, and Starbucks, the perpetual workday-in-your-pajamas party is over. The odd wrinkle is that in some cases, it's not just employees who aren't ready to be back at work every day. Their employers aren't ready for it, either, at least logistically. They're telling people to come to the office without having the actual space for them to be there. So, workers are competing for desks, setting up shop in common areas, or refusing to show up altogether until their employers have a more well-thought-out plan. It's emblematic of the broader issues surrounding RTO mandates: Many companies are implementing them without a solid logic as to how or why and alienating their employees — intentionally or not — in the process.\n\nMultiple big-name companies have had some small-time whoopsie daisies on back-to-office space constraints.\n\nIn late 2024, AT&T acknowledged in a memo to employees that they would not offer \"one-for-one seating per employee\" as they were called back in. At the time, employees told Business Insider that workers were filling up hallways or hanging out in the cafeteria in order to check the attendance box. Around the same time, Amazon wound up delaying its RTO ask for some employees because their spots weren't ready. Not only were there not enough desks, but workers also complained that offices and meeting rooms were lacking in chairs.\n\nEarlier this year, JPMorgan employees required to come back found themselves in a sort of Hunger Games situation for spots, showing up extra early and leaving behind possessions to mark their spots and signing on from vacation to try to book scarce desk space. On Reddit, some employees described the situation as \"pure chaos,\" and complained of being unable to accomplish work because \"half the morning is spent on desk f***ery.\" One JPMorgan employee told me that they often find themselves seated far away from the rest of their team because someone else reserved their regular spot, and there are often lines for the women's bathroom at the New York office where they work.\n\nHow much office space is needed and what to do with it is a perpetual conundrum. Just look at all the hate for open-office floor plans. But the pandemic added more complications to an already complicated situation. As the RTO wave has picked up momentum, space has become a significant issue at many companies, both large and small, including giant federal agencies. So what gives?\n\nSome of it is simply a result of poor planning, explains Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work. Decisions are made at the executive level without proper consultation with facilities personnel, who have detailed information on desks and seating. \"It's not as easy as adding up people and comparing to desks, as it matters which cities and offices they are in,\" he says in an email. \"Kind of like airlines that some flights may be overbooked and others half-empty.\"\n\nSome of the shortages may be on purpose. Strict RTO mandates are often viewed, at least in part, as a soft layoff — companies expect some level of attrition when they force people back, even if they won't openly admit it. \"Having insufficient seating is all part of the plan,\" Bloom says. \"If you want a 10% head count reduction, you only need seating for 90% of the folks.\"\n\nBrian Elliott, the CEO of Work Forward, a future of work think tank and consultancy, says that when executives started to think about bringing people back to the office in about 2021, many were surprised to learn how low the percentage of their workforce actually showing up on a given day had been pre-2020, because of sick time, vacations, workers visiting customers, etc. \"So your average CFO looks at this and goes, 'It's a 60% utilized asset on average. Why am I doing assigned seating? Why not go to hoteling and hot desking?'\" Elliott says. Add in the belief that at least some sort of remote work would stick around (especially as companies offered it as a perk to attract workers in a tight labor market), and many companies decided to downsize their overall office footprint to save some cash. Now, as businesses decide they want everyone back in full-time, they're realizing they axed too many desks.\n\nSome companies are moving in the other direction, and are on the hunt for more spacious offices. But that process takes time, and economic uncertainty has leaders nervous to go too big. Commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE says economic jitters, high interest rates, and slow growth in in-person jobs has been somewhat of a drag on office leasing activity this year, but the overall trend is up: A growing majority of its office occupants expect to maintain or expand their space over the next three years, while the share anticipating downsizing is steadily decreasing.\n\n\"Companies are taking more spaces, so clearly, they are very comfortable in expansionary mode,\" says Henry Chin, global head of research at CBRE.\n\nThat doesn't mean employees should expect to be drowning in spacious offices anytime soon — businesses are driving toward higher people-to-desk ratios, not lower. So instead of a single assigned desk for every person, there are multiple people sharing. Per CBRE, the most common ratio today is 1-1.49 employees per seat, and the plan is to up it. \"Ultimately, they want to have the higher ratio, that two or three people share a desk,\" Chin says.\n\nIn other words, however you feel about hotel desking, you might want to get used to it.\n\nThe RTO battle in America is proving to be quite the push-and-pull. Remote work is falling, but it hasn't gone away: According to Bloom's tracker, about 25% of work is being done from home in the US, compared to 62% in the spring of 2020, the height of the pandemic, and well under 10% prior to the lockdowns. And just because companies ask workers to come back doesn't mean they're all complying — there's a delta between what employers are asking, and employees are giving, RTO-wise. As the job market weakens, employees may be inclined to give in and commute more. You want your boss to see you enough that they at least feel a little guilty when they fire you.\n\nThese space-related headaches are reflective of broader questions about where and how it's best for people to work, and what sort of planning needs to be put into it. Some executives seem to be knee-jerk demanding people come back in without considering whether that's how their teams work best, or whether the infrastructure can handle it. A five-day-a-week office mandate isn't super helpful if teams are located all over the country and everyone's just sitting on video calls all day. Some companies are discovering they need more small meeting rooms, not just a few large ones, so people can gather if they are in the same place. And some are falling short on basic blocking and tackling — having working WiFi, or supplying sufficient monitors and equipment. In the internet age, it's a little tough to get work done when you don't have the internet itself, or a keyboard or a mouse.\n\nEmployers may be \"conflating productivity and effectiveness with proximity\" in insisting people show up full-time, explains Melissa Daimler, a corporate culture consultant. \"If I can see you and I know that you're working, then I feel good about how productive we are as a company.\" Much of the issue comes down to trust — businesses feeling confident that their people will get the work done when they're in the office collaborating and when they're at home for the day. \"It takes an extra kind of set of planning skills and a system that you put in place as a company and a team,\" she says.\n\nThe space problem is one that companies should fix, whether they actually will is another question. Your employees aren't going to love the return of long commutes and sad salad desk lunches, whatever you do, but they're probably going to be even more annoyed if, at the end of that commute, they find themselves eating that sad salad on the floor in the hallway, seated next to their laptop.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "Adtech company Fluency uses automation, and now AI agents, to run digital ad campaigns across the web, Meta, Google, TikTok, and more.",
    "fullText": "Adtech company Fluency has built a platform that helps brands and agencies automate their campaigns across Meta, TikTok, Google, and other platforms. Now, it aims to introduce AI agents to the mix.\n\nLarge brands and agencies typically manage campaigns across multiple platforms and ad buying tools, known as demand-side platforms, each with separate logins and interfaces.\n\nFounded in 2017 in Burlington, Vermont, Fluency created what it describes as a digital advertising operating system. It connects to the various platforms' application programming interfaces (APIs) and lets its customers manage their digital ads using a single workflow.\n\n\"It takes a lot of people, and hours, and button clicking to be able to effectively execute your advertising,\" Fluency CEO Mike Lane said in an interview with Business Insider.\n\nHe added that Fluency wanted to \"help simplify and streamline that, much like HubSpot or Salesforce\" did in the customer relationship management (CRM) space. Fluency's competitor set includes other campaign management and ad automation tools, such as Hootsuite, Smartly, and Sprinklr, though these companies tend to cater to larger advertisers and agencies.\n\nThe company said it manages around $3 billion in annual ad spend for brands and agencies, including Cox Automotive, Innocean, and The Johnson Group.\n\nFluency is set to announce on Tuesday that it has raised a $40 million Series A investment round, led and fully funded by Integrity Growth Partners.\n\nFluency said it plans to invest the funds in enhancing its agentic AI capabilities, which can autonomously oversee marketers' digital ad campaigns. This could mean AI agents automatically swapping out ad creatives or copy with better-performing versions, for example.\n\nFluency mostly uses Amazon's Bedrock generative AI models, as well as Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini, the company said.\n\nLane said that for agentic AI to work effectively for a marketer's digital advertising, the AI needs robust frameworks and structures to operate within, connections to all major media platforms, and for everything to be integrated into a single system.\n\nHe said these factors make Fluency well-positioned to be \"the premium platform for agentic\" AI in the digital ads space.\n\nCheck out the pitch deck Fluency used to secure its $40 million Series A investment, shared exclusively with Business Insider. Some of the slides have been omitted or redacted.\n\nFluency says marketers often use \"point solutions\" that don't interact with each other, which can also bring in issues around compliance and performance.\n\nFluency says ad strategists often have to cobble together several different tech solutions to handle tasks like targeting or reviewing campaign performance.\n\nFluency's platform aims to address these concerns as a kind of \"one-stop shop\" across various channels.\n\nThose attributes include a blue-chip client base and high customer-retention rates.\n\nThere's been a shift in budgets from big agency holding companies to independent agencies, though smaller firms have constrained resources, Fluency says.\n\nFluency says its \"serviceable addressable market\" is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11%, reaching $6.4 billion by 2028.\n\nFluency says its platform serves agencies and brands better than agency-developed tech, in-house channel management, legacy omni-channel tools, and point solutions.\n\nThe slide showcases how the Fluency platform integrates a marketer's own data, big media platforms, and DSPs using AI automation to manage campaigns and assess their performance.\n\nFluency says its tools can save customers time, improve ad performance, and boost their revenue.",

    "description": "Meta has given employees access to Google Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-5 alongside its own AI tools to help boost productivity.",
    "fullText": "In its push to create an \"AI-first\" workplace, Meta is expanding employees' access to tools from rivals such as Google and OpenAI, Business Insider has learned.\n\nThe social media giant has been encouraging employees to integrate AI tools into nearly everything they do, according to multiple internal documents and posts seen by Business Insider.\n\nOne of the company's priorities is to \"make AI core to how we work,\" Meta's chief information officer, Atish Banerjea, told employees in a June memo outlining a plan to use Meta's own models — which use the naming convention \"Llama\" — alongside products from other firms.\n\nIn November, a Meta engineer said in an internal post that all employees have access to Google's Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI's ChatGPT-5. The post included a list of AI tools Meta employees have access to, including their use cases. Business Insider has recreated the list below.\n\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed the revamped suite of AI tools and pointed to an earlier comment shared with Business Insider about AI adoption, stating: \"It's well-known that this is a priority, and we're focused on using AI to help employees with their day-to-day work.\"\n\nThe social media giant opened the floodgates to rival AI models in June.\n\nAmong those is an internal coding tool called Devmate that uses Anthropic's Claude, Business Insider previously reported. Google's Gemini and NotebookLM Pro are also available across the company to help employees \"work smarter and have more impact,\" Banerjea told employees in the June memo.\n\nMeta has invested tens of billions into its own consumer-facing AI models, and employees have access to an internal AI assistant called Metamate, which is built on its Llama models.\n\nAfter Meta struck a deal over the summer the startup Midjourney to weave its AI-image generator into its products and models, the company made the tool available to employees in October for \"concept and production uses\" to speed up design work and creative prototyping, according to an internal post ahead of the rollout, seen by Business Insider.\n\nGemini isn't the only Google tool Meta is embracing. The company migrated its internal productivity suite over the summer to Google Workspace — including Chat, Gmail, Docs, and Drive — describing the move in a June memo as a way to \"unlock AI-driven capabilities\" and better integrate with its expanding toolset.\n\nOn the engineering side, Meta has expanded access to agentic coding systems, adding Google's Gemini 3 Pro and exploring new integrations with tools like OpenAI's Codex CLI and Google's Gemini CLI. \"Rather than focusing on specific solutions, our strategy centers on outcomes: increasing productivity, accelerating development, and ensuring you have access to the best agentic coding experiences,\" Reality Labs executive Maher Saba told employees in a November memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nTo encourage adoption and experimentation, Meta has gamified the use of AI, Business Insider previously reported. Earlier this year, it launched an internal game called \"Level Up,\" which rewards employees with badges for using AI in different ways. Leaders are also tying performance to results achieved through AI, rewarding those who can prove \"AI-driven impact\" this year, and including it as part of performance reviews in 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the NCAA Division I Administrative Committee passed dates for the one-time-only college football transfer portal back earlier in October. As it stands, the 2025-26 college football transfer portal will last 15 days. It’ll span Jan. 2 to Jan. 16, the NCAA announced.\n\nMoving forward, the entire Division I football notification of transfer windows is slated for Jan 2-16. As has been the previous standard, athletes on College Football Playoff teams still playing would have 5 days beginning the day after their team’s final game to enter the transfer portal.\n\nAdditionally, players have 15 days to enter the portal, but they’re not under a deadline to commit when they enter. Traditionally, the deadline for committing is how late a school can enroll a player through admissions.\n\nOne caveat is that if a head coach is fired, the transfer portal will not open for players immediately. The NCAA revealed that moving forward, players will only have 15 days to enter the portal after a coaching change, instead of the former allocation of 30 days. Players will also have to wait five days after a new coach is hired or announced.\n\nFinally, graduate transfers also cannot enter the transfer portal until Jan. 2 with the new one-time-only portal window. All these new guidelines are bound to shake things up, but the transfer portal will still remain as interesting and entertaining as ever.",

    "description": "US Tech Force employees will have recruitment opportunities with a host of private companies ranging from Meta and Google to Apple and Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "Young tech talent hoping to land a job in the private sector has a new way in: the public sector.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration announced the launch of the United States Tech Force on Monday, a two-year program that offers participants federal government jobs and eventual recruitment opportunities for private sector roles.\n\nThe government is partnering with at least 28 tech companies on the program, including Apple, Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Dell, Box, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, Palantir, Oracle, Uber, and xAI, among others.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management is spearheading the early-career program in partnership with other agencies. Participants will be placed at agencies across the government to work on modernization projects and, in part, implement AI, according to the Tech Force website.\n\nTech Force plans to hire around 1,000 applicants to start, according to the site, and is looking for people \"highly skilled in the areas of software engineering, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data analytics, or technical project management.\"\n\nApplicants will submit an application, complete a technical assessment, have interviews with agency leaders, and undergo a background test. OPM will do the initial resume review and technical assessment before passing the hiring decisions off to individual agencies, OPM Director Scott Kupor said during a call before the announcement.\n\nPrivate sector partners can provide training resources and mentorship opportunities, and have committed to considering Tech Force participants for employment after the two years, according to the site. Kupor said on Monday's call that there will also be a speaker series featuring company CEOs. The program, he added, will end with public- and private-sector job fairs.\n\nCompanies haven't made any firm hiring commitments, Kupor said on the call.\n\n\"It wouldn't be appropriate for us to ask companies to hire people without knowing who those people are,\" Kupor said. He added that he'll \"be certainly disappointed\" if the program doesn't lead to hiring by the private-sector partners.\n\nSalaries will likely range from around $130,000 to $195,000, Kupor said. There are no specific degree or experience requirements for the positions, which will be posted on USA Jobs. Those interested are encouraged \"to apply as soon as possible\" on the site. Kupor said he hopes to get everybody hired by the end of March.\n\nThe roles are largely based in Washington, DC, and remote work options will depend on the agency and role, according to the site. They're non-partisan positions and are entirely distinct from the US DOGE Service.\n\nThough the Tech Force is primarily an early-career program, the government is also seeking \"experienced engineering managers from private sector partners,\" the site says. Companies can nominate employees, who will generally be expected to take unpaid leave or otherwise separate from their role to take the two-year position, per the site.\n\n\"They will become full-time employees of the government for the time they're here, and therefore be subject to all the various ethics rules,\" Kupor said. He added that each company will have its own policy, but expects that it will be \"easy\" for participants to return to their private-sector positions.\n\nKupor said on the call that the government plans to run the program on an annual basis and that he hopes to expand it in the years to come.\n\nAre you interested in applying to the Tech Force program?

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Several dozen people protested on Sunday in the Siberian city of Tomsk against Russia's ban on U.S. children's gaming platform Roblox, ​a rare show of public dissent as popular irritation over the ban gains ‌some momentum.\n\nIn wartime Russia, censorship is extensive: Moscow blocks or restricts social media platforms such as Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp ‌and YouTube while distributing its own narrative through a network of social media and Russian media.\n\nRussia's communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said on December 3 it had blocked Roblox because it was \"rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children\".\n\nIn Tomsk, 2,900 km (1,800 miles) east ⁠of Moscow, several dozen people braved ‌the snow to hold up hand-drawn placards reading \"Hands off Roblox\" and \"Roblox is the victim of the digital Iron Curtain\" in Vladimir Vysotsky Park, according ‍to photographs provided by an organiser of the protest.\n\n\"Bans and blocks are all you are able to do,\" read one placard. The photographs showed about 25 people standing in a circle in the snow, holding up ​placards.\n\nIn Russia, the ban on Roblox has triggered a debate over censorship, child safety in ‌relation to technology and even the effectiveness of censorship in a digitalised world where children can bypass many bans in a few clicks.\n\nMany Russians simply circumvent bans by using VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), though some young Russians have questioned the logic of a ban if it can be so easily bypassed while others have questioned why there are so few Russian alternatives to the ⁠apps which the state has banned.\n\nSome Russian parents and ​teachers have said they were concerned Roblox allowed children ​to access sexual content and communicate with adults.\n\nRoblox, headquartered in San Mateo, California, has been banned by several countries including Iraq and Turkey over concerns about ‍predators exploiting the platform ⁠to abuse children.\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When the Russian ban was introduced, Roblox said it has \"a deep commitment to safety\" and provides \"rigorous ⁠built-in protections to help keep users safe\".\n\nRussian officials say they need censorship to defend against a sophisticated \"information war\" unleashed ‌by Western powers, and what they cast as decadent Western culture which undermines \"traditional\" ‌Russian values.",

    "title": "Inside Meta's 'year of intensity' as its AI overhaul, culture wars, and crackdowns collide",
    "description": "Meta's AI overhaul, culture shifts, layoffs, and performance crackdowns have sparked internal clashes, employee exits, and morale concerns in 2025.",
    "fullText": "When CEO Mark Zuckerberg warned Meta employees in January to \"buckle up\" for an \"intense\" year, he meant it.\n\nDetermined to dominate the next era of AI, Meta has spent the past year in blitz mode. Zuckerberg has overhauled divisions, reallocated resources to new products, and poured billions into the AI arms race with OpenAI, Google, and others. Zuckerberg's push came with a marked shift in leadership tone as well, including his public celebration of what he described as more \"masculine energy.\"\n\nAlong the way, the company has trimmed its metaverse ambitions, raised performance expectations, and cut thousands of jobs, all while chasing Zuckerberg's grand vision of \"personal superintelligence.\"\n\nIn some ways, the moves have boosted efficiency and led to faster innovation. In others, some divisions have been roiled by internal tensions, including clashes resulting from AI reorganizations and Zuckerberg flaming the AI talent wars, according to current and former employees. Some also said Meta's layoffs earlier this year were unnecessarily demoralizing when Zuckerberg branded the affected employees as \"low performers.\"\n\nThe company's transformation comes at a time when Big Tech is rewriting its playbook, cutting costs, toughening its tone with employees, and making massive bets that AI will determine who leads in the next decade.\n\nMeta is wagering that moving harder and faster will help give the company an edge over its rivals. After months of a cultural reset in early 2025, employee sentiment improved in recent months, a Meta spokesperson said, citing a recent internal employee sentiment questionnaire.\n\nInvestors are worried about the company's strategy, particularly its plan to sink tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and talent. The question is whether Meta is overdoing it. Shares have risen 7.5% this year, less than half that of the S&P 500, and have underperformed most of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies.\n\n\"The company must articulate its vision, show how its pieces fit together, and, most importantly, demonstrate steady growth,\" said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester, who covers Meta.\n\nThis account of Meta's \"year of intensity\" is based on interviews conducted by Business Insider with more than a dozen current and former employees, analysts, and academic researchers.\n\nOver the summer, Zuckerberg sought to change the perception that Meta was trailing behind its AI rivals. In June, the company made a $14 billion investment in AI training company Scale AI and hired its 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, as chief AI officer. Two months later, it rebranded its team focused on AI efforts to Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL).\n\nAs Meta's leadership sought to reorganize teams and recruit top talent from competitors, some ex-employees went public with the view that the company lacked a coherent AI strategy.\n\nJoena Zhang, a former Meta Superintelligence Labs employee, said in a November LinkedIn post that \"nobody really knew what anyone was doing\" during the first half of the year at MSL — then called GenAI. She said there were \"endless\" meetings that didn't result in \"actual decisions.\" And in a July Substack post, former Meta researcher Tijmen Blankevoort wrote that Meta had \"a wavering vision that was tough for team members to enthusiastically rally behind.\"\n\nMeta began offering massive compensation packages to attract top AI talent from rival labs, including OpenAI and Google's AI division, DeepMind.\n\nThis created rifts between the \"old guard\" and newer hires by offering outsiders significantly more compensation than existing employees got. It fueled a quiet competition to prove whose ideas for AI features were more valuable, according to two MSL employees.\n\nThe tensions also revolved around access to computing resources and the prestige of being associated with the elite team at the center of MSL, as one researcher previously told Business Insider.\n\nIn August, Meta undertook its fourth major reorganization in six months to streamline its AI efforts, dividing MSL into four teams: a new TBD Lab (short for \"to be determined\"), a product team overseeing the Meta AI assistant, an infrastructure team, and the company's long-standing Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab.\n\nAfter the shake-up, it was unclear who owned which projects, and people were reassigned between teams, according to the two MSL employees, one of whom added that the flow of information between TBD and MSL wasn't always even.\n\nAsked about the internal shake-up, a Meta spokesperson pointed Business Insider to an X post from Andy Stone, a Meta communications executive, describing previous reporting about the company's AI restructuring as \"navelgazing.\"\n\nAt least eight of Meta's AI staffers, including researchers, engineers, and a senior product leader, left the company within two months of MSL's formation. Meta said most had been with the company for years, and that some attrition is normal for an organization of its size.\n\nTwo months after the August shuffle, Meta cut about 600 jobs as part of a wider reorganization of the MSL division. Wang told employees that the cuts were designed to speed up decision-making.\n\nShay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities, told Business Insider that the changes have helped Meta move faster in model releases and in integrating its AI across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\n\"Meta is now one of the only companies training frontier-class models and deploying them to billions of users, which is exactly where I want it to be,\" he said.\n\nMeta also shook up its leadership ranks in Reality Labs, the division responsible for developing its virtual and mixed reality products.\n\nThe company is considering budget cuts for the metaverse unit that sits within Reality Labs, which could result in job cuts, a person familiar with the matter previously told Business Insider. A Meta spokesperson said that it is reallocating some of its investment \"from Metaverse toward AI glasses and wearables\" to match momentum, adding that the company \"wasn't planning any broader changes than that.\"\n\nThe MSL layoffs were part of a broader effort by Meta to tighten operational efficiency this year, as the company reduced layers of management and implemented a stricter performance review process than in previous years.\n\nZuckerberg told employees in January he had \"decided to raise the bar on performance management\" and would move quickly to cut about 5% of \"low performers.\" The company cut about 3,600 jobs in February from its workforce of about 78,450 employees.\n\nMultiple employees said the revised system created a pressure-cooker environment and encouraged more cutthroat competition between staff. Managers and employees described a shift toward short-term projects as teams looked to protect themselves from landing at the bottom of the ranking.\n\nThe requirement to place more staff in lower performance tiers saw some managers strategically leave positions open or hire employees solely to place them in the bottom tier, two managers said.\n\nThe company says employee sentiment improved in the second half of the year. Its latest internal employee sentiment questionnaire, which ran from October 20 to November 3, showed \"optimism\" rose to 80%, \"pride\" at 71% and \"confidence in leadership\" at 68%, according to data Meta shared with Business Insider.\n\nEach of those metrics was up between 10 and 12 percentage points compared to the last survey, which ran April 21 through May 5, the spokesperson said. The latest survey had a 91% participation rate, Meta said.\n\nThe combination of policy shifts, reorganizations, job cuts, and stricter performance expectations triggered a wave of departures in 2025, according to five internal farewell posts reviewed by Business Insider. Some employees said Meta's evolving political posture and internal governance changes no longer aligned with their values.\n\n\"Meta in 2025 is a very different company from what Oculus & Facebook were in 2017,\" one engineer, who left Meta in August after nearly eight years at the company, wrote in an internal farewell message, viewed by Business Insider. These types of notes are known internally as \"badge posts.\"\n\nHe cited a \"matter of principles\" for his departure, adding that the \"sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit alignment with the new US government\" clashed with his personal values.\n\nSimilar themes surfaced in other employee departures this year.\n\n\"The unnecessary pressure, lack of empathy, and occasional lack of fairness,\" one former employee wrote in another farewell post from January, seen by Business Insider. \"Fighting for scope. Narratives. Oh, the narratives - I'm so looking forward to not hearing that word for a while. Smart and kind people bending their values to survive because they've been on the edge of their seats for too long.\"\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the resignations represent a small slice of the company. Meta has 78,450 employees, and head count is up 8% year-over-year.\n\nSome departing employees told Business Insider that they no longer had a meaningful outlet to share feedback with leadership on topics such as DEI and embracing \"masculine energy\" because questions for Q&A sessions were preselected, and that posts critical of leadership decisions were sometimes removed from the platform.\n\n\"We will skip questions that we expect might be unproductive if they leak or things like people-related questions that have already been answered,\" Meta's VP of internal communications, Jonny Oser, informed employees in an internal post earlier this year.\n\nIn a January poll titled \"Measuring workplace fear,\" dozens of Meta employees voted anonymously on how afraid they were that speaking openly about working conditions could lead to disciplinary action. The winning responses were \"extremely afraid\" and \"very afraid,\" according to a screenshot of the poll viewed by Business Insider.\n\nEven as some employees headed for the exits, others say they are optimistic about the new environment.\n\nTwo current employees told Business Insider that Meta can be a rewarding place to work, particularly for individuals accustomed to operating in high-pressure environments.\n\n\"I would say that people who are confident in their skills and are high performers generally thrive,\" one senior engineer said.\n\nAnother Meta veteran said the company used to \"coddle its staff\" — but \"that's changing.\"\n\nAn engineer said there are reasons to stay put. \"The positives are that we are still on the frontier in R&D,\" they said. \"There are a lot of cool AI, wearables, and robotics things going on,\" giving high-performing employees a chance to learn and build \"a lot of good skills.\"\n\n\"Also, we get paid a lot, still, and get free food and snacks,\" they said. \"That helps.\"",

    "title": "An 18-year-old brings in $300,000 a month selling 3D printed 'reload can holders.' Here's how he comes up with unique product ideas.",
    "description": "\"I didn't know if it was that good of an idea, but I just posted it on Instagram to see how it would do. The video went wild.\"",
    "fullText": "Earlier this year, Michael Satterlee posted a video chugging a Dr Pepper from his \"tactical reload can holder.\" It's like a coozie, but more fun.\n\nIn the video, as he finishes the beverage, another soda can slides into the frame. He slams the can holder on top of it, sending the original Dr Pepper can flying, and proceeds to chug the second soda.\n\nThe video has more than 50 million views on Instagram.\n\nWhen asked why it went viral, the 18-year-old entrepreneur points to the novelty factor: \"I think it's just, they hadn't seen anything like it before.\" Viewers were also astounded by how quickly he could chug a Dr Pepper, according to the thousands of comments. That part was just good acting, though. Satterlee told Business Insider that he'd drained the can beforehand and \"pretended to drink it in like a second.\"\n\nA post shared by CruiseCup™️ (@cruisecup)\n\nSatterlee's viral video has contributed to the quick success of his e-commerce business, Cruise Cup, which sells a variety of 3D printed products, including the top-selling can holder. In November 2025 alone, he generated $300,000 in sales, which Business Insider verified by reviewing a screenshot of his Shopify dashboard.\n\nHe was poised to capitalize on the viral moment. Satterlee has been building businesses since he was 10, when he went door-to-door asking neighbors if he could mow their lawns. Nearly everyone declined.\n\n\"I knocked on doors every day for like a month straight, and I think I had one client,\" he said. However, he had more success with e-commerce, creating and selling a sand-repellent product, which funded his next project: a clog accessory company called Solefully.\n\n\"I was no stranger to the orders flooding in and what it's like as soon as a viral video goes off,\" said Satterlee, who scaled Solefully's Instagram account to more than 100,000 followers. However, he did need to buy more 3D printers to keep up with the demand for Cruise Cup products.\n\n\"When you're printing a big product, it could take 10 hours, so if you get 10 orders, then you're going to need 100 hours' worth of print time,\" he explained. \"For Solefully, I was able to maintain all my orders with around 50 printers, but when Cruise Cup hit, it just got so insane. I'd be buying batches of 30 printers and still not being able to keep up.\"\n\nSatterlee, who learned about 3D printing in a design class he took his freshman year of high school, said that one of the main benefits of printing products, rather than going through a manufacturer, is the low barrier to entry.\n\n\"Anybody could do it. You could get a 3D printer for like 100 bucks, and a roll of filament costs like $20. They make the modeling software so easy now; there's even AI where you could just type in a prompt, and it will come up with a model for you that'll be ready to 3D print.\"\n\nSatterlee's company has outgrown his childhood home in Clifton Park, New York. The operation \"took over my entire house,\" he recalled. \"My basement was all 3D printers, my dining room was my shipping area, and then my room was my studio.\"\n\nWhile he still lives there, he's shifted operations to a nearby warehouse that houses more than 130 printers. He's also in the process of setting up a mold with a manufacturer and expects to produce stainless steel products by mid-2026.\n\nBefore the viral can holder, Satterlee experimented with a variety of products, including a one-can cooler that was performing well. It prompted him to look at the most dominant player in the cooler space — Yeti — and see if there were any products he could innovate.\n\n\"I was looking at a standard Yeti coozie, and I was like, 'How can I make this better?'\" he said.\n\n\"A couple of things popped into my mind: I can make it easier to load. Instead of having to twist the top off, why couldn't you just be able to slide a drink in through the bottom and then drink it through the top? If I tighten the caps up a little bit, then I can make it so when you put a new can in, the empty will fly out like a shell case.\"\n\nHe figured he was onto something, and Instagram confirmed his suspicions.\n\n\"I didn't know if it was that good of an idea, but I just posted it on Instagram to see how it would do,\" he said. \"The video went wild.\"\n\nThen, he paid close attention to what his audience was saying about the product. One comment popped up over and over again: \"Make it hold two cans,\" he said. \"So that's what I did from there, and that did even better.\"\n\nSatterlee believes in creating a product quickly and iterating from there, rather than spending months trying to perfect it. That's a major advantage of working with a 3D printer: you can create products quickly and at a low cost, and then test the market before deciding to invest time, money, and materials in producing something at scale.\n\n\"Just make whatever idea you have exist first, and then make it good later,\" he said. \"People would tell me all the time, 'What's the point of a can cooler if it's 3D printed? It's not insulated. It's not going to keep the drink cold.' But I didn't care. I had the vision. If you have an idea, just bring it to life as fast as you can, and then go from there.\"\n\nDon't expect your first product, or even first several products, to succeed, he added.\n\n\"You have to be super, super resilient because you're going to fail a ton of times. I just listed to you the companies that I had that made some money. I've lost money on a bunch of businesses, a bunch of ventures — and then sometimes you just get lucky, and it hits.\"",

    "fullText": "The talent wars continue to rage across Silicon Valley as companies vie for the best and brightest minds in AI. There is, however, one major AI company that says it is not giving in to pressure.\n\nMicrosoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said on Bloomberg Podcasts that he doesn't plan to compete with tech giants like Meta by offering top dollar for talent.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's matching those things,\" Suleyman said of the $100 million signing bonuses Meta has been offering engineers, and the $250 million packages it's been using to lure top AI researchers.\n\n\"I think that Zuck's taken a particular approach that involves sort of hiring a lot of individuals rather than maybe creating a team, and I don't really think that's the right approach,\" he said.\n\nSuleyman said he was \"very selective\" about new hires when he previously worked at DeepMind. At Microsoft, he said he has hired \"incrementally,\" prioritizing candidates who aligned with the team's culture and had the right skills, and let go of those who did not.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, the top ranks of AI talent are commanding pay packages in the millions.\n\nIn June, Meta spent $14.3 billion on an investment in Scale AI — a deal widely seen as an acquihire of its CEO, Alexandr Wang. Google also made a similar move, acquiring the leaders of Windsurf, an AI coding platform. in a deal worth $2.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said that Meta tried to lure his employees away with $100 million signing bonuses, which Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth said OpenAI later offered to match.\n\nEven at smaller startups, someone in an AI leadership role can command between $300,000 and $400,000 in base pay, Shawn Thorne, managing director at executive search firm True Search, previously told Business Insider.\n\nSuleyman said \"rotation\" is part of the industry, given the small pool of talent. He cited Microsoft's corporate vice president of AI, Amar Subramanya, decamping to Apple earlier this month as an example.\n\nMicrosoft recently brought in several new hires from DeepMind and OpenAI, he said.\n\n\"There's certainly no 'no poach' agreements, that would not be legal,\" he added. \"People can go work for whoever they want to work for.\"",

    "title": "Ex-Meta staffer nicknamed 'coding machine' says the best engineers aren't on LinkedIn — but they're special cases",
    "description": "Michael Novati , a former Meta principal software engineer, said the names of the best of the best engineers are \"nowhere\" online.",
    "fullText": "LinkedIn is full of corporate braggarts. But don't expect the best engineers to flaunt their success on the platform — or even have an account, according one former Meta employee.\n\nMichael Novati spent almost eight years at Meta, back when it was still called Facebook and hadn't yet doubled down on AI. He reached the rank of principal software engineer and earned the nickname \"coding machine.\"\n\nOn the \"A Life Engineered\" podcast, host Steve Huynh asked Novati about his claim that the top five engineers aren't on LinkedIn. Novati stood by it.\n\n\"When I was at Facebook, the top engineers were like, 'If you had a LinkedIn account, people would be wondering if you're job hunting,'\" he said.\n\nNovati said these engineers don't need to publicly job hunt because of tech's extensive recruiting arm, which he called the \"secrets of the industry.\"\n\n\"There are very senior, very highly paid recruiters that work at the top companies who have very strong long-term social relationships with a lot of top engineers,\" he said.\n\nHow do these engineers and recruiters meet? Novati gave the example of an engineer who spends a week doing campus recruiting at Stanford, bonding with the company's recruiter in the process.\n\nHe referred to these as the \"secret backroom dealings of Silicon Valley.\"\n\n\"These engineers' names are nowhere, but they are the ones that are the most desirable by these recruiters,\" he said. \"The $100 million engineer is not on LinkedIn with a tagline that's like, #100millionengineer.\"\n\nTech recruiting has long been a large, lucrative industry. Big Tech companies both employ in-house recruiters and outside agencies to stay close to key talent.\n\nMeanwhile, talent is becoming increasingly competitive, particularly in the field of AI. Meta shelled out large contracts for its Superintelligence Labs, poaching engineers from its competitors.\n\nSometimes CEOs even get involved. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly made a list of the top AI talent to poach. OpenAI's chief research officer said that Zuckerberg hand-delivered soup to an employee he was trying to recruit.\n\nOne AI worker told Business Insider they got a personal call from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, pitching them to join the company. They accepted.\n\nBeing offline may not be the golden key to tech recruiting, though. These top-tier engineers are a \"specific case,\" Novati said on the podcast.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that your strategy should be: delete LinkedIn and all the offers will come,\" he said.\n\nIt's a rarified class, Novati said, but one that stays away from all semblances of personal branding.\n\n\"I don't know any of those top engineers, who get special equity grants and special dinners with Bezos or whatever stuff like that, who have big personal brands,\" he said.",

    "description": "Meta's lines of code, shared meals, a familiar melodies, and the All the Smoke podcast, are finding ways to bring people together by a common thread.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES –– Indelible connections often unassumingly begin. They make their marks on out hearts and psyches with the whisper of a question: What if?\n\nWhat if a link could be more than a link?\n\nWhat if sharing a favorite podcast episode felt less like a broadcast and more like an invitation?\n\nEarlier this month, Threads answered. Meta introduced features that let podcasters and their afficianados plant their flags, pinning their work to their profile with pride.\n\nThey made episode shares not just visible, but vibrant. This was the technical seed. But the true story is about the soil where it was planted.\n\nThis is about the community that formed around a restaurant called Somerville.\n\nTo cross its threshold was to slip through time. Its decoration is an homage to the loving spectral echoes of Black excellence speakeasies that defined the Harlem Renaissance. This was no mere venue; it was a vessel.\n\nWooden beams, skeletal and sincere, stretched overhead like the bare ribs of a great, welcoming beast, married to the soft glow of romantic lighting.\n\nThe air hummed with a latent energy, the quiet thrill of a secret too good to keep. Plush brown seats held bodies leaning in, not back. This was the clubhouse for a playground's elite, and on Thursday, the NBA was the conversation.\n\nOn delicate plates, the philosophy of connection was served in edible metaphors.\n\nScrumptious tuna tartare, a diminutive masterpiece, its ginger-soy dressing performing a delicate dance on the palate. A sesame ice cream cone waltzed in perfect, savory harmony with shallots and chives.\n\nTruffle-flavored popcorn bursts with umami —a complex chorus of garlic, pepper, and a unique woodsy blend—each bite a tiny explosion of crafted communion.\n\nAnd weaving through it all, the sultry, sinuous voice of Briana Washington at the piano, wrapping around ballads like \"A Lovely Day.\" This was the soundtrack of shared humanity.\n\nBecause some truths are universal. Food, music, sports—these are the ancient, unbreakable codes that bypass borders, beliefs, every arbitrary self-absorbed monument that we build.\n\nThey are the common tongue. And in this temple of that truth, Threads made its stand, not with a mere press release, but with a party.\n\nAt the center sat Connor Hayes, Head of Threads, a man whose love for basketball was the engine of this experiment. His was not a corporate passion. It was born in the upper deck of the old Boston Garden, a childhood etched with the struggles of a bad Celtics team and the singular obsession with a player like Ron Mercer.\n\n\"I've been watching…I could watch all 82 games of that team,\" Hayes said. His fan's heart still beats beneath a builder's hoodie.\n\nFor him, Threads was a chance to rebuild the digital arena as it should be: a \"second screen\" where the community's roar during a Wembanyama highlight feels electric, intimate.\n\n\"I have a ton of people that I've met through Threads who are also Celtics fans,\" Hayes shared, describing a group chat that spanned from the Philippines to Brazil. \"One person… made Joe Mazzulla magnets for everybody and mailed them to them. That's the kind of magic we're trying to create.\"\n\nHis vision is to formalize the fellowship fans have already forged. To add the flair of team loyalty, so \"you know who you're dealing with.\"\n\nTo move from hot takes to heartfelt bonds.\n\nThis event, Hayes noted, was about \"the intersection of podcasts that are growing, communities that are growing on Threads, and commentators that we think speak to us.\"\n\nAnd into this curated crucible stepped the day's hosts. Matt Barnes. Stephen Jackson. And their guest, the formidable, unfiltered Kendrick Perkins.\n\nThe podcast taping of \"All the Smoke\" became a séance.\n\nThe proverbial smoke cleared not to obscure, but to reveal.\n\nPerkins, the ESPN persona known for volcanic takes, softened into something more vulnerable, more valuable.\n\nHe spoke of the athlete's tunnel vision, a poignant regret that hung in the perfumed air.\n\n\"One of my biggest regrets as a player,\" Perkins confessed, \"we may pass people up, they may give us their business cards. We keep it moving… Now we're in this space… those business cards actually mean something.\"\n\nIt was a stunning admission of life deferred, of human connections missed in the single-minded pursuit of the game.\n\nHe dissected the alchemy of team chemistry not with cold stats, but with the warmth of memory. He shared where things went awry in Oklahoma City.\n\n\"After you won a championship, man, you think you was the reason why. Everybody in the locker room think they was the reason.\"\n\nHis analysis was layered, empathetic, and born of experience. This was the content Threads dreamed of housing: not just debate, but depth. Not just reaction, but reflection.\n\nMeta's Jocelyn Jones, from Threads, watched it fuse into her soft manifesto.\n\n\"We think that Threads can be the place,\" Jones said. \"Where's the conversation that happens around podcasts? There's not a natural place… So, like, why not there be a place for that to happen?\"\n\nSomerville was the answer. It was the \"why not.\"\n\nIt was the physical manifestation of a digital thesis: that discovery is not a fleeting feeling, that discussion is a meal, that community is a melody you feel in your bones.\n\nThe new features on the app are mere signposts. Still, this—this warmth, this whiskey-washed wisdom, the collective silence of onlookers who hung on to every word as \"Big Perk\" peeled back layers of his persona, exposing a vulnerable underbelly, was the destination.\n\nAs Meta updates their code, users of the platform will find convenants in their conversations.\n\nIn a room lit by the glow of screens and content creators, where common threads formed the smells of truffles and heritage wafted, uncommon connections.\n\nThe joy of discovery has found its home. And this, as they say, is just the opening act.",

    "title": "Instagram Is Adding AI-Generated Headlines to Some Posts",
    "description": "No one asked for this.",
    "fullText": "Few of us are under the illusion that we own the content that we post on Instagram, but we do get a say in how that content is presented—we can choose which photos and videos we share, what captions appear (or don't appear) on each post, as well as whether or not we include where the image was taken or shared from. We might not control the platform, but we can control the content of our posts—unless those posts are found on search engines like Google.\n\nAs reported by 404 Media, Instagram is now experimenting with AI-generated SEO titles for users' posts—without those users' input or permission. Take this post for example: Author Jeff VanderMeer uploaded a short video of rabbits eating a banana to his Instagram. The video was posted as-is: There was no caption, location tag, or any other public-facing information. It's just a couple of rabbits having a bite.\n\nA post shared by Jeff VanderMeer (@jeff_vandermeer123)\n\nInstagram, however, took it upon itself to add a headline to the post—at least when you stumble upon it on via Google. Rather than display a link featuring Jeff's Instagram handle and some metadata about the video, the Google entry comes back with the following headline: \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas, A Nutritious Snack for...\" (the rest of the headline cuts off here).\n\nVanderMeer was less than pleased with the discovery. He posted a screenshot of the headline to Bluesky, writing, \"now [Instagram] appears to generate titles [and] headlines via AI for stuff I post...to create [clickbait] for [Google] wtf do not like.\"\n\nThis was not the only AI-generated headline VanderMeer was roped into. This post from the Groton Public Library in Massachusetts, which advertises VanderMeer's novel Annihilation as the library's December book group pick, was also given the clickbait treatment on Google. Just as with VanderMeer's post, the Groton Public Library didn't include any text in its Instagram post—just an image showing off the book. But if you see the post within a Google search, you'll see the following partial headline: \"Join Jeff VanderMeer on a Thrilling Beachside Adventure...\"\n\n404 Media's Emanuel Maiberg says that they've confirmed that Instagram is also generating headlines for other users on the platform, all without permission or knowledge. Google told Maiberg the headlines are not coming from its AI generators—though it has been using deceptive AI-generated headlines of its own on Google Discover. In fact, the company says its search engine is simply pulling the text from Instagram itself. Maiberg found that these headlines do appear under title tags for Instagram posts when using Google's Rich Result Test tool. When digging through the code, Maiberg also discovered AI-generated descriptions for each post, which could be what Instagram is ultimately using to generate the headlines.\n\nI reached out to Meta for comment, and this story originally published before they responded. However, a Meta spokesperson has since confirmed to me that Instagram has recently started generating these titles using AI. The goal, according to the spokesperson, is to make it easier to know what a post is about before you click the link. They also noted that these headlines might not be totally correct, as with all AI products. In addition, the spokesperson explained that search engine optimization indexing is not necessarily new. The company has been doing this for years in the U.S. to increase visibility for posts from professional accounts.\n\nThat last point is all fine and good, of course. No one is surprised that Instagram is indexing posts for search engines: Most social media platforms do that. Otherwise, you'd never find any of their posts on platforms like Google. The issue is generating fake headlines with AI without letting anyone know about it. Just because Meta AI is capable of generating headlines doesn't mean it is good at it, or even that it should—especially when users never consented to this practice in the first place. It'd be one thing if Instagram had an option before you post—something like \"Generate a headline for me using Meta AI that will appear in search engines for my post.\" Most of us would opt out of that, but it'd at least be a choice. However, it appears that Instagram decided that users like VanderMeer weren't capable of writing a headline as clever as \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas.\"\n\nThe worst part is, the AI doesn't even accurately describe the posts, a risk the Meta spokesperson readily admits to. That Groton Public Library post was only about a book club meeting featuring VanderMeer's novel, but the headline says \"Join Jeff VanderMeer,\" as if he'd be making an appearance. Not only did Instagram add a headline without VanderMeer's consent, it spread misinformation about his whereabouts. And for what? Some extra engagement on Google?\n\nIf Instagram wants its posts to appear as headlines on search engines, it should include the actual posters in the conversation. As VanderMeer told 404 Media: \"If I post content, I want to be the one contextualizing it, not some third party.\"\n\nWhile Meta has yet to add a dedicated on/off switch for these headlines, one thing you can do to ensure your posts don't get an AI clickbait makeover is to opt out of indexing as a whole. If you run an account that relies on discoverability, this might not be worth it, since you'll be impacting how users find your posts outside of Instagram. However, if you don't care about that, or you don't need the SEO at all, you can stop Instagram from making your posts available on search engines—and putting an end to the AI-generated headlines, at that.\n\nThere are three ways to accomplish this, according to Instagram:\n\nMake your account private: Head to Instagram's in-app settings, then choose Account privacy. Here, tap the Private account toggle.\n\nSwitch your account from professional to private: Open Instagram's in-app settings, scroll down and tap Account type and tools. Here, choose \"Switch to personal account.\"\n\nManually opt out of indexing: Head to Instagram's in-app settings, then choose Account privacy. You should see an option to stop your public photos and videos from appearing in search engines.",

    "description": "The mysterious algorithm is now (somewhat) customizable.",
    "fullText": "After years of suffering from a crippling TikTok addiction, I decided enough was enough: I quit the app cold turkey and deleted it from my phone. Then, I discovered Instagram Reels, and my attention span hasn't been the same since.\n\nTikTok's algorithm is infamous, but we don't give Instagram's enough credit. This platform is addicting. I hardly use the app to keep up with friends and family anymore: Reels grabs my attention and doesn't let go, and before I know it, it's midnight, and I've done nothing with my evening. How many videos did I watch? What did I even watch? Whatever Meta has going on in that algorithm is dangerous stuff.\n\nYou can influence the algorithm, of course: The decisions you make in the app—likes, comments, watch time, sharing—tell the algorithm which videos you like, which you don't, and inform its fraction-of-a-second decisions about what to show you next. But until now, you haven't been able to see what's driving those decisions. You're kind of flying blind—you can try to steer the algorithm in a new direction, but you'll never know exactly what direction you're really going in.\n\nThat's now changing. As reported by Wired, Meta is rolling out a new tab for Reels viewers that will let us see why the algorithm is delivering us these particular videos. This tab, called, appropriately, \"Your Algorithm,\" is now rolling out, first in the U.S., but soon to the rest of the world—at least, only to English speakers. It seems reminiscent of TikTok's \"Manage Topics\" feed, which lets you adjust the content types that appear in your For You feed.\n\nWhen \"Your Algorithm\" hits your phone, you'll find it in the top right corner of the Reels feed: two lines with heart icons placed on each. (I had to update the app and force quit it a couple times to get it to appear.) Once you open this tab, you'll see a short summary of the type of content the algorithm says you've liked recently. In Meta's example, it says, \"Lately you've been into creativity, sports hype, fitness motivation, [and] skateboarding.\" Mine says, \"Lately you've been into classic video games, laughing at comedy clubs, and making beats in the studio.\"\n\nBeneath this summary, you'll find the \"What you want to see more of\" section. Here, you can choose specific content categories you'd like to appear in your feed more often. Instagram will populate some choices here based on your past interests—Meta's example from above shows things like \"Sports,\" \"GRWM,\" \"Thrifting,\" and \"Horror movies\"—but you can tap an \"Add\" button to contribute your own requests. You can tap any of these content types to find the option to watch Reels in that category, in case you want to test drive any before locking in your choices.\n\nBeneath this, you'll find \"What you want to see less of.\" This is the same concept, but the reverse: You can choose any content types you don't want in your feed anymore. If you're sick of seeing hiking videos, but Instagram continues to show them to you, here's your chance to directly tell the algorithm to cut it out.\n\nIf you tap the three dots in the top right, you'll find some shortcuts to existing content controls, too, like whether to suggest political content on your feed, \"sensitive\" content controls, and specific words and phrase filters, to name a few. You can also tap the share button to share your algorithm summary to your story. I'm not sure who would want to do that, but I guess I shared my summary here, so who am I to judge.\n\nWired highlights how these changes come as the European Commission is pushing Meta to present more data controls to EU users: These users have so far been able to pay to not see ads, but since the European Commission didn't think that was enough, Meta will allow users to choose whether to allow all their data to be used for personalized ads, or only a small percentage.\n\nThat's not happening here in the U.S., but that doesn't mean Meta is staying the same, either. \"Your Algorithm\" is launching as Meta is facing criticism over how it handles younger users on its platforms. Reports suggest Meta understands how addictive its apps are, especially to teens, and the company's internal policies for chatbot interactions with minors was, frankly, appalling. The company has rolled out Teen Accounts across apps like Instagram and Facebook, which offer limits on communications and interactions, and new AI parental controls are also on their way. \"Your Algorithm\" seems to be the latest in a string of efforts to make it easier for users to control the experience on Meta platforms. Theoretically, you could even use these controls to make your Reels experience less addicting.\n\nThose are all good developments as far as I'm concerned, but I fear there's still quite a lot of work to do to make Meta's products—as well as many other social media products—less addictive, and, overall, better for us. Case in point: I opened the app to test out \"Your Algorithm,\" and not only did I not find it at first, I ended up losing five minutes of my life watching the first video that appeared in my feed. I need to delete Instagram from my phone.",

    "description": "Five months after Meta's $14 billion deal, Scale AI has lost some of its gleam, with workers sniping about pay, and rivals coming for its clientele.",
    "fullText": "This summer, after Meta made a $14 billion investment in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, and after A-list clients like OpenAI and Google halted work with the startup, a worker for Scale AI anxiously asked ChatGPT what it thought of his company's fate. He knew the chatbot well, having tested it for vulnerabilities. Its prognosis was grim.\n\n\"Scale AI will no longer exist as a credible independent entity within 24 months,\" ChatGPT, which isn't any kind of official authority, wrote. \"Its infrastructure will be repurposed for Meta's internal needs. Its client base will evaporate. Its role as a neutral red teamer or external evaluator is effectively over.\"\n\nThe contractor shared the chat logs with fellow workers at Scale AI. In one reply reviewed by Business Insider, one worker said that they were already on their way out, describing the startup as a ticking time bomb.\n\nThe chatbot was drawing from a storm of headlines about Scale AI, which until this summer had been touted as one of the most ascendant startups in tech — the place Big Tech companies vying for AI supremacy went to when they wanted their chatbots stress-tested and perfected. Lately, it's lost some of its gleam, with investors significantly lowering valuations, workers sniping about pay, and rivals coming for its clientele.\n\nThe vast army of human data labelers that made Scale AI a juggernaut are chafing at what they say are pay cuts, lengthy unpaid onboarding sessions to join new AI projects, and thinning workloads — and are increasingly leaving the platform altogether, according to interviews with five current and former contractors and internal correspondence obtained by Business Insider.\n\nActivity in the main internal chatroom for Outlier — Scale AI's flagship gig work platform, which touts more than 100,000 taskers — has plummeted since the Meta investment, with weekly discussion threads drawing dozens instead of the usual hundreds of replies, according to screenshots reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nOne tasker said that they'd spent close to 40 hours in a single month in unpaid onboarding sessions without landing any actual work, noting that other platforms like Scale AI's rival Mercor do pay for this kind of work. Elizabeth Boyd, another tasker, says she rarely does work for Outlier anymore after seeing effective pay rates for some projects slashed to around $20 an hour — down from the $50 she used to make. One gig that advertised $20 an hour only allowed three minutes of working time every two days, or a 99-cent payout, according to screenshots obtained by Business Insider.\n\nJoe Osborne, a Scale AI spokesperson, says the balance sheets show the company is on the right path. \"This quarter is on track to be our biggest of 2025, our data business is more profitable today than it was before the Meta deal, and our applications business, which includes work with Fortune 500 companies and governments, has doubled revenue\" in the second half of the year compared to the first, Osborne wrote in an email. He also noted there has been an increase in active users on Outlier since the Meta deal, and that pay rates are based on the skills for each project and contributors always see the rates upfront, and have the option of declining any gig.\n\nThe company is also looking to diversify. The startup has embraced fields like robotics, announcing a new lab to meet booming demand for robot training data this fall. It's doubling down on its US military and other government work, winning up to $199 million worth of defense contracts since the Meta deal.\n\nSome investors are bullish. In one current investor's view, Meta has mostly left Scale alone, letting it operate as an independent company. With around $1 billion on the balance sheet, the investor added, there are no plans to fundraise. And an IPO could still be on the table at some point.\n\nOther investors see Scale AI as more like a gutted fish. The Meta investment — which valued Scale AI at $29 billion — has dented Scale AI's valuation in private markets where people buy and sell equity from pre-IPO startups. Noel Moldvai, Augment's CEO, tells Business Insider his platform used to process millions of dollars' worth of transactions in Scale AI stock before the Meta deal, but that dried up as sellers waited to see if the startup rebounded. Activity is picking up again, he said, but at lower valuations of around $15 billion to $9 billion. The underlying message of Meta's semi-acquisition is clear to Moldvai. \"It seems like Meta was just after Alexandr Wang, and so this is probably the structure that let them get him,\" he says. He adds that Scale AI's valuation could still bounce back.\n\nOn another marketplace, Caplight, Scale's valuation has dropped to $7.3 billion. Osborne says that the valuation is not accurate because there have been no sales of stock at that price and multiples of comparable companies would yield a higher valuation.\n\nIf the company doesn't pull it off, it could become the latest example of a once-promising startup that morphed into a \"zombie\" after being invested in by a tech giant.\n\nThis summer, Scale AI painted a rosy picture of the Meta investment, describing it as a major cash infusion and source of future work in its official statement at the time of the deal. That messaging was also conveyed to the startup's corporate workforce, says another former member of Scale AI's red team, which tests chatbots for flaws and vulnerabilities. Just a few weeks after the investment, he was laid off as part of a major downsizing that saw 14% of Scale AI's full-time staff of 1,400 let go.\n\nOsborne said the layoffs were aimed at making the data division profitable, which it now is.\n\nThose weren't the only cuts. In September, Scale AI terminated 12 contractors on its red team, citing performance issues. Two ex-red teamers told Business Insider that the team's work had been drying up since the Meta deal, blaming thinning workloads for the cuts. Later that month, Scale AI shuttered a team in Dallas of contractors focused on generalist AI work as it moved towards more specialized fields.\n\nOsborne said the 12 contractors were part of Scale's temporary workforce and represented a small fraction of its overall red team, which the company is still committed to investing in. He said the Dallas cuts were part of an industry shift towards higher skilled work and represent a small fraction of its overall workforce.\n\nMeanwhile, a swarm of AI training startups has rushed in to poach Scale AI's workers and clients. Some are now raising capital at soaring valuations. Surge AI hit a valuation of $24 billion while Mercor, which is run by three 22-year-olds, announced in October it had raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation.\n\nMercor has won at least one major AI training project from Meta, Scale AI's 49% shareholder. In September, Scale AI filed a lawsuit in California against Mercor alleging it hired one of its sales employees to poach its biggest customers, allegations Mercor denies.\n\nOne Scale AI investor said he'd been frustrated with Scale AI's leadership losing customers to Surge AI in particular, which reportedly brought in more revenue than Scale in 2024, despite never having raised outside funding. (Scale AI had raised more than $1.5 billion before the Meta deal.)\n\nBrendan Foody, Mercor's CEO, has publicly criticized Scale AI for what he claims are low pay rates and data quality issues. \"Scale lost the focus on product, on scaling quality,\" Foody said in a September podcast appearance. In response, a Scale AI spokesperson told Business Insider its quality metrics are at \"record highs.\"\n\nIt's not just rival CEOs making that point. Tammy Hartline, who managed projects for Scale AI as a consultant until the summer of 2025, said Scale grew so quickly that the work became more about needing bodies than skills. \"Spam and low quality data became accepted as a cost of doing business,\" she said. Hartline joined Mercor in September.\n\nScale AI has also been beset with security issues that predate Meta's investment. In June, Business Insider reported that Scale AI routinely used public Google Docs to track work for high-profile customers, including Google, Meta, and xAI. That practice left AI training documents labeled \"confidential\" accessible to anyone with the link and exposed reams of personal information, like private emails and pay details, about contractors. \"We take data security seriously,\" Osborne said. \"We conducted a thorough investigation and disabled any user's ability to publicly share documents from Scale managed systems.\"\n\nSloppy security isn't uncommon in the AI training space — Surge AI similarly left open sensitive work for its client Anthropic. But the exposed documents seen by Business Insider show that for a project for Google, Scale AI faced security and quality issues throughout 2023 and 2024. Thousands of taskers were flagged for being \"suspected spammers,\" \"cheaters,\" with hundreds of workers listed in spreadsheets with titles like \"Good and Bad Folks\" and \"suspicious non-US taskers.\" Meta recently removed more than 40 groups buying and reselling AI training accounts, including from Scale AI, in response to a recent Business Insider investigation. Osborne said Scale's data quality metrics are the highest they've ever been.\n\nThe company has notched some recent wins. It once appeared bogged down by litigation, but recently agreed to settle multiple lawsuits filed by ex-workers in California who alleged they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors. (Scale no longer accepts gig workers from the state.) The big question remains whether Scale AI can thrive in the increasingly competitive AI training industry it helped give birth to. For many former workers, it'll be too late to find out.\n\nCharles Rollet is Business Insider's tech correspondent in San Francisco.

    "fullText": "A startup nabbing a $14 billion investment from one of the top tech companies seems like a good thing. The reality is a lot more complicated.\n\nScale AI has faced a turbulent five months since Meta purchased a 49% stake in the startup, write BI's Charles Rollet and Ben Bergman. Once a leader in the field of stress testing and perfecting AI models for Big Tech, Scale AI has faced pay cuts, poaching, and pivots since the Meta deal.\n\nIt's representative of how dealmaking with big players can be a double-edged sword in the age of AI.\n\nFor some, like Scale AI cofounder Alexandr Wang, who's now a high-level Meta exec, the deal was a windfall. However, according to interviews with five current and former contractors and internal correspondence obtained by BI, Scale AI has faced some inner turmoil following the Meta deal.\n\nJoe Osborne, a Scale AI spokesperson, strongly disputed that the startup's business has been in trouble since the Meta investment and said this quarter is on track to be the company's biggest of the year.\n\nNot all of Scale AI's issues are related to the Meta deal. A BI investigation this June found Scale AI routinely used public Google Docs for work with its Big Tech clients. (There was no indication of a breach, and Scale did lock down the documents after BI's report about the issue.) It also faced litigation over claims it misclassified and underpaid contract workers.\n\nBut one of the larger problems stems from some Big Tech companies pausing work with Scale now that one of their competitors — Meta — is its biggest backer.\n\nThe AI environment means more startups could encounter similar issues.\n\nThe Scale AI-Meta deal was unique in many ways, but there are still lessons to be learned from the aftermath.\n\nThe top-heavy ecosystem of the AI marketplace means there are a limited number of landing spots for startups looking for exit opportunities. Add in the ultra-competitive nature of the space, and a deal with one company could mean the end of business with the others.\n\nOf course, not every startup will get acquired by a tech giant. And yes, some startups will have products that companies will need to use regardless of their backers. But for the vast majority of young AI companies, that's not a reality.\n\nSo, if the industry faces a bit of turmoil and funding dries up, startups may have some difficult decisions about who they cut deals with and which doors could close to them.",

    "fullText": "Meta is planning to raise prices for its virtual reality devices, executives said in an internal memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nMetaverse leaders Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns told employees that the company must \"make a shift\" in its business model to ensure long-term sustainability. This will include measures such as price increases, accounting for new costs like tariffs, and extending the replacement cycle of its in-market devices, per the memo.\n\n\"Our devices will be more premium in price going forward, but we'll have a healthier business to anchor on and free ourselves from feeling existential about any singular device's success,\" Aul and Cairns wrote in the memo, shared with staff on December 4.\n\nThey also called for delivering high-quality software experiences to customers that can match the \"excellence\" of its devices, adding that this may mean \"we ship new hardware at a slower cadence going forward.\"\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe company's flagship virtual reality (VR) headset, the Meta Quest 3, retails for $499.99, while its entry-level model retails at $299.99.\n\nThe move comes as Meta pushed back the release of its new mixed reality glasses, codenamed \"Phoenix,\" from the second half of 2026 to the first half of 2027, as outlined in a product strategy note to staff that Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThe memo announcing the price increases from Aul and Cairns did not refer to its mixed reality glasses. The document outlined three major themes derived from a recent Reality Labs strategy meeting with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CTO Andrew Bosworth. They included how Meta can build a sustainable VR business for the long term, how it can build \"world-class\" software experiences, and how it can accelerate its pace on mobile.\n\nThey also sought to reassure staffers that it remains focused on VR. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Meta plans to make budget cuts of up to 30% to Reality Labs, the division responsible for Meta's hardware.\n\n\"We're committed to VR for the long-haul so we need to align our business model and roadmap to an approach that will make this possible,\" they wrote in the memo. \"We've been working hard to bend the curve and accelerate ahead of the category's natural growth rate, which means running multiple programs in parallel as well as carrying costs like tariffs and subsidies for content, GTM, and devices.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Instagram May Be Quietly Adding AI-Generated Headlines to Your Posts",
    "description": "No one asked for this.",
    "fullText": "Few of us are under the illusion that we own the content that we post on Instagram, but we do get a say in how that content is presented—w can choose which photos and videos we share, what captions appear (or don't appear) on each post, as well as whether or not we include where the image was taken or shared from. We might not control the platform, but we do control the content of our posts—unless those posts are found on search engines like Google.\n\nAs reported by 404 Media, it appears that Instagram is experimenting with AI-generated SEO titles for users' posts—without those users' input or permission. Take this post for example: Author Jeff VanderMeer uploaded a short video of rabbits eating a banana to his Instagram. The video was posted as-is: There was no caption, location tag, or any other public-facing information. It's just a couple of rabbits having a bite.\n\nA post shared by Jeff VanderMeer (@jeff_vandermeer123)\n\nInstagram, however, took it upon itself to add a headline to the post—at least when you stumble upon it on via Google. Rather than display a link featuring Jeff's Instagram handle and some metadata about the video, the Google entry comes back with the following headline: \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas, A Nutritious Snack for...\" (the rest of the headline cuts off here).\n\nVanderMeer was less than pleased with the discovery. He posted a screenshot of the headline to Bluesky, writing, \"now [Instagram] appears to generate titles [and] headlines via AI for stuff I post...to create [clickbait] for [Google] wtf do not like.\"\n\nThis was not the only AI-generated headline VanderMeer was roped into. This post from the Groton Public Library in Massachusetts, which advertises VanderMeer's novel Annihilation as the library's December book group pick, was also given the \"clickbait\" treatment on Google. Just as with VanderMeer's post, the Groton Public Library didn't include any text in its Instagram post—just an image showing off the book. But if you see the post within a Google search, you'll see the following partial headline: \"Join Jeff VanderMeer on a Thrilling Beachside Adventure with Mesta...\"\n\n404 Media's Emanuel Maiberg says that they've confirmed that Instagram is also generating headlines for other users on the platform, all without permission or knowledge. Meta did not return 404 Media's request for comment. (I have also reached out for comment.) Google, on the other hand, did return 404 Media's messages, and confirmed the headlines are not coming from its AI generators—though it has been using deceptive AI-generated headlines of its own on Google Discover. In fact, the company says its search engine is simply pulling the text from Instagram itself. Maiberg found that these headlines do appear under title tags for Instagram posts when using Google's Rich Result Test tool. When digging through the code, Maiberg also discovered AI-generated descriptions for each post, which could be what Instagram is ultimately using to generate the headlines.\n\nI'll update this post if I hear back from Instagram regarding these AI-generated headlines. Until then, I can only speculate on their intended purpose (assuming Instagram is the one generating these headlines in the first place). And the likeliest reason is to boost engagement: Instagram probably wants to increase the visibility of its users' posts in search, which means giving Google more information to work with. If the user doesn't provide their own details about the image, Instagram's AI appears to be filling in the blanks, first generating a description, and from there, sticking a \"clicky\" headline onto it.\n\nThe results aren't actually all that appealing, though. Just because Meta AI may be capable of generating headlines, doesn't mean it is good at it, or even that it should—especially when users never consented to this practice in the first place. It'd be one thing if Instagram had an option before you post—something like \"Generate a headline for me using Meta AI that will appear in search engines for my post.\" Most of us would opt out of that, but it'd at least be a choice. However, it appears that Instagram decided that users like VanderMeer weren't capable of writing a headline as clever as \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas.\"\n\nThe worst part is, the AI doesn't even accurately describe the posts. That Groton Public Library post was only about a book club meeting featuring VanderMeer's novel, but the headline says \"Join Jeff VanderMeer,\" as if he'd be making an appearance. Not only did Instagram add a headline without VanderMeer's consent, it spread misinformation about his whereabouts. And for what? Some extra engagement on Google?\n\nIf Instagram wants its posts to appear as headlines on search engines, it should include the actual posters in the conversation. As VanderMeer told 404 Media: \"If I post content, I want to be the one contextualizing it, not some third party.\"",

    "fullText": "Accounts held by users under 16 must be removed on apps that include TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube, Snapchat, Reddit, Kick, Twitch and Threads under ban\n\nHow is Australia’s social media ban affecting you and your family?\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nAustralia has enacted a world-first ban on social media for users aged under 16, causing millions of children and teenagers to lose access to their accounts.\n\nFacebook, Instagram, Threads, X, YouTube, Snapchat, Reddit, Kick, Twitch and TikTok are expected to have taken steps from Wednesday to remove accounts held by users under 16 years of age in Australia, and prevent those teens from registering new accounts.\n\nPlatforms that do not comply risk fines of up to $49.5m.\n\nThere have been some teething problems with the ban’s implementation. Guardian Australia has received several reports of those under 16 passing the facial age assurance tests, but the government has flagged it is not expecting the ban will be perfect from day one.\n\nAll listed platforms apart from X had confirmed by Tuesday they would comply with the ban. The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said it had recently had a conversation with X about how it would comply, but the company had not communicated its policy to users.\n\nBluesky, an X alternative, announced on Tuesday it would also ban under-16s, despite eSafety assessing the platform as “low risk” due to its small user base of 50,000 in Australia.\n\nChildren had spent the past few weeks undertaking age assurance checks, swapping phone numbers and preparing for their accounts to be deactivated.\n\nThe Australian chief executive and co-founder of the age assurance service k-ID, Kieran Donovan, said his service had conducted hundreds of thousands of age checks in the past few weeks. The k-ID service was being used by Snapchat among others.\n\nParents of children affected by the ban shared a spectrum of views on the policy. One parent told the Guardian their 15-year-old daughter was “very distressed” because “all her 14 to 15-year-old friends have been age verified as 18 by Snapchat”. Since she had been identified as under 16, they feared “her friends will keep using Snapchat to talk and organise social events and she will be left out”.\n\nAnother parent said the ban had forced him to teach his child how to break the law. “I’ve shown her how VPNs work and other methods on bypassing age restrictions,” he said. “I’ve had to set her up with her own adult YouTube account and have assisted her in bypassing TikTok’s age-estimation and will keep doing so each time it asks.”\n\nOthers said the ban “can’t come quickly enough”. One parent said their daughter was “completely addicted” to social media and the ban “provides us with a support framework to keep her off these platforms”.\n\nThe Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said in an opinion piece on Sunday: “From the beginning, we’ve acknowledged this process won’t be 100% perfect. But the message this law sends will be 100% clear … Australia sets the legal drinking age at 18 because our society recognises the ­benefits to the individual and the community of such an ­approach.\n\n“The fact that teenagers occasionally find a way to have a drink doesn’t diminish the value of having a clear, ­national standard.”\n\nPolling has consistently shown that two-thirds of voters support raising the minimum age for social media to 16. The opposition, including leader Sussan Ley, have recently voiced alarm about the ban, despite waving the legislation through parliament and the former Liberal leader Peter Dutton championing it.\n\nThe ban has garnered worldwide attention, with several nations indicating they will adopt a ban of their own, including Malaysia, Denmark and Norway. The European Union passed a resolution to adopt similar restrictions, while a spokesperson for the British government told Reuters it was “closely monitoring Australia’s approach to age restrictions”.\n\nInman Grant told the Guardian that from Thursday, she would be sending notices to the platforms covered by the ban to find out how the implementation was progressing.\n\nQuestions included “how many accounts [they’ve] deactivated or removed, what challenges they’re finding, how they’re preventing recidivism and preventing circumvention, whether or not their abuse or reporting abuse and the appeals processes are working as planned”, she said.\n\nAlbanese said the information gathered in this process would be made public.\n\nThe regulator would need to assess whether platforms were taking reasonable steps. If they were not, it could take that platform to court to seek fines.\n\nThere would be an independent evaluation of the ban conducted by an academic advisory group examining the short-term, medium-term and longer-term impacts of the ban.\n\n“It will look at the benefits over time, but also the unintended consequences,” Inman Grant said.\n\n“Everything from are sleeping? Are they interacting or are they actually getting out on the sports fields? Are they reading books? Are they taking less medication like antidepressants? Are their Naplan scores improving over time?” Inman Grant said.\n\nPotential unintended consequences to be investigated included whether children were moving on to “darker areas of the internet”, learning how to bypass the bans through VPNs, or moving on to other platforms, she said.\n\nTeens on Snapchat affected by the ban had been publicly sharing their mobile numbers in their profiles ahead of their accounts being shut down.\n\nA spokesperson for Snapchat said the platform understood under-16s were disappointed by the ban but “would strongly encourage any teens using Snapchat not to publicly share their personal contact information”.\n\nInman Grant said she had sent notices to 15 companies not initially included in the ban, asking them to self-assess whether they should be.\n\nYope and Lemon8, which shot up the app store rankings as teens looked for alternatives, were among those contacted.",

And doing great things, especially young entrepreneurs,\" Jena said.\n\nAt the same time, children watching adult content online \"has a very bad effect\".\n\nAt a Mumbai park, cricket coach Pratik Bhurke, 38, said Australia's move would encourage children to spend time outdoors and could have \"great benefits\" in India too.\n\nIn the chilly German capital, Luna Drewes, 13, is watching selfie-style TikTok clips posted by other young people.\n\n\"Actually a good thing in some ways because social media often portrays a certain image of how people should look, like girls have to be thin,\" she said of the ban.\n\nAnother teenager, Enno Caro Brandes, said: \"I'm 15 so for me the ban would definitely come into effect. I can't really imagine giving it up completely.\n\n\"A ban is a bit extreme, but it could definitely help to do a detox.\"\n\nAn AI baby singing and answering interview questions are among the videos served up to Firdha Razak, 16, as she scrolls in her room.\n\nRazak is not in favour of a ban. \"It's really stupid, honestly,\" although \"there's not really much we can do as 16-year-olds\" if governments decide to act, she said.\n\nThe families of many people in Qatar live abroad, so \"it's going to be so much harder to talk to them\".\n\nAlso in Doha, Youssef Walid, 16, said bans like Australia's were \"a bit harsh\" and hard to enforce.\n\n\"We can use VPN. We can easily bypass the security and easily make new accounts,\" he said.\n\n- Lagos: 'We were born with it' -\n\nAt a Nigerian high school, Mitchelle Okinedo is revising for exams, checking over her hand-written notes. In the classroom -- where phones are banned -- students in uniform sit at separate desks.\n\n\"I see where the (Australian) government is coming from. Students nowadays, they are really distracted,\" Okinedo said.\n\nEven so, \"we were born with it\", the 15-year-old added. \"And I don't think it's something I want to stop.\"\n\nHer mother, 50-year-old event planner Hannah Okinedo, agrees with a social media ban for under-16s, saying most parents \"don't have time to monitor their children all day\".\n\n- Mexico City: 'Express yourself' -\n\nYoung Mexico City resident Aranza Gomez, 11, has had a smartphone with access to social media for one year.\n\nWithout it, \"I would honestly feel sad. I wouldn't really have a good way to spend my time,\" she said.\n\nSantiago Ramirez Rojas, 16, is sitting on a bench in the Tabacalera district, scrolling through posts containing news about Argentina and tour dates for a musician.\n\n\"Social media today is very important for expressing yourself, no matter how old you are,\" said Rojas.\n\nBut \"there are many kidnappings that begin online\" and \"younger kids, around 10 or 12, are much more vulnerable\".\n\n- Sydney: 'Not going to have any impact' -\n\nIn Australia one family has diverging ideas on how the law will go.\n\n\"I don't think the government really knows what they're doing and I don't think it's going to have any impact on children of Australia,\" said 15-year-old Layton Lewis.\n\nBut his mother Emily Lewis hopes it will help children \"have better, more authentic relationships\".\n\n\"They'll make proper plans, like we used to, to meet up with their friends face-to-face and have proper conversations as opposed to these illusive friendships online,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "As midlife audiences turn to digital media, the 55 to 64 age bracket is an increasingly important demographic\n\nIn 2022, Caroline Idiens was on holiday halfway up an Italian mountain when her brother called to tell her to check her Instagram account. “I said, ‘I haven’t got any wifi. And he said: ‘Every time you refresh, it’s adding 500 followers.’ So I had to try to get to the top of the hill with the phone to check for myself.”\n\nA personal trainer from Berkshire who began posting her fitness classes online at the start of lockdown in 2020, Idiens, 53, had already built a respectable following.\n\nBut after one video offering guidance on getting toned summer arms was picked up by a US fitness account, that number rocketed to 50,000 – and beyond. “I post it every year now as a bit of a tribute,” she jokes. “It was that reel that launched me into a whole new market.”\n\nToday, as @carolinescircuits, she has 2.3 million followers on Instagram, more than 70,000 on Tiktok and 50,000 on YouTube, and a book, Fit at 50, that was a recent Sunday Times bestseller – making her a key influencer in an increasingly important demographic for social media platforms: those in midlife and older.\n\nIf you want to grow your reach on social media, figures suggested this week, you could do worse than target the over-55s.\n\nResearch from media analysts Ampere found it was people in the 55 to 64 age bracket who were delivering the highest growth in YouTube traffic, up 20% since 2020 in the US and 14% in the UK. Tiktok, too, has had a 16% rise in British users in this age bracket in the past year.\n\n“We’ve been seeing this trend over the last few years where older audiences who have traditionally [focused on] linear and broadcast TV have been digitising,” says Minal Modha, the head of Ampere’s consumer research division.\n\n“And by getting access to things like smartphones and smart TVs in particular, it’s opening up a whole new world for them.” More than half of US adults in the age bracket now watch influencer videos weekly.\n\nSome of them will be tuning in to Valerie Mackay from Inverness, who as @embracingfifty has gained 312,000 followers on Tiktok and almost 1 million on Instagram since she started her warmly chatty account eight years ago.\n\n“In hindsight, I wouldn’t have picked that name ’cause I’m now 62 and stuck with it. But the point of the name was I was embracing life over 50. I had two children, they had both left home and I was enjoying life with myself and my husband, it was like freedom.”\n\nShe founded her account after overhearing a woman asking what was the point of makeup and style after a certain age. “I just thought, well, what’s the point in life? Just dress and be who you want to be.”\n\nMackay says she tries not to think about the huge numbers watching her from around the world – many of whom share an interest in the Scottish weather.\n\n“I get asked a lot: ‘I’m coming to Scotland, what do I wear?’ Which it’s difficult for me to answer because I might be flitting about in a trench coat and they might need big coats.”\n\nMark Lidster is a 62-year-old from north London who posts videos as FitnessGeezer on YouTube and Instagram, attracting up to 1m views. “There are a lot of guys out there getting to 40, through to 70, 80 – who relate and take inspiration from what I’m doing,” he says.\n\nLike Mackay, Lidster says actively engaging with his audience is crucial. As well as becoming more savvy with tech, he says, “people of that age are feeling more disconnected from society, and getting lonelier. Social media is another way of feeling part of something – I try to create that community feel.”\n\nThe crucial thing with 50-somethings and older is “to keep it genuine”, says Idiens, who is 53.\n\n“The biggest thing about social media in this age bracket is trust,” she says.\n\n“It has to be genuine – we are a little bit older and wiser, and what the audience are really looking for are people that they can trust with advice. For the midlife demographic, they also really love that sense of community.\n\n“Even with an audience of 2 million, I still think, when I’m putting up a post, that it’s going to my friends and family group. And the feedback I get is that [my followers] still feel like I’m a PT [personal trainer] in their sitting room – which, for me, is everything. That’s what I want.”",
