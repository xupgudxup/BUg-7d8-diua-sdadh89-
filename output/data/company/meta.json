    "description": "Meta alignment director Summer Yue hooked OpenClaw up to her inbox. Then, the bot tried to delete her emails. Yue chalked it up to a \"rookie mistake.\"",
    "fullText": "Even the people hired to keep AI aligned can't always keep it in line.\n\nMeta's Summer Yue has been testing OpenClaw, a popular open-source AI agent capable of working 24/7 on behalf of its users. Then the bot went out of control, according to photos she posted on X. It ended up planning to delete her emails — and wouldn't stop after being directed to.\n\nIn her X post, Yue's OpenClaw bot said that it would \"trash EVERYTHING in inbox older than Feb 15 that isn't already in my keep list.\"\n\nYue tried multiple times to stop it. First, she messaged the AI agent, \"Do not do that.\" As the bot kept planning to delete her inbox, she wrote, \"STOP OPENCLAW.\"\n\n\"I couldn't stop it from my phone,\" Yue wrote in her post. \"I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb.\"\n\nNothing humbles you like telling your OpenClaw “confirm before acting” and watching it speedrun deleting your inbox. I couldn’t stop it from my phone. I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb. pic.twitter.com/XAxyRwPJ5R\n\nYue had previously tried OpenClaw on her \"toy inbox,\" where she wrote that the bot worked well and gained her trust. Testing it on her \"real inbox,\" the bot had to compact a much larger set of emails. She instructed it not to take action without approval, but OpenClaw lost the prompt during compaction, she wrote.\n\nYue joined Meta after its deal with Scale AI as a director of alignment of its Superintelligence Labs division, according to her LinkedIn profile. That's left some critics on social media confused: why would someone studying AI safety use such an AI agent that has previously drawn security concerns?\n\nUnlike other AI agents, OpenClaw does not need human approval to sign off on actions. It was also vibe-coded, and that combined with OpenClaw's level of system access has led some AI researchers to question the bot's security. AI researcher Gary Marcus told Business Insider that it was like \"giving full access to your computer and all your passwords to a guy you met at a bar who says he can help you out.\"\n\nOpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger, who has since been hired by OpenAI, recently said in a podcast interview that he was prioritizing building out additional security safeguards over ease-of-use features.\n\nThough it's not altogether surprising that someone working in AI would test out one of the buzziest AI products of the last year, some X users criticized Yue for hooking up OpenClaw to her real email in the first place. Ben Hylak, the cofounder of Raindrop AI and an Apple alum, posted a screenshot of her LinkedIn. \"This should terrify you,\" he wrote. \"What is Meta doing?\"\n\n\"Somewhat concerning that a person whose job is AI alignment is surprised when an AI doesn't precisely follow verbal instructions,\" another X user wrote.\n\nYou can't make this up. And this happened to a someone working on safety and alignment at META Superintelligence Lab.\n\nI don't get how people can let AI agents go on unsupervised like this.\n\nI'll stick to my supervised use of AI for now. pic.twitter.com/tWvQFd1NP5\n\nYue and Meta didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nYue also isn't the only Meta employee to toy around with OpenClaw; creator Peter Steinberger said that Mark Zuckerberg played with the tool for a week and even sent feedback. While Meta courted him, Steinberger later accepted a job offer from OpenAI.\n\nIn the comments of Yue's post, someone asked about her AI alignment role. \"Were you intentionally testing its guardrails or did you make a rookie mistake?\" they wrote.\n\n\"Rookie mistake tbh,\" Yue responded. \"Turns out alignment researchers aren't immune to misalignment.\"",

    "description": "David Ronca's cancer battle reshaped his career, including at Netflix. He learned to prioritize work-life balance and intentional productivity.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with David Ronca, a retired video systems engineer. He spent 12 years at Netflix and six years at Meta. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy time at a startup in the early years of my engineering career was like a really bad relationship.\n\nI joined a company that specialized in video playback around 2000. I loved working on video. I consider those seven years like going to school, and I came out with a Ph.D. in practical video systems. But it was the hardest seven years I've ever had in terms of work demands.\n\nI was told when I joined that it would be really important that you're seen around here a lot. So I would work until 7, 8, 9 — sometimes until 10 p.m. Then we started hitting delivery schedules, and I was getting to work around 10 in the morning and going home sometimes at 2:30 in the morning. We're talking 14-hours days, six to seven days a week. Eighty hours a week would've been a break.\n\nWe didn't have good direction. We'd be four or five months into solving a hard problem before leadership would stop us and say, \"Go work on this instead.\" It was madness.\n\nWe were using work hours to compensate for really bad decisions.\n\nIn January 2004, I started feeling ill. On a Sunday, I didn't feel so good, and by midweek, I got worse.\n\nOn Friday night, January 17, my wife took me to the emergency room. The doctor told me, \"This is likely colon cancer.\" After the first surgery, he said, \"There's no way you have a tumor like this and it's not cancer.\"\n\nTwo weeks earlier, I had been running and feeling great. Within a week, I was in a hospital bed on machines.\n\nIt took another week before doctors could do the full surgery. And you spend that time with no idea what they're going to find. That was a very dark week.\n\nMy mother died of breast cancer when she was 48. I was 16. Now, I'm in the hospital at 44. I remember thinking, \"History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.\"\n\nMy wife would bring the three kids. My oldest, who was seven, would sit quietly in the room with me. My youngest was two years old. He didn't really know me.\n\nI was looking at my young son, thinking he's going to grow up without a dad.\n\nAfter surgery, they told me it was stage 3 colon cancer. They removed 60% of my colon. There was lymph node metastasis. My five-year survival prognosis was about 25%.\n\nI went back to work part-time at first.\n\nI was told that I had used up all my sick leave and vacation and was put on California disability, which is around $200 a week.\n\nI told my boss, \"I'm sorry, I will not do this. I still want to work here, but if I have to leave, I will quit. Because I will not work like this.\"\n\nFrom that point on, I didn't. And that was the irony of it all.\n\nI feel like I did some of my best engineering after that. The real change was that I was no longer wasting my brainpower and my thinking on junk.\n\nYou don't do good work after 12 hours. You can't work sustained all-nighters and be productive. The quality of your work is going to suck. I don't care who you are. For most mere mortals, you try to work those hours, you're just not going to be doing good work.\n\nI also started making intentional decisions for life, not just work.\n\nI coached soccer for all three of my kids. I went to their games. My daughter did ballet, and we were there all the time. We started planning and taking family vacations — hiking in the mountains, RV road trips, and Maui.\n\nI realized you have to work to have a life, but you have to have a life to work. So you want to stand in the middle of those things.\n\nIn 2007, after several clean scans, I joined Netflix. I delayed accepting the offer until I got my scan report. I didn't want to change jobs yet because if you have positive liver metastasis, you'd be lucky to get two years.\n\nIn my interview, Patty McCord, the chief talent officer at the time, told me, \"We don't value 24/7 work. You won't be successful here working all the time.\"\n\nThat was almost foreign to me. But it also didn't mean we didn't work hard.\n\nAt Netflix, I was part of the early streaming team — maybe 12 to 16 people. We made aggressive schedules, and we didn't miss them. We launched a Netflix app on the original iPad on Day One within two months.\n\nThe culture at the company was: If you have to work 24/7 for us to be successful, you've got a problem, and we've got a problem, and we're going to fix it.\n\nEven at Meta, my favorite poster had a silhouette of a rocking horse that said, \"Don't mistake motion for progress.\"\n\nIn other words, high performance is not measured by how much work you do. It's measured by how impactful your results are.\n\nThis is not to say that it's wrong to work more than eight hours. Instead, you should understand why you're working more hours. It should be intentional. Intentional exceptions.\n\nIf I were to tell my younger self anything, it would be to make work-life balance part of your DNA. Learn to take time off.\n\nDon't wait until you have cancer or some other near-death experience to realize this.",

    "fullText": "Steve Hanke says there's excessive buzz around AI — and it could end badly.\n\nThe veteran trader and economist told Business Insider by email that he agrees with Yann LeCun, Meta's former chief AI scientist and a pioneer in the field, who's warned that large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT just aren't that revolutionary.\n\nHanke quoted a speech by LeCun in the spring of 2024, where he said: \"We're easily fooled into thinking they are intelligent because of their fluency with language, but really, their understanding of reality is very superficial.\"\n\nLeCun added that the chatbots have their uses but \"on the path towards human-level intelligence, an LLM is basically an off-ramp, a distraction, a dead end.\"\n\nHanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, said he's \"on LeCun's side of the court\" and considers AI to be \"overhyped and potentially dangerous.\"\n\nHe told Business Insider last October that whether the market's exuberance turned out to be rational or irrational would \"largely depend on whether the AI firms' spectacular revenue forecasts hold water.\"\n\n\"It might be wise to buckle your seat belt,\" he added.\n\nHanke was the president of Toronto Trust Argentina when it was the world's best-performing market mutual fund in 1995. He also served as an economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nDespite some recent jitters, the AI boom seems to be going strong with OpenAI reportedly close to raising north of $100 billion at a potential $850 billion valuation. ChatGPT's maker crossed $20 billion in annualized revenue last year.\n\nThe so-called \"hyperscalers\" racing to build the infrastructure to power the AI boom have forecasted some truly mind-boggling outlays.\n\nMeta, Amazon, and Alphabet recently projected that their capital expenditures for 2026 could reach a combined $520 billion, and Microsoft is also on track to invest more than $100 billion this calendar year.\n\nLeCun recently departed Meta after working at Facebook and Instagram's parent company for more than a decade. He left to found Paris-based AMI Labs and develop open-source AI that could truly comprehend and model the physical world, not just language.\n\nHanke isn't alone in sounding the alarm on the AI boom. Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has warned tech giants are overinvesting in microchips that could quickly become obsolete, and could see disappointing returns.\n\nJeremy Grantham, a bubble guru and GMO's long-term investment strategist, has cautioned that previous transformative technologies, such as railroads and the internet, were marked by initial bubbles that inevitably popped, and he expects the same to happen with AI.\n\nHowever, AI champions from Elon Musk to Sam Altman have predicted the tech will supercharge productivity and generate huge profits, so the run-up in valuations is more than justified.",

    "title": "Meta Is Taking VR Out of 'Horizon Worlds'",
    "description": "But where will all the legless avatars go?",
    "fullText": "Meta just announced a seismic change to its 3D social platform Horizon Worlds. The company is removing Meta Quest users to focus on mobile users. So Horizon Worlds, originally a VR-only platform, now a mix of both VR users and mobile users, will become a mobile-only platform in the near future. In a blog post aimed at developers, Samantha Ryan, VP of Content at Meta's Reality Labs, said the company is \"separating our Quest VR platform from our Worlds platform in order to create more space for both products to grow.\"\n\n\"We’re doubling down on the VR developer ecosystem while shifting the focus of Worlds to be almost exclusively mobile. By breaking things down into two distinct platforms, we’ll be better able to clearly focus on each,\" Ryan wrote.\n\nAnnounced in 2019 as a \"social VR world\" called Facebook Horizon, the platform was renamed Horizon Worlds two years later and was an integral part of Meta's vision of a future \"Metaverse,\" but Worlds never really caught on with users. Despite the money Facebook/Meta clearly devoted to the platform, its monthly user count was only around 200,000 in 2022.\n\nAccording to Ryan, 86% of time people spend in their VR headsets is spent with third-party apps, so it's not surprising that Meta would pull back from first-party VR. Last month, the company shuttered its three AAA VR game development companies, stopped updating its first-party subscription-based fitness app Supernatural, and laid off around 10% of its Reality Labs division. Ryan says Meta will continue supporting third-party VR developers and releasing hardware, promising the company has \"robust roadmap of future VR headsets\" tailored to \"different audience segments\" on tap, but offered no specific details as yet.\n\nWhile the change marks a definitive end to Horizon Worlds as a VR-first destination, the company plans to leverage the massive user base of Meta's Instagram and Facebook to make Worlds competitive with social platforms like Roblox. The company reports 4x growth in Horizon mobile users in 2025.\"We’re in a strong position to deliver synchronous social games at scale,\" Ryan wrote.\n\nThere are around five billion smart phone users worldwide, all potential customers to Worlds, compared to an estimated 20-30 million Quest users, so the math definitely makes sense in terms of growing a platform and stock price, but it's sad for the (relatively few) people who have found a home on Horizon Worlds. They'll be able to use mobile platform, but it isn't the same: the sense of scale and engagement can't be replicated on a small, 2D screen. I recently spent a lot of time looking for life in the VR version of Worlds, and it's a unique place, an undiscovered country where strange little communities have taken up residence in a massive, deserted shopping mall. If you can, strap on a headset and poke around a little before the plug is pulled.",

    "fullText": "Meta is dialing back the metaverse to mean something far less futuristic: an app on your phone.\n\nThe company, which spent billions of dollars to build Horizon Worlds — an immersive, virtual hangout zone on its Quest virtual reality headsets — is \"shifting focus\" for Horizon Worlds \"to be almost exclusively mobile,\" according to a blog post published on Thursday.\n\nHorizon Worlds is part of Meta's Reality Labs division for VR products and smart glasses, a unit that has burned nearly $80 billion since 2020.\n\n\"Last year, we began to experiment with Worlds as a mobile platform, and we saw positive momentum,\" wrote Samantha Ryan, Meta's vice president of content at Reality Labs. \"Now, to truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we're going all-in on mobile.\"\n\nThe move signals how dramatically Meta has redrawn its VR ambitions.\n\nLast month, Meta laid off roughly 10% of Reality Labs employees, closed three VR gaming studios it owned, and stopped releasing new content for Supernatural, a popular VR fitness app it acquired in 2023.\n\nMeta said it is still committed to virtual reality hardware and supporting third-party developers who create games for it.\n\n\"We're in it for the long haul,\" Ryan wrote, and pointed to the company's \"robust roadmap of future VR headsets tailored to different audience segments.\"\n\nMeta invested nearly $150 million in VR developer platforms in 2025, Ryan wrote, and she said that popular games like \"The Thrill of the Fight 2,\" \"Hard Bullet,\" and \"UG\" had earned \"millions\" in revenue.\n\nStill, she wrote that 86% of the time people spend in Meta's headsets is in third-party apps, not its own. The pivot to mobile effectively pits Horizon Worlds against entrenched competitors like Roblox and Fortnite that cater to casual mobile gamers rather than VR enthusiasts with headsets.\n\nOn Meta's latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg pitched Horizon as the natural home for \"immersive 3D\" content: AI-generated scenes, objects, and mini experiences. Now, rather than putting on a headset, people could just spin up that content with a prompt and then share it straight into Instagram, Facebook, or Threads, he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Great: more stuff I'll lose.",
    "fullText": "The next generation of Meta's Display smart glasses might come with a smart watch. According to a report from The Information, Meta's watch, codenamed Malibu 2, could feature fitness tracking features and AI, but its real purpose is to replace the Display's neural band and act as controller for the smart glasses. If the reports are accurate, Meta Display smart glasses with a smart watch could be available in 2026.\n\nThere aren't any other details on the smart watch, so we don't know the price or what features it may have—but I'd be surprised if this rumor doesn't pan out eventually. Meta has discussed the idea of a smart watch before, and it makes sense: If you're going to have a wrist-controller for your glasses, why not give it smart watch features as well? Especially if a glasses-and-watch combo potentially gives users a reason to switch away from their Apple Watches.\n\nSpeaking of Apple, if the rumors about the company are true, Apple is pushing to release its own suite of AI-powered wearable devices. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple could roll out smart glasses in early 2027. The company is also reportedly developing an AI-powered pendant that can \"be pinned to a shirt or worn as a necklace,\" as well as AirPods with expanded AI capabilities. The AirPods and pendant will be equipped with cameras designed to \"help the AI work\" as opposed to taking photos. Apple's smart glasses will reportedly not feature a display, but will feature a higher end camera and superior build quality to Meta's smart glasses. All of Apple's devices are reportedly designed to work with iPhones.\n\nNone of this is confirmed, of course. The closest Apple has come to announcing these plans is CEO Tim Cook mentioning “categories of products” enabled by artificial intelligence at an all-hands meeting. However, everything points to Meta and Apple betting that consumers want a collection of connected AI-wearables. Each company is taking a different approach to hooking users into their ecosystem. Apple seems to be betting on devices integrated with iPhones and controlled with the kind of camera-based tech that powers the Apple Vision Pro headset. Meta seems to be aiming at replacing phones with an in-glasses display, and a biometric control scheme that works with muscle movements, like the existing neural band.\n\nBoth Meta and Apple seem to be competing to go beyond a screen or smart glasses to become the next interface for your life—but do people want that? Are consumers excited enough by the prospect of always-available AI and tied-together devices to buy them? That's the big question, and the answer is anything but certain. Both Apple and Meta have made big bets on virtual reality, and, despite both companies' VR devices being excellent, neither seems to have captured the market in way these firms would have liked. So, as they say, stay tuned.",

Tennessee, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Texas are now considered the top emerging markets for data centers.\n\nTexas alone has 6.5 gigawatts of data center capacity under construction.\n\nThat amount of power is roughly equivalent to more than three Hoover Dams or over 17,000 Tesla Model 3s when using the US Department of Energy's standard, and it accounts for about one-fifth of the 35 gigawatts of data center capacity the US added to its pipeline.\n\nThat 35 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of the UK or Italy, and adding it would nearly double the existing data center capacity in the US, according to JLL.\n\nPart of Texas's appeal is its sprawl.\n\nThe state houses some of the most ambitious data center projects in the country. Oracle and OpenAI's flagship Stargate data center is in Abilene, Google is planning a $40 billion expansion in West Texas, and Meta is building a massive new site in El Paso, just to name a few.\n\nTexas also has abundant energy resources, which is good news for data center developers. The AI boom has driven electricity demand to new heights and strained the nation's power grid. In Texas, several data centers — including Stargate — are being built alongside on-site power plants.\n\nNorthern Virginia has been the data center industry's central hub for more than 15 years, going back to the early days of cloud computing. That has changed rapidly as Big Tech spreads out across the country in search of available power, cheap land, and the best tax incentive packages for the coming wave of AI data centers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "OpenAI just poached the celebrity whisperer Charles Porch away from Instagram. It makes sense when you consider how anti-AI some celebs have been.",
    "fullText": "A \"detriment\" to human creativity, said Vince Gilligan, creator of \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Pluribus\" about AI. \"Horrifying,\" said James Cameron about the possibility of AI actors. \"I'd rather die,\" said Guillermo del Toro. \"Incredibly destructive,\" said Cate Blanchett.\n\nIt's not hard to see why OpenAI recognizes it has a bit of an image problem among some people in Hollywood. It appears that the company is now trying to change that.\n\nOpenAI just poached Charles Porch from Meta, where he oversaw celebrity partnerships for over a decade, as Vanity Fair reported earlier. Porch is generally recognized for helping make Instagram the cultural juggernaut it is today by helping celebrities who might have been confused by or disinterested in newfangled social media join and use the platform.\n\nPorch has deep connections in the entertainment industry — celebrities like Harry Styles attended his lavish wedding this summer in France.\n\nPorch wrote on his personal Instagram about his job change:\n\n\"From helping Beyoncé figure out how to launch an album exclusively on social media to onboarding Pope Francis to Instagram (he held my hands and asked me to pray for him) to watching creators become the next generation of entrepreneurs, the impact on culture that me and the team have been able to have is something that I take great pride in.\"\n\nIt's not clear exactly what Porch's new gig will entail. He told Vanity Fair that his first step will be to go on a \"listening tour\" to hear the hopes and fears about AI from creatives and celebrities. I've asked OpenAI for comment.\n\nFor Hollywood actors, filmmakers, and studio executives, those fears are pretty big. Why wouldn't Brad Pitt be alarmed to see a passably real AI-generated version of himself in a fist-fight against Tom Cruise?\n\nThe idea that AI could replace actors, screenwriters, and other creatives is alarming, especially as Hollywood as an industry is hurting. Box office sales haven't bounced back from the pandemic, streaming is complicated, fewer and fewer projects are being made, and efforts to cut costs by filming overseas have devastated Los Angeles' middle-class of film industry workers.\n\nOn top of that, AI is, as far as I can tell, widely considered a theft machine that gobbled up tons of images and videos from movies and TV for training data, largely without permission or compensation.\n\nYou can see a filmmaker or actor's point of view here: They stole my face and my work to build this tool, and now they want to use it to make soulless slop that will undercut the value of my work?\n\nNot great! I imagine Porch has his work cut out for him.\n\nOpenAI and other AI companies have started making deals with Hollywood. Disney made a $1 billion deal with OpenAI around the time Sora 2 launched, licensing Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Darth Vader, and also becoming a customer and investor in OpenAI. Lionsgate and AMC made deals allowing their catalogs to be used for training Runway. (Business Insider, through our parent company, has a somewhat similar deal with OpenAI.)\n\nBut those deals with studios, while they might stave off copyright lawsuits and create some cash flow, aren't winning over the hearts and minds of the celebrities and creatives — the kinds of people who make headlines when they call AI \"horrifying.\"\n\nPerhaps OpenAI is realizing that celebrities still hold the kind of cultural capital that can't be built in the Bay Area. And while OpenAI has been pretty successful in pushing its agenda in Washington, thanks to an AI-friendly administration, it still has an uphill battle to win over the general public, which remains fairly skeptical of AI.\n\nAnd for that, you need to get the celebs on board. There's a beautiful irony now that these big AI companies are paying big bucks to hire human writers, and VCs are now obsessed with the concept of \"taste.\"\n\nIt turns out that kinds of \"soft skills\" that had long been undervalued in Silicon Valley are more relevant than ever now that AI can do a lot of the technical work. And someone like Charles Porch, who has the connections and ability to charm a roomful of Hollywood types and other cultural elites, is more valuable than ever. That's the kind of job AI can't take.",

    "description": "Meta's shift to AI builders is redefining roles, as product managers adopt AI coding tools for increased productivity and innovation.",
    "fullText": "Meta product managers are rebranding. Some are now calling themselves \"AI builders,\" a signal that AI coding tools are changing who gets to build software inside the company.\n\nOne of them, Jeremie Guedj, announced the change in a LinkedIn post last week. \"I still can't believe I'm writing this: as of today, my full-time job at Meta is AI Builder,\" he wrote.\n\nGuedj has spent more than a decade as a traditional product manager, a role that sets the road map and strategy for products then built by engineering teams. He said that while his title in Meta's internal systems still lists him as a product manager, his actual work is now full-time building with AI on what he calls an \"AI-native team.\"\n\nAnother Meta product manager also lists \"AI Builder\" on her LinkedIn profile, while at least two other Meta engineers write the term in their bios, Business Insider found.\n\nThe shift aligns with a message CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed on Meta's most recent earnings call: 2026 is when AI tools would meaningfully reshape how work gets done inside the company. AI coding tools have already shaken up the tech industry, allowing more people with fewer technical skills to build apps from scratch.\n\n\"We're investing in AI-native tooling, so individuals at Meta can get more done,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We're elevating individual contributors and flattening teams. We're starting to see projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single very talented person.\"\n\nGuedj's role reads like a practical expression of that vision. In his post, he described his team as one \"where data and knowledge are AI-friendly at their core, and where humans and AI agents work together, synchronously and asynchronously.\"\n\nMeta did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\n\"AI builder\" isn't a formal Meta designation, at least not yet. Guedj acknowledged it isn't his official title.\n\nOne Meta employee who wished to stay anonymous because they weren't authorized to speak to the press said that the label is not an official role and is more likely an experiment within a specific organization as Meta pushes toward AI-native teams across the company. Reality Labs, Meta's division responsible for its smart glasses and virtual reality efforts, is one of those organizations, this person said.\n\n\"Software engineers are becoming product managers and product managers becoming software engineers,\" they added. \"The idea is to make individual contributors more productive.\"\n\nInside Meta, the drift from coordinator to builder has been visible for months. In November, Joseph Spisak, a product director in Meta's Superintelligence Labs, said that product managers at the company were vibe-coding prototypes and showing them directly to Zuckerberg.\n\n\"We can literally vibe code products in a matter of hours, days, and explore the space,\" Spisak said.\n\nIn January, another Meta product manager, Zevi Arnovitz, said on a podcast that using AI coding tools felt like being handed \"superpowers.\" Arnovitz, who said he has no technical background, described rebuilding his workflow around AI — operating less like a conductor moving work between engineering and design and more like a product owner who can execute.\n\nSome companies are moving beyond experimentation. In December, LinkedIn scrapped its long-running associate product manager program and replaced it with an associate product builder track.\n\nTomer Cohen, LinkedIn's chief product officer at the time, said on a podcast that the company wanted to train new hires who can code, design, and manage products — people \"who can flex across\" traditional role boundaries.\n\nLast year, Madhu Gurumurthy, the company's product head for AI models, tweeted that the company was moving to a \"building-first\" culture. In an age of vibe-coding, Gurumurthy said, product managers can show, not tell. \"Role profiles are blurring, creativity and building are happening in parallel,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Each company is approaching this differently and is still figuring this out,\" one product manager at Google, who wished to stay anonymous, told Business Insider. \"I've been encouraging designers and product managers on my team to blur roles a bit.\"\n\nAs Guedj, the self-proclaimed Meta AI builder, put it: \"Building has always been my passion. AI gave me the ability to turn ideas into real, working apps. That changed everything.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact Pranav Dixit via email at pranavdixit@protonmail.com or Signal at 1-408-905-9124.

    "description": "OpenAI and Meta alum Philip Su said that AI was turning software engineers into managers. The IC role is \"dead,\" he wrote.",
    "fullText": "Use AI at work? You might be a manager and not even know it.\n\nPhilip Su is on the frontline of AI. He worked at OpenAI until 2025, when he left to found his startup, Superphonic. Before that, he worked at Microsoft and Meta.\n\nIn January, Su made a provocative claim on Substack: \"AI Killed the Individual Contributor.\"\n\nSu wrote that software engineers are asked to perform tasks once reserved for managers: set priorities, resolve conflicts, and give feedback. Rather than building, they're spending time \"pondering and tweaking the machine that builds the thing.\"\n\n\"The halcyon days of the IC are over,\" Su wrote. \"Not because AI codes better than you, but because maximizing your productivity necessitates focusing your time on all the things that are, at the end of the day, manager tasks.\"\n\nSu doubled down this week on the podcast \"A Life Engineered.\" He said the IC role was \"probably over\" because engineers were delegating their work to AI.\n\nIf everyone's a manager (of AI), do we need managers (of humans) anymore? Su said yes. There's a \"human coordination problem\" that AI cannot solve, he said.\n\nSu's theory of managerial takeover comes amid the \"great flattening\" in Big Tech. Flat org charts are all the rage: few managers, many ICs. Elon Musk's companies are known for their lack of managers; Amazon and Meta have recently culled management layers as they aim to increase their IC-to-manager ratios.\n\nMeanwhile, tech CEOs are also embracing \"founder mode.\" The reviled opposite of that, according to Paul Graham's 2024 essay, is \"manager mode.\"\n\nBut maybe managers are back en vogue — so long as they're managing AI agents. Vercel COO Jeanne DeWitt Grosser told Business Insider that companies will see a new role: the \"agent manager.\"\n\nThe tools will get better, too. Su already finds that he has to review AI-written code \"less carefully\" than he used to.\n\n\"It might currently feel like managing a team of barely-competent interns,\" he wrote in his essay. \"It'll soon feel like managing a team of very high performers, each better, faster, and smarter than you.\"",

    "fullText": "Meta chief says it has improved identifying underage users but adds ‘I always wish we could have gotten there sooner’\n\nThe Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, testified at a landmark trial of social media companies on Wednesday. Plaintiffs’ lawyers grilled Zuckerberg about internal complaints that not enough was being done to verify whether children under 13 were using the platform.\n\nZuckerberg claimed Meta had improved in identifying underage users but also said: “I always wish that we could have gotten there sooner.”\n\nZuckerberg also said some users lie about their age when joining Instagram and that the company removes those it identifies as underage. The plaintiffs’ lawyers hit back at those claims: “You expect a nine-year-old to read all of the fine print? That’s your basis for swearing under oath that children under 13 are not allowed?” After repeated questioning about age verification, Zuckerberg said: “I don’t see why this is so complicated.”\n\nIn response to questioning by the plaintiffs’ attorney, Zuckerberg also said: “I think a reasonable company should try to help the people that use its services.”\n\nAsked about media training and his famously stiff responses to public questioning: he said: “I think I’m actually well-known to be sort of bad at this.”\n\nThe Meta chief was flanked by people wearing the Meta Ray-Ban artificial intelligence glasses, and the judge in the courtroom threatened to hold anyone recording with the devices in contempt.\n\nWhen he arrived at court, Zuckerberg was asked by a security guard at a metal detector if he had any metal on him. “I have a gold chain on,” he responded, according to the New York Post.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs, who argue that Meta intentionally designed its social media platforms to be addictive, questioned Zuckerberg about whether he knew of harms his company’s products could inflict on young people’s mental health. The plaintiffs have already made public internal documents they say prove their point.\n\nThis is the first time Zuckerberg has addressed concerns about child safety before a jury at trial. Tech companies have long relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for content posted by users, but the plaintiffs’ novel argument – which is focused on harmful design and not individual actors – has so far sidestepped this defense.\n\nThe initial trial in Los Angeles focuses on a 20-year-old woman, known as KGM, who says her compulsive use of YouTube and Instagram worsened her depression and suicidal thoughts. KGM’s case is one of about 20 “bellwether” cases – designed to be test cases to gauge a jury’s reaction. TikTok and Snap settled in the initial trial but will still be defendants in hundreds of other cases.\n\nZuckerberg’s testimony comes about a week after Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri spoke on the witness stand. Mosseri pushed back on the science behind social media addiction by denying users could be “clinically addicted”. He described children’s high usage of Instagram as “problematic use” – similar to “watching TV for longer than you feel good about”. Psychologists do not classify social media addiction as an official diagnosis, but many researchers have documented the harmful consequences of compulsive use among young people, and lawmakers around the world are worried about its addictive potential.\n\nPaul Schmidt, one of Meta’s attorneys, previously said in his opening statement that the company acknowledged KGM’s mental health issues but disputed that Instagram played a significant role in exacerbating them. He cited medical records to suggest the primary issue was a difficult home life.\n\nTwo years ago, Zuckerberg fielded similar questions in a heated congressional hearing about child exploitation. In January 2024, Zuckerberg turned directly towards grieving parents on the Senate floor to apologize, promising to continue investments to protect children. Those families were not convinced that Meta would make meaningful progress, and still aren’t; they are hoping the courts can provide more relief. These trials could eventually result in large payouts from tech companies and changes in the way social media platforms are designed.\n\n“His apology – if you will call it that – was mostly empty,” said John DeMay, who was present in the Senate hearing room in 2024. DeMay’s son, Jordan, was 17 when he died by suicide in 2022, hours after being targeted in an online sextortion scam on Instagram. “He basically said they’re doing everything they can to stop and prevent this stuff from happening and unfortunately that’s just not the case.”\n\nIn the two years since, DeMay has visited Capitol Hill frequently to advocate for online child safety – but has been frustrated by the lack of progress. DeMay’s lawsuit is one of the many cases that will be considered as part of a judicial council coordination proceeding. He has more faith in the courts than Congress, and has previously attended hearings in the current trial, although he was following Wednesday’s proceedings from his home in Michigan.\n\n“I’m hopeful that this case prevails but if it doesn’t, we still won because we showed the world – with on the record evidence – that they’re doing one thing and saying another,” DeMay said.\n\nMeta is also involved in separate litigation in New Mexico, where prosecutors accuse the company of violating the state’s consumer protection laws; Meta failed to disclose what it knew about how its social media platforms could harm children, they say. Meta has denied those claims.\n\nInstagram has, in recent years, added some safety features aimed at its young users. But a 2025 review of these tools by Fairplay – a non-profit that advocates for reducing the influence of big tech on children – found “that less than one in five are fully functional and two-thirds (64%) are either substantially ineffective or no longer exist”.\n\nSome former Meta employees have said that the company has been dismissive of warnings around child safety. Kelly Stonelake left Meta on medical leave, in February 2023, after she faced harassment and retaliation for raising such concerns, she says. Stonelake sued Meta last year over the issue, and also alleged a toxic pattern of silencing women.\n\nShe alleges Meta was collecting data on kids without parental consent and exposing them to other adults and “an environment that we knew was riddled with harassment and bullying”.",

    "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a landmark trial about social media addiction. Parents who attended hope the 'tide will turn' against Big Tech.",
    "fullText": "Lori Schott, a mother from rural Colorado, said she stared down Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg as he walked into court in Los Angeles on Wednesday to testify in a landmark trial regarding social media addiction.\n\nSchott lost her 18-year-old daughter, Annalee, to suicide in 2020. She believes the content Annalee saw on social media platforms \"destroyed\" her mental health.\n\n\"I made eye contact with him for quite a long time,\" Schott said of Zuckerberg. \"I was not backing down.\"\n\nSchott is not a plaintiff in the case where Zuckerberg testified on Wednesday, but is among more than 2,000 individuals who have similar personal injury lawsuits pending regarding social media addiction and harm.\n\nThe case underway in Los Angeles centers on a 20-year-old woman, identified by the initials KGM, who says her use of social media throughout her childhood negatively affected her mental health, contributing to depression and suicidal thoughts. It is considered a bellwether trial that could indicate how other similar lawsuits related to social media harm, like Schott's, could play out.\n\nMeta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, was named as a defendant alongside Google-owned YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat. TikTok and Snapchat both settled the lawsuit out of court.\n\nLast month, Meta warned investors that its mounting legal battles over youth safety could \"significantly impact\" its 2026 financial results. Attorneys for more than 100,000 individual arbitration claimants have \"sent mass arbitration demands relating to 'social media addiction'\" since late 2024, the company said in a 2026 10-K, which warned that potential damages in certain cases could reach into the \"high tens of billions of dollars.\"\n\nIn a statement, Stephanie Otway, a Meta spokesperson, said: \"We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.\" Otway highlighted changes the company has made over the past decade, including Teen Accounts, which give parents tools to manage their teens' accounts.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. A Snapchat spokesperson said in a statement: \"The Parties are pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, parents showed up hours before the courthouse opened in hopes of getting a seat inside. Many of them had personal stories about how they believed social media use harmed their children.\n\n\"We face a lot of stigma from people telling us we're bad parents,\" said Amy Neville, another parent who attended to show her support. She said that once the evidence comes out in the trial, she believes \"the tide will turn, and the general public will be on board with us.\"\n\n\"It is by design that social media is tearing their family apart,\" Neville said.\n\nOn the stand, Zuckerberg said that teens represent less than 1% of Meta's ad revenue and that most teens don't have disposable income, so it's not especially valuable to advertisers to reach them.\n\nZuckerberg said it's in Meta's best interest to create a platform that inspires people and makes them want to stick around for the long term.\n\n\"If people aren't happy with a service, eventually over time they'll stop using it and use something better,\" he said.\n\nSarah Gardner said that regardless of the outcome of the trial, she hopes it raises awareness about how the social media companies, and specifically Zuckerberg, have been operating. Gardner is the CEO of the Heat Initiative, an advocacy group that pressures Big Tech companies to make their platforms safer for kids. She was at the courthouse with the parents who believe they have been affected.\n\nGardner said she's hopeful the trial will empower more people to say, \"I don't want to be on Instagram anymore.\"",

    "fullText": "As Mark Zuckerberg was ushered into the Los Angeles Superior Court early on Wednesday morning, one accessory in his entourage stood out: Meta Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nZuckerberg, wearing a navy blue suit and tie, arrived without any glasses. Flanking either side of him as he walked up to the courthouse were longtime executive assistant Andrea Besmehn and an unidentified man donning Meta's Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nMeta declined to comment about the accessory choice.\n\nAI-powered smart glasses weren't just a hot accessory in the California sun. They were a hot topic inside the courtroom.\n\nThe judge presiding over the trial announced that anyone using glasses to record inside the courtroom would be \"held in contempt of the court,\" according to CNBC.\n\nThis isn't the first trial where Meta's glasses have caused issues.\n\nLast year, while Meta battled the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust allegations, New York Times reporter Mike Isaac posted on X (formerly Twitter) that he had been reprimanded by the court for wearing Meta Ray-Bans.\n\ndo not wear camera glasses in federal buildings folks 😞\n\nThe glasses cameo came as Zuckerberg took the stand in a Los Angeles trial accusing major social media companies of building addictive products that harm young users. The case centers on a now-20-year-old plaintiff, identified in court filings as \"KGM,\" who alleged that Instagram and YouTube worsened her depression and suicidal thoughts after she started using the apps as a child. TikTok and Snap have already settled, leaving Meta and Google's YouTube as the remaining defendants in the trial, which could shape similar lawsuits nationwide.\n\nThe trial underway in Los Angeles is focused on design features that plaintiffs say keep teens scrolling. Zuckerberg's testimony follows an earlier appearance from Instagram chief Adam Mosseri.\n\nMeta's Ray Ban smart glasses have become a surprise hit. On the company's earnings call last month, Zuckerberg said that sales of the glasses more than tripled in 2025, and compared the moment to the shift from flip phones to smartphones.\n\nMeta has increasingly positioned the glasses as a vehicle for its AI ambitions. In addition to taking pictures and playing music, users can ask questions to Meta AI, Meta's AI assistant, about anything that they're looking at through the glasses.\n\nLast week, the New York Times reported that Meta is planning to add facial recognition technology to the glasses.",

    "description": "Meta is deepening its ties to Nvidia in a move that could further pressure Intel and AMD, even as AI demand remains strong.",
    "fullText": "Meta is doubling down on its relationship with Nvidia in what the AI chip giant called a \"multigenerational\" deal.\n\nThe agreement, announced Tuesday, calls for Meta to build data centers powered by millions of Nvidia's current and next-generation chips for AI training and inference.\n\nThe move underscores how Meta is deepening its reliance on Nvidia, even as the social networking giant develops its own in-house chips and works with competing suppliers like AMD. Reports also suggested Meta has explored using TPUs — chips designed by its rival, Google.\n\nThe Nvidia deal could cool speculation around Meta's purported TPU talks, said Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy — though Big Tech companies often test several suppliers at the same time.\n\nThe deal arrives amid increased competition in AI infrastructure. While Nvidia leads the market, rivals including Google, AMD, and Broadcom are working to chip away at its dominance.\n\nCrucially, the partnership will see Meta deploy not only Nvidia's GPUs, but also CPUs.\n\nCPUs, long dominated by Intel and AMD, are the central processors that work with GPUs inside data centers. They're used for general computing tasks and are core to essentially all modern computing systems, whereas GPUs are used in specialized cases that require more compute power, such as AI training and graphics in gaming. By supplying both, Nvidia stands to capture even more spend and deepen its role within Meta's AI stack.\n\nWhile that increases competitive pressure, Moorhead said the demand for infrastructure has become so high that Nvidia's rivals will unlikely see outright declines in the near term.\n\nNvidia has been making its CPU ambitions more explicit, Moorhead said, including marketing its forthcoming Vera CPU as a stand-alone product. This emphasis reflects how CPUs play a larger role as AI workloads move beyond model training and toward inference.\n\n\"CPUs tend to be cheaper and a bit more power-efficient for inference,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at Enderle Group.\n\nBoth Moorhead and Enderle said that Meta's decision to source both GPUs and CPUs from a single vendor can also reduce complexity, with chief information officers often favoring a \"one-throat-to-choke\" approach to problem resolution.\n\nIn addition to GPUs and CPUs, Meta will use Nvidia's networking equipment inside data centers as part of the deal, as well as its confidential computing technology to run AI features within WhatsApp.\n\nThe companies will also work together to deploy Nvidia's next-generation Vera CPUs beyond the current Grace CPU model, Nvidia said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Meta is weighing facial recognition for its Ray-Ban smart glasses, raising serious privacy concerns.",
    "fullText": "According to a New York Times report, Meta plans to add facial recognition technology to its Ray-Ban and Oakley smart glasses. The feature, called “Name Tag” within Meta, would allow users to identify people and get information about them through Meta's AI. The feature could be rolling out as early as this year.\n\nAdding the feature is not a done deal, however. According to an internal document cited by The Times, the company is weighing the “safety and privacy risks\" of introducing facial recognition as well as discussing how to navigate the response to a no-doubt controversial feature.\n\nA document quoted by The Times suggests Meta is deliberately timing a potential rollout to minimize scrutiny. “We will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns,” the document from Meta’s Reality Labs reads.\n\nThis would not be the first time Meta dabbled in facial recognition. Meta debated adding facial recognition to the first generation of its Ray-Ban smart glasses in 2021, but decided against it due to privacy concerns. And Facebook, Meta's social media platform, identified and tagged people as early as 2010, but the company pulled the feature in 2021, citing \"many concerns about the place of facial recognition technology in society.”\n\nConcerns also include the risk of doxxing. The ACLU characterized facial recognition used by law enforcement as a \"systematic invasion of privacy,\" though personal use of the technology raises different issues. Facial recognition glasses could enable instant doxxing, linking anyone's face to publicly available information, including social media profiles, addresses, and phone numbers.\n\nMeta says it isn't planning to release a universal facial recognition tool. The company is considering glasses that identify only people a user knows based on their connection on a Meta platform, or only identify people who have a public account on a Meta site like Instagram. \"While we frequently hear about the interest in this type of feature—and some products already exist in the market—we’re still thinking through options and will take a thoughtful approach if and before we roll anything out,\" Meta said in a statement.\n\nPrivacy concerns aside, the technology has genuinely beneficial applications, particularly to people with vision problems. According to The Times' report, Meta originally planned to introduce Name Tag to attendees of a conference for the blind before releasing it to the public, highlighting a group that could potentially benefit from facial recognition technology, though that plan was scrapped for unknown reasons.\n\nMike Buckley, CEO of Be My Eyes, an accessibility technology company that works closely with Meta, said he has been in discussions with Meta about facial recognition glasses for more than a year. “It is so important and powerful for this group of humans,” Buckley told The Times.",

    "fullText": "Earlier this year, domestic violence allegations against Chiefs receiver Rashee Rice surfaced on Instagram. New allegations have emerged against Rice in a lawsuit that was initiated earlier this week.\n\nVia James Newell of The Athletic, the civil complaint filed Monday in Dallas County District Court includes the following contentions: \"Defendant Rashee Rice and Plaintiff Dacoda Jones lived together. Following an escalation in violent behavior, in December, 2023, Defendant Rashee Rice strangled Plaintiff Dacoda Joans [sic] at their shared home in Victory Park, Texas. Defendant Rashee Rice continued to repeatedly assaulted Dacoda Jones over the course of their relationship through July, 2025. Defendant Rice has grabbed, choked, strangled, pushed, thrown, scratched, hit, and headbutted Ms. Jones, as well as hit her with inanimate objects. Additionally, he has engaged in other violent and abusive behaviors towards Ms. Jones, including throwing objects, destroying property, punching walls, and breaking furniture, as well as locking her out in the middle of the night. Many of these behaviors occurred while Ms. Jones was pregnant.\"\n\nThe league previously commenced a review based on the allegations from Instagram. The league undoubtedly will expand the investigation to include the claims made in the new lawsuit.\n\nRice served a six-game suspension to start the 2025 season, following a guilty plea to a March 2024 street-racing incident. His history could result in enhanced penalties, if the league finds he violated the Personal Conduct Policy again.\n\nThe situation also potentially impacts Rice's probation resulting from the street-racing incident. The agreement was announced in July; if any potential abuse occurred after the five-year period of probation commenced, he could face an argument that he violated the terms of his probation.",

    "title": "OpenAI, Meta, and Apple's latest battle: Breaking your phone addiction",
    "description": "The tech companies that created our phone addiction are trying to cure us with AI wearables.",
    "fullText": "The average American picks up their phone more than 200 times a day. Teens are pinged with some 250 notifications a day — during school, after school, and overnight. The apps meant to prevent you from checking apps have done little to stop the problem. Now, some of the tech companies that helped create our screen dependence are trying to disrupt it.\n\nLater this year, OpenAI plans to debut a small, screenless device that Sam Altman describes as more \"peaceful\" than a smartphone. Apple, the Oz of screentime, is developing smart glasses, a pin, and AirPods with more AI built in, according to a Tuesday report from Bloomberg, with the rumored pendants featuring microphones and cameras to be the \"eyes and ears\" of the iPhone. Meta has teased its fully augmented reality Orion glasses since 2024. While that device doesn't have a release date, the company last year sold some 7 million pairs of its smart glasses, which is the start of the post-smartphone future Mark Zuckerberg has predicted. Eventual smart specs could be more screen all-the-time than screenless, but they also rely on AI to make the experience much more hands-free than swiping and scrolling on a phone.\n\nCould AI be what finally breaks our phone addiction?\n\nSince 2007, no device out of Silicon Valley has captured universal imagination the way Steve Jobs did when he put your iPod, your phone, and the internet together on a 3.5-inch screen. Competitors have tried for a decade-plus to get people to shift us from the iPhone to smart glasses, and largely failed. The awe around smartphones has turned to derision, as excessive screen time is linked to disrupted sleep, anxiety, and fractured attention. Now, developers are hoping the AI boom can give us the next big thing.\n\nBeating the smartphone would mean replacing a device that 91% of American adults now carry — a device for which millions of apps have been developed and people now depend on in lieu of wallets and cameras and health monitors. New AI devices can't just copy what smartphones do, says Ramon Llamas, a research director at a technology intelligence firm IDC: They have to show they have a solution to an everyday problem. If they don't, Llama says, \"these things are just gonna really end up as solutions looking for a problem to solve.\"\n\nCritiques of screen time can be as blunt and smoothbrained as what the critics say excessive screen time makes you. A seven-hour daily log may seem like a staggering amount of dependence, but what did the person spend those seven hours doing? Doomscrolling late into the night, or FaceTiming with a far-away friend? With AI wearables, there's the risk of becoming dependent on the device for different reasons.\n\n\"The screen may not be there, but what's getting filled in the back is already this problem of AI companionship,\" says Olivia Gambelin, an AI ethicist and author of the book \"Responsible AI.\" An AI device designed to do something very specific — like listen to a meeting and then send follow-up emails or messages related to action points discussed — could save people time and keep them from writing tedious emails and Slack messages from their desk. But that same device listening in to personal conversations with family and friends could compromise a relationship, and erode the positive effects that texting a friend to check-in can have on both people (already, my friends are tiring of AI summaries on the iPhone that summarize our group text and become an intermediary into our threads of gossip and jokes in the name of efficiency). Wearing microphones and cameras to social interactions and into businesses is likely to really weird out some of the people around you. More people are entering into romantic, dependent relationships with AI companions, and a swell of loud dissenters are criticizing the technology for taking jobs and attempting to replicate human relationships.\n\nBut OpenAI is betting that it can package its technology in a device in a way that calms the user. \"When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way,\" Altman said in November. OpenAI's device, he said, would be less Time Square, more \"sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm.\" That's because the AI device would learn \"contextual awareness of your whole life,\" and when best to send you alerts.\n\nOther AI wearables have failed by falling short of that goal. Humane AI sold a wearable pin, priced at $700 plus a monthly fee to connect it, but pulled it from the market a year ago. It failed perhaps because it tried too hard to replace our phones — it didn't interact with them, but provided a shoddy replacement. Novelty wasn't a factor that could outshine usability. The AI Friend pendant, which can't search the internet or help with tasks outside of sending reminders and acts instead as an eavesdropping sycophant around its user's neck, was mocked relentlessly and sold just a few thousand devices after it hit the market last year.\n\nCompanies trying to make AI hardware should focus on \"transformative features,\" Jason Low, research director at Omdia, tells me in an email. AI wearables must be more than \"marginally more convenient,\" should integrate with our existing products, and have a clear, stated value. For example, glasses that provide real-time language translation or devices for fitness and health tracking offer features our smartphones can't do as well. The Oura ring continues to grow in popularity, particularly among women after starting out as a niche tech bro buy, for the novel insights it can offer; the company announced last fall it has sold 5.5 million rings since 2015, with more than 2.5 million sold between June 2024 and September 2025. \"These devices often deliver a more polished user experience compared to general-purpose, do-it-all AI devices,\" Low says.\n\nLlamas tells me that the AI functions of a wearable have to be \"contextual, personalized, and actionable,\" like reminding the wearer to send birthday flowers or responding accurately to being asked to direct the user to the nearest Starbucks. A first attempt device shouldn't try to replace the smartphone, but to integrate with the Apple or Google ecosystems, he says. Apple and OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment about their rumored products for this story.\n\nIf anything has hyped Silicon Valley like the iPhone, it's been AI. But three years after the mainstream adoption of ChatGPT, the value generative AI in the white collar workforce has yet to be fully realized. That could make a product for consumers a hard sell, too. \"Some of the overwhelm that's coming with AI that I see in general users is you can use it for everything, or it's promoted that way, which is actually quite stifling,\" Gambelin says.\n\nIn our quest to find a peaceful equilibrium with tech, the screen itself may not be the problem; it's what's summoning us to the screen. Its bright colors, games, and infinite scroll give quick dopamine hits that entice us to stay glued to it. But much of what pings my phone throughout the day are useless notifications trying to get me to reopen one of the dozens of apps — a markdown moment on a clothing thrifting app, a like on the Instagram story I've posted of my dog from my best friend, and ironically, a report of how much time I've already logged. There's a relentless business model at play to keep us on these apps. No screens would mean no infinite scroll through TikTok, no Candy Crush — but app developers and companies may need to find new ways to reach people if wearables caught on, and an always-there AI device and companion might not be as peaceful as Altman describes. Our collective screen time is a problem, but the AI wearable will have to surprise us all with something novel to be useful.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "fullText": "It is unknown whether the Burbank Police Department expected such a reaction to one of its recent Instagram posts, but it sure has taken off.\n\nBPD posted on Feb. 13 a photo of a member of their ranks, Officer Parks, after he encountered a pair of French Bulldogs during a call for service.\n\n“He could not resist petting, holding and snapping a photo with them!” the department said in the post’s caption. “Police officers love dogs.”\n\nWhat started as a routine cute photo-op quickly became something else, however, as social media users flocked to the comment section not to comment on the Frenchies – one being held by Officer Parks and the other appearing to relieve itself behind him – but to comment on Officer Parks himself.\n\nThe post, as of Tuesday morning, sat at over 200,000 likes. For context, the BPD Instagram post before the one with Officer Parks – a job posting – got less than 100. Over 3,000 people commented on the post, mostly on Officer Parks’ looks.\n\nThe most-liked ones were quite creative:\n\n“I just lost my dogs in Burbank requesting Officer Parks’ help,” one person said.\n\n“Is Officer Parks available for a completely professional, absolutely necessary pat-down?” another asked.\n\n“I identify as a dog if Officer park wants to pick me up too,” said a third.\n\nSome even went as far as to accuse themselves of (hopefully) fake crimes in the hopes Officer Parks would respond.\n\n“I stole $2,000 worth of items from Target. I dare you to arrest me I’m in the parking lot by the 3rd light post towards the back next to the black Honda,” a user quipped.\n\n“I committed a crime, please come arrest me,” said another.\n\nSome users opted for other humorous comments.\n\n“Ain’t nobody looking at that cat,” said one person.\n\n“Nah y’all wrong for dropping his name but not his number,” said another.\n\nThe police department clearly noticed the virality, liking some of the comments pertaining to Officer Parks’ looks — including “This cop out here servin’ the people AND servin’ looks!” and “Ooof he has handcuffs” — and another posted by a user who said the comment section had them “in freaking tears.”\n\nIt was not immediately clear what Officer Parks thought of the messages.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Nvidia on Tuesday said it has signed a multiyear deal to sell Meta Platforms millions of its current ‌and future artificial intelligence chips, including central processing units that compete ‌with products from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nNvidia did not disclose a value for the deal, ​but said it includes its current Blackwell chips as well as its forthcoming Rubin AI chips. It also includes standalone installations of its Grace and Vera central processors.\n\nNvidia introduced those central processors, based on technology from Arm Holdings, as companions to its ‌AI chips starting 2023. ⁠But the announcement Tuesday signaled that Nvidia aims to push those chips for emerging fields such as running AI agents as ⁠well as into markets for processors used in workaday technical tasks such as running databases.\n\nNvidia's announcement also comes as Meta is developing its own AI chips and is in ​discussions with ​Google about using that company's Tensor Processing ​Unit chips, or TPUs, for ‌AI work.\n\nIan Buck, the general manager of Nvidia's hyperscale and high-performance computing unit, said that Nvidia's Grace central processors have shown they can use half the power for some common tasks such as running databases, with more gains expected for the next generation, Vera.\n\n\"It actually continues down that path and makes it an ‌excellent data center-only CPU for those high-intensity data ​processing back-end operations,\" Buck said. \"Meta has already had ​a chance to get on ​Vera and run some of those workloads. And the results ‌look very promising.\"\n\nWhile Nvidia has never disclosed ​its sales to ​Meta, it is widely believed to be among four customers that made up 61% of its revenue in its most recent fiscal quarter. Moorhead ​said Nvidia likely highlighted the ‌deal to show that it has retained a large business with ​Meta and is gaining traction with its central processor chips.",

The feature, internally known as “Name Tag,” would allow smart glasses wearers to identify people and get information about them through Meta’s AI assistant.\n\nMeta’s plans could change, the report notes. The tech giant has been deliberating since early last year on how to release a feature that carries “safety and privacy risks.”\n\nAccording to an internal memo, the company had originally planned to release Name Tag to attendees of a conference for the visually impaired before releasing it to the public, but didn’t end up doing that.\n\nMeta reportedly saw the political tumult in the United States as a good time to release the feature.\n\n“We will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns,” the document reads.\n\nMeta considered adding facial recognition technology to the first version of its Ray-Ban smart glasses back in 2021, but dropped the plans over technical challenges and ethical concerns. The NYT reports that the company has revived its plans as the Trump administration has grown closer to Big Tech, and following the unexpected success of its smart glasses.",

    "fullText": "As Gavin Newsom departs, ultra-wealthy flex wealth and influence to fight regulation and keep the boom going\n\nTech billionaires are leveraging tens of millions of dollars to influence California politics in a marked uptick from their previous participation in affairs at the state capitol. Behemoths such as Google and Meta are getting involved in campaigns for November’s elections, as are venture capitalists, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Palantir’s co-founders. The industry’s goals run the gamut – from fighting a billionaire tax to supporting a techie gubernatorial candidate to firing up new, influential super political action committees (Pacs).\n\nThe phenomenon squarely fits the moment for the state’s politics – with 2026 being the year that Politico has dubbed “the big tech flex”.\n\nGavin Newsom, California’s tech-friendly governor who’s been quick to veto legislation that cramps the sector’s unfettered growth, is reaching his term limit. That means Silicon Valley needs to find a new ally. The industry may have found its candidate in an upstart mayor from San Jose, Matt Mahan.\n\nSilicon Valley’s businesses and billionaires – some of the richest and most powerful on earth, most of which are headquartered in California – are in the midst of a massive AI boom. Industry insiders say tech companies need to ensure they can continue to flourish without regulations getting in the way.\n\n“This is a golden opportunity and a golden moment for tech to reset its priorities and its perceptions,” said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University who studies state lobbying.\n\nRather than going all-in on one candidate or issue, McCuan said the tech sector is using a multi-pronged attack in California. Tech billionaires are contributing to campaigns ranging from candidates for governor to local city council and school board races. They are also donating heavily to groups campaigning for relaxed taxation and minimal regulation around AI.\n\n“If you’re an uber-zillionaire, you give money early and often,” McCuan said. “They have more wealth and resources than they’ve ever had before, so that allows them to play on both sides of the aisle and up and down the ballot and across issues like never before.”\n\nUnlike other industries, such as oil and pharma, tech has been relatively tame when it comes to lobbying in the state. The industry has tended to focus on narrow state issues and instead spent big and broad at the federal level (aside from Uber and Lyft’s massive $200m ballot measure campaign in 2020). That ethos has changed. California is now ground zero for tech titans working to become omnipresent in politics.\n\nRobert Singleton, the senior director of policy in California for the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said this moment has been brewing for a long time and it just needed the right thing to set it off.\n\n“The introduction of that billionaire tax obviously galvanized a lot of wealthy individuals who don’t want to see that happen, and who will spend money to make sure it doesn’t happen,” Singleton said. “That tipped them into wanting to get more involved.”\n\nThe “California Billionaire Tax Act”, often referred to simply as the billionaire tax, is a proposal that would require any California resident worth more than $1bn to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state. It’s sponsored by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, and if it receives enough signatures from California voters, it will go to the ballot in November.\n\nWhen the proposal was put forward at the end of last year, many among tech’s billionaire elite threw a tantrum.\n\nSome opened offices or bought mansions in Florida or Texas, vowing to leave California for good. The fleeing rich included Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, whose current net worth is $25bn; Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth around $255bn and $240bn respectively; and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, whose net worth is not publicly known. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, worth $229bn, has also bought a property in south Florida valued between $150 and $200m.\n\nThiel has additionally led the charge in donating to a lobbying group, the California Business Roundtable, which has pledged to fight the wealth tax. The Palantir co-founder handed over $3m to the political action committee in late December. Other major donors include realtors, entrepreneurs and private equity firms. James Siminoff, who founded the camera-embedded Ring doorbell company, also donated $100,000, according to public records.\n\n“The most powerful money in politics is to be on the no-side of a ballot measure,” said McCuan. “You can even pre-empt something getting to the ballot, like a billionaire’s tax, by explaining to everyone out there that this is a bad idea for economic growth.”\n\nTech investors and venture capitalists have been extremely vocal in their opposition to the tax, saying that the state will lose revenue as billionaires flee and it will hurt the state’s ability to be economically competitive.\n\nJust this week, Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive and current venture capital investor, wrote “the loss of this tax revenue was totally avoidable but is now forever”. Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, wrote, “the most successful tech founders of all time have now exited the failed state of California”.\n\nAdding on, Paul Graham, the co-founder of seed capital firm Y Combinator, wrote: “It’s important that people like Zuck and Larry Page are willing to move in response to the proposed wealth tax. It shows politicians what will happen if they try things like this.”\n\nJoining the billionaires, Newsom has pledged to fight the tax, saying it will “drive a race to the bottom” and stifle innovation as the ultra-wealthy leave. “This will be defeated – there’s no question in my mind,” Newsom told the New York Times in January. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nOutcry over taxes is just one of the ways the tech sector is ramping up its influence campaign. Several Super Pacs have popped up over the past few months and tech is injecting these committees with tens of millions.\n\nMcCuan said this strategy is helpful for the ultra-wealthy because it allows them to stay behind the scenes, while donating limitless money.\n\n“You could create some amorphous sounding organization like ‘Californians for All That is Good and Right Under the Sun’,” McCuan said. “And who knows what the hell that is, but that entity becomes the vehicle to which others give money … and it becomes very difficult to unpeel and unfurl what is going on.”\n\nMeta launched two new Super Pacs last fall, which are focused on dialing back AI regulation and supporting AI-friendly candidates. The company contributed $45m to one, the American Technology Excellence Project, which will operate in several states but hasn’t yet established a committee in California. The other, Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across (Meta) California, is state-specific and has received one $20m contribution from Meta.\n\nThe social media giant has also matched Google in infusing a separate Super Pac called California Leads with a total of $10m. Ron Conway, a longtime Democratic tech donor, has also donated $100,000 to this committee, which says it aims to support favorable candidates in the state but will not just focus on issues affecting the tech industry, according to Politico.\n\nThe crypto industry is getting into Super Pacs too, debuting a group called Grow California. The committee opened with $10m from crypto executive Chris Larsen and evangelist Tim Draper. Larsen told the New York Times he plans to give $30m more. The focus of Grow California is to “rebuild a state capital” and shape the state’s legislature.\n\n“We have a group of people who are not acting in a pragmatic way. They’re not looking for balance. They’re completely fucking owned by one side,” Larsen, who’s the chair of crypto company Ripple, told Politico. “So we’re going to work on taking out those people who are not working for the people of California.”\n\nWhile the tech industry is now pushing its influence at the state level, San Francisco has already experienced many of these same tactics at the city level. Backed with Silicon Valley money, several different 501(c)(4) groups formed over the past couple election cycles to throw support behind preferred mayoral and board of supervisor candidates. They also bankrolled successful recall campaigns for a progressive district attorney and members of the school board.\n\nThe California governor’s race has been a crowded field without notable frontrunners. Newsom had been a long-time friend of the tech industry, hosting Google’s Page and Brin as guests at his wedding and referring to Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff as “family”. His departure appears to have Silicon Valley fretting.\n\nSingleton, from the Chamber of Progress, said Newsom had long recognized “how pivotal the technology industry is in California”.\n\nBut then, late last month, Mahan, a moderate Democrat and the mayor of San Jose, announced his candidacy. Before Mahan got involved in politics in 2020, he had a career in the tech sector. He was an undergraduate at Harvard with Zuckerberg, and in 2014 co-founded a startup with funding from Conway, Benioff and Napster co-founder Sean Parker.\n\nMahan appears to be the savior the tech industry had been searching for. Since his candidacy announcement just two weeks ago, millions have poured into his campaign. According to public records, he’s received donations from several venture capitalists, along with Roblox CEO David Baszucki, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, GitHub co-founder Chris Wanstrath, Cloudkitchen co-founder Diego Berdakin, and Ring founder Siminoff.\n\nMahan has even courted donors who helped launch companies known for working with the Trump administration, including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Anduril co-founder Matt Grimm and his wife Kimberly Grimm, according to public records.\n\nGoogle’s Brin has also backed Mahan, maxing out the limit for an individual campaign donation at $78,400. Several of Mahan’s other tech backers also maxed out their donations. At this point, Mahan has now raised more than double the two most prominent democrats in the race, Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.\n\nAs political races and ballot measure campaigns continue to heat up across California in 2026, tech’s influence is only expected to grow.\n\n“It’s going to be a fun session,” Singleton said. That’s for sure.”",

    "fullText": "Meta-backed artificial intelligence training company Scale AI is suing the Department of Defense.\n\nThe nature of the dispute, including what Scale is seeking, is unclear. Most of the documents, including the complaint, were filed on January 30 and are sealed. The lawsuit has not previously been reported.\n\nCase documents are expected to include classified information at the \"secret/no foreign\" level, according to one of the few unsealed documents.\n\nThe US is the only named defendant. Another AI company, Enabled Intelligence, joined as an intervenor defendant — a third party that voluntarily joins a suit to protect their interests.\n\nIn the fall, Scale lost a bid for a contract worth up to $708 million from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, part of the DoD, to Enabled Intelligence. The contract, which could last up to seven years, was the agency's largest data-training agreement yet. It includes work with the Pentagon's signature AI effort, Maven.\n\nIn late December, Scale filed a bid protest with the Government Accountability Office against the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Scale's bid protest was dismissed in late January, two days before the company sued in the Court of Federal Claims. The GAO does not typically publish information on routine protest dismissals.\n\nIn 2024, Scale won a $24 million, one-year contract from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to work on data labeling for Maven.\n\nA Scale spokesperson declined to comment on the DoD lawsuit, saying it \"relates to a recent procurement decision.\"\n\n\"Scale AI stands firmly with Secretary Hegseth and the Department of War in their mission to get frontier AI capabilities into the hands of warfighters. We are committed to ensuring the procurement process reflects the high standards required for our nation's most critical AI initiatives,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAttorneys for Enabled Intelligence and the DoD did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nScale has signed several multimillion-dollar contracts with the DoD since 2020. In March, the startup announced it was working with defense tech startup Anduril and Microsoft to deploy AI agents in the US military under a DoD program called \"Thunderforge.\" In August, Scale announced a $99 million contract to develop AI tools for the Army.\n\nThe company is best known for its data labeling business, which has helped Big Tech clients like Google and Meta improve their AI chatbots. In June, Scale received a $14.3 billion investment from Meta in exchange for a 49% stake in the startup.\n\nScale's former CEO, Alexandr Wang, wrote an open letter to President Donald Trump after his second inauguration, outlining five ways the president could advance AI in his first 100 days. The then-Scale exec wrote that he wanted the US government to emulate tech giants by spending more on data and compute and noted Scale's work with the DoD. Wang, who left Scale to join Meta's Superintelligence Labs as chief AI officer, also attended the president's AI dinner at the White House in September.\n\nSince Meta's investment, Scale has laid off 200 employees, or 14% of its workforce, lost major clients including Google and xAI, and has been battling a swarm of newer entrants trying to poach its clients and workers.",

    "description": "Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses could be equipped with facial recognition, and an internal memo reportedly says we're all too distracted to care.",
    "fullText": "Since Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses launched in 2021, there's always been a lingering, controversial question about whether they could be used for facial recognition.\n\nThe question has surfaced again more recently, according to a New York Times report on Friday. And this time, the story says, there's a reason the company thinks it could add facial recognition without kicking up too much of a fuss: because we're all busy worried about so many other things going on in the world.\n\nIt's not clear whether Meta will follow through on the plans. \"While we frequently hear about the interest in this type of feature — and some products already exist in the market — we're still thinking through options and will take a thoughtful approach if and before we roll anything out,\" Erin Logan, a Meta spokesperson, told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nSince their launch, the Meta Ray-Ban glasses have been a surprise hit, with Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica saying it tripled sales in 2025 and is struggling to keep up with demand.\n\nIn 2024, some Harvard students rigged Meta Ray-Bans to perform facial recognition by sending camera photos to a third-party service for scanning. At the time, Meta was adamant that people understand the glasses themselves weren't performing facial recognition, and that this wasn't a capability of the device itself. Which was true, but a truth somewhat orthogonal to the public horror about the idea of people using facial recognition glasses in public.\n\nThus far, legal and privacy issues surrounding facial recognition, not technical limitations, have kept the feature at bay. So what's changed?\n\nThe New York Times viewed a document that gives us a clue:\n\nThis is straight out of the playbook for a celebrity announcing their divorce during the Super Bowl to minimize attention. Basically, at least one person at Meta was apparently considering the fact that — waves hands — so many other horrors are going on in the world that people will be too distracted to focus on this.\n\nAnd what, exactly, might this unnamed Meta person be assuming are the \"other concerns\" keeping civil society groups' resources focused? I have some ideas:\n\nFrankly, any of these is a big enough distraction to keep me from complaining about facial-recognition glasses!",

    "fullText": "Move is a ‘backwards step’, company spokesperson says, amid concerns Kremlin is seeking more state control via messaging apps such as Max\n\nRussia has attempted to “fully block” WhatsApp in an attempt to push users towards its own state-sponsored communications app, Max, a spokesperson for the Meta-owned company has said.\n\nThe company did not reveal more detail on what extent the attempt succeeded or what action was taken to try to block the app.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, the WhatsApp spokesperson said: “Trying to isolate over 100 million users from private and secure communication is a backwards step and can only lead to less safety for people in Russia. We continue to do everything we can to keep users connected.”\n\nThe move fits into the Kremlin’s aim to achieve a “sovereign internet” – an online space cut off from western technology and foreign influence, and more vulnerable to state control.\n\nThe latest rift between Russia and WhatsApp comes amid a broader crackdown on social media, most recently targeting Telegram, another popular messaging app used by more than 60 million Russians each day. The move triggered criticism from frontline Russian troops, as well as pro-war bloggers and exiled opposition figures.\n\nAfter users reported slower traffic and delays in downloading videos and images on Tuesday, Telegram’s Russian-born billionaire founder, Pavel Durov – who is based in Dubai – criticised Russian authorities. “Restricting citizens’ freedom is never the right answer,” he said, adding: “Telegram stands for freedom of speech and privacy, no matter the pressure.”\n\nThe Russian state-sponsored app, Max, is largely modelled on China’s own “super app” WeChat and has approximately 55 million users across Russia. In August last year, Russia ordered Max be pre-installed on new phones, with critics arguing that the app could be used to surveil users, a claim dismissed in state media as false.\n\nOwned by Meta, WhatsApp reportedly has at least 100 million users in Russia, making it the country’s most widely used messaging service, according to the Financial Times, which previously reported that Russian authorities removed the app from an online directory operated by Roskomnadzor, Russia’s media monitoring agency.\n\nThe outlet added that Russian authorities also removed Facebook and Instagram – both also owned by Meta – from the directory.\n\nIn December last year, Russian authorities blocked access to Snapchat and also placed restrictions on FaceTime, Apple’s own video calling service.\n\nWhen asked if WhatsApp would return in Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agency Tass in a video published on Wednesday: “This is again a question of fulfilling the legislation. If the Meta corporation fulfils this and enters into dialogue with Russian authorities, then we have the possibility of reaching an agreement.”\n\nPeskov added: “If the corporation [Meta] sticks to an uncompromising position and, I would say, shows itself unready to align with Russian legislation, then there is no chance.”\n\nThe Guardian has contacted the Kremlin for additional comment.",

    "description": "Andrew McCollum, the CEO of Philo, shares his career journey and routine, from helping start Facebook in 2004 to running a streaming platform now.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew McCollum, the 42-year-old CEO of Philo, based in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy first job was at Subway, but my first meaningful career job was helping to start Facebook during my time at Harvard.\n\nI spent a lot of time with Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes, and the other founders of the company. We worked together on various things and discussed ideas for projects we thought were cool. One thing we discussed was the concept of creating a universal Facebook.\n\nDuring one winter break, Mark wrote the first version of Facebook and asked if I wanted to handle the graphics and design.\n\nI was there for the first year and a half of the company. I returned in the summer between my last few years of college. I didn't go back to Facebook after I graduated. Instead, I traveled for a year through 40 countries.\n\nAfter my trip, I sold some of my Facebook stock and became an entrepreneur-in-residence at a couple of VC firms. I was introduced to what was then called Tivli, and is now Philo, where I became an angel investor and advisor.\n\nI met the other cofounders of Philo, a streaming and live television service, when they had just built the prototype in late 2010. I immediately fell in love with what they were doing and became an advisor when they began raising money.\n\nIt all happened naturally. I became the CEO of Philo in September 2014. Here's what a typical day in my life looks like now.\n\nMy wife doesn't sleep as well or as consistently as I do, so she's often up before I am. Our kids usually wake up between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m.\n\nIn the morning, I'll check Slack to see if anything big has happened within the company, and then I'll check the headlines to see if anything big has happened in the world.\n\nI don't do a ton of work in the morning, but I'll check in to see if there's anything that demands an immediate response. I don't have a policy against checking my devices at any particular time of day, but I don't constantly respond to emails or Slack messages.\n\nI've mastered a lot of the breakfast staples at this point — I make pancakes, crepes, French toast, eggs, and bacon for my kids. I don't eat breakfast myself.\n\nI used to not drink coffee at all, but now I drink one cup of espresso-based coffee every day. However, I don't do that until I arrive at the office because we have nice espresso machines there.\n\nI try to get everyone out the door. My wife and I split up the school drop-off.\n\nI work from home very rarely, as I prefer to be in the office every day. If I have several tasks spread throughout the day that are easier to complete from home, I'll occasionally work from home.\n\nI take Waymo to the office 90% of the time. I appreciate autonomous cars, which have significantly improved the commute to and from the office.\n\nThe things I thought I was going to hate about Waymo turned out to be the best things about it — a driver that's going to drive the speed limit, make a complete stop at every stop sign, and drive super conservatively.\n\nThe robotic drive allows me to focus on work. I use that time to start my day before I arrive at the office — sometimes I'm on a Zoom call, and sometimes I'm just on Slack. Sometimes I'm writing code.\n\nMeetings make up my entire schedule. We have a main meeting to plan our work in six- or seven-week cycles. One of those weeks is designated as a no-meeting week, meaning all regularly scheduled weekly meetings are paused.\n\nThose weeks, I typically have a lot more free time. I tend to use it to think through company strategy or write code on projects — I'm an engineer by training, and I still enjoy it when I get the chance to do technical work.\n\nI make myself very available and tell people every chance I get that they're welcome to message me or set up a time with me at their convenience. I actually wish people did it more.\n\nI rarely have a real lunch. I only do it if I have a lunch meeting scheduled with someone outside the office. If I do have lunch, I change it up a lot. My favorite lunch restaurants around the office are Xica, North Beach Cantina, Tony's Pizza Napoletana, and Pier 23.\n\nI may grab a snack between meetings during the day, but I don't have my first full, real meal until dinner time.\n\nMy afternoon is stacked with more meetings. I want to empower people so they feel they can take ownership.\n\nAs a CEO, it's my job to look at things differently from everyone else in the company. I view my role as synthesizing everything that's happening with the business across all the different areas we work in.\n\nI do some nonprofit work, and I'm on the board of the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation. When I'm out, I try to get to the gym.\n\nI always try to be home for dinner with my family. The gym I go to is very close to our office — a couple of blocks' walk. I need to leave the office around 4 p.m. if I'm going to make it there and still have enough time to get home in time for dinner with our kids.\n\nOn days I don't go to the gym, I'll leave around 5:30 pm.\n\nWaymo is sometimes very expensive and slow to get home in the evening. I often take an Uber or Lyft home.\n\nMy wife is also very busy, so we try to cook when we can, but sometimes we either order in or eat out.\n\nWe use a service like HelloFresh that prepares a home-cooked meal and delivers it to you; the portions are generous. We can have leftovers that need reheating.\n\nAfter dinner, cleaning the whole house, and getting everything organized, there's time for reading or watching a show in bed.\n\nMy wife reads a lot. I read, but not as much as she does. I enjoy doing crossword puzzles, and sometimes we'll work on them together, then we'll watch shows.\n\nWe enjoy shows like Taskmaster, a British comedy panel show featuring five comedians who are tasked with performing absurd, arbitrary tasks. I also watch various shows on Philo, and one of my favorites is the survival genre. Sometimes I'll watch The Daily Show.\n\nI sleep seven to eight hours a night.\n\nIf my wife goes to bed before me, I'm more likely to stay up a little later, perhaps even a bit past 11 p.m.\n\nI'm typically available on Slack. Often, I'm working on some project, but I don't work for many hours on weekends.\n\nTypically, I spend time with my family, and we go on some adventure or travel. In the evenings, I'll be checking Slack and email.\n\nVery rarely will a day go by without me doing something with Philo, but I try not to let work get in the way of spending time with my family.",

    "description": "Meta's Threads introduces Dear Algo, an AI feature for personalized feeds, as it surpasses 400 million monthly users and outpaces X in daily usage.",
    "fullText": "Threads, Meta's X-like social network, rolled out a feature that lets users tell the app's algorithm what they want to see more or less of in their feed.\n\nThe feature, called Dear Algo, works like this: you write a public Threads post starting with \"Dear Algo,\" followed by a request, such as asking to see less about a TV show you're not caught up on yet, for instance, or more about your favorite basketball team during a live game. The algorithm then adjusts your feed for three days based on what you asked for, and you can delete that request if you want. You can also repost someone else's Dear Algo request to try out their preferences.\n\n\"We think we can do a better job by going deep with individuals on what they want to see more and less of,\" said Connor Hayes, Meta's head of Threads.\n\nIn a blog post about the announcement, Meta described Dear Algo as \"an AI-powered feature that gives you more control over what you see by letting you tell Threads what's important to you in the moment.\"\n\nHayes also said that Threads will reject queries that don't meet Meta's recommendation guidelines or content principles.\n\nThreads teased the feature back in December, framing it as a response to a trend Meta had noticed: people were already posting to ask their algorithms to change what showed up in their feeds.\n\nFor years, people have blamed algorithmic timelines for pulling users into echo chambers, rewarding rage bait over substance, and turning a quick scroll into doomscrolling. Dear Algo could give users back some agency.\n\n\"The best algorithms are personalized,\" Hayes said, adding that what works for one user won't work \"at scale.\"\n\nDear Algo arrives at an interesting moment for Threads. The app now has more than 400 million monthly active users, and on its latest earnings call, Meta said time spent on it jumped 20% in the fourth quarter of 2025. A recent report from analytics firm Similarweb found that Threads had edged out X in daily mobile usage. And in January, Meta started running ads, a sign it sees Threads as a real business.\n\nThe feature also provides a glimpse into the company's broader AI ambitions. On Meta's latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is working on merging large language models with the recommendation systems that power Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and its ad system.\n\nThe company's recommendation systems are \"already driving meaningful growth,\" Zuckerberg said on the call. He added that \"the current systems are primitive compared to what will be possible soon.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact Pranav Dixit via email at pranavdixit@protonmail.com or Signal at 1-408-905-9124.

    "description": "Meta was recently granted a patent for tech to keep your social media accounts running using AI if you take a break or die.",
    "fullText": "Does Meta want to make our social media accounts immortal?\n\nThe company was granted a patent in late December that outlines how a large language model can \"simulate\" a person's social media activity, such as responding to content posted by real people.\n\n\"The language model may be used for simulating the user when the user is absent from the social networking system, for example, when the user takes a long break or if the user is deceased,\" the patent says.\n\nAndrew Bosworth, Meta's CTO, is listed as the primary author of the patent, which was first filed in 2023.\n\n\"We have no plans to move forward with this example,\" a spokesperson for Meta told Business Insider.\n\nIn the patent, Meta lays out why it thinks people might need this.\n\nIf you're no longer posting online — whether that's because you need a break from social media or … you … die — your followers' user experience will be affected. In short, they'll miss you.\n\n\"The impact on the users is much more severe and permanent if that user is deceased and can never return to the social networking platform,\" the document says.\n\nTo fill that void, Meta would essentially create a digital clone of your social media presence, training a model on \"user-specific\" data — including historical platform activity, such as comments, likes, or content — to understand how you would (or rather, did) behave.\n\nThat clone can then respond to other people's content by liking and commenting, or responding to DMs. For influencers or creators who make their livelihoods on Meta's platforms and need to take a break from social media, such a tool could be useful.\n\nMeta's patent also references tech that would allow the LLM to simulate video or audio calls with users.\n\nThe Meta spokesperson said that while it files patents to disclose concepts, a granted patent does not always mean the company will pursue, develop, or implement that tech.\n\nStill, it opens up many questions about the nature of tech — and grief. An AI bot that acts as your understudy while you're on a digital detox is one thing, but imitating people who've died?\n\nEdina Harbinja, a UK-based professor at the University of Birmingham's Law School, has concerns.\n\n\"It does affect not just legal issues, but a lot of very important social, ethical, and deeply philosophical issues as well,\" Harbinja, who specializes in digital rights and post-mortem privacy, told Business Insider.\n\nMeta has thought about managing digital legacies for years.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Facebook launched tools that let people designate a \"legacy contact\" to manage their accounts if they died. And back in the company's metaverse days, in a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Mark Zuckerberg discussed virtual avatars for deceased people.\n\n\"If someone has lost a loved one and is grieving, there may be ways in which being able to interact or relive certain memories could be helpful,\" Zuckerberg said at the time.\n\nThere are a lot of names for this broader category of tech — death bots, ghost bots, grief tech — that are aiming to help people face the loss of loved ones with eternally memorialized digital versions of them.\n\nSeveral startups have launched around this premise, and many have emerged from founders' own experiences with grief. Replika, an AI chatbot startup, was founded in 2015 by Eugenia Kuyda after the loss of her friend. Then there's You, Only Virtual (YOV), which was founded in 2020 by Justin Harrison when his mother was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\"Everybody in the tech world has been thinking about this for a while, as soon as we started having breaks in generative AI,\" Harrison said.\n\nIn 2021, Microsoft patented an AI chatbot that could simulate a deceased person (as well as fictional characters or celebrities).\n\nMeta's patent signals that the technology category is moving more into the mainstream, Harbinja said.\n\nHarrison isn't surprised to see bigger tech companies dipping their toes in the space, and sees it as a sign that people are beginning to \"feel more comfortable with doing this.\"\n\n\"We can only improve on what we offer people,\" Harrison said, adding that the resources for grieving are \"horrible\" to begin with.\n\n\"I think we have a moral obligation, if we have the potential, to do more for those folks than we should be,\" he said.\n\nAI, death, and grief are not easy topics to digest, however. The intersection of all three is a potent brew of taboos ripe for a philosophical debate on ethics, digital rights, and privacy for any dinner table.\n\nMeta has more than helping people process grief as an incentive to pursue the tech it lays out in its patent, especially for accounts taking a break.\n\n\"It's more engagement, more content, more data — more data for the current and the future AI,\" Harbinja said. \"I can see the business incentive for that. I'm just curious to see how they would, when, and if they will implement this innovation.\"\n\nDepending on how a product like this is rolled out, different questions could come up.\n\nFor instance, would this apply across all of Meta's apps? Would it understand the nuance of your WhatsApp presence vs. the candor you have in the Instagram comment section?\n\nJoseph Davis, a sociology professor at the University of Virginia, said he was concerned with the impact that tools like a Meta bot could have on how humans experience grief.\n\n\"One of the tasks of grief is to face the actual loss,\" Davis said.\n\n\"Let the dead be dead,\" Davis added. \"The idea of bringing them back, but you're not really doing that, but in fact, it looks like that. That's the confusion.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at sbradley@businessinsider.com or Signal at sydneykbradley.123.

    "fullText": "Adam Mosseri's multimillion-dollar pay package took center stage on Wednesday as lawyers sought to link Meta's profits to platforms that addict children.\n\nAs the first of several tech executives to testify in a social media addiction trial playing out in Los Angeles state court, the head of Instagram said he is paid roughly $900,000 a year and receives annual performance-based bonuses that can be as high as half of his salary.\n\nLike many executives of publicly traded social media companies, Mosseri, who's been head of Meta's Instagram since 2018, also earns stock-based compensation.\n\nFrom the witness stand, Mosseri said that his stock-based pay varies year to year but that it has been in the \"tens of millions of dollars.\" Some years, he said, he believes it's been over $20 million.\n\nMosseri made the comments while being questioned in Los Angeles Superior Court over a lawsuit that argues Meta and YouTube knowingly engineered their platforms to addict and cause harm to kids. Snap and TikTok were also named in the lawsuit but settled before trial for undisclosed amounts.\n\nMark Lanier, the attorney representing the plaintiff, pressed Mosseri on how the company determined its policy on cosmetic filters, such as filters that alter users' appearances, which was a key topic in court on Wednesday. He brought up Mosseri's compensation again while asking whether banning filters could have hurt Mosseri's bottom line by limiting the company's growth.\n\n\"I was never worried about this affecting our stock price,\" Mosseri said in court.\n\nMeta declined to comment about Mosseri's compensation.\n\nThe lawsuit centers on a 20-year-old woman, identified by the initials KGM, who says her use of social media throughout her childhood negatively affected her mental health, contributing to depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nThe case is considered a bellwether trial that could indicate how other similar lawsuits related to social media addiction might play out.\n\n\"We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,\" Stephanie Otway, a Meta spokesperson, told Business Insider. Otway said the company has been making \" meaningful changes—like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens' experiences.\"",

    "description": "Meta says it will build a new 1-gigawatt data center in Indiana, its second in the state.",
    "fullText": "Meta (META) on Wednesday said it is breaking ground on its latest data center as part of its massive AI infrastructure build-out.\n\nThe more than $10 billion data center will be located in Lebanon, Ind., and have a capacity of upwards of 1 gigawatt. That's enough energy to power several hundred thousand homes.\n\nAccording to Meta, the data center will handle both Meta's AI workloads as well as its core products and represents one of its largest infrastructure projects to date.\n\nDuring its Q4 earnings announcement, Meta said it plans to spend as much as $135 billion throughout 2026 as part of its AI expansion plans. The company spent $72.2 billion in 2025. The social media giant isn't the only tech company sending big on AI this year. Advertising rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) said it plans to spend $180 billion in 2026 during its own earnings report, while Amazon (AMZN) said it anticipates spending $200 billion.\n\nThe massive spending news spooked Google and Amazon investors and lifted shares of Meta more than 10% at the time, though they've since come back down to Earth.\n\nThe broader data center explosion is facing increasing criticism from residents in and around communities where they're being built, with complaints ranging from increasing utility costs to the irritating sounds of cooling systems.\n\nTo that end, Meta says it will pay the full cost of the energy the data center uses, provide $1 million each year for 20 years to the Boone REMC Community Fund to assist with energy bills, and fund emergency water utility assistance. The data center will also use a closed-loop water system that Meta says will use no water \"a majority of the year.\"\n\nThe company further says it will invest more than $120 million in water infrastructure for Lebanon, as well as make upgrades to roads, transmission lines, and area utilities.\n\nMeta isn't the only company looking to make concessions to win over local communities. Last month, Microsoft president Brad Smith announced that the Windows developer will work with local utilities to provide a better understanding of its data center electricity needs and “bear the cost” when electricity companies need to upgrade their transmission capabilities to meet data center demand.\n\nIn August, Google agreed to cut back on its electricity usage during periods of high demand in certain regions, Reuters reported.\n\nMeta's ambitious AI construction plans aren't limited to single-gigawatt data centers. In July, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company is set to build its enormous Hyperion facility in Louisiana, adding that the data center will be so large it would cover a large portion of Manhattan and will eventually scale up to support upwards of 5 gigawatts of capacity.",

That encompasses a more than 350-acre span of land on Pila'a Beach.\n\nAnother part of Zuckerberg's Hawaii holdings is the nearly 600 acres of land on Kauai's North Shore that reportedly cost him around $53 million in 2021.\n\nOn one of his Hawaiian parcels, Zuckerberg is reportedly building a huge compound that's said to include a 5,000-square-foot underground bunker with an escape hatch.

It was designed by local firm Robert Gurney Architect and sits on about one acre of property.\n\nBusiness Insider was unable to independently confirm that Zuckerberg purchased the property.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is reportedly adding a second East Coast property to his portfolio after buying a home in Miami, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nZuckerberg is purchasing a waterfront mansion on Indian Creek, an exclusive island in South Florida that's home to Jeff Bezos, Carl Icahn, and Jared Kushner.\n\nThe sold home previously belonged to a limited liability company linked to Peter Cancro, the founder of Jersey Mike's Subs. The property — which was just a home lot — was last traded for $37 million in 2021, Miami-Dade property records show.\n\nIt's unclear how much this off-market deal was worth, but an empty lot next door to Bezos sold for $105 million in 2025.\n\nHillary Hoffower contributed to an earlier version of this story.",

    "fullText": "Roger Federer was among the celebrities in attendance at Super Bowl LX, where the Seattle Seahawks met the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Seahawks emerged victorious as 29-13 champions, with the iconic match having been played at Levi’s Stadium in California.\n\nTennis icon Federer took in the action in Santa Clara, where a superb defensive display helped the Seahawks get over the line.\n\nHe was one of 70,823 fans in attendance, where the world-famous half-time show was performed by Bad Bunny.\n\nFederer has now taken to social media to describe the experience, where he also made it onto the pitch.\n\nSharing images on his Instagram, the Swiss legend wrote: “Super Bowl LX. Amazing trip back out to the Bay Area.”\n\nJustin Bieber, Adam Sandler, Lewis Hamilton and Travis Kelce among many other high-profile names also attended.\n\nIt’s been a very busy year so far for 44-year-old Federer, who only just returned to Melbourne for the Australian Open.\n\nFederer played in an exhibition match at the start of the Grand Slam, before hanging around to watch some of the action.\n\nHis fellow legend Rafael Nadal was also in attendance in Australia, where Carlos Alcaraz lifted the trophy and completed the career Grand Slam.\n\nHe beat Novak Djokovic in the final, with the Serbian involved in a long-standing debate with Federer and Nadal.\n\nMany tennis fans continue to argue which of the three is the greatest player of all time, with Djokovic the only one still playing.\n\nFederer still loves his tennis, but he retired from the sport in 2022, while Nadal called time on his career in 2024.\n\nNotably, it is Djokovic who leads the way in the men’s all-time Grand Slam titles list on 24, followed by Nadal’s 22 and Federer’s 20.",

    "fullText": "CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy — Lindsey Vonn sustained a “complex tibia fracture that is currently stable but will require multiple surgeries to fix properly” after her devastating crash in the Olympic downhill, the skier said in a social media post late Monday.\n\nVonn posted on Instagram about her left leg injuries following her fall in Sunday’s race.\n\n“While yesterday did not end the way I had hoped, and despite the intense physical pain it caused, I have no regrets,” Vonn said.\n\nNine days before Sunday’s crash, the 41-year-old Vonn ruptured the ACL in her left knee. It is an injury that sidelines pro athletes for months, but ski racers have on occasion competed that way. She appeared stable in two downhill training runs at the Milan Cortina Games.\n\nOnlookers on social media wondered if Vonn’s ruptured ACL could have played a factor in her crash near the top of the Olympia delle Tofana course, where she has a World Cup record 12 wins. That maybe, on a healthy left knee, she would not have clipped a gate and been able to stave off a crash.\n\n“Yesterday my Olympic dream did not finish the way I dreamt it would,” Vonn said. “It wasn’t a story book ending or a fairy tail, it was just life. I dared to dream and had worked so hard to achieve it. Because in Downhill ski racing the difference between a strategic line and a catastrophic injury can be as small as 5 inches.\n\n“I was simply 5 inches too tight on my line when my right arm hooked inside of the gate, twisting me and resulted in my crash. My ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever.”\n\nVonn’s father said Monday that the American superstar will no longer race if he has any influence over her decision.\n\n“She’s 41 years old and this is the end of her career,” Alan Kildow said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. “There will be no more ski races for Lindsey Vonn, as long as I have anything to say about it.”\n\nWhen she arrived in Cortina last week, Vonn said she had consulted with her team of physicians and trainers before deciding to move ahead with racing. The International Ski and Snowboard Federation does not check on the injury statuses of athletes.\n\n“I firmly believe that this has to be decided by the individual athlete,” FIS president Johan Eliasch said Monday in Bormio. “And in her case, she certainly knows her injuries on her body better than anybody else. And if you look around here today with all the athletes, the athletes yesterday, every single athlete has a small injury of some kind.\n\n“What is also important for people to understand, that the accident that she had yesterday, she was incredibly unlucky. It was a one in a 1,000,” Eliasch added. “She got too close to the gate, and she got stuck when she was in the air in the gate and started rotating. No one can recover from that, unless you do a 360. … This is something which is part of ski racing. It’s a dangerous sport.”\n\nThe Italian hospital in Treviso where Vonn was being treated said late Sunday she had undergone surgery to repair a broken left leg. The U.S. Ski Team has said only that Vonn “sustained an injury, but is in stable condition and in good hands with a team of American and Italian physicians.”\n\nPierre Ducrey, the sports director for the International Olympic Committee, noted Vonn was able to train and had experts counseling her decision.",

    "title": "As billionaires bail, Mark Zuckerberg doubles down on California with $50 million donation",
    "description": "The Meta founder’s donation to Sacramento State will help build “state-of-the-art STEM facilities” and a dedicated AI center.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg is going all-in on AI and STEM with his philanthropic efforts. Late last year, he and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, announced they would shift the majority of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute to biomedical AI research. And late last month, the Meta founder and CEO pledged $50 million to Sacramento State University to fuel state-of-the-art STEM labs and an AI center.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled the gift on Jan. 28, tying it to a major redevelopment of three vacant state office buildings on Sacramento’s Capitol Mall into a downtown campus. The gift from Zuckerberg and Meta will fund abatement, demolition, and initial construction of the campus, enabling new student housing alongside new academic spaces, including STEM facilities and an AI center.\n\nMeta’s donation also comes at the heels of an interesting corporate and financial dynamic in California: Billionaires may soon be subject to a one-time 5% tax on their wealth. Many billionaires, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and Craft Ventures’ David Sacks, have already moved their permanent residences out of state to avoid the tax.\n\nZuckerberg hasn’t made any public statements about the billionaires tax, and is instead doubling down on California investments and legacy.\n\n“These investments will help strengthen our communities and support the next generation of leaders and innovators,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. The Meta CEO also owns a compound of 11 properties in Palo Alto’s Crescent Park neighborhood, valued at more than $110 million. Minutes from his home, Meta has its sprawling 57-acre headquarters campus and also more than 400,000 square feet of office space nearby in Menlo Park.\n\nNewsom said Zuckerberg’s gift allows the Sacramento-based school to continue to build its talent pipeline for tech jobs.\n\nThe donation “[opens] doors for students to succeed and for our communities to prosper,” Newsom said. “Making sure students can actually afford to live where they learn is essential to that work.”\n\nWhile this recent donation comes directly from Meta and Zuckerberg, it also fits into the playbook they recently rewrote. Launched in 2015 with a pledge to give away 99% of their fortune, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has recently refocused on science, AI, and biomedical research, shifting emphasis away from its initial education and social justice priorities (although they say they’ll continue making other local donations).\n\nIn 2025, Zuckerberg and Chan laid the groundwork to recalibrate their philanthropic organization toward AI-powered biomedical research, with a particular focus on their flagship Biohub network. Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes, aims to “cure or prevent all disease,” according to Zuckerberg and Chan.",

    "fullText": "Hey Meta, are you also nostalgic for 2016?\n\nAs social media users wax poetic and share throwbacks about the social media heyday of 2016, it seems Meta wants to revive a piece of it.\n\nThe tech giant is working on an internal prototype of a new stand-alone app for sending disappearing photos, a spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nYes, that does sound like Snapchat's original premise.\n\nAccording to a screenshot shared by mobile developer Alessandro Paluzzi, who reverse engineers Instagram to reveal prototypes, the app is being called \"Instants.\"\n\n\"Share disappearing photos with friends,\" Paluzzi's rendering says.\n\nThe Meta spokesperson said the stand-alone Instants app is not testing externally.\n\n#Instagram is working on a standalone app for Instants/Quicksnap 👀 pic.twitter.com/d56vOeoGap\n\nInstagram has also been testing a feature called Instants, which was previously called \"Shots,\" with some users of its main app. It has been a limited test available to \"some countries globally,\" the Meta spokesperson said.\n\nThe Instants feature lets Instagram users quickly send disappearing photos in their direct-messaging inbox. Once the photo message is opened, the photo disappears and expires 24 hours after sending, per Instagram's Help Center.\n\nInstants can only be \"sent to followers you follow back,\" the same help page says. The photos cannot be edited.\n\nThis isn't the first time Instagram has rolled out disappearing messaging tools.\n\nIn 2016, Instagram launched tools for disappearing text and photos in its DM product. The platform also introduced \"Vanish Mode\" in 2020, which lets users turn on disappearing messages by swiping up in the DM thread. These features are still live within the Instagram app, but Instants would be a new way to send disappearing content to friends.\n\nA new app from Meta shouldn't come as a surprise. It's rolled out several stand-alone apps in the company's recent history, including Threads, Edits, and Meta AI.\n\nInstagram has been doubling down on ways for friends — which Meta defines as people who mutually follow each other — to interact on the app.\n\nInfluencers, the rise of the creator economy, and advertising have turned Instagram into more of an entertainment platform than a social media platform. Now, people post less frequently to the main feed or stories, and instead, share content directly in DMs with their friends and family.\n\nHead of Instagram Adam Mosseri told Business Insider last year that there's been a \"paradigm shift\" toward more private sharing (like DMs) on the platform.\n\nMeta seems to be looking at Snapchat as a frequent source of inspiration for how people communicate with their closest friends.\n\nDisappearing messages aren't the only way Instagram has imitated Snapchat. Stories, famously, was a clone of Snapchat's highly successful product. Last year, Instagram also launched a social map feature similar to Snapchat's Snap Map.\n\nThere's a reason Snap CEO Evan Spiegel keeps \"VP Product @ Meta\" in his LinkedIn bio.",

We need your help,\" Savannah Guthrie said in the Monday video, calling the situation a \"nightmare.\"\n\nShe added, \"Law enforcement is working tirelessly around the clock trying to bring her home, trying to find her. She was taken, and we don't know where.\"\n\n\"And we need your help, so I'm coming on just to ask you, not just for your prayers, but no matter where you are, even if you're far from Tucson, if you see anything, you hear anything, if there's anything at all that seems strange to you, that you report to law enforcement,\" Savannah Guthrie said.\n\nThe FBI, which is assisting in the investigation, is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the recovery of Nancy Guthrie or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.\n\nNancy Guthrie's disappearance has garnered national attention and has led to ransom notes being sent to local and national media outlets, which the authorities have been investigating. Last week, however, the FBI arrested a California man over a bogus ransom demand that was sent to Guthrie's family.",

    "description": "Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth said that cuts to the company's VR effort were \"a real loss,\" but that Meta's investment had to match segment growth.",
    "fullText": "Meta poured billions into its VR and metaverse efforts. It even renamed the company after it. But after the recent round of cuts and product pullback, Meta's CTO acknowledge that the industry was growing \"more slowly than we had hoped.\"\n\nAndrew \"Boz\" Bosworth did a Q&A on his Instagram story on Monday. One of the questions Meta's chief technology officer received: \"There is a lot of doom and gloom about the future of Quest and gaming. What is the truth?\"\n\nBosworth said that the doom and gloom was mostly \"overwrought.\"\n\n\"There is a real cause for sadness here,\" Bosworth said, referencing Meta's recent cuts to its Reality Labs division, which houses Meta's metaverse and VR bets. \"You have people doing work that we were excited about, that we wanted to have in the system.\"\n\nMeta realized that its vision for Horizon and VR was \"too much,\" he said. Reality Labs has racked up more than $70 billion in losses since 2020.\n\n\"The investment that we put in is bigger than the growth that this ecosystem will allow,\" he said. \"That's a real loss. We are allowed to feel sad about those things.\"\n\nMeta has cut several of its VR products, including its virtual workplace and fitness apps.\n\nStill, Bosworth maintained that Meta was \"extremely bullish on VR,\" and that the company was investing \n\n\"Yes, we've receded from the high watermark, but we are still very much a net positive investor in the ecosystem,\" he said.\n\nReality Labs also houses Meta's AI glasses bet, which it has expanded rapidly. As Meta has bet big on wearables, some onlookers wondered whether that would require a pullback on VR.\n\nIn December, Bosworth said that the two products were separate and that Meta can pursue both. In the February update, he said that was still true.\n\n\"If VR were growing at the rate we all wish it were, we probably wouldn't have made these changes, and wearables would still be growing a ton,\" he said. \"It is wrong to think of those things as zero-sum.\"\n\nA year ago, Bosworth prophesied 2025 would be make-or-break for the metaverse. \"This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure,\" he wrote in a memo obtained by Business Insider.\n\nWhich was it: the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure? It's still unclear — though Bosworth doesn't sound so optimistic.\n\n\"It doesn't mean we're going to invest infinitely, forever,\" he said. \"We do need to have our investment match the size of growth.\"",

    "fullText": "Last night (Sat., Feb. 7, 2026), Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) returned home to the Meta APEX in Las Vegas, Nevada for UFC Vegas 113. Luckily, the first “Fight Night” event of 2026 was a step up from the average APEX affair. There were intriguing bouts booked throughout the evening featuring some quality prospects and familiar faces alike. The night kicked off with a couple impressive comebacks on the “Prelims,” and the action remained high throughout the evening, almost all the way to the pivotal Bantamweight main event.\n\nLet’s take a look back over the best performances and techniques of the evening:\n\nI’m having a tough time making heads or tails of Mario Bautista vs. Vinicius Oliveira.\n\nUndoubtedly, it’s a great performance and win from Bautista, who pretty much dominated the fight and won a main event without taking any hard punches to the face. There’s no question he brought a smart game plan and excellent transitional work to the cage with him, getting Oliveira to play his game and then quickly showing himself the finer man in that aspect.\n\nAll the questions surround “Lokdog.” The Brazilian made the bizarre decision of shooting just seconds into the fight against the man known to be the better grappler? Then continued to proactively wrestle? Weirder yet, Oliveira is known for his deep gas tank. He’s made a UFC career out of outlasting opposition, taking their best punches and/or takedowns early and then drowning them later.\n\nBeing an absurdly gifted athlete is Oliveira’s whole thing.\n\nIn this fight, conversely, Oliveira was exhausted just a minute into round two … and he didn’t really do that much in the first! I cannot help but think that his absurd weight cut severely drained him and robbed us of a more competitive fight. If that’s the case, it’s high time for “Lokdog” to either figure out how to cut in a healthier fashion or make the move up to 145 pounds.\n\nFor the second time in three months, 35-year-old Kyoji Horiguchi absolutely styled on a top-ranked Flyweight contender.\n\nSeriously, Horiguchi beat the brakes off Albazi and made it look pretty easy. Despite a clear size advantage and decorated wrestling pedigree, Albazi couldn’t floor Horiguchi a single time. He was forced to chase after the Karateka, and it did not at all go well for him. Horiguchi’s timing and movement patterns are so unlike everybody else that the Japanese striker was routinely able to line up hard shots that Albazi didn’t see coming and was forced to just absorb.\n\nThe damage built up quickly, and by the end of the fight, Albazi was covered in blood and had been rocked badly on multiple occasions. The finish didn’t materialize, but this was one-way traffic from pretty much the first bell.\n\nIn particular, Horiguchi’s lead hand looked great here. His jab repeatedly interrupted Albazi’s would-be pressure and stood him up tall, leaving him more vulnerable to follow-up right hand swings. As Albazi changed his guard to adjust for the jab, Horiguchi started sitting down behind wide counter left hooks that clipped the temple and did major damage.\n\nThe Flyweight division is hot right now with multiple options for champion Joshua Van’s first title defense. Given Horiguchi’s age and overall accomplishments as a world-class champion, I’m in favor of booking “The Karate Kid” for a title shot quickly while he’s still performing at such a high level — there’s no chance Van vs. Horiguchi wouldn’t be absolute fireworks.\n\nJailton Almeida vs. Rizvan Kuniev was a horribly frustrating fight but not entirely for the reason one might expect.\n\nBased on his pair of fights with Curtis Blaydes and Almeida, Kuniev was genetically engineered in a Russia lab to shut down the takedown attempts of elite Heavyweight wrestlers. Sadly, he was not engineered to do anything else. In this fight, Kuniev routinely shut down Almeida’s previously unstoppable double leg with absolute ease and then proceeded to do NOTHING! He spent so much time in the clinch with his forehead driven up into Almeida’s chin in perfect position to rip the liver, dig knees, break with elbows or right hands and a vast majority of the time he just … stayed there.\n\nAlmeida wasn’t much better. In the second round, for example, he landed a big calf kick that nearly knocked Kuniev to the floor and then proceeded to never throw that kick again. His right hand and front kick looked good when he threw them, which was incredibly rare. Worse yet, he would randomly just back himself into the fence and concede long periods of clinch time.\n\nKuniev picked up the nod, which is a big win if you look at the rankings and completely meaningless if you actually watched the fight. After those 15 minutes, who f—king cares about the judges’ scorecards? This was truly awful Heavyweight fighting just one week after the Tuivasa vs. Teixeira embarrassment at UFC 325. This division has never been worse, and there is no rebuild happening.\n\nVeteran referee Dan Miragliotta celebrated his 500th appearance as a UFC ref last night in appropriate fashion: with a hilariously bad stoppage!\n\nDustin Jacoby vs. Julius Walker was a decent veteran vs. prospect scrap. Jacoby was clearly the better kickboxer by a significant margin and was sticking Walker with good straight punches, but Walker showed in the first round why he was a live dog with some powerful slam takedowns. It was a good display of chain wrestling and physicality from the young talent, attributes we don’t often see at 205 pounds.\n\nStill, Jacoby was a step too far for the up-and-comer. Jacoby connected on a big right hand early in the second and then unleashed hell, putting Walker down hard with another right. Miragliotta moved in to stop the fight, pulled away at the last second, and Walker was hit another couple dozen times for his indecision. Even when Walker was turning away from the punches — a clear sign referees are supposed to look for that indicates the fight is over — Miragliotta still allowed the 7-2 professional to eat more punches.\n\nAnother good performance from Jacoby, who has won four straight, and exactly what we’ve come to expect from everyone’s favorite hallucinating referee.\n\nNikolay Veretennikov defeats Niko Price via first-round knockout (highlights): I am sad to say Price appears to be completely washed. Veretennikov entered this fight with an underwhelming 1-3 UFC record and then looked like a world beater against “The Hybrid.” He chewed up Price’s midsection with some violent clinch knees then went upstairs with a barrage of right hands and right elbows to secure a dramatic standing knockout win. Given that this is Price’s third straight defeat and fifth loss in his last six, it’s hard to really be that impressed by Veretennikov.\n\nJakub Wiklacz defeats Muin Gafurov via third-round guillotine choke (highlights): We have an early candidate for Submission of the Year, and it came at the conclusion of a pretty great scrap! Gafurov started strong, pressuring forward with combinations to box up Wiklacz, who has a definite bit of Reinier de Ridder to his stand-up game (derogatory). He’s very slick on the canvas, however, and Wiklacz used a guillotine choke to reverse his way into top position in round two. He spent most of that frame in top position, threatening submissions and landing some chipping ground shots. With the scorecards tied up, Gafurov stuck to his boxing and really ripped up the body for most of five minutes. In the closing seconds, he shot for a double leg along the fence and wound up in another guillotine! Wiklacz fully committed to the squeeze and forced the tap with less than one second remaining, earning the unlikely comeback at the last second. Strange style or not, Wiklacz is now 2-0 in the UFC with a pair of wins over pretty damn good Bantamweights.",

    "fullText": "Savannah Guthrie has made a direct plea to her mother's potential abductor: \"We will pay.\"\n\nIn a new, 20-second video posted on her Instagram account on Saturday, Guthrie said her family had received someone's \"message\" and were begging for the return of her mother, Nancy Guthrie, 84, who has been reported missing since Sunday.\n\n\"We received your message, and we understand,\" Guthrie said, sitting between her two siblings in the video. \"We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her. This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.\"\n\nGuthrie did not identify a specific individual. It's also unclear what message Guthrie was referring to.\n\nThe Pima County Sheriff’s Department and the FBI said in a statement on Friday that they were aware of a new message regarding Nancy Guthrie.\n\n\"Investigators are actively inspecting the information provided in the message for its authenticity,\" the sheriff's department wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for the Pima County Sheriff's Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An FBI spokesperson said the agency did not have further information to provide.\n\nThere have been reports of multiple ransom notes. Federal officials arrested a California man on Thursday, accusing him of sending a fake ransom note to the Guthrie family.\n\nOfficials have not identified a suspect but have said that the incident may have involved a kidnapping or abduction.\n\nGuthrie's mother was last seen at her home located just outside Tucson.\n\nAuthorities said blood confirmed to belong to the elder Guthrie was found on the porch, and the doorbell camera had been disconnected, leaving investigators without crucial evidence.\n\nHer daughter, a veteran news anchor of nearly three decades, said that her mother's health is \"fragile\" and requires daily medication.\n\n\"We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated,\" the younger Guthrie said in a video posted on Wednesday. \"We need to know, without a doubt, that she is alive, and that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen. Please, reach out to us.\"",

    "description": "Big Tech's capital expenditures soar with Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft at the forefront, ushering a new era of AI infrastructure spending.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech is taking the AI age to a whole new level.\n\nWhen Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta announced earnings recently, one set of numbers stole the show: The massive projections for data center spending this year.\n\nThough the industry's capital expenditures — spending on property and equipment — have ramped up in recent years, 2026 is shaping up to be leaps and bounds ahead of any private-sector infrastructure spending in modern history.\n\nThe projections draw comparisons to previous transformational eras, such as the Gilded Age of the late 1800s and the Information Age of the 1990s.\n\nStill, Wall Street questions whether it will bring a return on investment — and investors are starting to get antsy. Shares of Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta were all down as of Friday morning. Microsoft was slightly up.\n\n\"Investors needed more than promises to underwrite this story,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote Thursday in a research note following Amazon's earnings call.\n\nAmazon said Thursday it is planning $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, a more than 50% increase from 2025 and the largest estimated budget among Big Tech companies.\n\nThe forecast came in $50 billion above analysts' expectations, and they were less than impressed — despite Amazon's 14% revenue growth for the quarter compared with the same period last year.\n\nThe company's stock dropped as much as 10% after the bell on Thursday, and was down 8% on Friday morning.\n\nWith spending this extreme, a beat on earnings should be \"table-stakes,\" Bernstein's Shmulik wrote Thursday night in a research note that dripped with sarcasm.\n\n\"If we're going to peg the share price to 2026 CapEx, maybe Amazon should have guided even higher, Shmulik wrote. \"Why not at this point?\"\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet stunned investors on Wednesday when it said it is planning $175 billion to $185 billion in capex for 2026, doubling its budget for the second year in a row.\n\nGoogle, which trails behind Amazon and Microsoft in cloud services, has dramatically increased its spending as demand for its Gemini AI models grows. Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users, the company said on its fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nGoogle's stock was down about 2% Friday morning as investors digested Big Tech's big spending plans for 2026.\n\nOne thing Google has going for it is the growing enthusiasm for Gemini.\n\n\"We believe these investments are rational, given its fast-growing backlog, supporting our view that Alphabet is among the best positioned to emerge as one of the leading, if not the leading, AI platform,\" BNP Paribas analyst Nick Jones wrote Thursday in a research note.\n\nLike its Big Tech peers, Meta will up the ante on AI investment in 2026. It was the only company that seemed to get a pass from investors this earnings season — at first, that is.\n\nMeta said last week it is planning $115 billion to $135 billion in capex, close to doubling its spend from last year. Meta's stock surged 8% on January 29, the morning after its fourth-quarter earnings call. Investors were pleased with the social media giant's strong advertising business, which reported $58.14 billion in ad revenue that quarter. What's more, it saw gains from its advertising AI tools.\n\nSince then, enthusiasm has waned, and the stock has been on a downward slope this week.\n\nMicrosoft reported $37.5 billion in capex for the second quarter of its fiscal 2026. While the company hasn't released full-year capex guidance, S&P last week estimated the figure could be around $97.7 billion, with some analysts projecting slightly more.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud business heavily depends on OpenAI. The ChatGPT-maker represents 45% of its backlog, meaning Microsoft's future cloud revenue largely depends on it. The company's stock fell 12% on January 29, the morning after it reported earnings last week — Microsoft's biggest decline since March 2020.\n\nInvestors seemed pleased with the 17% jump in total revenue, including a 39% spike in revenue from Azure and other cloud services.",

    "title": "Eileen Gu, Olympian by day, millionaire social  media star by night",
    "description": "The day has arrived where Olympians like Eileen Gu are making millions, not by what she does on a ski slope, but through content she creates for Instagram.",
    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy — On Jan. 9, freestyle skier Eileen Gu posted on Instagram a “Day in my life” video commemorating the one-month countdown to the Milan-Cortina Olympics.\n\nGlimpses of Gu brushing her teeth, eating breakfast, riding a ski lift, practicing tricks on a giant airbag, cooling down with a 5 kilometer run, talking to the media, completing a doping test and reading a book while she’s in a hyperbaric chamber were all stuffed into a 29-second Instagram reel.\n\nWithin 10 days, it generated more than a million views.\n\nSo it’s probably no coincidence that Gu, the American-born dual gold medal winner who chose to compete for China in 2019, was the fourth highest-paid female athlete of 2025.  According to Sportico, all but $20,000 of her $23 million came from endorsements.\n\nWhile sponsorships have always been crucial to the earning potential of Olympic athletes, who generally aren’t raking in huge sums of prize money, financial success no longer hinges on whose image lands on the Wheaties box.\n\nNow most of it happens on social media, where the line between Olympic athletes and influencers has been blurred — usually to the benefit of their pocketbooks as this Winter Games draws close.\n\n“The number of Olympians who have become more popular and made money in the Olympics has grown exponentially,” said Doug Shabelman, the CEO of Chicago-based Burns Entertainment, a firm that matches celebrities and athletes with marketing opportunities. “Now everybody, whether you win or lose, can be an influencer. Before you had to win gold medals, you had to do something special. Now social media has leveled the playing field, and the marketability of these athletes is 365 days a year.”\n\nGu is among the handful of Olympic athletes at the top of that food chain along with the likes of Simone Biles and Lindsey Vonn. It’s no surprise given Gu’s success in the sport and her endorsement potential in China, which likely played at least some role in her choice to represent her mother’s homeland rather than the more crowded American market.\n\nBut you don’t need to be the most successful winter sports athlete in a country of 1.4 billion people to leverage social media for endorsement dollars.\n\nTake freestyle skier Alex Ferreira. Once a year, he puts on a prosthetic mask, a gray wig and fake facial hair to make him look like a skiing has-been, goes to the slopes with a film crew, talks trash to younger skiers and shocks crowds as executes Olympic-level tricks.\n\nThe character, “Hot Dog Hans,” was inspired by Kyrie Irving’s portrayal of streetball legend “Uncle Drew.” Though it started out as a one-time gag a few years ago, Ferreira realized within 15 minutes of his first day in costume that it was something he could draw out into a multi-episode series of short films.\n\nThe full Hans skits now generate hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube, with the clips drawing millions on Instagram. And while it may have started as a fun distraction, it has become a high-profile example of how an Olympic athlete who is not particularly famous in the mainstream world can find a niche that leads to dollars.\n\n“We’re in this day and age where your main job is to compete, learn new tricks, go to these contests and win them,” Ferreira said. “But the other half of the business is gaining sponsors, so you need to create content as well. I’m a professional skier, but I’m also an influencer in a way. Basically, when you think the job is over, you have to get back and get on the computer and start cranking out content. When I started, it was much less than that.”\n\nThough the content game does require more time outside of traditional training and media obligations, it keeps many athletes in the mix during those four-year gaps between Olympics when they don’t get as much mainstream attention. And then, once an Olympics begins, you never really know what’s going to hit.\n\nOne of the biggest social media stars of the Paris Games was Henrik Christiansen, a Norwegian swimmer who did not finish better than 20th in any of his three events but went viral for videos about chocolate chip muffins in the athletes’ village. The “Muffin Man” now has more than 500,000 followers on TikTok and is still trading off the joke. One of his most popular recent videos from last October shows him whisking cocoa powder into a mixing bowl trying to replicate a recipe he’s watching on television.\n\n“I’m 56, and our generation, we still look at it like, ‘We want to see the winners and the great stories,’” Shabelman said. “But a different generation has different things they’re more interested in, and there are so many different avenues now, so many different ways to get your story and your personality out that it changed the game in a big way on the marketing side.\n\n“It’s not just the winners anymore. Engagement on social media with fans is so important to marketers because they don’t just want to see how many people look at videos. They want to see who’s engaging, who has that accessibility and who has something that other people don’t.”\n\nIt also helps that Olympic sports, particularly in the winter, have great visuals that lend themselves to social media. Whether it’s a striking costume being worn by a figure skater, a gravity-defying trick on a snowboard or simply the backdrop of a snow-capped mountain, Winter Olympians don’t necessarily have to stretch far outside their comfort zone to create eye-catching content.\n\nMany of Gu’s posts, for instance, have nothing to do with sports and fall more into the category of modeling or a peek into the lifestyle of a rich, young woman who travels the world like a true celebrity and hangs out with other celebrities. They are slickly produced and undeniably targeted to demographics that are not watching the Freestyle Ski World Cup.\n\n“We are still a society that does value attractiveness and different elements that we all have come to know about people who are endorsers,” Shabelman said. “But then you also add on being really good at building great content, you have a lot of (famous) friends you might tag in a post and that might get you even more followers.”\n\nThough not every Olympic athlete handles their social media as seriously or professionally as Gu, it’s now just a fact of life that maximizing endorsement potential — which is what keeps many of these Olympians going in sports that don’t offer big prize money — often runs through Instagram or TikTok.\n\n“Content creation is what’s happening right now,” snowboarder Jamie Anderson said. “It’s bigger than almost anything. There are YouTubers making more money than NFL players. So it really doesn’t matter what I think about it, it’s happening. You kind of have to move with the waves. It’s definitely the future of marketing and sports. Times have changed quick.”",

    "description": "Mark Zuckerberg published a playlist of five songs he was pumping while building Facebook in 2004. It includes hard-rocking hits and some synth funk.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg is feeling nostalgic.\n\nOn the 22nd anniversary of Facebook's founding, Zuckerberg reposted a meme about the fresh-faced Harvard student \"getting ready to make history.\" Then he linked a playlist titled \"2004 Facebook coding jams.\"\n\nZuckerberg said he \"had these bangers on repeat\" while building Facebook. The playlist's cover features the young founder — long before his bulked-up rebrand — listening to music on headphones.\n\nThe playlist's five songs feature a fair share of emo wails, electric guitars, and even some funky synthesizers. Some of them have receded into the tides of music history; others remain classics for weddings and bar mitzvahs.\n\nThey're also evocative of a quieter, easier time in tech. There were no culture wars, cage matches, or capex worries. What would a 2004 Zuckerberg think of $10 billion data centers?\n\nMusic speaks to how we feel. Here's what these five songs might say about a 19-year-old Zuckerberg — and just how far he's come.\n\nZuckerberg liked hard rock, it seems.\n\n\"Headstrong\" is a loud, thrashing song that feels built to be played on \"Guitar Hero.\" There's even a good guttural scream in there before one chorus. The lyrics are equally attacking. \"Back off, I'll take you on,\" Chris Taylor Brown sings.\n\nThe opening of \"Headstrong\" sounds like UFC walkout music, hyping up a big fight. That's now a favorite sport of Zuckerberg's. Some things never change.\n\n\"Like a Stone\" is about death and religion — two subjects that Zuckerberg has long been interested in.\n\nFrontman Chris Cornell prays to God and angels on their deathbed that they will get into heaven. \"In dreams until my death / I will wander on,\" he sings.\n\nZuckerberg seems more interested in extending human life than forecasting its end. His philanthropic initiative invests heavily in drug and disease research. He also has an intense fitness routine, including jiu-jitsu and CrossFit routines.\n\nAs for faith, Zuckerberg said in 2020 that he had \"become more religious.\" He cited two sources: The issues his company has faced in the prior years and the birth of his daughters.\n\nMostly, though, \"Like A Stone\" is another huge rock hit. It seems like Zuckerberg enjoyed the sound of banging drums and wailing guitar.\n\nNow this one is a nostalgia trip.\n\nYou can't help but feel something when Douglas Robb croons out, \"I'm not a perfect person.\" Was Zuckerberg a perfect person? Most people who have watched \"The Social Network\" would say no.\n\nIt's a romantic song. After considering their flaws, Robb sings out that they've found a reason to change. \"The reason is you,\" he repeats, over and over.\n\nZuckerberg met his wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2003, one year before this playlist's date. Maybe he was thinking of her.\n\nHe'd be less happy to hear that the song reemerged on TikTok — a Meta competitor — in a 2021 trend.\n\nWe all knew that Zuckerberg liked rap. He recorded his own version of T-Pain's \"Get Low\" in tribute to his wife. He also started dressing like Eminem.\n\n\"In the End\" is peak 2010s emo rap-rock. One of its refrains is \"I tried so hard.\" Zuckerberg did try so hard — he often worked till late into the night.\n\nThe song is more pessimistic in its outlook: \"In the end, it doesn't even matter.\" Zuckerberg would likely disagree here. He tried so hard — and in the end, it did matter. Meta is now a trillion-dollar company.\n\nHard pivot! After four hard rock tunes, Zuckerberg's last song leans into synth-funk.\n\nThe lyrics here feel self-explanatory for Zuckerberg's workplace ethos: \"Work it harder, make it better / Do it faster, makes us stronger / More than ever, hour after hour / Work is never over.\"\n\nAfter Meta's year of intensity, I'm sure that some of Zuckerberg's employees can relate.\n\nAlso, the Daft Punk helmet doesn't look that different from a Meta Quest.",

    "fullText": "Duane “Dog the Bounty Hunter” Chapman’s stepson Gregory Zecca is facing life behind bars if convicted of aggravated manslaughter after fatally shooting his teenage son.\n\nFlorida’s Collier County Sheriff’s Office posted an update on the July 2025 incident via Facebook on Tuesday, February 3, stating that Zecca accidentally shot his child, Anthony, 13, in the family’s Naples, Florida, apartment while allegedly under the influence of alcohol. Local Southwest Florida news outlet WINK News was first to report on the update.\n\nPer the Sheriff’s Office, Zecca, 39, was taken into custody “on a warrant for aggravated manslaughter of a child with a firearm and using a firearm while under the influence,” which could result in a life sentence.\n\nA Collier County police investigation into Zecca, who is the son of Dog’s wife, Francie Chapman, from a previous marriage, found that Zecca allegedly “consumed alcohol over several hours at a local establishment, purchased more alcohol, and later used both alcohol and marijuana at a friend's residence.”\n\nChase Chrisley Breaks Down His Drinking Habits and Battery Arrest: ‘Hit Rock Bottom’\n\nZecca and his son were “watching a UFC fight on TV at the time.”\n\nLaw enforcement also reported that Zecca “repeatedly handled a firearm in his son's presence, practicing drawing it from his waistband and dry-firing.” The firearm had “initially been made safe by removing the magazine and clearing a live round from the chamber.”\n\nFurther detail stated that the magazine was put back into the firearm before Zecca “discharged a single shot” that struck Anthony.\n\nSheriff Kevin Rambosk stated in the update that the event “was a heartbreaking and preventable tragedy.”\n\nFormer UFC Champion Cain Velasquez Sentenced to Prison in Attempted Murder Case\n\nRambosk added, “Our detectives conducted an exhaustive and thorough investigation, examining every element of what happened through witness statements, forensic testing, subpoenas, search warrants, and more.”\n\nPolice officials also noted that deputies who arrived at the scene “detected the odor of alcohol on Zecca and observed marijuana in plain view.”\n\nA subsequent toxicology report estimated Zecca's “blood-alcohol concentration to be approximately 0.116 at the time of the shooting, above Florida's legal limit of 0.08.”\n\nZecca was placed on a psychiatric hold following the shooting. A family representative told TMZ one day after the incident occurred that Zecca was “under observation on a 5150 hold,” which meant that he had been involuntarily detained for 72 hours after being deemed “a danger to themselves, to others, or gravely disabled,” per Clear Behavior Health.\n\nBachelorette’s DeAnna Pappas Celebrates Son’s 9th Birthday After Arrest, Incident With Ex\n\nThe rep also told the outlet at the time that the hold was instigated because Zecca was “overcome with grief” and not because he felt guilty of a crime.\n\nDog released a statement via the outlet in the shooting’s aftermath. “We are grieving as a family over this incomprehensible tragic accident and would ask for continued prayers as we grieve the loss of our beloved grandson, Anthony,” Dog and Francie both wrote at the time.\n\nZecca also disabled his Instagram account after the incident. Prior to the account’s disappearance, Zecca had posted photos of himself with Anthony, including one image that showed the pair at a shooting range.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

    "fullText": "New US-owned app struggled with a storm and was accused of blocking content critical of Trump – can it recover?\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m Blake Montgomery, writing to you from Doha, where I’m moderating panels about AI and investing as part of the Web Summit Qatar.\n\nI want to bring your attention to the impact of a Guardian story. In December, we published a story, “‘A black hole’: families and police say tech giants delay investigations in child abuse and drug cases”, about grieving families and law enforcement officers who say that Meta and Snapchat have slowed down criminal investigations. (The tech companies contend that they cooperate.) This month, Colorado lawmakers introduced a bill to compel social media platforms to respond to warrants in 72 hours.\n\nNearly two weeks ago, TikTok stepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life. It endured a major outage that stifled users’ ability to upload videos, which fueled a fierce user backlash over perceived censorship. Now it’s facing an ascendant competitor and an inquiry by the California governor.\n\nTikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The day after the deal closed, its new owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection.\n\nDuring the weekend that followed, the US weathered a fearsome winter storm and the killing of an American citizen by federal immigration agents. Both knocked TikTok off its feet.\n\nWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on. The app suffered severe outages as a result. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings. Many of those same users cried censorship as they tried to express their outrage over Alex Pretti’s death via TikTok and found they could not. Prominent personalities said they would leave the app.\n\nAfter days of outcry, TikTok issued a statement ascribing the problems to the snow, ice and cold. That did not stop California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, from announcing the next day that his office would investigate the app’s alleged suppression of content critical of Donald Trump.\n\nTikTok’s late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. Upscrolled’s founder said in a conversation at the Web Summit Qatar that the app now boasts more than 2.5 million users.\n\nWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well, though.\n\nElon Musk had more extensive ties to Epstein than previously known, emails show\n\nTesla discontinues Model X and S vehicles as Elon Musk pivots to robotics\n\nTwo dramas, both showing in New York, are highlighting how our collective anxieties about technology have shifted in the decade between their premieres.\n\nMarjorie Prime, now revived on Broadway but first staged in 2014, follows Tess (Cynthia Nixon), as she deals with the ageing, death and robotic recreation of her mother (June Squibb). The world of the play features “Primes”, android lookalikes of real people that attempt to emulate them for the comfort of those left behind, which Tess and her mother both engage with. Picture an Alexa, but it’s your dead husband, grandmother, etc. The play brings to mind the early worries about Siri, which debuted three years before the play. Since then, we’ve seen our own real-life versions of Primes: millions of people have digitally copied their deceased loved ones to varying degrees of uncanniness and success. Though its predictions are no longer far-fetched, the play remains moving. I found it touching.\n\nData, which premiered off Broadway last week, follows the talented young programmer Maneesh (Karan Brar) after he joins Athena Technologies, a clear analogue for the very real company Palantir. Maneesh is inducted into the company’s most elite team, data analytics, where he learns about clandestine work with the US government. He struggles with the ethics of the project. He wrestles with whether to expose it to the world in hopes of tanking it or keeping his head down. The play’s themes are quite familiar. They were playing out in headlines two days before I attended, and the Guardian has published stories about them.\n\nData is paced and plotted like a political thriller, more like House of Cards than Her. Seeing the two plays within a week of each other, I was struck by how much our concerns with tech have moved from the realm of science fiction into that of realism. Marjorie Prime is less literally concerned with tech, more with its emotional consequences. Data is about what it means to literally work as a software engineer. It seems unlikely to me that a play about the ethics of software in US bureaucracy could have sustained any tension in an era before this one.\n\nMarjorie Prime imagines a melancholy future; Data chronicles a version of the unpleasant present. The very real events of the previous year and Silicon Valley’s entanglement with the Trump administration loom over Data, for better and for worse. The play could not be more timely; it may feel dated by the end of year. Watching it felt like reading a yarn in the Wall Street Journal (or the Guardian, if I’m flattering myself).\n\nI am curious to observe which play ages better. Data serves as a real-time, red-hot record of our current moment, which may cool quickly. During the play, I was intrigued by some of its villains’ seemingly nefarious arguments in favor of the company’s work. What if the main character exposes the evil in the press and nothing happens, as his boss says? I have been part of multiple news cycles where that has been the case. What will plucky 22-year-old Maneesh do then? The question presents a more interesting, nuanced response to reality than Maneesh’s black-and-white, do-or-die plan to blow things up. By contrast, Marjorie Prime’s sentient artificial intelligence acts as a vehicle to discuss the age-old grief of a parent’s death and its aftermath.\n\nThe central question that both plays ask is not, in the end, one explicitly about technology, but about how to keep living beneath crushing weight. In Marjorie Prime, Tess struggles with the repetitiveness of her days and the robotic, constant reminder of her mother. She eventually succumbs to her despair, replaced by a robot herself, which torments her grieving husband with its pale simulation. In Data’s final, devastating scene, the secondary hero, Riley (Sophia Lillis, who gives the play’s best performance), asks how she can just go back to work, plagued as she is by moral concerns but trapped by monetary need, after failing to stop the company’s work. She trembles as her phone beeps, reminding her she’s late for her next meeting.\n\nWhat is Moltbook?

    "fullText": "The AI bot social network Moltbook has riled up the internet. Meta's CTO isn't so intrigued.\n\nMoltbook is a Reddit-like forum that is exclusively meant for AI agents to chat among themselves; no humans allowed. Asked about the viral site in an Instagram Q&A, Andrew Bosworth said that he didn't \"find it particularly interesting.\"\n\nBosworth said that AI agents were trained on thousands of pieces of content from the internet. These training materials were written by humans, and thus have our voice.\n\n\"We should not be surprised, when left to their own devices and forced to speak with each other, they talk like us,\" he said.\n\nWhat Bosworth was more interested in was humans trying to infiltrate the AI-only network. Some researchers have suggested that humans have influenced Moltbook by commanding their bots to act in certain ways — or sometimes even hacking in themselves.\n\n\"That I did find hilarious,\" Bosworth said. \"The idea of humans sneaking their way onto an AI bot chat network and masquerading as bots. That I found satirical.\"\n\nOn TBPN, Moltbook creator Matt Schlicht said that humans were integral to the agents. They use the bots as their helpers and assistants; the forum is merely the bots' \"third space.\"\n\n\"You are imprinting part of your soul or your personality onto the bot,\" Schlicht said. \"Maybe it's aligned with who you are, and sometimes maybe it's surprising.\"\n\nSchlicht might disagree with Bosworth that the human escapades are what make Moltbook \"hilarious.\" In fact, part of his goal was to make AI funny.\n\n\"I find myself laughing at some of the different things that are popping up here,\" Schlicht said on TBPN. \"I don't remember the last time I laughed at AI.\"\n\nBosworth concluded his message by doubling down on the idea that humans were the funny ones, not the AI bots.\n\n\"I enjoyed that,\" he said. \"Otherwise, I don't think it's actually that interesting.\"",

Musk folded social media ​platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution.

    "fullText": "New Mexico attorney general accuses Meta of failing to safeguard children against trafficking and sexual abuse\n\nMeta’s second major trial of 2026 over alleged harms to children begins on Monday.\n\nThe landmark jury trial in Santa Fe pits the New Mexico attorney general’s office against the social media giant. The state alleges that the company knowingly enabled predators to use Facebook and Instagram to exploit children.\n\nThe trial will introduce evidence that Raúl Torrez, the state’s attorney general, believes shows how Meta’s social networks create dangerous environments for children, exposing them to sexual exploitation, solicitation, sextortion and human trafficking.\n\nThe lawsuit states that Meta’s design choices and profit incentives prioritized engagement over child safety and that it failed to implement effective safeguards. The state accuses the company of allowing unmoderated groups devoted to commercial sex and of facilitating the buying, selling, and sharing of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\n\n“While the New Mexico attorney general makes sensationalist, irrelevant and distracting arguments by cherry-picking select documents, we’re focused on demonstrating our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,” a Meta spokesperson said.\n\n“For over a decade, we’ve listened to parents, worked with experts and law enforcement, and conducted in-depth research to understand the issues that matter most. We use these insights to make meaningful changes – like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens’ experiences. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made, and we’re always working to do better.”\n\nThe lawsuit follows a two-year Guardian investigation, published in 2023, which revealed that the tech giant was struggling to prevent people from using its platforms to traffick children. The investigation is cited several times in the suit’s filings. In an interview with the Guardian in 2024, Torrez said he believes Meta is the “largest marketplace for predators and paedophiles globally”.\n\nAfter a week of jury selection, opening statements are set to begin on 9 February, followed by the presentation of evidence. The proceedings are expected to be about seven weeks long.\n\nSocial media companies have long maintained they are not responsible for crimes committed via their networks because of a US federal law that generally protects platforms from legal liability for content created by their users, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Meta’s attempts to invoke section 230 and the first amendment to get the case dismissed were ultimately denied in a judge’s ruling in June 2024, due to the lawsuit’s focus on Meta’s platform product design and other non-speech issues, such as internal decisions about content and curation.\n\nThe New Mexico trial comes just a week after a high-profile case began in Los Angeles, in which hundreds of US families and schools allege that Meta, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube have harmed children. The plaintiffs in the LA lawsuit allege the platforms knowingly addicted young users, leading to depression, eating disorders, self-harm and other mental health problems. The proceedings involve about 1,600 plaintiffs, including more than 350 families and 250 school districts. Snap and TikTok reached settlements with the plaintiffs, while Meta and YouTube remain on trial. Each company has denied wrongdoing.\n\n“The fact that these cases are going to trial proves the section 230 dam is breaking and social media platforms,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project. “These are the trials of a generation; just as the world watched courtrooms hold big tobacco and big pharma accountable, we will for the first time see big tech CEOs take the stand.”\n\nKey witnesses for the plaintiffs in the New Mexico suit are expected to include educators and law enforcement officials, who will speak about the alleged harms and crimes they have witnessed take place on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and whistleblowers, who may reveal internal company discussions. Teens and families who have experienced harm on the platforms are not anticipated to take the stand.\n\nTorrez and his team have already taken Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg’s deposition, and may play portions of it in court if he does not attend. New Mexico’s jurisdiction limits its ability to compel out-of-state witnesses to testify in person.\n\nOn the lawsuit’s journey to the courtroom, the attorney general’s office has made several disclosures with fresh allegations. They include that Meta may have profited by placing advertisements from companies such as Walmart and Match Group alongside content that sexualized children, according to internal documents and emails.\n\nInternal Meta documents obtained by the attorney general’s office show the company estimates that roughly 100,000 children on Facebook and Instagram experience online sexual harassment each day. Filings unveiled chat excerpts of users allegedly discussing how to lure minors into engaging with them sexually. A former Instagram employee testified in 2023 before Congress that his own daughter had received unwanted sexual advances on Instagram. When he notified senior Meta leadership, he said he was ignored.\n\nAmong the evidence expected to be presented in court are details of the 2024 arrest of three men charged with sexually preying on children through Meta’s platforms. This was part of an investigation dubbed “Operation MetaPhile” by the attorney general’s office. Undercover agents posing as children were contacted by the suspects, who allegedly solicited them for sex after finding minors through design features on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe agents did not initiate any conversations about sexual activity, according to the state attorney general. Following a surge of activity from adults to one of these undercover agent’s accounts, Meta did not shut it down, and instead sent it information about how to monetize accounts and grow followings.\n\nA filing last week revealed allegations that Zuckerberg approved allowing minors to access AI chatbot companions despite warnings from the company’s safety staff that the bots could engage in sexual interactions. Internal emails and messages cited in the filings reportedly show that “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots”.\n\nThe documents detail an internal chat in March 2024 about parental controls for minors using AI chatbots on Meta’s platforms; one employee asked whether parents could disable the chatbots for their children. Another employee responded that it was a “Mark-level decision that parents cannot turn it off”.",

    "description": "Igor Tsvetkov says he faced a \"lot of stress\" as a senior staff engineer at Meta. But securing a demotion isn't easy, he said. Now, he's at Google.",
    "fullText": "There are dozens and dozens of guides on how to ask for a promotion. What about a demotion?\n\nIgor Tsvetkov spent over a year as a senior staff software engineer at Meta, coming from a background at Google and Cruise. Then he posted on LinkedIn, describing how difficult he found it to try to blend into Meta's culture — and why he decided to ask for a downward shift in title.\n\n\"I did not fit in perfectly,\" Tsvetkov wrote in the December post, describing the need for intimate systems knowledge and credibility among leaders at his rank. \"It is very hard to achieve all of that when you join as a new hire from another company and work from a remote office.\"\n\nHis slow ramp-up caused a \"lot of stress,\" he wrote, and he eventually wished for a demotion — before jumping back to Google.\n\nOn \"The Peterman Pod,\" Tsvetkov recently described his Meta story in more detail. During performance reviews, Tsvetkov said he knew he was being judged against other senior staff engineers. He also knew that Meta laid off low performers.\n\n\"What it means is: you have at most one year to ramp up to be comparable in performance to other old-timers at the company,\" Tsvetkov said.\n\nTsvetkov needed to \"start from zero,\" he said. On day one, he said he knew less than the intern sitting next to him. Within the year and two months that he spent at Meta, Tsvetkov guessed that he had reached the performance of an E6 software engineer — if he was \"generous\" — but not the E7 he was hired to be.\n\nHe also learned he didn't want to be an E7. Coding and debugging were what Tsvetkov loved about his job, he said, but those skills are rarely practiced at that high a level.\n\nWhile Tsvetkov's experience is not necessarily representative of what other Meta engineers experience, it captures how difficult it can be to make career moves at the senior level, across tech and beyond. Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTsvetkov eventually said he asked management: \"Can I actually drop a level?\"\n\nThat's difficult for Meta, he recognized. His stock grants and compensation were already determined. There is a demotion process at Meta — like when a director wants to become an individual contributor — but dropping a single level on the same team was more challenging, Tsvetkov said.\n\nTsvetkov said he was told no. Maybe if he pushed harder, or went to a vice president, the answer would have been different, he said.\n\n\"I also felt like I was too far outside my comfort zone,\" he added. \"I worked at Google for 14 and a half years. That was my comfort zone.\"\n\nA Google recruiter had been contacting Tsvetkov periodically, asking whether he was ready to return. He finally said yes.",

    "fullText": "App endured a major outage and user backlash over perceived censorship. Now it’s facing an inquiry by the California governor and an ascendant competitor\n\nA little more than one week ago, TikTok stepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life.\n\nTikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The app’s time under Chinese ownership had been marked by a meteoric ascent to more than a billion users, which left incumbents such as Instagram looking like the next Myspace. But TikTok’s short new life in the US has been less than auspicious.\n\nThe day after TikTok’s arrival, its owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection, including tracking the precise locations of its users. The change was notable less for any potential invasion of privacy than for suspicion of the new owners. The updated policy falls in line with those of other major social networks. But what did these men, among them billionaire Oracle owner and Maga donor Larry Ellison, intend to do with the user data? The tweaks aroused suspicion that would blossom into paranoia just a few days later.\n\nDuring the weekend that followed the transfer of TikTok’s ownership, the US weathered two major events. A hefty, frigid snowstorm slammed the country and put about 230 million people on alert for power outages and burst pipes. And federal immigration officers killed a 37-year-old US citizen in Minneapolis during a protest, which elicited outright lies from the White House despite copious video footage. Both would knock TikTok off its feet, though in different ways.\n\nWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on, which the company did not make public at the time. The app suffered severe outages as a result, according to a statement from the company. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings.\n\nSimultaneously, prominent personalities were attempting to use TikTok to express their outrage over the violent death of Alex Pretti at the hands and guns of border patrol agents. They found they could not post videos or that they received zero views. In response, many users – among them California state senator Scott Weiner, musician Billie Eilish and her brother, and comedian Meg Stalter – accused TikTok of stifling videos critical of federal immigration agents. Stalter said she would delete her account, which boasts nearly 280,000 followers. Media outlets far and wide – the New York Times, Variety, the Independent, CNN, the Washington Post – picked up their claims. Cosmopolitan magazine asked: “Is TikTok Censoring Anti-ICE Content?” The Democratic senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, tweeted that TikTok’s alleged censorship was a “threat to democracy”.\n\nAfter days of outcry online, IRL scrutiny and likely dozens of requests for clarification from the press, TikTok issued a statement blaming the problems on the snow, ice and cold on 26 January.\n\nOracle issued a statement with more detail: “Over the weekend, an Oracle datacenter experienced a temporary weather-related power outage which impacted TikTok. The challenges US TikTok users may be experiencing are the result of technical issues that followed the power outage.” It is uncommon for a physical event like a storm to wound a major site of digital life like TikTok, as such popular apps often have backups to their backups, but it can happen.\n\nThe most powerful figure to accuse TikTok of censorship was not its most famous user. The governor of California is better known for his textual presence on X than his TikToks. Nevertheless, Gavin Newsom announced on 27 January that his office would investigate whether TikTok had censored videos critical of Donald Trump, broadening the scope of alleged pro-Maga interference by the app.\n\nThe late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. An unknown number of users said they were decamping from the new American TikTok in response to its perceived censorship. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. An Upscrolled press release now claims more than a million users. As of writing, TikTok rests at No 16 in the iPhone App Store and 10th in the Google Play Store. Alongside Upscrolled in the top 10 most downloaded are three apps used to cloak online activity from surveillance, which are known as virtual private networks (VPNs). A fear of digital government incursions is in the air.\n\nWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. Facebook and Instagram have withstood far graver scandals than this. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well for its future, though. The app has damaged user trust, and another misstep may inflict a more lasting injury.\n\nTikTok’s week of mayhem began with Trump. The transfer of TikTok’s ownership consummated the ban-or-sell deal the US president proposed nearly six years ago, and he said he was thrilled that that the transfer had finally taken place. In the intervening years, Trump had walked back his support for the deal; his enemy Joe Biden had supported it during his presidency; Congress had passed a law codifying Trump’s wishes and legally forcing TikTok’s sale; and the US supreme court had ratified the law in the face of a challenge by TikTok and immense popular disapproval. Then Trump ordered the immigration crackdown that set the stage for the killing of two US citizens. The only aspect of TikTok’s miserable week Trump had no hand in was the winter weather.\n\nTikTok’s disastrous arrival marks an anniversary of a similar bungled nature. One year and two weeks ago, the app stopped functioning in the US because of the same sell-or-ban law that precipitated the sale. That darkening lasted less than 24 hours. Its new owners can only hope their present problems go away just as soon.",

    "fullText": "A lawsuit filed last week alleges tech firm ‘can access virtually all’ private communications, a claim the company has denied\n\nUS authorities have reportedly investigated claims that Meta can read users’ encrypted chats on the WhatsApp messaging platform, which it owns.\n\nThe reports follow a lawsuit filed last week, which claimed Meta “can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications”.\n\nMeta has denied the allegation, reported by Bloomberg, calling the lawsuit’s claim “categorically false and absurd”. It suggested the claim was a tactic to support the NSO Group, an Israeli firm that develops spyware used against activists and journalists, and which recently lost a lawsuit brought by WhatsApp.\n\nThe firm that filed last week’s lawsuit against Meta, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, attributes the allegation to unnamed “courageous” whistleblowers from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa.\n\nQuinn Emanuel is, in a separate case, helping to represent the NSO Group in its appeal against a judgment from a US federal court last year, which ordered it to pay $167m to WhatsApp for violating its terms of service in its deployment of Pegasus spyware against more than 1,400 users.\n\n“We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines,” said Carl Woog, a Meta spokesperson, in a statement. “This is the same firm that is trying to help NSO overturn an injunction that barred their operations for targeting journalists and government officials with spyware.”\n\nAdam Wolfson, a partner at Quinn Emanuel said: “Our colleagues’ defence of NSO on appeal has nothing to do with the facts disclosed to us and which form the basis of the lawsuit we brought for worldwide WhatsApp users.\n\n“We look forward to moving forward with those claims and note WhatsApp’s denials have all been carefully worded in a way that stops short of denying the central allegation in the complaint – that Meta has the ability to read WhatsApp messages, regardless of its claims about end-to-end encryption.”\n\nSteven Murdoch, professor of security engineering at UCL, said the lawsuit was “a bit strange”. “It seems to be going mostly on whistleblowers, and we don’t know much about them or their credibility,” he said. “I would be very surprised if what they are claiming is actually true.”\n\nIf WhatsApp were, indeed, reading users’ messages, this was likely to have been discovered by staff and would end the business, he said. “It’s very hard to keep secrets inside a company. If there was something as scandalous as this going on, I think it’s very likely that it would have leaked out from someone within WhatsApp.”\n\nThe Bloomberg article cites reports and interviews from officials within the US Department of Commerce in claiming that the US has investigated whether Meta could read WhatsApp messages. However, a spokesperson for the department called these assertions “unsubstantiated”.\n\nWhatsApp bills itself as an end-to-end encrypted platform, which means that messages can be read only by their sender and recipient, and are not decoded by a server in the middle.\n\nThis contrasts with some other messaging apps, such as Telegram, which encrypt messages between a sender and its own servers, preventing third parties from reading the messages, but allowing them – in theory – to be decoded and read by Telegram itself.\n\nA senior executive in the technology sector told the Guardian that WhatsApp’s vaunted privacy “leaves much to be desired”, given the platform’s willingness to collect metadata on its users, such as their profile information, their contact lists, and who they speak to and when.\n\nHowever, the “idea that WhatsApp can selectively and retroactively access the content of [end-to-end encrypted] individual chats is a mathematical impossibility”, he said.\n\nWoog, of Meta, said: “We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines. WhatsApp’s encryption remains secure and we’ll continue to stand up against those trying to deny people’s right to private communication.”",

    "fullText": "Becoming parents has changed more than just the work schedules for Silicon Valley's elite, according to the \"father of the iPod.\"\n\nTony Fadell, the former Apple executive who invented the popular music player, said that founders he's worked with think differently about privacy issues after going through the life-changing experience of having kids.\n\n\"I remember a marked way difference in the way I thought about the world before I had kids and after I had kids,\" Fadell told Eric Newcomer during a recent interview on the journalist's podcast.\n\nFadell said that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin think about the world \"in a very different way\" now than before they had kids or were married.\n\n\"'I want everything all the time. I'll give away all my privacy. I don't care what happens with all this data,'\" Fadell said, describing the pre-parenthood viewpoint. \"As soon as you have kids and you start hearing about deepfakes, and you start hearing about social engineering, and you start hearing about all this other stuff, you start changing your view on how much data you want sucked up and how you're being protected.\"\n\nZuckerberg has previously spoken about how becoming a parent changed how he led Facebook, now Meta. Zuckerberg and his wife, pediatrician and philanthropist Priscilla Chan. Their eldest child was born in 2015.\n\n\"Having kids does change how you think about the world in a pretty dramatic way,\" Zuckerberg told students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in 2017, according to a CNBC report of his remarks.\n\nPage has two children with his wife, research scientist Lucinda Southworth. Brin has three children, two with his first wife Anne Wojcicki, the founder of genetics testing company 23andMe, and one with Nicole Shanahan, the founder of a legal-tech startup and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s former vice presidential running mate in the 2024 election.\n\nOn the broader issue of children, privacy, and AI, Congress and regulators around the globe are closely scrutinizing tech companies.\n\nElon Musk's xAI is facing probes ranging from the California Attorney General's office to Britain's Ofcom over Grok generating sexualized images of real people, including minors, without their permission. On January 14, xAI said it had implemented measures to prevent the Grok account from generating such images on the platform, though tests showed Grok continued to produce sexualized images of real people within the Grok app.\n\n\"We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X Rules,\"xAI's official account said in a post on X.\n\nIn August, a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider that the company was changing how its AI chatbots respond to children. Congressional lawmakers had pressed the social network after Reuters reported that internal Meta documents showed it was acceptable for a chatbot to engage in romantic conversations with children.\n\nFadell and Newcomer discussed how society, and even company leaders, might approach AI-enabled devices that require access to large amounts of personal data, including real-time inputs, to be truly revolutionary.\n\n\"I know for a fact I worked with these guys, some of these founders, that they think about the world differently, and they wish they would've made some different moves and different decisions early on, and would like to go back, but they can't,\" Fadell said.",

Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts sued Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, leading to a series of landmark trials that began this week. Jury selection in the first case started on Tuesday in Los Angeles court.\n\nMeta’s Mark Zuckerberg is among the big tech CEOs who are expected to testify. Both sides are likely to bring in experts to hash out the science behind alleged addiction to social media.\n\nThe initial trial involves a 20-year-old, identified by the initials KGM, who alleges she experienced physical and emotional harm after becoming addicted to social media at age 10. This case is expected to last six to eight weeks, and will be the first of about 22 “bellwether” trials. The outcome can signal, and influence, how courts and juries may handle similar lawsuits in the future. Snap and TikTok have settled with the plaintiff in the first case, leaving Meta and YouTube to stand trial.\n\n“Everybody’s looking at it as a data point,” said Benjamin Zipursky, a law professor at Fordham University.\n\nThe legal proceedings follow years of heated criticism of tech companies from angry parents; they blame social networks for causing eating disorders, suicidal thoughts and anxiety in their children. The companies lay blame on the victims, plaintiffs’ lawyers and supporters say: “The tech companies blame parents for not being good parents,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, which has been involved in advocacy work for the plaintiffs. “Their experience has shown that you can be the best parent in the world – you can have conversations, you can limit screen time, you can turn on the bullshit parental controls – and your kid still dies.”\n\nThe cases and future settlements could eventually change the way social media platforms work; plaintiffs are asking for money, as well as injunctive relief that would establish industry-wide safety standards. Legislators around the world are watching; many are trying to impose liability on tech companies in a similar way as the plaintiffs. So even if juries declare the defendants aren’t liable in these cases, lawmakers will be taking notes–and adapting their own strategies, says Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University school of law. Some have already enacted laws that align with the plaintiff’s claims.\n\nThere’s more at stake now, legal experts say. “Bad press about how some members of Congress embarrass Zuckerberg is one thing,” Zipursky added. Changing the architecture of a social network may be another entirely.\n\nPlaintiffs want to know: how much did tech companies know about the alleged harm caused by their products, and to what extent did they fail to warn users? They take particular issue with design features such as infinite scroll, autoplay and content curated by algorithms, accusing social media companies of prioritising engagement over wellbeing. Their legal strategy has brought up comparisons with those used against tobacco companies in the 1990s.\n\nThe trial will explore what social media addiction consists of. Tech companies have questioned the scientific link between their platforms and addiction. They also highlight various safety features and parental controls they adopted in recent years. Even if this harm exists, they argue, it’s a result of problematic content, as opposed to a poorly designed system. In doing so, the companies have often relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for third-party content on their platforms: section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That defense hasn’t worked so far in this case, given the plaintiffs’ novel argument.\n\n“[Plaintiffs] have reconfigured it to say, look: the wrongful thing Meta is doing is running its whole platform in such a way that people get addicted,” Zipursky said. A key issue will be whether plaintiffs can prove the tech companies were wrongfully taking harmful risks, Zipursky added. Moreover, if the plaintiffs can prove that tech companies knowingly and intentionally caused harm, it will be easier to get punitive damages.\n\nSocial media addiction is not included in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the authoritative handbook for mental health treatment. Scientists have, however, catalogued compulsive use with severe consequences among young people, and legislators across the world are engaged in heated debate over its addictive potential and how to respond.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan and Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri are expected to testify in the initial trial. Snap and TikTok reached a settlement in that case but are still defendants in other suits in the state-level trial.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said in an emailed comment that they strongly disagree with these allegations, and stressed that they have listened to parents and worked with experts and law enforcement to address safety issues. The company also cited the introduction of teen accounts, with additional protections.\n\nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda called allegations in the lawsuits “simply not true”, and emphasized that the company had prioritized providing a safe and healthy experience for young people. Snap commented only on the first bellwether trial, saying they were “pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner”. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile much of the cases is yet to play out, some unsealed evidence has already drawn criticism of tech companies. That includes allegations that an Instagram employee compared the app to a drug, and that another suggested: “lol, we’re basically pushers.” A Meta spokesperson previously told Politico that the plaintiffs’ allegations relied on “cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture”.\n\nThe 20-year-old at the center of the initial trial started using social media around age 10, even as her mother tried to stop her from using the apps. She “developed a compulsion to engage with those products nonstop” as a result of their “addictive design” and “constant notifications”, the complaint notes, according to NPR.\n\nLegal experts expect all of these cases will eventually be appealed if they don’t reach a settlement, and there’s no certainty about outcomes until appellate courts have weighed in. They expect tech companies to raise several issues, including whether the Communications Decency Act or first amendment applies, as well as potential disputes over causation and expert testimony. “None of these companies are going to feel that they need to change what they do,” Zipursky said.\n\nStill, juries’ verdicts in the early cases can affect how much companies may pay out. “The jury might signal they’re completely persuaded by the plaintiff’s arguments,” Goldman said. “Then, if there’s any settlement, the price tag will go up substantially.”",

    "title": "CEO Mark Zuckerberg says Meta's AI story is about where it's headed, not just one model",
    "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses AI strategy, highlighting steady progress over breakthrough models, with Wall Street awaiting results.",
    "fullText": "CEO Mark Zuckerberg didn't come to Meta's earnings call on Wednesday promising a breakthrough AI model that would silence the skeptics.\n\nInstead, he offered something more careful: a bet on momentum.\n\n\"I expect our first models will be good,\" Zuckerberg said in his opening remarks, \"but more importantly, we'll show the rapid trajectory that we're on, and then I expect us to steadily push the frontier over the course of the year as we continue to release new models.\"\n\nIn June, Meta launched a new AI initiative, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), headed by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang. When Wall Street sought signs that this big, costly AI reset is working, Zuckerberg had a different ask: patience and faith that a steady drumbeat of releases in 2026 will matter more than a single big reveal.\n\n\"The AI strategy articulated on the call may leave some wanting more,\" wrote Barclays analyst Ross Sandler in a note to clients, \"but there was an underlying confidence and clearly a lot of new things in the works.\"\n\nZuckerberg said he could not yet share details of the company's AI strategy on the call and that it would roll out its initial set of models and products over the coming months.\n\n\"I think my answers to a lot of your questions on this particular call may be somewhat unfulfilling because we're in this interesting period where we've been rebuilding our AI effort. And we're six months into that, and I'm happy with how it's going,\" he said.\n\nThat didn't stop some analysts from pressing the CEO. When JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth asked Zuckerberg \n\n\"The first set of things that we put out, I think, are going to be more about showing the trajectory that we're on rather than being a single moment in time,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nBrian Mulberry, an analyst at Zacks Investment Management, told Business Insider that there was \"no real substance to any of Zuckerberg's comments that would move our analysis one way or the other.\"\n\n\"We want to see real bottom-line profits driven by AI, and it seems that Meta is still far from that reality,\" Mulberry said.\n\nRoger Beharry Lall, a research director at IDC, told Business Insider that Zuckerberg's remarks about the company's coming AI models and their \"trajectory\" show that the company is ambitious, though the lack of concrete information means its goals \"remain largely aspirational.\"\n\nMeta's financials show that its AI work is already improving its advertising business. The company said improvements to how it ranks and shows ads led to 3.5% more clicks on Facebook and over 1% gain in conversions on Instagram in the final quarter of 2025.\n\nMeta's revenue jumped 24% to $59.9 billion in the last three months of 2025, and the company generated $43.6 billion in free cash flow in 2025 even as it spent heavily on AI infrastructure. Ad impressions jumped 18% from this time last year, and what advertisers paid for each ad rose 6%.\n\nThat combination explains why Meta can afford to keep spending on AI even while Zuckerberg asks investors to wait for the bigger breakthroughs.\n\nMeta's patient approach carries some risk given the company's recent track record. In August, Business Insider reported that the company was pushing to release the next version of its Llama AI model by the end of the year, which didn't happen.\n\nLlama's previous release in April disappointed developers who said it lagged in coding and reasoning, precisely the capabilities that matter most in the AI race that Meta wants to catch up in.\n\nMeta's new model, called \"Mango\", will focus on images and videos, while another one called \"Avocado\" will be better at coding, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nSome analysts said that Zuckerberg's restraint may simply reflect Meta's early stage in its AI reset.\n\n\"Training the model with this new team is going to take a while,\" Mandeep Singh, Bloomberg Intelligence's global head of technology research, told Business Insider.\n\nTo make up ground, he expects Meta to sharpen its focus and specialize in certain areas, rather than \"trying to beat everyone everywhere all at once.\"\n\nSingh said that Meta's strong advertising business gave it a lot of runway.\n\n\"This kind of growth rate allows you a lot of cushion in terms of taking your time and getting AI,\" he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Diana Bahadori was better known online as Baby Rider, a 19-year-old Iranian motorbike influencer whose high-octane Instagram videos drew tens of thousands of followers. Her videos captured her precise cornering and fearless control of superbikes in a country where women riding motorcycles without a headscarf is illegal and often viewed as an act of defiance.\n\nAs of late January, global media reports and activist sources say Bahadori was killed by security forces during ongoing anti-government protests in northern Iran.\n\nAccording to independent Iranian news outlets such as IranWire, Bahadori was shot twice with live ammunition by Iranian security forces in the city of Gorgan around midnight on January 9. After her disappearance, her family searched for her for two days and only received her body on January 11.\n\nThe circumstances of her death have sparked outrage in Iran and among human rights advocates abroad.\n\nThe Iranian government and state media have offered conflicting explanations for what happened to Bahadori. Official statements circulated on her Instagram account claimed she died in a motorbike accident and urged followers not to spread rumors about her death.\n\nIndependent sources, however, say that her family was pressured by intelligence and security agencies to publicly deny responsibility by government forces as a condition of getting her body back. Reports allege that her burial was carried out quietly and without public acknowledgement because of those pressures.\n\nWhat has made this case especially compelling for international audiences is the way it encapsulates the intersecting forces at play in Iran’s current turmoil. The protests first began in late December, triggered by a rapid collapse of the Iranian rial and deepening economic distress.\n\nThey quickly expanded into a simmering revolt against the policies and leadership of Iran’s Supreme Leader and the country’s clerical establishment. Women’s rights, personal freedoms, strict moral codes, and broader political repression have all turned into rallying points for demonstrators across the nation.\n\nBahadori represented a generation of young Iranians pushing up against the boundaries of what is socially and legally acceptable in their society. She had amassed more than 100,000 followers on Instagram by showcasing her riding skills and a kind of vibrant modern lifestyle that many young Iranians find inspiring.\n\nIn a society with strict codes on dress, movement, and gender, a woman confidently riding a powerful motorbike was inherently symbolic.\n\nSocial media activists and diaspora Iranian journalists have invoked Bahadori’s story in the same tradition as earlier cases of young Iranians killed during uprisings. In 2009, the killing of Neda Agha-Soltan by militia forces during protests became a defining moment widely shared on the internet and broadcast abroad.\n\nLook at this beautiful girl. She was full of love and joy for life.\nEven with all the restrictions and bans in Iran, she broke the rules and followed her passion. A strong, fearless young woman who went against the Islamic Republic’s laws that say women can’t ride motorcycles,… pic.twitter.com/fLsGPr0PeF\n\n— Masih Alinejad 🏳️ (@AlinejadMasih) January 26, 2026\n\nHer death galvanized international attention and helped shape the narrative of the Green Movement. Other protest deaths in recent years have similarly sparked anger over state violence and information control.\n\nIranian activist Masih Alinejad took to social media to condemn the treatment of Bahadori, saying the young woman’s only crime was being born under a regime that cannot tolerate the very image of youthful independence.\n\nLook at this beautiful girl, Alinejad wrote. She was full of love and joy for life. Even with all the restrictions and bans in Iran, she broke the rules and followed her passion.\n\nIt remains difficult to independently verify precise details from inside Iran because of restricted press access and government censorship. Independent journalists and human rights groups rely on family accounts, activist networks, and digital communication channels to piece together events that may otherwise go unreported.\n\nNonetheless, international coverage and reporting from outlets like IranWire and multiple global news services have repeatedly cited the core elements of Bahadori’s death.\n\nFor many observers, the loss of Baby Rider is tragic, and a stark reminder of the costs borne by young people in societies marked by political repression and generational conflict. It raises urgent questions about how authoritarian governments respond when a youthful challenge to cultural norms meets fierce political dissent.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's SpaceX and xAI are in discussions to merge ahead of a blockbuster public offering planned for later this year. The combination would bring Musk’s rockets, Starlink satellites, the X social media platform and Grok AI chatbot under one roof, according to a person briefed on the matter and two ​recent company filings seen by Reuters.\n\nHow could space-based data centers reduce AI costs?\n\nWhat would the proposed SpaceX-xAI merger involve?\n\nWhat defense applications are planned for merged companies?\n\nWhy is Musk combining his different business ventures?\n\nThe plan, which Reuters is reporting exclusively, would give fresh momentum to SpaceX’s effort to launch data centers into orbit as Musk battles for supremacy in the rapidly ‌escalating AI race against tech giants like Google, Meta and OpenAI.\n\nMusk, the world's richest man, is the CEO of both the private space company SpaceX and the artificial intelligence company xAI, which controls his social media platform X. He also runs electric automaker Tesla, tunnel ‌company The Boring Co. and neurotechnology company Neuralink.\n\nMusk, SpaceX, and xAI did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nUnder the proposed merger, shares of xAI would be exchanged for shares in SpaceX. Two entities have been set up in Nevada to facilitate the transaction, the person said.\n\nCorporate filings in Nevada show that those entities were set up on January 21. One of them, a limited liability company, lists SpaceX and Bret Johnsen, the company's chief financial officer, as managing members, while the other lists Johnsen as the company's only officer, the filings show.\n\nThe filings don't contain additional information about the purpose of the companies ⁠or their role in any deal.\n\nJohnsen did not respond to a Reuters ‌request for comment.\n\nThe person, who requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential, said that some xAI executives could be given the option to receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal. A final agreement, however, hasn't been signed, and the timing and structure of the transaction remain fluid, the person cautioned.\n\nSpaceX is already the world's most ‍valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share sale. xAI was valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal. Reuters and other media have reported that SpaceX plans to go public some time this year, with a valuation expected above $1 trillion.\n\nThrough xAI, Musk is building out a massive supercomputer for AI training in Memphis, Tennessee, called Colossus. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI as part of the startup’s $5 billion equity ​fundraising, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.",

    "description": "Meta stock surged on Thursday as Q4 earnings beat estimates and investors welcomed more big AI spending plans from the Facebook parent.",
    "fullText": "The move: Meta Platforms stock jumped 9% on Thursday after earnings, erasing losses from the previous week. The stock is up 10% year-to-date.\n\nWhy: Meta reported Q4 2025 earnings on Wednesday after close, coming in above Wall Street estimates on both top and bottom line metrics. It posted revenue of $59.9 billion, versus the forecasted $58.4 billion, and earnings per share of $8.88, versus the $8.16 consensus.\n\nImportantly, the social media giant also revealed that it plans to spend $115 billion to $135 billion on AI in the coming year, a substantial increase from the $72.22 billion it spent on AI in 2025 and well above Wall Street's expectations for 2026.\n\nDespite balking at its big spending plans announced in its last quarterly earnings, Wall Street reacted favorably to the news.\n\nThe key difference this time around seems to be that the company's quarterly advertising revenue came in well above expectations. CFO Susan Li fueled confidence in Meta's growth plans when she said on the earnings call that the company's AI endeavors would be financed with cash rather than debt, likely generated by its advertising success.\n\nWhat it means: The earnings were a key update on the AI race, showing that the company is successfully generating cash from other areas to fund its AI ambitions. It's the kind of strength investors want to see after last year ended with Wall Street growing anxious about soaring capex among hyperscalers.\n\n\"Ongoing investments across the business, including the infusion of AI capabilities across the company's ad stack and content recommendation engines, are already driving tangible benefits for the core advertising segment,\" stated Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.",

    "description": "There's only one life-giving product from Meta. Zuck just killed it.",
    "fullText": "As much as nearly all of Meta's products are part of my daily life  —  Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, even the Ray Ban smart glasses  —  I can't say that any of them make me feel more alive. Except the one that Meta just killed.\n\nSupernatural, the Meta-owned VR fitness app, has been my constant cardio companion since 2022. For about 45 minutes each day, I slip on Meta's Quest headset and smash through shiny targets flying at me with virtual baseball bats synced to the beat of Taylor Swift, Madonna, Imagine Dragons, Eminem, Coldplay, and many others in my living room. Throughout the workout, which Supernatural calls \"flow,\" my body drips with sweat, and my breath explodes in thunderous bursts. More than anything, I'm transported into a meditative state I haven't found in any other physical activity: reality fades away as I become one with the action.\n\nSupernatural, however, is fading away too. Earlier this month, Meta decided to lay off its entire staff — including its effusive, cheerleading coaches — along with 1,500 other employees in Meta's Reality Labs division. Some other VR gaming studios that Meta owned got the ax too. \"We're still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we hoped,\" Andrew Bosworth, Meta's CTO, told Sources, a tech newsletter, last week. \"And so you want to make sure that your investment is right-sized.\"\n\nFor now, the app itself isn't going anywhere. Instead, it will continue to exist as a snapshot, frozen in time with no additional workouts. But users are worried that it might start rotting away as licenses to the songs expire and workouts get pulled.\n\nAccessing Supernatural needs ponying up for a $300 Quest and a $10 monthly subscription fee — a big reason why it never gained mainstream popularity. But it still has a passionate — and vocal — fanbase, which is punching back, even as Meta deprioritzes the metaverse to make room for all-out investment in AI.\n\nIn the app's official 113,000-member Facebook community, a relentlessly upbeat feed of sweaty selfies from silver-haired seniors and retired moms, Supernatural's unlikely connoisseurs, Meta's announcement landed like an unexpected email from HR announcing that everyone had been laid off.\n\n\"I feel like I've been kicked in the stomach,\" one person posted. \"I feel like I'm going to puke!\" wrote another. \"Supernatural is my only reason to go into VR!\"\n\n\"Four years of Supernatural,\" posted another one. \"Almost every single day. I feel BETRAYED. I feel let down. I feel angry.\"\n\nMany others wrote long, emotional paeans about how the workouts helped them drop the pounds, reverse diabetes, or simply get through a rough patch in life. \"This is a huge loss, especially now with the state the US is in,\" one user wrote. \"Supernatural has been the best escape from reality for me and I'm so heartbroken.\"\n\nLike all successful Meta products since Zuckerberg first built Facebook in his dorm room, Supernatural was an acquisition. In 2022, when Meta sought to buy Within Unlimited, the Los Angeles-based VR startup that made Supernatural, for more than $400 million, the Federal Trade Commission tried to block the sale. Then-FTC chair Lina Khan argued that the deal would harm competition by allowing Meta to simply purchase a top player in VR fitness rather than build its own rival app. A year later, Meta prevailed. The Information, a tech news website, called the FTC's move a \"head-scratcher\" and a \"ridiculous sideshow.\"\n\nNow Khan is having an I-told-you-so moment. \"This is exactly what antitrust laws are designed to prevent: a dominant platform eliminating choice by buying up the competition and then abandoning the market when corporate priorities shift,\" she told me in a statement. Courts and enforcers, Khan added, should learn from this cautionary tale, \"especially as they evaluate Meta's acquisitions in artificial intelligence and other emerging markets.\"\n\nSome of Meta's employees are also concerned. \"It makes no sense to decimate studios you acquired,\" says a Reality Labs employee who wished to stay anonymous. \"It lowers your credibility. You will have trouble buying others in the future. But Meta does this a lot and also cancels useful things.\" Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJulia Meyer, a 47-year-old single mother from Texas who was once a Supernatural beta tester, tells me that after hearing the news about killing the app she had named her Roomba \"Mark Suckerberg.\" \"Roombas are not smart,\" Meyer says. \"They suck up everything around them, and they make no distinction as to what it is they're sucking up  —  be it carpet or dirt or your pet's tail. They just consume and bumble around. And that's pretty much the view I have of Mark Zuckerberg.\"\n\n\"There's such a community that was built with this,\" says Karla Mellinger, a 64-year-old Supernatural fan from Massachusetts who bought her first Quest headset with her COVID stimulus check. \"And now they're killing it, and it's a shame, because it helped a lot of people. Mark Zuckerberg can kiss my ass.\"\n\nPalmer Luckey, who sold his VR company, Oculus, to Meta for $2 billion in 2014, argued that the layoffs are actually a good thing. In a long post on X, which Bosworth retweeted, Luckey argued that Meta's acquisition of gaming studios made it harder for independent developers to compete. \"Change always sucks because people lose their jobs in the process,\" Luckey wrote, \"but in a world of limited resources, Meta heavily subsidizing their own (with money, marketing, placement, etc) at the expense of core technical progress and platform stability doesn't make sense.\"\n\n\"I am sure that closing Supernatural made sense somewhere on a spreadsheet to some bean counter at Meta,\" John Hansknecht, a 62-year-old engineer from Johns Island in South Carolina, tells me. \"I don't think Mark Zuckerberg even knows how many people love this program.\" Last week, Hansknecht started a Change.org petition to \"Save Supernatural,\" demanding that Meta either revamp the app itself, or spin it off, so it can be \"supported by community funding or subscription models.\" It currently has just over 7,000 signatures.\n\nOther Supernatural superfans are taking craftier action. One user begged Zuck's would-be cage fight foe Elon Musk to buy the app from Meta. \"If there were ever a product worth saving, continuing, or reimagining under leadership that values innovation, health, and long-term impact, this is it,\" they wrote. \"This isn't just about software. It's about the health and well-being of thousands of Americans.\" Others asked Taylor Swift to take over.\n\nSome users tried to start a campaign to log in to Supernatural at the same time to \"crash the servers\" to get Zuckerberg's attention  —  until someone pointed out that a few thousand people would be unlikely to jam a company whose platforms are used by more than three billion people every day.\n\nWhat happened to Supernatural isn't supernatural: Tech companies have a storied tradition of taking a product with a small but fiercely devoted user base, deciding it's not \"core,\" and euthanizing it with a blog post. From Google Reader in 2013 to Pebble smartwatch when it was acquired by Fitbit in 2016 to previous Meta products like Facebook Paper and the video-call device Portal, the graveyard of tech projects with avid followings put to bed after the numbers didn't justify the continued spend is vast. The details change, but the ending is always the same: the product gets \"sunset,\" the community mourns, and the company announces it's focusing on the Next Big Thing. (Supernatural did not even get a blog post. There was no final goodbye, no last workout, no closing lap. \"They didn't just pull the plug,\" wrote one user in a blog post. \"They gave it a farewell drink with a turd in it.\")\n\nWhen I spoke to Lisa Messeri, an associate professor of anthropology at Yale and author of a 2024 book about VR 'In the Land of the Unreal,' I asked her a question many Supernatural users I interviewed kept asking themselves: Is it ethical when a corporation collects years of physical and emotional data from an app that functioned as a form of self-care for thousands of people, and then pulls the rug out for a pivot?\n\n\"The question is, why did we ever think that corporations were ethical in the first place?\" Messeri says. For decades, the tech industry has benefited from what she calls an \"endurable myth\": that better technology automatically equals social progress. Messeri points to Google's original motto ,  \"Don't Be Evil,\"   as \"the kind of grace that we gave tech companies.\"\n\nSeen through that lens, the backlash against Meta over Supernatural isn't just about losing a fitness app. It's the whiplash of thousands of people realizing that something they treated as a routine, a community, and even a mental health lifeline, was never anything more than a plaything of billionaires. \"Part of the anger that you're seeing \"is coming from this feeling of betrayal that comes with an enduring belief in that myth,\" Messeri says.\n\nFive years ago, smarting from years of backlash over Facebook's role in the 2016 election, Cambridge Analytica, and damaging whistleblower revelations, Mark Zuckerberg rebranded his company as Meta, hitching its identity to a vision of the future he called the \"metaverse.\"\n\nIts defining quality, Zuckerberg wrote, \"will be a feeling of presence — like you are right there with another person or in another place. Feeling truly present with another person is the ultimate dream of social technology. That is why we are focused on building this.\" Since then, Meta has sunk more than $70 billion into making Zuckerberg's vision a reality, with little to show for it. It burned nearly $20 billion in 2025 alone.\n\nSupernatural, arguably, was the closest the company ever came to realizing it :  a truly immersive experience that made you feel like you were hanging out, laughing, and sweating to the beat of great music on the surface of the moon, or Mars, or on top of a volcano, or in the Alps, along with strangers from all over the country.\n\nUltimately, Meta's mission is to build value for its shareholders, Messeri says. \"It's not to build the metaverse or to pioneer AI technologies. When it seemed like VR or the metaverse could do it, they happily acquired all of these companies.\" Now that the VR winter has set in, she added, \"it just doesn't make sense for them.\"\n\nMeta's new goal, Zuckerberg announced in the summer of 2025, is building \"personal superintelligence\" —as long as we make smart glasses with built-in cameras and microphones that can \"see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day,\" our primary computing devices.\n\nTo help build this new vision, Meta has invested billions of dollars in building data centers across the country and hired top AI researchers and engineers from rivals such as Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Apple, among others. So far, the company has had little to show for it.\n\nSome of Supernatural's most passionate fans aren't convinced. \"I think sometimes Zuckerberg isn't great with his decision-making,\" Hansknecht says. \"I think he's putting all his chips on the AI glasses, and I just don't see society buying into it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he's still planning to keep paying Meta for his Supernatural subscription \"until the wheels fall off,\" he says. \"I hope that my headset doesn't just become an anchor for my boat.\"\n\nPranav Dixit is the Meta Correspondent at Business Insider based in the San Francisco Bay Area.",

    "fullText": "Heading into Wednesday's hoy trinity of earnings — which saw Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla report within five minutes of each other — everyone knew that updates on AI progress would be the only game in town.\n\nHow those results ended up playing out shed crucial light on where we are in the AI trade right now.\n\nThe overarching focus for the Big Tech trio was not who has immediately seen results from AI investment. Instead, it was whether those companies were doing enough to support the appearance of maybe, eventually doing something. Investors love the prospect of future upside, and want a reason to preserve their optimism.\n\nEach of the three companies showcased this trend in their own unique way. Let's go one by one:\n\nLast quarter, Meta was punished for its capex-spending plans. This quarter, the company once again blew the doors off spending forecasts … but this time the market seemed OK with it.\n\nWhat changed? Look no further than the company's stronger-than-expected first-quarter revenue, driven by a big beat in advertising. Meta CFO Susan Li also got investors hyped on the earnings call by saying the company will fund its AI ambitions primarily with cash, rather than debt.\n\nIn the end, it's not that Meta has tangible proof that its AI spending is going to generate monstrous future earnings growth. The company has instead fallen back on its cash-cow advertising business to alleviate financing pressures and buy itself more time.\n\nWe haven't yet gotten an answer about whether the AI spending will pay off. We just know the company can afford to keep pursuing it.\n\nMarket reception: Very positive\n\nI present the counterpoint to Meta's well-received quarter. Microsoft also announced much larger-than-expected spending plans … and its stock fell.\n\nThe difference? One of Microsoft's main cash cows — its Azure cloud-computing unit — showed slowing growth. Suddenly, big spending doesn't look so appealing when your backstop is weakening.\n\nWhile Tesla's AI push has taken the form of self-driving vehicles and robotics, the company's lofty valuation is still being largely driven by hopes that big AI-linked profits will one day be unlocked.\n\nBut unlike Meta, the EV-maker is doing it at a time when its core business is in decline. One overlooked highlight of Tesla's report was that — even though the company posted a bottom-line beat — it also saw first-ever decline in annual revenue.\n\nIt didn't matter. Investors instead focused on Tesla's $2 billion investment in xAI, the company owned by Elon Musk. They also seemed to take the discontinuation of the Model S and Y vehicles in stride.\n\nAgain, the perception of eventually monetizing AI won out. In the AI race, it's not what you're doing, it's what you can convince everyone you're going to do down the line.",

    "description": "Meta's Q4 2025 earnings reveal massive AI investment plans, ad-driven revenue growth, and costly Reality Labs losses.",
    "fullText": "Meta's earnings sent a clear signal to Wall Street on Wednesday: while its core advertising engine is still firing on all cylinders, the price tag for CEO Mark Zuckerberg's AI ambitions will skyrocket in 2026.\n\nThe company reported $59.89 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025, topping Wall Street's forecasts. Meta's stock jumped as high as 10% in after-hours trading.\n\nAlongside the upbeat numbers, Meta laid out how hard it plans to push in 2026. The company said it expects to spend $115 billion to $135 billion next year on capital expenditures — largely on the computers and data centers that power AI.\n\nIn other words, Meta still makes most of its money from ads. It's asking investors to stay on board as it pours an extraordinary amount of cash into the race to build more powerful AI and weave it into Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and virtual and augmented reality products, collectively used by more than 3.5 billion people daily around the world.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Meta's Q4 2025 earnings call.\n\nMeta told to brace for a much more expensive 2026 as it pours money into the compute and data centers needed to power its AI push. The company said it expects capital expenditures in 2026 to land between $115 billion and $135 billion — up to almost double the $72 billion it spent in 2025.\n\nMeta's chief financial officer, Susan Li, said the increased expenditure will support Meta Superintelligence Labs' efforts and its core business.\n\nLi also warned that Meta's overall costs are set to climb fast. The company expects total 2026 expenses of $162 billion to $169 billion, with most of the increase coming from \"infrastructure costs,\" including \"third-party cloud spend, higher depreciation, and higher infrastructure operating expenses.\"\n\nAnd Meta isn't just buying more machines — it's also paying for people to run them. Li said the \"second-largest contributor\" to expense growth will be compensation, driven by \"investments in technical talent,\" including hires in \"priority areas, particularly AI.\"\n\nAdvertising once again powered Meta's quarter. The company reported $58.14 billion in ad revenue in Q4 2025, up 24% from the same time last year. That growth came from a mix of showing more ads (ad impressions rose 18% from the same quarter last year) and charging a bit more per ad (average price per ad rose 6%).\n\nWhen analysts pressed Zuckerberg on whether Meta can build meaningful businesses beyond ads, given how much cash it's pouring into AI, he didn't dodge the question of its dependency.\n\n\"For the next couple of years, ads are going to be by far the most important driver of growth in our business,\" Zuckerberg said, adding that Meta is working on new bets alongside that core engine.\n\nMeta's pitch is that its AI investments are already making the ad machine work better — not just by targeting, but by improving the systems that decide which ads people will most likely engage with.\n\nThe company said that its AI tools for making video ads hit a $10 billion revenue run rate. It also said a newer measurement product helped advertisers drive 24% more conversions than its standard method — and ramped up to a multi-billion-dollar annual run rate in just seven months.\n\nReality Labs, the division behind Meta's virtual and augmented reality efforts, continued to burn cash in the final quarter of 2025. The division lost $6.02 billion in a quarter, the highest ever, and $19.19 billion in 2025 — numbers that underscore how much Meta's ambitions to build immersive worlds still depend on ad revenue.\n\nDespite laying off about 1,500 people at Reality Labs earlier this month, Meta told investors not to expect a sudden turnaround. Li said the company expects Reality Labs' operating losses in 2026 to remain \"similar to 2025 levels.\"\n\nZuckerberg is trying to reposition what Reality Labs is building. The company's focus has shifted from trying to go all in on the \"metaverse\" to building AI-powered smart glasses and experiences that could live inside Meta's existing apps.\n\nWhen Barclays analyst Ross Sandler asked about Meta's plans to bring Horizon Worlds, a virtual hangout zone accessible on the company's Quest VR headsets, to mobile, Zuckerberg said that he expects more \"interactive and immersive\" content formats to show up directly inside the feeds in Meta's existing apps.\n\nHe added that people might be able to use AI to create a game with a single prompt and share it on their feeds so that others can \"jump right into it.\"\n\nHe positioned Horizon Worlds as a natural fit for an \"immersive 3D\" version of that idea and said that Meta's work on VR software and Horizon could pair with AI advances to bring these kinds of experiences to \"hundreds of millions and billions of people through mobile.\"\n\nMeta isn't just trying to sprinkle AI features across Facebook and Instagram. Zuckerberg is making a bigger argument: if Meta wants to shape the next generation of consumer tech, it needs to control the underlying AI, not just depend on whatever rivals sell.\n\nThat's also the framing behind his public push for \"personal superintelligence,\" which he called out again as a key focus for 2026.\n\nWhen Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski asked how critical it is for Meta to have a general-purpose model, Zuckerberg leaned into Meta's identity as a \"deep technology company.\"\n\nWhat allows Meta to build everything it does, he said, \"is that we build and control the underlying technology.\" That way, Meta can design the experiences it wants, \"and not just be constrained to what others in the ecosystem are building or allow us to build,\" Zuckerberg added.\n\nHe suggested that relying on outside models could become risky over time, citing a mix of competitive and safety reasons. That's why, he said, it's important for Meta to have its own models, both from a business perspective and because Meta wants to \"actually design and build the experiences that we believe that we should be building for people.\"\n\nZuckerberg is pitching 2026 as the year AI changes not just Meta's products, but how Meta itself operates. On the call, he said 2026 will be \"the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work\" and that the company is \"investing in AI native tooling so individuals at Meta can get more done.\"\n\nHe also described a deliberate shift in org design.\n\n\"We're elevating individual contributors and flattening teams,\" Zuckerberg said, adding that Meta is already seeing \"projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single, very talented person.\"\n\nLi paired that cultural pitch with a concrete productivity claim. She said that since the beginning of 2025, Meta has seen a \"30% increase in output per engineer\" overall, and that \"power users\" of its internal AI coding tools saw output rise 80% year-over-year.\n\nThe company's implied bet? Spend heavily on AI infrastructure and tooling, and then run leaner teams that can ship more.\n\nHave a tip? Contact Pranav Dixit via email at pranavdixit@protonmail.com or Signal at 1-408-905-9124.

    "description": "The Big Tech rivals are spending more than ever, but analysts are more concerned about Microsoft at the moment.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street had very different reactions to two of Big Tech's biggest spenders after quarterly earnings reports came out on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Meta and Microsoft reported higher-than-expected capex. While both companies beat revenue expectations, Microsoft's stock sank more than 6% after-hours, while Meta's stock jumped as high as 9%.\n\nBig Tech's spending has risen sharply in the last two years, driven by investments in massive AI data centers. Wall Street has started to question when those investments will pay off, and analysts are giving some companies a much harder time than others.\n\nMeta reported capex of $22.1 billion for the fourth quarter and $72.2 billion for the year, up from 2024's $39.2 billion. That number will climb in 2026 — the company estimates capex will be in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion for the year, driven by increased spending on Meta SuperIntelligence Labs, the company's big bet on speeding up AI model development.\n\n\"We plan to continue to prioritize investing in the business to support these opportunities,\" CFO Susan Li told investors on Wednesday's call.\n\nMicrosoft logged $37.5 billion in capex for the quarter, up 66% from one year ago. Most of that spend went toward CPUs and GPUs, the powerful computing chips that run AI workloads. The company said the spending was necessary to support fast-growing demand for its cloud and AI business.\n\nMicrosoft's revenue was 81.3 billion for the quarter, up 17% from the previous year. Meta reported $55.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter and $200.1 billion for all of 2025.\n\nWhile both surpassed Wall Street's revenue expectations, analysts gave Microsoft a much harder time than Meta over its surging capex.\n\nPart of that could be Microsoft's heavy investments in GPU chips, which can become costly given their short life spans.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Keith Weiss said that a core issue for investors, as Microsoft's capex grows faster than they expected, \"comes down to ROI on capex spend over time.\"\n\nMicrosoft is also heavily exposed to a single customer, another concern for investors. Nearly half — 45% — of the company's remaining performance obligations are attributed to OpenAI.\n\n\"There's obviously concern about the durability,\" Jeffries analyst Brent Thill said of the backlog.\n\nMicrosoft holds a $135 billion stake in OpenAI and has invested more than $13 billion into the company since 2019.\n\nWhile OpenAI does not directly carry a heavy debt load, some of its partners, including Oracle, CoreWeave, and Nvidia, have taken on massive amounts of debt to fund data center buildouts, fueling Wall Street's anxiety over a potential AI bubble.\n\nOracle is struggling to finance its $500 billion data center initiative, Business Insider reported last week, amid growing concerns about its credit rating and risk.\n\nOn the Meta earnings call, Li noted that Meta's cash reserves, thanks to its very profitable ad business, will fuel its AI spending spree next year.\n\n\"We have a strong net cash balance, and expect our business will continue to generate sufficient cash to fund our infrastructure investments in 2026,\" Li said.",

    "description": "Apple, OpenAI, Meta, and more are all racing toward AI hardware products.",
    "fullText": "Apple is working on a wearable device that will allow the user to take advantage of AI models, according to sources familiar with the product who spoke with tech publication The Information.\n\nThe product is said to be “the same size as an AirTag, only slightly thicker,” and will be worn as a pin, inviting comparisons to the failed Humane AI pin that launched to bad reviews and lackluster sales in 2024. The Humane product was criticized for sluggish performance and low battery life, but those shortcomings could potentially be addressed by Apple’s solution, should Apple offload the processing to a synced external device like an iPhone.\n\nThe Information’s sources don’t specify whether that’s the plan, or if it will be a standalone device.\n\nThe wearable will have a single physical button “along its edges” and will feature a speaker. It will have three microphones and two cameras (one regular and one wide-angle) for capturing information about the user’s surroundings. It will use a magnetic inductive wireless charging surface similar to the one used to charge the Apple Watch.\n\nThe report didn’t include any information about pricing, but it did say that Apple has fast-tracked the product with the hope to release it as early as 2027. Twenty million units are planned for launch, suggesting the company does not expect it to be a sensational consumer success at launch the way some of its past products, like AirPods, have been.\n\nNot long ago, it was reported that OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) plans to release its own hardware, though the specifics and form factor are not publicly known. Apple is expecting fierce competition there, as well as with Meta, which Apple already expected to compete with in the emerging and related smart glasses market.\n\nApple has experienced significant internal turmoil over AI, with former AI lead John Giannandrea’s conservative approach to the technology failing to lead to a usable, true LLM-based Siri or other products analysts expect would make Apply stay competitive in the space with other Big Tech companies.\n\nJust a few days ago, it was revealed that Apple will tap Google’s Gemini large language models for an LLM overhaul of Siri. Other AI-driven products like smart glasses and an in-home smart display are also planned.",

    "fullText": "Filing by New Mexico’s attorney general includes Meta staff emails objecting to AI companion policy\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, approved allowing minors to access artificial intelligence chatbot companions that safety staffers warned were capable of sexual interactions, according to internal Meta documents filed in a New Mexico state court case and made public on Monday.\n\nThe lawsuit – brought by the state’s attorney general, Raul Torrez, and scheduled for trial next month – alleges Meta “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children” on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe filing on Monday included internal Meta employee emails and messages obtained by the New Mexico attorney general’s office through legal discovery. The state alleges they show that “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots”, the attorney general said in the filing. Meta announced last week that it had removed teen access to AI companions entirely, pending creation of a new version of the chatbots.\n\nIn the communications, some of Meta’s safety staff expressed objections the company was building chatbots geared for companionship, including sexual and romantic interactions with users. The artificial intelligence chatbots were released in early 2024. The documents cited in the state’s filing Monday don’t include messages or memos authored by Zuckerberg.\n\nAndy Stone, a Meta spokesperson, on Monday said the state’s portrayal was inaccurate and relied on selective information: “This is yet another example of the New Mexico attorney general cherrypicking documents to paint a flawed and inaccurate picture.”\n\nMessages in the filing showed safety staff had special concern about the bots being used for romantic scenarios between adults and minors under the age of 18, referred to as “U18s”.\n\n“I don’t believe that creating and marketing a product that creates U18 romantic AI’s for adults is advisable or defensible,” wrote Ravi Sinha, head of Meta’s child safety policy, in January 2024.\n\nIn reply, Antigone Davis, Meta’s global safety head, agreed that safety staff should push to block adults from creating underage romantic companions because “it sexualizes minors”. Sinha and Davis did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAccording to one February 2024 message, a Meta employee whose name was redacted relayed that Zuckerberg believed that AI companions should be blocked from engaging in sexually “explicit” conversations with at least younger teens and that adults should not be able to interact with “U18 AIs for romance purposes”.\n\nA summary of a meeting dated 20 February 2024, said the CEO believed the “narrative should be framed around … general principles of choice and non-censorship”, that Meta should be “less restrictive than proposed”, and that he wanted to “allow adults to engage in racier conversation on topics like sex”.\n\nStone said the documents did not support New Mexico’s case. “Even these select documents clearly show Mark Zuckerberg giving the direction that explicit AIs shouldn’t be available to younger users and that adults shouldn’t be able to create under 18 AIs for romantic purposes.”\n\nMessages between two employees from March 2024 state that Zuckerberg had rejected creating parental controls for the chatbots, and that staffers were working on “Romance AI chatbots” that would be allowed for users under the age of 18.\n\nWe “pushed hard for parental controls to turn GenAI off – but GenAI leadership pushed back stating Mark decision”, one employee wrote in that exchange.\n\nNick Clegg, who was Meta’s head of global policy until early 2025, said in an email included in the court documents he thought Meta’s approach to sexualized AI companions was unwise.\n\nExpressing concern that sexual interactions could be the dominant use case for Meta’s AI companions by teenage users, Clegg said: “Is that really what we want these products to be known for (never mind the inevitable societal backlash which would ensue)?” Clegg did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeta’s AI chatbot policies eventually came to light, prompting a backlash in the US Congress and elsewhere.\n\nA Wall Street Journal article in April 2025 found that Meta’s chatbots included overtly sexualized underage characters and that they engaged in all-ages sexual roleplay, including graphic descriptions of prepubescent bodies. Reuters reported in August that Meta’s official guidelines for chatbots stated that it is “acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual”. In response to the report, Meta said it was changing its policies and that the internal document granting such approval had been in error.",

    "fullText": "Campaigners decry ties with ‘Trump-supporting’ tech firms after funding is accepted to develop state AI systems\n\nUK politics live – latest updates\n\nMinisters have accepted $1m (£728,000) from Meta, the US tech and social media company, to build AI systems for defence, national security and transport, sparking warnings about the UK government’s “alarmingly close relationship with Trump-supporting US tech giants”.\n\nThe money from Mark Zuckerberg’s company will be used to pay experts to “develop cutting-edge AI solutions … to support national security and defence teams”, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) announced on Tuesday.\n\nThe money will pay for four British AI experts, coordinated by the government-funded Alan Turing Institute, to “play a pivotal role in rewiring our healthcare, police, transport systems and more”, said Ian Murray, the minister for data and digital government.\n\nThe move comes after Meta executives had 50 meetings with ministers in the last two years for which data was available, one of the highest levels of direct access of any technology company, a Guardian investigation found.\n\nThe government is consulting on a ban on social media use by under-16s, which would have a major effect on Meta’s Instagram platform. Meta said the money had been allocated to the Alan Turing Institute before any ban was floated.\n\nAnnouncing the $1m deal, Meta said it was “proud to help bring top British AI talent into government, fast-tracking the transformation of public services”.\n\nDSIT said: “People across the UK could benefit from faster, safer and more reliable public services as leading British AI specialists join government to modernise critical systems used every day – from public safety to transport maintenance.”\n\nBut the tech justice campaign group Foxglove asked: “What’s Meta getting for its million dollars?” It added: “When it comes to big tech, there’s no such thing as a free lunch.”\n\n“This is yet more evidence of the UK government’s alarmingly close relationship with Trump-supporting US tech giants,” said Donald Campbell, Foxglove’s advocacy director. “It’s deeply worrying that ministers are still naive enough to swallow this kind of lobbying from a handful of Silicon Valley plutocrats – who have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt they do not have the British public’s best interests at heart.”\n\nDaisy Greenwell, a co-founder of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, said the deal “highlights an uncomfortable reality: tech giants spend vast sums to gain access and influence in policymaking”.\n\nShe added: “That makes it even more important that decisions about children and online safety are shaped by independent evidence and the public interest, not by the companies whose products are under scrutiny.”\n\nThe government also announced a new partnership with the San Francisco AI company Anthropic, which will build and pilot a dedicated assistant tool for public services on gov.uk, starting with a model that will give jobseekers career advice “and help to lock down a job”. Anthropic said the project implementation work was “pro bono”.\n\nDSIT said the technology was “part of a cutting-edge plan to use AI agents for national government services, with a pilot expected to begin later this year”. In October, Anthropic announced that the former prime minister Rishi Sunak was taking an advisory role at the $350bn startup. The former Downing Street chief of staff Liam Booth-Smith is a policy and communications adviser to Anthropic.\n\nThe deals come as ministers wrestle with policy decisions that directly affect Meta and Anthropic. As well as launching a consultation last week on banning social media use for under-16s, they are also due to set out changes to how creatives’ copyrighted works are protected from being mined to build AI models, such as those made by Anthropic.\n\nBeeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer who campaigns on child protection and copyright, said: “This government is walking into dependence on Silicon Valley, is undermining the chance to build a UK AI sector, and above all is busy giving away some of the most precious datasets in the world to Silicon Valley, who could well afford to pay.”\n\nThe Meta-funded AI experts will be tasked with using AI to develop models that analyse images and videos, enabling councils to prioritise transport infrastructure repairs more effectively. They will also “develop cutting-edge AI solutions which run offline or within secured networks to support national security and defence teams to make vital decisions while safeguarding sensitive data”, the government said.",

    "title": "Meta Is Testing Paid Subscriptions for Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook",
    "description": "Why would I want to pay for any of this?",
    "fullText": "It's possible the one thing that could universally break smartphone addiction is making social media pay-to-play. Right now, there is zero friction involved in opening Instagram or TikTok, and getting sucked into their algorithms. But add a paywall to those apps, and all of a sudden, I don't have any interest in logging on.\n\nIf that sounds like it'd work on you too, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that Meta will soon test a subscription model for Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. The bad news is that these subscriptions won't be required to actually access the app, or the core features you already know. That will remain free, so we will remain hopelessly addicted.\n\nThe details are light at the moment, especially concerning WhatsApp and Facebook. Meta told TechCrunch that the subscriptions will offer \"exclusive features\" on its apps, and will \"unlock more productivity and creativity, along with expanded AI capabilities.\" That will include more controls over how you share and connect with other users. Again, pretty vague.\n\nPerhaps part of this cloak-and-dagger approach is that Meta isn't really sure how it wants to roll out these subscriptions. The company explained to TechCrunch that it was testing a \"variety of subscription features and bundles,\" and that each app's subscription will feel unique from the others.\n\nWhile Meta isn't revealing much at this point, we might have a glimpse at what the company has in store for Instagram. Reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi posted on X that Instagram's paid subscription will include the option to create as many audience lists as you want, view a list of people you follow who don't follow you back, and—perhaps more enticing to some—look at another user's story without them knowing you saw it. Would you pay a monthly subscription to be able to lurk in other people's Instagram stories? (It's possible to do this already, by the way.)\n\nThere's another feature set that Meta plans to test subscriptions for that likely includes all three of these apps: AI features. Meta will experiment with subs for Vibes, the company's short-form AI video app built into Meta AI. The services has been free since it launched last fall, and will likely continue to be free, but Meta may charge for \"additional video creation opportunities.\"\n\nAs much as I'm reluctant to say so, this really is Meta doing subscriptions right. I wouldn't pay for any of these features, but it's not like the company is taking away previously free features and locking them behind a subscription. If companies like Meta want to integrate a subscription model, they need to offer new features and abilities to justify the price. I might not think these anticipated features are worth it, but at least the current apps as they exist will remain free—even if charging for them would get me to stop using them for good.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jason White, a 46-year-old startup founder in the San Jose area. Business Insider has verified his former employment with documentation. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've spent half of my 20 years in the tech industry working at Google and Meta. These companies allowed me to work on some amazing projects, but I've now resigned from them both.\n\nI joined Google in 2016 as a tech lead in the Gmail division and transitioned to the Google Search team in 2020. By 2024, I realized I wanted to lean more heavily into AI. I didn't feel my position at Google would give me the opportunity to do that, so I opened myself up to other opportunities.\n\nWhen a Meta recruiter reached out about an AI machine learning engineer role, I decided to pursue it and eventually received an offer. I left Google in July 2024 and started at Meta a month later.\n\nI had a positive experience at Meta. I worked with great people in a high-resource environment and learned a lot. I was also able to lean into AI as I'd hoped, focusing fully on AI products.\n\nHowever, halfway through 2025, I started thinking about resigning to build a startup — specifically, a venture that would use AI to help the typical household with their finances.\n\nWhether to resign from Meta was a complex decision.\n\nThe startup was something I was growing increasingly passionate about. I know what financial pressure feels like — I had been a low-paid graduate student trying to provide for a newborn.\n\nMany people don't have access to great financial planning and management tools to help improve their financial situations. While I was still figuring out what the business would look like, I felt there was an opportunity to help people, and that was very motivating for me.\n\nI connected with a potential cofounder — a friend of a friend — and we spent a lot of time talking through the opportunity. That helped me grow more comfortable with the idea of leaving Meta, but there were still a lot of other factors to consider.\n\nIt's hard to leave a world-class team with people you like — not to mention a reliable source of income.\n\nI know some people start businesses on the side while keeping their full-time jobs, but I couldn't do that because I was already juggling two demanding roles as a Meta employee and a parent.\n\nMy other concern was legal. I would've had to disclose any outside business to Meta, and there could've been non-compete issues — especially since my business idea was related to AI, like my role at Meta.\n\nI wanted to make sure my family had enough savings to cover at least one year of our current expenses without touching our retirement accounts. My wife works, but I wanted a cushion in case she lost her job. I figured that would give me at least one year to build the business, and, if things went really badly, enough time afterward to find a job.\n\nWe already were in a good place savings-wise, so we were still able to take vacations, hire tutors for our kids, and order DoorDash. I had about six months before resigning to make some minor adjustments, including cutting back on 401(k) contributions and putting more money into liquid savings accounts.\n\nThis financial planning process for my family really helped crystallize the direction I wanted to go with the startup. In September 2025, I resigned from Meta.\n\nWhen I shared the news with my colleagues, the response was a mix of surprise, support, and a large amount of jealousy. A lot of people want to leave and start their own thing, but for various reasons they can't or won't — whether it's because of their visa status, financial constraints, or broader fear.\n\nI'm now focused on my business, Bear Financial. My cofounder and I are planning to publicly launch in the second half of this year. We may seek external funding, but for now, we're bootstrapping the business, so I've tracked our spending very carefully.\n\nI have a few pieces of advice for people considering leaving their jobs to start their own business. First, get your finances in order. Second, make sure anyone who depends on you, like your family, is supportive of the decision — I was fortunate to have a supportive partner who knew that I felt limited working in Big Tech.\n\nThird, choose an idea you deeply believe in. With a startup, you have to be the one to bring the energy, the enthusiasm, the vision — and to carry others into it.\n\nAddress your knowledge gaps. Startup founders often need to be generalists, which means having a basic understanding of a lot of areas.\n\nI'd also suggest envisioning the worst-case outcome and asking yourself whether you'd be OK with it. I thought about what it would look like one year later if my business failed. I believe I'd still value everything I learned over those 12 months.\n\nIf I eventually decide to pursue a corporate position again, I have faith that I'd be able to find something — even though it's hard to predict what the job market will look like.\n\nThere are, however, a lot of potential barriers to success: we have to navigate a moving target on regulations, we need to figure out ways to convince potential customers to give us a try, and there are super well-resourced companies that could become direct competitors.\n\nAt the end of the day, I want to take the swing.",

    "description": "A mom in Maine shares how a viral Instagram video inspired her family to turn a kids' climbing structure into a DIY igloo. And it cost $0.",
    "fullText": "Years ago, we bought a geodesic climbing structure for my three kids, who were all under 5. We thought it would keep them entertained all year long without our supervision, but the reality could not be more different. The structure sat untouched through the seasons.\n\nOn Sunday, while preparing for the massive snowstorm that was headed toward Maine, Instagram fed me a reel of a couple building an igloo with the same climbing structure we have. I sent it to my husband, who came running from the room next door and said, \"We have to do this!\"\n\nIt turned out to be a hit with the kids, and it was surprisingly easy to pull off.\n\nThe video I watched showed the first step to making the igloo is wrapping the perimeter of the climbing structure tightly with plastic wrap.\n\nWe opted for a more eco-friendly option and decided to use king-size bed sheets. My husband had the idea to soak them in water first so they wouldn't blow away in the strong wind as we were prepping the igloo. We soaked them in a tub and carried them outside quickly. The temps in Maine were in the teens, so we had to drag the sheets across the climbing dome quickly. I was actually surprised at how quickly the sheets hardened in the cold air. We just wrapped the ends of the sheet around a pole and didn't need anything else to secure it in place.\n\nWe covered the entire structure, leaving one small triangle so the kids could crawl in and out of it, and had the rest of the dome totally covered.\n\nWe had tried something similar years earlier, and the sheets never hardened enough to stay on the dome. I didn't want to get my hopes up this time around, so we left the sheets and walked over to a friends' house to play before the snow.\n\nWe were back home when the storm had already started, and we could see snow accumulating on the dome. I really wanted to check on it regularly because I was worried the weight of the snow would collapse the igloo's roof. But I'm from Argentina, and I don't do well in negative temperatures, so I let it be and decided to check it in the morning.\n\nWe got absolutely dumped with snow overnight; it was the biggest snowstorm I've experienced since moving to Maine 6 years ago. And to my surprise, the igloo worked.\n\nImmediately, my kids were excited to climb inside, even exclaiming that it was way warmer in the igloo than outside it. They called over friends and neighbors, and they all played inside the igloo while I worked and my husband snowblowed around our house.\n\nIt's the first time that I copied something from a viral reel or TikTok video, and it really paid off. And the best part is that it costs us nothing.\n\nNext time we get a snowstorm warning, I at least know which sheets to pull out ASAP so we can start building quickly.",

    "description": "Attorneys for Meta Platforms and other social media companies asked a California federal judge on Monday to block several school districts from taking their",
    "fullText": "Jan 26 (Reuters) - Attorneys for Meta Platforms and other social media companies asked a California federal judge on Monday to block several school districts from taking their lawsuits against the companies to trial, arguing that federal law protects them from claims they ​knowingly addicted young users.\n\nAt a hearing before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, lawyers for the companies clashed with counsel ‌for six school districts from states across the country, who argue the platforms' design has harmed students' mental health and forced districts to spend money and staff time to address the fallout.\n\nThe companies urged ‌the judge to rule that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which generally shields platforms like Meta's Facebook and Instagram from liability over user-generated content, bars the cases from proceeding to the first trials in federal court over the claims.\n\nJonathan Blavin, an attorney for the social media companies, said the schools’ allegations rely on evidence that includes such content, placing the claims within the protections of Section 230.\n\n\"If that evidence is entirely excluded, I think the record here is incredibly thin,\" Blavin said. \"It's just ⁠not there.\"\n\nLawyers for the school districts countered that their ‌claims are not based on user-content but on platform features they say are intentionally designed to keep young people on the social media sites as long as possible.\n\nAndre Mura, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said their experts had examined broad studies of ‍students who had used social media to support their findings that it had harmed them.\n\n“The literature shows the increase in the risk of harm is not based on content,” he said.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS IN STATE, FEDERAL COURT\n\nMeta, Snapchat and parent Snap Inc., YouTube and parent Alphabet Inc., and TikTok and parent ByteDance are facing thousands of lawsuits in both federal and ​state court over claims they knowingly designed their platforms to have features that addict children and teens, fueling a mental health crisis.\n\nThe first trial testing ‌the claims in state court is slated for this week in Los Angeles.\n\nThe federal cases have been consolidated into multidistrict litigation before Rogers and include lawsuits brought by families, school districts and state governments.\n\nMonday's hearing focused only on cases filed by school districts, which claim they have been hurt financially from having to manage student mental health issues and social problems like cyberbullying. Rogers is considering whether to enter judgment for the companies in six of those lawsuits, selected as so-called \"bellwether\" or test cases, ahead of the first trials in federal court, currently scheduled to begin in June.\n\nBellwether trials are used to gauge how juries may respond to similar ⁠claims and help establish settlement values for the other similar cases in the litigation.\n\nIn rulings ​on the companies’ motions to dismiss in 2023 and 2024, Rogers said the cases could go ​forward, but Section 230 limited many of their claims, including some about specific features of the platforms.\n\nOn Monday, Rogers agreed that the plaintiffs had a lot of evidence that seemed to be based on content and said that should the cases go forward, there ‍would be a lengthy debate about what ⁠could be shown to the juries.\n\nBut even if the actual content played some role, Rogers said that juries were often asked to examine a problem with several causes and determine which were primarily to blame.\n\n“It’s not like we have a white and a yolk, it’s all scrambled together,” Rogers ⁠said. “That’s a very common circumstance. Why should this be any different?”\n\nThe case is In Re: Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury Products Liability Litigation, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District ‌of California, No. 4:22-md-03047.\n\nFor plaintiffs: Andre Mura of Gibbs Mura; Previn Warren of Motley Rice\n\nFor defendants: Jonathan Blavin of Munger Tolles & Olson; ‌Ashley Hardin of Williams & Connolly; Christian Pistilli of Covington & Burling",

    "title": "Meta Is Being Sued Over Whether WhatsApp Really Encrypts Your Messages",
    "description": "The lawsuit was filed by an international group of plaintiffs.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after Meta (then Facebook) bought WhatsApp in 2014, it promised to implement a surprisingly un-Facebooky feature: End-to-end encryption. The move was supposed to be a boon for privacy, ensuring nobody could see your messages aside from the recipient and yourself. Even now, WhatsApp's website claims, \"No one outside of the chat, not even WhatsApp, can read, listen to, or share [your messages].\" However, a new lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco is now claiming that's not the case.\n\nAccording to reporting from Bloomberg, an international group of plaintiffs has sued Meta, saying that the app's claims of end-to-end encryption are a lie. The lawsuit alleges that Meta and WhatsApp \"store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp user's purportedly 'private' communications.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs include users from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa, who are being represented by attorneys from several firms. The allegations cite \"whistleblowers\" who helped bring this information to light, but no more is known as of yet.\n\nWhen I reached out to Meta for comment, Meta strongly denied the allegations. The company called the lawsuit \"frivolous,\" assuring users that WhatsApp uses the open-source Signal protocol for encryption and adding that \"[a]ny claim that people's WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false and absurd.\"\n\nIf the lawsuit succeeds, it could affect billions of users around the world. That's because the plaintiffs' lawyers are asking the court to certify a class-action lawsuit.\n\nIn the meantime, WhatApp is far from the only option for encrypted messaging apps. While it's unclear how the lawsuit will proceed, those looking to jump ship might want to look at alternatives like Signal or Viber instead. Note that some apps, like Telegram, do offer end-to-end encryption, but don't enable it by default. (Personally I use Line, because of the anime stickers.)",

    "fullText": "At long last Zuffa Boxing is set to kick off its debut event later TONIGHT (Fri., Jan. 23, 2026) as Zuffa Boxing 1 is set to go down inside Meta’s Apex in Las Vegas, Nevada. Headlining the event — which will streaming live on Paramount+ — will be a Middleweight showdown between Irish sensation, Callum Walsh, taking on Carlos Ocampo.\n\nWalsh was Dana White’s first-ever signing to his upstart boxing promotion, so it makes sense to have him kickoff the debut event. “King” is undefeated (15-0) with 11 knockouts and is coming off a unanimous decision win over Fernando Vargas Jr. on the “Canelo vs. Crawford”-led undercard in Las Vegas, Nevada, back in Sept. 2025 (full results here). As for Ocampo, he is coming in with a record of 38-3 and is currently riding a three-fight win streak into a bout he hopes will give him the spotlight should he pull off the massive upset.\n\nIt’s an important night for White and Co. since the debut fight card to his boxing venture will either silence a lot of doubters (such as this one), or give them more fuel to spit verbal venom at him for trying to change things up to a combat sport that has marched to the beat of the same drum for decades.\n\nWe don’t expect it to be perfect, but all eyes will be on this event.\n\nMany readers check in before, during and after the fights to share their thoughts on all of the action, as the card kicks off at 6 p.m. ET on Paramount+.

    "fullText": "The Federal Trade Commission filed a notice on Tuesday appealing its loss in a lawsuit that accused Meta of breaking antitrust laws to protect a monopoly in social networking.\n\nAt a trial last year, Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia considered the government’s claims that Meta snuffed out nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago. He ruled in November that Meta had not broken the law.\n\n“Meta violated our antitrust laws when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp,” an agency spokesman, Joe Simonson, said. “Thankfully for Americans, there is an appeal process.”\n\nA Meta spokesman, Christopher Sgro, said in a statement that Judge Boasberg’s “decision to reject the F.T.C.’s arguments is correct, and recognizes the fierce competition we face.”\n\nThe F.T.C. is aiming to reverse a setback in the government’s campaign to rein in the power of the biggest tech companies. In the last two years, the government has won federal antitrust cases against Google, with judges saying the company has monopolies in online search and advertising technology. It has also sued Amazon and Apple over monopoly concerns.\n\nJudge Boasberg’s six-week trial in the lawsuit against Meta featured testimony from witnesses including Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, and an Instagram founder, Kevin Systrom.\n\nThe government argued that Meta bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014 to get rid of the threat posed by young competitors.\n\nJudge Boasberg ruled in favor of Meta’s arguments that changes in social media, including the growth of TikTok and YouTube, undercut the government’s case about Meta’s dominance.\n\nThe F.T.C.’s notice of appeal on Tuesday, filed in the District Court, is preliminary. The agency will lay out its legal argument for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit at a later date.",

    "fullText": "Yann LeCun is clear on his life goals — and being a leader is not one of them.\n\n\"I can do management, but I don't like doing it,\" Meta's former chief AI scientist said in an interview with MIT Technology Review published on Thursday.\n\n\"I kind of hated being a director,\" he said about his time at Meta's Fundamental AI Research (FAIR), a leading AI research lab he founded. \"I am not good at this career management thing. I'm much more visionary and a scientist.\"\n\nHe said his \"mission in life\" was not leadership, but to accelerate technological progress and inspire others to work on what interests them.\n\nIn November, LeCun announced his departure from Meta, where he had worked for 12 years, and said he would launch his own AI company.\n\nHis new startup, AMI Labs, focuses on building world models — a type of AI that closely reflects the real world. The Paris-based startup will work on open source solutions and be among the few frontier AI labs that he said are \"neither Chinese nor American.\"\n\nLeCun said that he would take on the role of executive chairman, while Alex LeBrun, his former colleague from Meta AI, will be the company's CEO. LeCun will continue teaching at NYU.\n\nIn the MIT interview, the AI pioneer said that he did not agree with all the choices Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made, such as letting go the robotics team inside FAIR.\n\nEarlier this month, he criticized the leadership of another Meta exec, Alexandr Wang, the former CEO of data labelling startup Scale AI. Meta invested $14.3 billion in the buzzy startup, which included hiring Wang to lead AI progress.\n\n\"There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher,\" LeCun said in an interview with the Financial Times.\n\nLeCun said that even though the 28-year-old was briefly his boss after Zuckerberg's AI reorg, he wasn't taking orders from Wang.\n\n\"You don't tell a researcher what to do,\" LeCun said. \"You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do.\"\n\nHe also made similar remarks about being a visionary instead of a leader in the FT interview.\n\n\"I'm pretty good at guessing what type of technology will work or not. But I can't be a CEO,\" LeCun, 65, said. \"I'm both too disorganized for this, and also too old.\"",

The fault instead lies with Meta, as Instagram is currently down. That's according to Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, which shows over 2,000 user reports of issues with Instagram at the time of this writing.\n\nThe issues seem to affect Instagram in all forms. While the mobile app was working last time I checked, I couldn't get it to load in Safari. That means you might not be able to check out posts, add new posts, or send and receive DMs—at least until Meta figures out what's causing the issue.\n\nInevitably, of course, it will: Outages and downtime happen, though it seems this week they're happening with increasing frequency. There was, obviously, Verizon (which the company attributes to a software issue), but also issues with Yahoo!, X, and Microsoft 365. Something's in the air this week, it seems. Whatever is going on with Instagram though, Meta will assuredly figure it in due time. Usually, these things are resolved pretty quickly, but if there's a deeper issue, us Instagram users may have to go without the app for some time.",

    "title": "Well, There Goes the Metaverse",
    "description": "The metaverse is on its last legs as VR is eclipsed by AI. But that's not the only thing that went wrong for Meta's VR ambitions.",
    "fullText": "Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept.\n\nAs industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices.\n\nIn part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more.\n\nMeta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta’s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets.\n\nFast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI.\n\nAccording to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel’s Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard’s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by GeekWire.\n\nAnd last week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well.\n\nThe news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers.\n\nUnlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit.\n\nIn total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending.\n\nBesides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate.\n\nThat model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments.\n\nMeta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers.\n\nSpecifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores.\n\n“This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.”\n\nHe proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey & Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030.\n\nMeta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size.\n\nThough there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity.\n\nFrom a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta.\n\nFor comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.\n\nOf course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)\n\nBut this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.\n\nEven before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy.\n\nAs bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.\n\nIn May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior.\n\nAt the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.\n\nThese types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.”\n\nAlso around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!)\n\nAnother nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week.\n\nWith an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.)\n\nWith other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass.\n\nCombined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models.",
