    "description": "Meta's Q4 2025 earnings reveal massive AI investment plans, ad-driven revenue growth, and costly Reality Labs losses.",
    "fullText": "Meta's earnings sent a clear signal to Wall Street on Wednesday: while its core advertising engine is still firing on all cylinders, the price tag for CEO Mark Zuckerberg's AI ambitions will skyrocket in 2026.\n\nThe company reported $59.89 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025, topping Wall Street's forecasts. Meta's stock jumped as high as 10% in after-hours trading.\n\nAlongside the upbeat numbers, Meta laid out how hard it plans to push in 2026. The company said it expects to spend $115 billion to $135 billion next year on capital expenditures — largely on the computers and data centers that power AI.\n\nIn other words, Meta still makes most of its money from ads. It's asking investors to stay on board as it pours an extraordinary amount of cash into the race to build more powerful AI and weave it into Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and virtual and augmented reality products, collectively used by more than 3.5 billion people daily around the world.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Meta's Q4 2025 earnings call.\n\nMeta told to brace for a much more expensive 2026 as it pours money into the compute and data centers needed to power its AI push. The company said it expects capital expenditures in 2026 to land between $115 billion and $135 billion — up to almost double the $72 billion it spent in 2025.\n\nMeta's chief financial officer, Susan Li, said the increased expenditure will support Meta Superintelligence Labs' efforts and its core business.\n\nLi also warned that Meta's overall costs are set to climb fast. The company expects total 2026 expenses of $162 billion to $169 billion, with most of the increase coming from \"infrastructure costs,\" including \"third-party cloud spend, higher depreciation, and higher infrastructure operating expenses.\"\n\nAnd Meta isn't just buying more machines — it's also paying for people to run them. Li said the \"second-largest contributor\" to expense growth will be compensation, driven by \"investments in technical talent,\" including hires in \"priority areas, particularly AI.\"\n\nAdvertising once again powered Meta's quarter. The company reported $58.14 billion in ad revenue in Q4 2025, up 24% from the same time last year. That growth came from a mix of showing more ads (ad impressions rose 18% from the same quarter last year) and charging a bit more per ad (average price per ad rose 6%).\n\nWhen analysts pressed Zuckerberg on whether Meta can build meaningful businesses beyond ads, given how much cash it's pouring into AI, he didn't dodge the question of its dependency.\n\n\"For the next couple of years, ads are going to be by far the most important driver of growth in our business,\" Zuckerberg said, adding that Meta is working on new bets alongside that core engine.\n\nMeta's pitch is that its AI investments are already making the ad machine work better — not just by targeting, but by improving the systems that decide which ads people will most likely engage with.\n\nThe company said that its AI tools for making video ads hit a $10 billion revenue run rate. It also said a newer measurement product helped advertisers drive 24% more conversions than its standard method — and ramped up to a multi-billion-dollar annual run rate in just seven months.\n\nReality Labs, the division behind Meta's virtual and augmented reality efforts, continued to burn cash in the final quarter of 2025. The division lost $6.02 billion in a quarter, the highest ever, and $19.19 billion in 2025 — numbers that underscore how much Meta's ambitions to build immersive worlds still depend on ad revenue.\n\nDespite laying off about 1,500 people at Reality Labs earlier this month, Meta told investors not to expect a sudden turnaround. Li said the company expects Reality Labs' operating losses in 2026 to remain \"similar to 2025 levels.\"\n\nZuckerberg is trying to reposition what Reality Labs is building. The company's focus has shifted from trying to go all in on the \"metaverse\" to building AI-powered smart glasses and experiences that could live inside Meta's existing apps.\n\nWhen Barclays analyst Ross Sandler asked about Meta's plans to bring Horizon Worlds, a virtual hangout zone accessible on the company's Quest VR headsets, to mobile, Zuckerberg said that he expects more \"interactive and immersive\" content formats to show up directly inside the feeds in Meta's existing apps.\n\nHe added that people might be able to use AI to create a game with a single prompt and share it on their feeds so that others can \"jump right into it.\"\n\nHe positioned Horizon Worlds as a natural fit for an \"immersive 3D\" version of that idea and said that Meta's work on VR software and Horizon could pair with AI advances to bring these kinds of experiences to \"hundreds of millions and billions of people through mobile.\"\n\nMeta isn't just trying to sprinkle AI features across Facebook and Instagram. Zuckerberg is making a bigger argument: if Meta wants to shape the next generation of consumer tech, it needs to control the underlying AI, not just depend on whatever rivals sell.\n\nThat's also the framing behind his public push for \"personal superintelligence,\" which he called out again as a key focus for 2026.\n\nWhen Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski asked how critical it is for Meta to have a general-purpose model, Zuckerberg leaned into Meta's identity as a \"deep technology company.\"\n\nWhat allows Meta to build everything it does, he said, \"is that we build and control the underlying technology.\" That way, Meta can design the experiences it wants, \"and not just be constrained to what others in the ecosystem are building or allow us to build,\" Zuckerberg added.\n\nHe suggested that relying on outside models could become risky over time, citing a mix of competitive and safety reasons. That's why, he said, it's important for Meta to have its own models, both from a business perspective and because Meta wants to \"actually design and build the experiences that we believe that we should be building for people.\"\n\nZuckerberg is pitching 2026 as the year AI changes not just Meta's products, but how Meta itself operates. On the call, he said 2026 will be \"the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work\" and that the company is \"investing in AI native tooling so individuals at Meta can get more done.\"\n\nHe also described a deliberate shift in org design.\n\n\"We're elevating individual contributors and flattening teams,\" Zuckerberg said, adding that Meta is already seeing \"projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single, very talented person.\"\n\nLi paired that cultural pitch with a concrete productivity claim. She said that since the beginning of 2025, Meta has seen a \"30% increase in output per engineer\" overall, and that \"power users\" of its internal AI coding tools saw output rise 80% year-over-year.\n\nThe company's implied bet? Spend heavily on AI infrastructure and tooling, and then run leaner teams that can ship more.\n\nHave a tip? Contact Pranav Dixit via email at pranavdixit@protonmail.com or Signal at 1-408-905-9124.

    "title": "Meta and Microsoft both blew their data center budgets last quarter. Wall Street is only mad at one of them.",
    "description": "The Big Tech rivals are spending more than ever, but analysts are more concerned about Microsoft at the moment.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street had very different reactions to two of Big Tech's biggest spenders after quarterly earnings reports came out on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Meta and Microsoft reported higher-than-expected capex. While both companies beat revenue expectations, Microsoft's stock sank more than 6% after-hours, while Meta's stock jumped as high as 9%.\n\nBig Tech's spending has risen sharply in the last two years, driven by investments in massive AI data centers. Wall Street has started to question when those investments will pay off, and analysts are giving some companies a much harder time than others.\n\nMeta reported capex of $22.1 billion for the fourth quarter and $72.2 billion for the year, up from 2024's $39.2 billion. That number will climb in 2026 — the company estimates capex will be in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion for the year, driven by increased spending on Meta SuperIntelligence Labs, the company's big bet on speeding up AI model development.\n\n\"We plan to continue to prioritize investing in the business to support these opportunities,\" CFO Susan Li told investors on Wednesday's call.\n\nMicrosoft logged $37.5 billion in capex for the quarter, up 66% from one year ago. Most of that spend went toward CPUs and GPUs, the powerful computing chips that run AI workloads. The company said the spending was necessary to support fast-growing demand for its cloud and AI business.\n\nMicrosoft's revenue was 81.3 billion for the quarter, up 17% from the previous year. Meta reported $55.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter and $200.1 billion for all of 2025.\n\nWhile both surpassed Wall Street's revenue expectations, analysts gave Microsoft a much harder time than Meta over its surging capex.\n\nPart of that could be Microsoft's heavy investments in GPU chips, which can become costly given their short life spans.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Keith Weiss said that a core issue for investors, as Microsoft's capex grows faster than they expected, \"comes down to ROI on capex spend over time.\"\n\nMicrosoft is also heavily exposed to a single customer, another concern for investors. Nearly half — 45% — of the company's remaining performance obligations are attributed to OpenAI.\n\n\"There's obviously concern about the durability,\" Jeffries analyst Brent Thill said of the backlog.\n\nMicrosoft holds a $135 billion stake in OpenAI and has invested more than $13 billion into the company since 2019.\n\nWhile OpenAI does not directly carry a heavy debt load, some of its partners, including Oracle, CoreWeave, and Nvidia, have taken on massive amounts of debt to fund data center buildouts, fueling Wall Street's anxiety over a potential AI bubble.\n\nOracle is struggling to finance its $500 billion data center initiative, Business Insider reported last week, amid growing concerns about its credit rating and risk.\n\nOn the Meta earnings call, Li noted that Meta's cash reserves, thanks to its very profitable ad business, will fuel its AI spending spree next year.\n\n\"We have a strong net cash balance, and expect our business will continue to generate sufficient cash to fund our infrastructure investments in 2026,\" Li said.",

    "description": "Apple, OpenAI, Meta, and more are all racing toward AI hardware products.",
    "fullText": "Apple is working on a wearable device that will allow the user to take advantage of AI models, according to sources familiar with the product who spoke with tech publication The Information.\n\nThe product is said to be “the same size as an AirTag, only slightly thicker,” and will be worn as a pin, inviting comparisons to the failed Humane AI pin that launched to bad reviews and lackluster sales in 2024. The Humane product was criticized for sluggish performance and low battery life, but those shortcomings could potentially be addressed by Apple’s solution, should Apple offload the processing to a synced external device like an iPhone.\n\nThe Information’s sources don’t specify whether that’s the plan, or if it will be a standalone device.\n\nThe wearable will have a single physical button “along its edges” and will feature a speaker. It will have three microphones and two cameras (one regular and one wide-angle) for capturing information about the user’s surroundings. It will use a magnetic inductive wireless charging surface similar to the one used to charge the Apple Watch.\n\nThe report didn’t include any information about pricing, but it did say that Apple has fast-tracked the product with the hope to release it as early as 2027. Twenty million units are planned for launch, suggesting the company does not expect it to be a sensational consumer success at launch the way some of its past products, like AirPods, have been.\n\nNot long ago, it was reported that OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) plans to release its own hardware, though the specifics and form factor are not publicly known. Apple is expecting fierce competition there, as well as with Meta, which Apple already expected to compete with in the emerging and related smart glasses market.\n\nApple has experienced significant internal turmoil over AI, with former AI lead John Giannandrea’s conservative approach to the technology failing to lead to a usable, true LLM-based Siri or other products analysts expect would make Apply stay competitive in the space with other Big Tech companies.\n\nJust a few days ago, it was revealed that Apple will tap Google’s Gemini large language models for an LLM overhaul of Siri. Other AI-driven products like smart glasses and an in-home smart display are also planned.",

    "fullText": "Filing by New Mexico’s attorney general includes Meta staff emails objecting to AI companion policy\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, approved allowing minors to access artificial intelligence chatbot companions that safety staffers warned were capable of sexual interactions, according to internal Meta documents filed in a New Mexico state court case and made public on Monday.\n\nThe lawsuit – brought by the state’s attorney general, Raul Torrez, and scheduled for trial next month – alleges Meta “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children” on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe filing on Monday included internal Meta employee emails and messages obtained by the New Mexico attorney general’s office through legal discovery. The state alleges they show that “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots”, the attorney general said in the filing. Meta announced last week that it had removed teen access to AI companions entirely, pending creation of a new version of the chatbots.\n\nIn the communications, some of Meta’s safety staff expressed objections the company was building chatbots geared for companionship, including sexual and romantic interactions with users. The artificial intelligence chatbots were released in early 2024. The documents cited in the state’s filing Monday don’t include messages or memos authored by Zuckerberg.\n\nAndy Stone, a Meta spokesperson, on Monday said the state’s portrayal was inaccurate and relied on selective information: “This is yet another example of the New Mexico attorney general cherrypicking documents to paint a flawed and inaccurate picture.”\n\nMessages in the filing showed safety staff had special concern about the bots being used for romantic scenarios between adults and minors under the age of 18, referred to as “U18s”.\n\n“I don’t believe that creating and marketing a product that creates U18 romantic AI’s for adults is advisable or defensible,” wrote Ravi Sinha, head of Meta’s child safety policy, in January 2024.\n\nIn reply, Antigone Davis, Meta’s global safety head, agreed that safety staff should push to block adults from creating underage romantic companions because “it sexualizes minors”. Sinha and Davis did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAccording to one February 2024 message, a Meta employee whose name was redacted relayed that Zuckerberg believed that AI companions should be blocked from engaging in sexually “explicit” conversations with at least younger teens and that adults should not be able to interact with “U18 AIs for romance purposes”.\n\nA summary of a meeting dated 20 February 2024, said the CEO believed the “narrative should be framed around … general principles of choice and non-censorship”, that Meta should be “less restrictive than proposed”, and that he wanted to “allow adults to engage in racier conversation on topics like sex”.\n\nStone said the documents did not support New Mexico’s case. “Even these select documents clearly show Mark Zuckerberg giving the direction that explicit AIs shouldn’t be available to younger users and that adults shouldn’t be able to create under 18 AIs for romantic purposes.”\n\nMessages between two employees from March 2024 state that Zuckerberg had rejected creating parental controls for the chatbots, and that staffers were working on “Romance AI chatbots” that would be allowed for users under the age of 18.\n\nWe “pushed hard for parental controls to turn GenAI off – but GenAI leadership pushed back stating Mark decision”, one employee wrote in that exchange.\n\nNick Clegg, who was Meta’s head of global policy until early 2025, said in an email included in the court documents he thought Meta’s approach to sexualized AI companions was unwise.\n\nExpressing concern that sexual interactions could be the dominant use case for Meta’s AI companions by teenage users, Clegg said: “Is that really what we want these products to be known for (never mind the inevitable societal backlash which would ensue)?” Clegg did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeta’s AI chatbot policies eventually came to light, prompting a backlash in the US Congress and elsewhere.\n\nA Wall Street Journal article in April 2025 found that Meta’s chatbots included overtly sexualized underage characters and that they engaged in all-ages sexual roleplay, including graphic descriptions of prepubescent bodies. Reuters reported in August that Meta’s official guidelines for chatbots stated that it is “acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual”. In response to the report, Meta said it was changing its policies and that the internal document granting such approval had been in error.",

    "description": "Analysts are laser-focused on Meta's AI ambitions and its surging capex spending. The company reports Q4 earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech earnings are about to kick off in earnest, with Meta Platforms due to report results for the final quarter of 2025 on Wednesday.\n\nMeta stock has been highly volatile over the past year, remaining in the green but lagging behind some of its Magnificent Seven peers. The stock is up about 1% year-to-date and up 7% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe social media giant spent 2025 telling investors it would boost capex spending, hyping up its ambitious AI plans. Investors eventually balked at Meta and other tech titans' plans to keep increasing capex. Meta tumbled after its Q3 report, partly on its announcement that it plans to spend more than ever on AI infrastructure going forward.\n\nMeta latest announced it would significantly scale back its metaverse spending, touted by CEO Mark Zuckerberg as the company's future only a few years earlier.\n\nWall Street is estimating that the Facebook parent will report $58.4 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $8.19.\n\nHere's what analysts say they'll be listening for.\n\nBofA analysts expect Meta to slightly beat estimates, though they remain focused on the company's expense guide for the coming year. The bank has an $810 price target and a buy rating for the stock, implying 21% upside.\n\n\"Concerns on '26 expenses have been building for 5 months & we think an expense guide at around 30% 2026 growth could be positive, while at/above 35% a negative,\" said analyst Justin Post.\n\nHe added that his team expects Meta's capex spending to come in between $109 and $114 billion for the year, likely above Wall Street consensus of $110 billion.\n\nDeutsche analysts maintain a buy rating and a bullish price target of $880 for Meta stock, a 31% jump from current levels. But as analyst Benjamin Black notes, heading into the Q4 earnings call, concerns linger about this year's expenses.\n\nThat said, his team also predicts that Meta's revenue will come in at $59 billion, just above Wall Street estimates.\n\n\"In our view, Meta is positioned favorably — especially in the long-term — as it doubles down on an AI investment cycle,\" Black said.\n\nLike its peers, Goldman analysts remain focused on Meta's capex plans, which they believe will continue to drive growth into 2026 and beyond. The bank recently raised its spending projections for the company, already above analyst estimates, noting that it sees upward pressure on consensus capex estimates.\n\n\"On the next earnings call, we expect investors will be focused on any updates on the work of the Meta Superintelligence Lab, the timing of any foundational model work and/or any strategies with respect to consumer or enterprise utility around AI,\" Goldman analysts stated.\n\nRothschild has a $900 price target for Meta stock, one of the highest on Wall Street. Its target represents a 34% increase from levels on Tuesday. Analyst James Cordwell sees Meta as one of the tech sector's best-positioned companies to capitalize on rising AI demand.\n\n\"The recent focus regarding Meta has been dominated by how the company might guide for FY26 operating expenses and capital expenditure,\" he stated. \"The fear is that this is 'Zuckerberg unleashed', with the company's CEO truly back in 'founder mode', pursuing his AI dreams whatever the financial cost.\"\n\nThe analyst added that this has prompted Rothschild to increase its full-year capex projection for Meta to $117.1 billion.\n\nTD Cowen is bullish on Meta ahead of its Wednesday earnings report, predicting generative AI tools will continue to support growth in its advertising business.\n\nAnalyst John Blackedge said he believes ad growth will help bolster its high capex spending.\n\n\"Key at the 4Q25 print will be mgmt's '26 capex and opex guides,\" he said. \"We currently expect '26 capex of $125.0BN, up 76% y/y and 14% above consensus alongside '26 opex of $156.1BN, up 32.9% y/y and 7% above consensus.\"",

    "fullText": "Campaigners decry ties with ‘Trump-supporting’ tech firms after funding is accepted to develop state AI systems\n\nUK politics live – latest updates\n\nMinisters have accepted $1m (£728,000) from Meta, the US tech and social media company, to build AI systems for defence, national security and transport, sparking warnings about the UK government’s “alarmingly close relationship with Trump-supporting US tech giants”.\n\nThe money from Mark Zuckerberg’s company will be used to pay experts to “develop cutting-edge AI solutions … to support national security and defence teams”, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) announced on Tuesday.\n\nThe money will pay for four British AI experts, coordinated by the government-funded Alan Turing Institute, to “play a pivotal role in rewiring our healthcare, police, transport systems and more”, said Ian Murray, the minister for data and digital government.\n\nThe move comes after Meta executives had 50 meetings with ministers in the last two years for which data was available, one of the highest levels of direct access of any technology company, a Guardian investigation found.\n\nThe government is consulting on a ban on social media use by under-16s, which would have a major effect on Meta’s Instagram platform. Meta said the money had been allocated to the Alan Turing Institute before any ban was floated.\n\nAnnouncing the $1m deal, Meta said it was “proud to help bring top British AI talent into government, fast-tracking the transformation of public services”.\n\nDSIT said: “People across the UK could benefit from faster, safer and more reliable public services as leading British AI specialists join government to modernise critical systems used every day – from public safety to transport maintenance.”\n\nBut the tech justice campaign group Foxglove asked: “What’s Meta getting for its million dollars?” It added: “When it comes to big tech, there’s no such thing as a free lunch.”\n\n“This is yet more evidence of the UK government’s alarmingly close relationship with Trump-supporting US tech giants,” said Donald Campbell, Foxglove’s advocacy director. “It’s deeply worrying that ministers are still naive enough to swallow this kind of lobbying from a handful of Silicon Valley plutocrats – who have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt they do not have the British public’s best interests at heart.”\n\nDaisy Greenwell, a co-founder of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, said the deal “highlights an uncomfortable reality: tech giants spend vast sums to gain access and influence in policymaking”.\n\nShe added: “That makes it even more important that decisions about children and online safety are shaped by independent evidence and the public interest, not by the companies whose products are under scrutiny.”\n\nThe government also announced a new partnership with the San Francisco AI company Anthropic, which will build and pilot a dedicated assistant tool for public services on gov.uk, starting with a model that will give jobseekers career advice “and help to lock down a job”. Anthropic said the project implementation work was “pro bono”.\n\nDSIT said the technology was “part of a cutting-edge plan to use AI agents for national government services, with a pilot expected to begin later this year”. In October, Anthropic announced that the former prime minister Rishi Sunak was taking an advisory role at the $350bn startup. The former Downing Street chief of staff Liam Booth-Smith is a policy and communications adviser to Anthropic.\n\nThe deals come as ministers wrestle with policy decisions that directly affect Meta and Anthropic. As well as launching a consultation last week on banning social media use for under-16s, they are also due to set out changes to how creatives’ copyrighted works are protected from being mined to build AI models, such as those made by Anthropic.\n\nBeeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer who campaigns on child protection and copyright, said: “This government is walking into dependence on Silicon Valley, is undermining the chance to build a UK AI sector, and above all is busy giving away some of the most precious datasets in the world to Silicon Valley, who could well afford to pay.”\n\nThe Meta-funded AI experts will be tasked with using AI to develop models that analyse images and videos, enabling councils to prioritise transport infrastructure repairs more effectively. They will also “develop cutting-edge AI solutions which run offline or within secured networks to support national security and defence teams to make vital decisions while safeguarding sensitive data”, the government said.",

    "title": "Meta Is Testing Paid Subscriptions for Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook",
    "description": "Why would I want to pay for any of this?",
    "fullText": "It's possible the one thing that could universally break smartphone addiction is making social media pay-to-play. Right now, there is zero friction involved in opening Instagram or TikTok, and getting sucked into their algorithms. But add a paywall to those apps, and all of a sudden, I don't have any interest in logging on.\n\nIf that sounds like it'd work on you too, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that Meta will soon test a subscription model for Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. The bad news is that these subscriptions won't be required to actually access the app, or the core features you already know. That will remain free, so we will remain hopelessly addicted.\n\nThe details are light at the moment, especially concerning WhatsApp and Facebook. Meta told TechCrunch that the subscriptions will offer \"exclusive features\" on its apps, and will \"unlock more productivity and creativity, along with expanded AI capabilities.\" That will include more controls over how you share and connect with other users. Again, pretty vague.\n\nPerhaps part of this cloak-and-dagger approach is that Meta isn't really sure how it wants to roll out these subscriptions. The company explained to TechCrunch that it was testing a \"variety of subscription features and bundles,\" and that each app's subscription will feel unique from the others.\n\nWhile Meta isn't revealing much at this point, we might have a glimpse at what the company has in store for Instagram. Reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi posted on X that Instagram's paid subscription will include the option to create as many audience lists as you want, view a list of people you follow who don't follow you back, and—perhaps more enticing to some—look at another user's story without them knowing you saw it. Would you pay a monthly subscription to be able to lurk in other people's Instagram stories? (It's possible to do this already, by the way.)\n\nThere's another feature set that Meta plans to test subscriptions for that likely includes all three of these apps: AI features. Meta will experiment with subs for Vibes, the company's short-form AI video app built into Meta AI. The services has been free since it launched last fall, and will likely continue to be free, but Meta may charge for \"additional video creation opportunities.\"\n\nAs much as I'm reluctant to say so, this really is Meta doing subscriptions right. I wouldn't pay for any of these features, but it's not like the company is taking away previously free features and locking them behind a subscription. If companies like Meta want to integrate a subscription model, they need to offer new features and abilities to justify the price. I might not think these anticipated features are worth it, but at least the current apps as they exist will remain free—even if charging for them would get me to stop using them for good.",

    "description": "A former Google and Meta employee shares why he left Big Tech and how he got comfortable making the leap to entrepreneurship.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jason White, a 46-year-old startup founder in the San Jose area. Business Insider has verified his former employment with documentation. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've spent half of my 20 years in the tech industry working at Google and Meta. These companies allowed me to work on some amazing projects, but I've now resigned from them both.\n\nI joined Google in 2016 as a tech lead in the Gmail division and transitioned to the Google Search team in 2020. By 2024, I realized I wanted to lean more heavily into AI. I didn't feel my position at Google would give me the opportunity to do that, so I opened myself up to other opportunities.\n\nWhen a Meta recruiter reached out about an AI machine learning engineer role, I decided to pursue it and eventually received an offer. I left Google in July 2024 and started at Meta a month later.\n\nI had a positive experience at Meta. I worked with great people in a high-resource environment and learned a lot. I was also able to lean into AI as I'd hoped, focusing fully on AI products.\n\nHowever, halfway through 2025, I started thinking about resigning to build a startup — specifically, a venture that would use AI to help the typical household with their finances.\n\nWhether to resign from Meta was a complex decision.\n\nThe startup was something I was growing increasingly passionate about. I know what financial pressure feels like — I had been a low-paid graduate student trying to provide for a newborn.\n\nMany people don't have access to great financial planning and management tools to help improve their financial situations. While I was still figuring out what the business would look like, I felt there was an opportunity to help people, and that was very motivating for me.\n\nI connected with a potential cofounder — a friend of a friend — and we spent a lot of time talking through the opportunity. That helped me grow more comfortable with the idea of leaving Meta, but there were still a lot of other factors to consider.\n\nIt's hard to leave a world-class team with people you like — not to mention a reliable source of income.\n\nI know some people start businesses on the side while keeping their full-time jobs, but I couldn't do that because I was already juggling two demanding roles as a Meta employee and a parent.\n\nMy other concern was legal. I would've had to disclose any outside business to Meta, and there could've been non-compete issues — especially since my business idea was related to AI, like my role at Meta.\n\nI wanted to make sure my family had enough savings to cover at least one year of our current expenses without touching our retirement accounts. My wife works, but I wanted a cushion in case she lost her job. I figured that would give me at least one year to build the business, and, if things went really badly, enough time afterward to find a job.\n\nWe already were in a good place savings-wise, so we were still able to take vacations, hire tutors for our kids, and order DoorDash. I had about six months before resigning to make some minor adjustments, including cutting back on 401(k) contributions and putting more money into liquid savings accounts.\n\nThis financial planning process for my family really helped crystallize the direction I wanted to go with the startup. In September 2025, I resigned from Meta.\n\nWhen I shared the news with my colleagues, the response was a mix of surprise, support, and a large amount of jealousy. A lot of people want to leave and start their own thing, but for various reasons they can't or won't — whether it's because of their visa status, financial constraints, or broader fear.\n\nI'm now focused on my business, Bear Financial. My cofounder and I are planning to publicly launch in the second half of this year. We may seek external funding, but for now, we're bootstrapping the business, so I've tracked our spending very carefully.\n\nI have a few pieces of advice for people considering leaving their jobs to start their own business. First, get your finances in order. Second, make sure anyone who depends on you, like your family, is supportive of the decision — I was fortunate to have a supportive partner who knew that I felt limited working in Big Tech.\n\nThird, choose an idea you deeply believe in. With a startup, you have to be the one to bring the energy, the enthusiasm, the vision — and to carry others into it.\n\nAddress your knowledge gaps. Startup founders often need to be generalists, which means having a basic understanding of a lot of areas.\n\nI'd also suggest envisioning the worst-case outcome and asking yourself whether you'd be OK with it. I thought about what it would look like one year later if my business failed. I believe I'd still value everything I learned over those 12 months.\n\nIf I eventually decide to pursue a corporate position again, I have faith that I'd be able to find something — even though it's hard to predict what the job market will look like.\n\nThere are, however, a lot of potential barriers to success: we have to navigate a moving target on regulations, we need to figure out ways to convince potential customers to give us a try, and there are super well-resourced companies that could become direct competitors.\n\nAt the end of the day, I want to take the swing.",

    "description": "A mom in Maine shares how a viral Instagram video inspired her family to turn a kids' climbing structure into a DIY igloo. And it cost $0.",
    "fullText": "Years ago, we bought a geodesic climbing structure for my three kids, who were all under 5. We thought it would keep them entertained all year long without our supervision, but the reality could not be more different. The structure sat untouched through the seasons.\n\nOn Sunday, while preparing for the massive snowstorm that was headed toward Maine, Instagram fed me a reel of a couple building an igloo with the same climbing structure we have. I sent it to my husband, who came running from the room next door and said, \"We have to do this!\"\n\nIt turned out to be a hit with the kids, and it was surprisingly easy to pull off.\n\nThe video I watched showed the first step to making the igloo is wrapping the perimeter of the climbing structure tightly with plastic wrap.\n\nWe opted for a more eco-friendly option and decided to use king-size bed sheets. My husband had the idea to soak them in water first so they wouldn't blow away in the strong wind as we were prepping the igloo. We soaked them in a tub and carried them outside quickly. The temps in Maine were in the teens, so we had to drag the sheets across the climbing dome quickly. I was actually surprised at how quickly the sheets hardened in the cold air. We just wrapped the ends of the sheet around a pole and didn't need anything else to secure it in place.\n\nWe covered the entire structure, leaving one small triangle so the kids could crawl in and out of it, and had the rest of the dome totally covered.\n\nWe had tried something similar years earlier, and the sheets never hardened enough to stay on the dome. I didn't want to get my hopes up this time around, so we left the sheets and walked over to a friends' house to play before the snow.\n\nWe were back home when the storm had already started, and we could see snow accumulating on the dome. I really wanted to check on it regularly because I was worried the weight of the snow would collapse the igloo's roof. But I'm from Argentina, and I don't do well in negative temperatures, so I let it be and decided to check it in the morning.\n\nWe got absolutely dumped with snow overnight; it was the biggest snowstorm I've experienced since moving to Maine 6 years ago. And to my surprise, the igloo worked.\n\nImmediately, my kids were excited to climb inside, even exclaiming that it was way warmer in the igloo than outside it. They called over friends and neighbors, and they all played inside the igloo while I worked and my husband snowblowed around our house.\n\nIt's the first time that I copied something from a viral reel or TikTok video, and it really paid off. And the best part is that it costs us nothing.\n\nNext time we get a snowstorm warning, I at least know which sheets to pull out ASAP so we can start building quickly.",

    "fullText": "Jan 26 (Reuters) - Attorneys for Meta Platforms and other social media companies asked a California federal judge on Monday to block several school districts from taking their lawsuits against the companies to trial, arguing that federal law protects them from claims they ​knowingly addicted young users.\n\nAt a hearing before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, lawyers for the companies clashed with counsel ‌for six school districts from states across the country, who argue the platforms' design has harmed students' mental health and forced districts to spend money and staff time to address the fallout.\n\nThe companies urged ‌the judge to rule that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which generally shields platforms like Meta's Facebook and Instagram from liability over user-generated content, bars the cases from proceeding to the first trials in federal court over the claims.\n\nJonathan Blavin, an attorney for the social media companies, said the schools’ allegations rely on evidence that includes such content, placing the claims within the protections of Section 230.\n\n\"If that evidence is entirely excluded, I think the record here is incredibly thin,\" Blavin said. \"It's just ⁠not there.\"\n\nLawyers for the school districts countered that their ‌claims are not based on user-content but on platform features they say are intentionally designed to keep young people on the social media sites as long as possible.\n\nAndre Mura, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said their experts had examined broad studies of ‍students who had used social media to support their findings that it had harmed them.\n\n“The literature shows the increase in the risk of harm is not based on content,” he said.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS IN STATE, FEDERAL COURT\n\nMeta, Snapchat and parent Snap Inc., YouTube and parent Alphabet Inc., and TikTok and parent ByteDance are facing thousands of lawsuits in both federal and ​state court over claims they knowingly designed their platforms to have features that addict children and teens, fueling a mental health crisis.\n\nThe first trial testing ‌the claims in state court is slated for this week in Los Angeles.\n\nThe federal cases have been consolidated into multidistrict litigation before Rogers and include lawsuits brought by families, school districts and state governments.\n\nMonday's hearing focused only on cases filed by school districts, which claim they have been hurt financially from having to manage student mental health issues and social problems like cyberbullying. Rogers is considering whether to enter judgment for the companies in six of those lawsuits, selected as so-called \"bellwether\" or test cases, ahead of the first trials in federal court, currently scheduled to begin in June.\n\nBellwether trials are used to gauge how juries may respond to similar ⁠claims and help establish settlement values for the other similar cases in the litigation.\n\nIn rulings ​on the companies’ motions to dismiss in 2023 and 2024, Rogers said the cases could go ​forward, but Section 230 limited many of their claims, including some about specific features of the platforms.\n\nOn Monday, Rogers agreed that the plaintiffs had a lot of evidence that seemed to be based on content and said that should the cases go forward, there ‍would be a lengthy debate about what ⁠could be shown to the juries.\n\nBut even if the actual content played some role, Rogers said that juries were often asked to examine a problem with several causes and determine which were primarily to blame.\n\n“It’s not like we have a white and a yolk, it’s all scrambled together,” Rogers ⁠said. “That’s a very common circumstance. Why should this be any different?”\n\nThe case is In Re: Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury Products Liability Litigation, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District ‌of California, No. 4:22-md-03047.\n\nFor plaintiffs: Andre Mura of Gibbs Mura; Previn Warren of Motley Rice\n\nFor defendants: Jonathan Blavin of Munger Tolles & Olson; ‌Ashley Hardin of Williams & Connolly; Christian Pistilli of Covington & Burling",

    "title": "Meta Is Being Sued Over Whether WhatsApp Really Encrypts Your Messages",
    "description": "The lawsuit was filed by an international group of plaintiffs.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after Meta (then Facebook) bought WhatsApp in 2014, it promised to implement a surprisingly un-Facebooky feature: End-to-end encryption. The move was supposed to be a boon for privacy, ensuring nobody could see your messages aside from the recipient and yourself. Even now, WhatsApp's website claims, \"No one outside of the chat, not even WhatsApp, can read, listen to, or share [your messages].\" However, a new lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco is now claiming that's not the case.\n\nAccording to reporting from Bloomberg, an international group of plaintiffs has sued Meta, saying that the app's claims of end-to-end encryption are a lie. The lawsuit alleges that Meta and WhatsApp \"store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp user's purportedly 'private' communications.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs include users from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa, who are being represented by attorneys from several firms. The allegations cite \"whistleblowers\" who helped bring this information to light, but no more is known as of yet.\n\nWhen I reached out to Meta for comment, Meta strongly denied the allegations. The company called the lawsuit \"frivolous,\" assuring users that WhatsApp uses the open-source Signal protocol for encryption and adding that \"[a]ny claim that people's WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false and absurd.\"\n\nIf the lawsuit succeeds, it could affect billions of users around the world. That's because the plaintiffs' lawyers are asking the court to certify a class-action lawsuit.\n\nIn the meantime, WhatApp is far from the only option for encrypted messaging apps. While it's unclear how the lawsuit will proceed, those looking to jump ship might want to look at alternatives like Signal or Viber instead. Note that some apps, like Telegram, do offer end-to-end encryption, but don't enable it by default. (Personally I use Line, because of the anime stickers.)",

    "fullText": "At long last Zuffa Boxing is set to kick off its debut event later TONIGHT (Fri., Jan. 23, 2026) as Zuffa Boxing 1 is set to go down inside Meta’s Apex in Las Vegas, Nevada. Headlining the event — which will streaming live on Paramount+ — will be a Middleweight showdown between Irish sensation, Callum Walsh, taking on Carlos Ocampo.\n\nWalsh was Dana White’s first-ever signing to his upstart boxing promotion, so it makes sense to have him kickoff the debut event. “King” is undefeated (15-0) with 11 knockouts and is coming off a unanimous decision win over Fernando Vargas Jr. on the “Canelo vs. Crawford”-led undercard in Las Vegas, Nevada, back in Sept. 2025 (full results here). As for Ocampo, he is coming in with a record of 38-3 and is currently riding a three-fight win streak into a bout he hopes will give him the spotlight should he pull off the massive upset.\n\nIt’s an important night for White and Co. since the debut fight card to his boxing venture will either silence a lot of doubters (such as this one), or give them more fuel to spit verbal venom at him for trying to change things up to a combat sport that has marched to the beat of the same drum for decades.\n\nWe don’t expect it to be perfect, but all eyes will be on this event.\n\nMany readers check in before, during and after the fights to share their thoughts on all of the action, as the card kicks off at 6 p.m. ET on Paramount+. Feel free to leave a comment (or several) about the bouts and chat with all the other Maniacs during the show — it’s always a lot of fun!\n\n160 lbs: Callum Walsh vs. Carlos Ocampo\n160 lbs: Misael Rodriguez Olivas vs. Austin Deanda\n147 lbs: Julian Rodriguez vs. Cain Sandoval \n126 lbs: Omar Trinidad vs. Max Ornelas \n118 lbs: Floyd Diaz vs. Guillermo Gutierrez \n118lbs: Emiliano Cardenas vs. Marcus Cortez Harris – Cardenas via unanimous decision\n135 lbs: Robert Meriwether III vs. Cesar Correa – Merriwether III via unanimous decision\n135 lbs: Troy Nash vs. Jacob Ramos – Nash via unanimous decision\n\nWe've got some ACTION at #ZuffaBoxing01💥#RiyadhSeason | @RiyadhSeason pic.twitter.com/9K4xHMg5Lc\n\n— Zuffa_Boxing (@Zuffa_Boxing) January 23, 2026\n\nOPENING UP THE FIRST ZUFFA BOXING CARD EVER‼️\n\n🇺🇸 @RealTroyNash v Jaycob Ramos 🇺🇸\n\nLIVE on @ParamountPlus | #RiyadhSeason | @RiyadhSeason pic.twitter.com/JdiFSpLuoQ\n\n— Zuffa_Boxing (@Zuffa_Boxing) January 23, 2026\n\nIT'S ALMOST TIME 🥊#ZuffaBoxing01 kicks off at the top of the hour!\n\nWatch here: https://t.co/bgoL7klXvE | #RiyadhSeason | @RiyadhSeason pic.twitter.com/2Sd0KqPKEJ\n\n— Zuffa_Boxing (@Zuffa_Boxing) January 23, 2026",

    "description": "The agency is aiming to reverse a setback in the government’s campaign to rein in the power of the biggest tech companies.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Trade Commission filed a notice on Tuesday appealing its loss in a lawsuit that accused Meta of breaking antitrust laws to protect a monopoly in social networking.\n\nAt a trial last year, Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia considered the government’s claims that Meta snuffed out nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago. He ruled in November that Meta had not broken the law.\n\n“Meta violated our antitrust laws when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp,” an agency spokesman, Joe Simonson, said. “Thankfully for Americans, there is an appeal process.”\n\nA Meta spokesman, Christopher Sgro, said in a statement that Judge Boasberg’s “decision to reject the F.T.C.’s arguments is correct, and recognizes the fierce competition we face.”\n\nThe F.T.C. is aiming to reverse a setback in the government’s campaign to rein in the power of the biggest tech companies. In the last two years, the government has won federal antitrust cases against Google, with judges saying the company has monopolies in online search and advertising technology. It has also sued Amazon and Apple over monopoly concerns.\n\nJudge Boasberg’s six-week trial in the lawsuit against Meta featured testimony from witnesses including Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, and an Instagram founder, Kevin Systrom.\n\nThe government argued that Meta bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014 to get rid of the threat posed by young competitors.\n\nJudge Boasberg ruled in favor of Meta’s arguments that changes in social media, including the growth of TikTok and YouTube, undercut the government’s case about Meta’s dominance.\n\nThe F.T.C.’s notice of appeal on Tuesday, filed in the District Court, is preliminary. The agency will lay out its legal argument for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit at a later date.",

    "fullText": "Yann LeCun is clear on his life goals — and being a leader is not one of them.\n\n\"I can do management, but I don't like doing it,\" Meta's former chief AI scientist said in an interview with MIT Technology Review published on Thursday.\n\n\"I kind of hated being a director,\" he said about his time at Meta's Fundamental AI Research (FAIR), a leading AI research lab he founded. \"I am not good at this career management thing. I'm much more visionary and a scientist.\"\n\nHe said his \"mission in life\" was not leadership, but to accelerate technological progress and inspire others to work on what interests them.\n\nIn November, LeCun announced his departure from Meta, where he had worked for 12 years, and said he would launch his own AI company.\n\nHis new startup, AMI Labs, focuses on building world models — a type of AI that closely reflects the real world. The Paris-based startup will work on open source solutions and be among the few frontier AI labs that he said are \"neither Chinese nor American.\"\n\nLeCun said that he would take on the role of executive chairman, while Alex LeBrun, his former colleague from Meta AI, will be the company's CEO. LeCun will continue teaching at NYU.\n\nIn the MIT interview, the AI pioneer said that he did not agree with all the choices Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made, such as letting go the robotics team inside FAIR.\n\nEarlier this month, he criticized the leadership of another Meta exec, Alexandr Wang, the former CEO of data labelling startup Scale AI. Meta invested $14.3 billion in the buzzy startup, which included hiring Wang to lead AI progress.\n\n\"There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher,\" LeCun said in an interview with the Financial Times.\n\nLeCun said that even though the 28-year-old was briefly his boss after Zuckerberg's AI reorg, he wasn't taking orders from Wang.\n\n\"You don't tell a researcher what to do,\" LeCun said. \"You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do.\"\n\nHe also made similar remarks about being a visionary instead of a leader in the FT interview.\n\n\"I'm pretty good at guessing what type of technology will work or not. But I can't be a CEO,\" LeCun, 65, said. \"I'm both too disorganized for this, and also too old.\"",

The fault instead lies with Meta, as Instagram is currently down. That's according to Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, which shows over 2,000 user reports of issues with Instagram at the time of this writing.\n\nThe issues seem to affect Instagram in all forms. While the mobile app was working last time I checked, I couldn't get it to load in Safari. That means you might not be able to check out posts, add new posts, or send and receive DMs—at least until Meta figures out what's causing the issue.\n\nInevitably, of course, it will: Outages and downtime happen, though it seems this week they're happening with increasing frequency. There was, obviously, Verizon (which the company attributes to a software issue), but also issues with Yahoo!, X, and Microsoft 365. Something's in the air this week, it seems. Whatever is going on with Instagram though, Meta will assuredly figure it in due time. Usually, these things are resolved pretty quickly, but if there's a deeper issue, us Instagram users may have to go without the app for some time.",

    "fullText": "Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept.\n\nAs industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices.\n\nIn part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more.\n\nMeta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta’s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets.\n\nFast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI.\n\nAccording to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel’s Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard’s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by GeekWire.\n\nAnd last week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well.\n\nThe news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers.\n\nUnlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit.\n\nIn total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending.\n\nBesides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate.\n\nThat model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments.\n\nMeta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers.\n\nSpecifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores.\n\n“This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.”\n\nHe proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey & Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030.\n\nMeta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size.\n\nThough there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity.\n\nFrom a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta.\n\nFor comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.\n\nOf course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)\n\nBut this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.\n\nEven before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy.\n\nAs bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.\n\nIn May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior.\n\nAt the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.\n\nThese types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.”\n\nAlso around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!)\n\nAnother nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week.\n\nWith an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.)\n\nWith other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass.\n\nCombined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models.",

Last year a Los Angeles judge ruled that the platforms’ design features may be responsible for harm – and not just the third-party content posted on sites and apps.\n\nHistorically, tech firms have turned to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law underpinning US internet regulation that exempts platforms from legal liability for content generated by its users, as part of their legal defence. The first bellwether case is still due to begin on 27 January with jury selection.\n\nSnap remains a defendant in the other two cases.\n\nBeasley Allen, a law firm involved in the lawsuits on the plaintiff side, has said the cases could have profound consequences including billions of dollars in damages, forcing changes in platform design and new US regulations governing how tech firms interact with minors.\n\n“The litigation is being compared to past landmark cases against big tobacco and opioid manufacturers – industries that were held accountable for public health harms after years of denial,” the firm said in a statement last year.\n\nSnap, Meta, TikTok and YouTube have been contacted for comment.",

    "fullText": "Friends … followers … where is the line?\n\nInstagram is testing out new tweaks that emphasize friends. It also has a new definition of friends: People who mutually follow each other.\n\nThe Instagram test involves changing a user's \"following\" count on a profile to a \"friends\" count. That means if you follow thousands of people, but maybe only a few hundred of those people follow you back, that'll show up as your \"friends\" count.\n\nFor those of you who care about those precious follower-to-following ratios, get ready for a potentially even more telling public ratio: How many of those Instagram followers are friends?\n\nInstagram is quietly running this as a \"small global test,\" a Meta spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider, adding that the platform is trying to understand how users respond to seeing more content from friends in the app.\n\n\"Friends are central to the Instagram experience, so we're exploring ways to make these connections more visible and meaningful,\" a Meta spokesperson said. \"We're running a small test to highlight Friends throughout Instagram.\"\n\nAs part of the test, Meta is also labeling some content in the feed as \"friends\" instead of \"posts\" or \"following.\"\n\nAs influencers, brands, and now AI slop have invaded Instagram's feed, it's felt less and less like a space to share content with your friends.\n\nThat's part of the reason Instagram has doubled down on its \"Close Friends\" features over the years, focused on direct messaging (where friends and family often share content), and added more friend-focused features.\n\nFor instance, Instagram rolled out a feature called \"Blend,\" which lets you and a friend share a mutual feed of reels.\n\nLast year, Instagram also introduced features like a social mapping experience similar to Snapchat's map, as well as a \"Friends\" feed in the reels tab, where you can see content your friends (by Instagram's definition) are engaging with.\n\nInstagram's top executive, Adam Mosseri, said in an August post that he wants Instagram to be somewhere where users can \"actually engage with and connect with the people that you care about.\"",

    "description": "A Meta product manager says vibe coding is letting non-technical PMs ship features and work differently with engineers.",
    "fullText": "A product manager at Meta says vibe coding has changed what it means to do his job — even though he has no technical background and still finds code \"terrifying.\"\n\nZevi Arnovitz said in an episode of \"Lenny's Podcast\" released Sunday that discovering AI coding tools in mid-2024 marked a turning point in his career.\n\nIt felt like he was handed \"superpowers,\" Arnovitz said.\n\nUnderstanding how to use AI intentionally is \"one of the biggest game changers that will make you much better as a PM,\" he said, referring to product management.\n\nArnovitz joined Meta in September last year after about three years as a product manager at website-building company Wix, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nArnovitz said he has rebuilt his workflow around AI. He uses vibe coding tools like Cursor alongside models from Anthropic and Google to explore product ideas, generate build plans, execute code, review it, and update documentation.\n\nThe shift reshaped his role as a product manager. Instead of merely acting as a coordinator between engineering and design, Arnovitz operates more like a product owner with the capability to execute.\n\n\"Everyone's going to become a builder,\" he said. \"We're going to see that a lot in the next coming years.\"\n\nStill, Arnovitz said there are limits to what non-technical product managers should take on. He said he doesn't think product managers should be shipping complex infrastructure changes or big projects.\n\nAI has enabled product managers to take on smaller UI projects by building the feature and then handing the code to a developer for final review and completion, he added.\n\nAs AI tools improve, Arnovitz said titles and responsibilities are likely to \"collapse,\" and product managers should treat vibe coding as a \"collaborative learning opportunity\" with their engineering teams.\n\nThe rise of AI coding tools is blurring the lines for traditional roles, making it easier for non-technical workers, including product managers, to build products directly.\n\nFigma CEO Dylan Field said in October on \"Lenny's Podcast\" that AI has pushed many workers to experiment with building products.\n\nTasks that once required deep engineering expertise can now be done with vibe coding tools, he said.\n\n\"I think that we're seeing more designers, engineers, product managers, researchers, all these different folks that are involved in the product development process dip their toe into the other roles,\" he said.\n\n\"We're all product builders, and some of us are specialized in our particular area,\" he added.\n\nThat same thinking is showing up in how companies train new hires. LinkedIn replaced its long-running associate product manager program with an associate product builder track in January.\n\n\"We're going to teach them how to code, design, and PM at LinkedIn,\" said the company's former chief product officer, Tomer Cohen, in an episode of \"Lenny's Podcast\" published in December. It's more about training people \"who can flex across,\" he added.\n\nCohen, who spent nearly 14 years at LinkedIn, left the company in January and now works as an advisor, according to his LinkedIn profile.",

    "description": "Oculus founder Palmer Luckey said Meta's VR cuts targeted subsidized game studios that were crowding out developers and distorting the industry.",
    "fullText": "Meta's decision to cut more than a thousand jobs in Reality Labs and wind down parts of its metaverse strategy has reignited fears that the company is quietly backing away from virtual reality.\n\nOculus founder Palmer Luckey says that interpretation is wrong — and misses a deeper problem the cuts may actually solve.\n\nIn a series of posts on X on Monday, Luckey said that Meta's Reality Labs layoffs, which The New York Times reported were roughly 10% to 15% of the division's 15,000 employees, do not signal retreat.\n\nMeta still employs the largest VR workforce in the world, he said, dwarfing competitors \"by about an order of magnitude.\"\n\nFrom a numbers perspective, Luckey framed the layoffs as \"six months of normal churn concentrated into 60 days,\" not an existential blow.\n\nThe more consequential shift, he said, lies in where the cuts landed.\n\nAccording to Luckey, most of the eliminated roles were tied to first-party content — Meta-owned studios building internally developed VR games.\n\nThose teams, he said, had become a growing problem for the broader VR ecosystem.\n\n\"Meta heavily subsidizing their own (with money, marketing, placement, etc) at the expense of core technical progress and platform stability doesn't make sense,\" Luckey wrote. \"Crowding out the rest of the entire ecosystem, even less so.\"\n\nLuckey said third-party developers — even efficient, well-run studios — struggled to compete against Meta-owned teams backed by budgets that far exceeded what the market could realistically return.\n\nThe irony, he added, was that strong reviews and polished execution only worsened the imbalance by pulling attention and sales away from independent creators.\n\n\"People will point out that these teams did an awesome job and got awesome reviews from critics and customers alike — yes, and fucked up though it is, that makes the problem even worse!\" he wrote.\n\nIn a capital-constrained environment, Luckey said, Meta's resources are better spent on core technology and platform stability than on competing directly with developers it needs to keep VR viable.\n\nHe also framed the move as a return to Oculus's original philosophy. Internally, he said, the company aimed \"to NOT be Nintendo\" — avoiding a closed, first-party-dominated model in favor of building an ecosystem that others could profit from.\n\nLuckey acknowledged the human cost of layoffs and said he felt \"really bad for the people impacted.\"\n\nStill, he said that scaling back first-party content is ultimately \"a good thing for the long-term health of the industry,\" even if it's uncomfortable in the short term.",

The most prized employees today are \"player-coaches,\" people who ship work themselves while also guiding projects, mentoring peers, and shaping strategy. AI makes that hybrid role even more potent, allowing a single strong contributor to amplify their output, and their influence, without managing a large team, Musa wrote this week.\n\nThe result is a revival of the individual contributor track. You no longer have to become a full-time people manager to earn top-tier pay. At companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, senior ICs can now match (or beat) the compensation of managers simply by delivering outsized results, he noted.\n\nFor ambitious employees, the takeaway is simple: in the AI era, execution compounds.

    "fullText": "Progress of artificial general intelligence could stall, which may lead to a financial crash, says Yoshua Bengio, one of the ‘godfathers’ of modern AI\n\nWill the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) lead us to a land of financial plenty – or will it end in a 2008-style bust? Trillions of dollars rest on the answer.\n\nThe figures are staggering: an estimated $2.9tn (£2.2tn) being spent on datacentres, the central nervous systems of AI tools; the more than $4tn stock market capitalisation of Nvidia, the company that makes the chips powering cutting-edge AI systems; and the $100m signing-on bonuses offered by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to top engineers at OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nThese sky-high numbers are all propped up by investors who expect a return on their trillions. AGI, a theoretical state of AI where systems gain human levels of intelligence across an array of tasks and are able to replace humans in white-collar jobs such as accountancy and law, is a keystone of this financial promise.\n\nIt offers the prospect of computer systems carrying out profitable work without the associated cost of human labour – a hugely lucrative scenario for companies developing the technology and the customers who deploy it.\n\nThere will be consequences if AI companies fall short: US stock markets, boosted heavily by the performance of tech stocks, could fall and cause damage to people’s personal wealth; debt markets wrapped up in the datacentre boom could suffer a jolt that ripples elsewhere; GDP growth in the US, which has benefited from the AI infrastructure, could falter, which would have knock-on effects for interlinked economies.\n\nDavid Cahn, a partner at one leading Silicon Valley investment firm, Sequoia Capital, says tech companies now have to deliver on AGI.\n\n“Nothing short of AGI will be enough to justify the investments now being proposed for the coming decade,” he wrote in a blog published in October.\n\nIt means there is a lot hanging on progress towards advanced AI, and the trillions being poured into infrastructure and R&D to achieve it. One of the “godfathers” of modern AI, Yoshua Bengio, says the progress of AGI could stall and the outcome would be bad for investors.\n\n“There is a clear possibility that we will hit a wall, that there’s some difficulty that we don’t foresee right now, and we don’t find any solution quickly,” he says. “And that could be a real [financial] crash. A lot of the people who are putting trillions right now into AI are also expecting the advances to continue fairly regularly at the current pace.”\n\nBut Bengio, a prominent voice on the safety implications of AGI, is clear that continued progress towards a highly advanced state of AI is the more likely endgame.\n\n“Advances stalling is a minority scenario, like it’s an unlikely scenario. The more likely scenario is we continue to move forward,” he says.\n\nThe pessimistic view is that investors are backing an unrealistic outcome – that AGI will not happen without further breakthroughs.\n\nDavid Bader, the director of the institute for data science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, says trillions of dollars are being spent on scaling up – tech jargon for growing something quickly – the underlying technology for chatbots, known as transformers, in the expectation that increasing the amount of computing power behind current AI systems, by building more datacentres, will suffice.\n\n“If AGI requires a fundamentally different approach, perhaps something we haven’t yet conceived, then we’re optimising an architecture that can’t get us there no matter how large we make it. It’s like trying to reach the moon by building taller ladders,” he says.\n\nNonetheless, big US tech companies such as Google’s parent Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are ploughing ahead with datacentre plans with the financial cushion of being able to fund their AGI ambitions through the cash generated by their hugely profitable day-to-day businesses. This at least gives them some protection if the wall outlined by Bengio and Bader comes into view.\n\nBut there are other more worrying aspects to the boom. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, estimate that $2.9tn will be spent on datacentres between now and 2028, with half of that covered by the cashflow from “hyperscalers” such as Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nThe rest will have to be covered by alternative sources such as private credit, a corner of the shadow banking sector that is activating alarm bells at the Bank of England and elsewhere. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, has borrowed $29bn from the private credit market to finance a datacentre in Louisiana.\n\nAI-related sectors account for approximately 15% of investment grade debt in the US, which is even bigger than the banking sector, according to the investment bank JP Morgan.\n\nOracle, which has signed a $300bn datacentre deal with OpenAI, has had an increase in credit default swaps, which are a form of insurance on a company defaulting on its debts. High-yield, or “junk debt”, which represents the higher-risk end of the borrowing market, is also appearing in the AI sector via datacentre operators CoreWeave and TeraWulf. Growth is also being funded by asset-backed securities – a form of debt underpinned by assets such as loans or credit card debt, but in this case rent paid by tech companies to datacentre owners – in a form of financing that has risen sharply in recent years.\n\nIt is no wonder that JP Morgan says the AI infrastructure boom will require a contribution from all corners of the credit market.\n\nBader says: “If AGI doesn’t materialise on expected timelines, we could see contagion across multiple debt markets simultaneously – investment-grade bonds, high-yield junk debt, private credit and securitised products – all of which are being tapped to fund this buildout.”\n\nShare prices linked to AI and tech are also playing an outsized role in US stock markets. The so-called “magnificent 7” of US tech stocks – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia – account for more than a third of the value of the S&P 500 index, the biggest stock market index in the US, compared with 20% at the start of the decade.\n\nIn October the Bank of England warned of “the risk of a sharp correction” in US and UK markets due to giddy valuations of AI-linked tech companies. Central bankers are concerned stock markets could slump if AI fails to reach the transformative heights investors are hoping for. At the same time the International Monetary Fund said valuations were heading towards dotcom bubble-levels.\n\nEven tech execs whose companies are benefiting from the boom are acknowledging the speculative nature of the frenzy. In November Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, said there are “elements of irrationality” in the boom and that “no company is going to be immune” if the bubble bursts, while Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has said the AI industry is in a “kind of industrial bubble”, and OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, has said “there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.”\n\nAll three, to be clear, are AI optimists and expect the technology to keep improving and benefit society.\n\nBut when the numbers get this big there are obvious risks in a bubble bursting, as Pichai admits. Pension funds and anyone invested in the stock market will be affected by a share price collapse, while the debt markets will also take a hit. There is also a web of “circular” deals, such as OpenAI paying Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares. If these transactions unravel due to a lack of take-up of AI, or that wall being hit, then it could be messy.\n\nThere are also optimists who argue that generative AI, the catch-all term for tools such as chatbots and video generators, will transform whole industries and justify the expenditure. Benedict Evans, a technology analyst, says the expenditure numbers are not outrageous in the context of other industries, such as oil and gas extraction which runs at $600bn a year.\n\n“These AI capex figures are a lot of money but it’s not an impossible amount of money,” he says.\n\nEvans adds: “You don’t have to believe in AGI to believe that generative AI is a big thing. And most of what is happening here is not, ‘oh wow they’re going to create God’. It’s ‘this is going to completely change how advertising, search, software and social networks – and everything else our business is based on – is going to work’. It’s going to be a huge opportunity.”\n\nNonetheless, there is a multitrillion dollar expectation that AGI will be achieved. For many experts, the consequences of getting there are alarming. The cost of not getting there could also be significant.",

Think Lo-Fi selfies, thick winged eyeliner, and the dog-ear Snapchat filter.\n\nPeople on Instagram and TikTok, influencers and regular folks alike, have been posting throwback pictures from 2016.\n\nIn some posts, millennials openly mourned for the halcyon days of 2016, when they were free to wear skinny jeans without being scorned by Gen Z coworkers, some 20 pounds lighter, and juicing up their feeds with the Clarendon and Gingham Instagram filters.\n\nIt was also a huge year for music, yielding 2010s-defining pop hits like The Chainsmokers' \"Closer,\" Justin Bieber's \"Love Yourself,\" and Alan Walker's \"Faded.\"\n\nNo surprise, millennials are craving a walk down memory lane.\n\nKar Brulhart, a Mexico City-based social media strategist and coach, said 2016 is trending because of nostalgia and a broader shift toward analogue — think paperback books, flip phones, and digital cameras.\n\nBut beyond that, Brulhart said, revisiting the 2016 era provides relief.\n\n\"Especially in the US, where the political and cultural climate feels increasingly charged, people genuinely don't know what — or how — to post anymore. Revisiting that era gives people a socially acceptable break from having to respond, react, or perform relevance,\" she said.\n\nCelebrities like Charlie Puth, Eva Longoria, Lucy Hale, and Karlie Kloss have jumped on the trend, posting awkward, unglamorous selfies.\n\nKylie Jenner's 2016 post on Thursday, captioned \"You just had to be there,\" has gotten over 2.4 million likes as of press time. The \"Keeping up with the Kardashians\" star posted pictures of herself wearing skinny jeans, black Converse high tops, and her iconic Kylie Lip Kit.\n\nMakeup artist and beauty influencer James Charles revived a full 2016 cut-crease eyeshadow routine in a TikTok video on Wednesday, which has garnered about 5.6 million views.\n\nOthers used the trend to remember milestones. John Legend posted a picture of himself and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, sharing a kiss after the birth of their first child in 2016.\n\nAnd brands wasted no time capitalizing on the throwback trend. LA-based fashion brand Reformation posted pictures of celebrities like Taylor Swift and Emily Ratajkowski in its 2016 range with the caption, \"We miss 2016 too.\"\n\nThe trend reveals a yearning for a simpler time, social media and PR experts say.\n\nHailey Bailey, the founder of Los Angeles-based PR and talent management firm Image PR, said the trend is a result of millennials like herself \"craving the innocence, promise, and naivety of our summer 2016 selves.\"\n\n\"I think most millennials look at where they are at in life right now and think, 'Wow, I thought I'd be in a different place,'\" Bailey said. \"Many of us can't afford to buy a house anytime soon, or haven't found the right partner, or are so career-focused we can't even think about having children.\"\n\nBrulhart said that in 2016, chronological posts were the only way to experience Instagram. That was before Reels, AI-generated \"slop,\" and hyper-clean, aesthetic-first feeds took over the app.\n\n\"There was far less curation, and people weren't trying to brand themselves with every post,\" she said. \"They were documenting life as it happened, not worrying about the likes or engagement.\"\n\nThe trend felt like a gentle moment of reflection to her.\n\n\"It's not about wanting to go backward, but about remembering a version of ourselves that perhaps felt lighter,\" Brulhart said.",

    "description": "And laying off 1,500 people as it pivots from VR to AI wearables.",
    "fullText": "Users of Supernatural got an unpleasant surprise this week: Meta has pulled the plug on its flagship virtual reality fitness app. Citing \"organizational changes,\" Meta says it will no longer release new content or update features for Supernatural.\n\nThe app is not shutting down completely however. Subscribers can still access Supernatural's existing library of Beat Saber-workouts, and Meta says it will maintain the platform and Facebook page, but no new workouts, features, or other content is planned.\n\nBoth users and critics have nearly universally praised Supernatural—CNet scored it 9 out of 10, it won both Fast Company's Best App award in 2020 and a Webby in 2023, and boasted celebrity tie-ins with Jane Fonda and Bon Jovi. Meta doesn't publish subscriber numbers for Supernatural, but there are over 110,000 members of Supernatural's Facebook community. Not enough, apparently, to warrant keeping the app going.\n\nIn 2021, Meta spent an estimated $400 million to purchase Within, Supernatural's developer, even battling the FTC to make the deal, and the app was a heavily promoted part of the company's overall \"Metaverse\" strategy.\n\nThe shuttering of Supernatural is part of a larger shift at Meta. This week, the company laid off 1,500 people—about 10% of the staff—from Reality Labs, Meta's hardware and virtual reality division. “We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables. This is part of that effort,” a Meta spokesman told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAlong with cuts at Supernatural, Meta is closing three studios behind some of the most prominent, high-end VR games: Armature, who brought Resident Evil 4 to VR, Sanzaru, the studio behind Asgard’s Wrath, and Twisted Pixel, creators of Deadpool VR.",

The drivers were from Guatemala and Honduras.\n\n\"ICE did not enter the Meta site at any time,\" the office said.\n\nMeta declined to comment to Business Insider.\n\nThe Meta project is the largest of several multi-gigawatt data centers that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said will come online as the company races to catch up on AI computing capacity.\n\nWednesday's arrests crystallize an issue that companies have increasingly had to grapple with over the past year: how to prepare workers for an ICE encounter, whether on or off company property.\n\nThe action also follows a recent surge of ICE activity in cities and towns across the US, which has met some resistance in Democratic-led states.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has been a prominent supporter of President Donald Trump's immigration policies. The state is receiving nearly $1 million a month to house detainees at its Angola prison, Axios reported, citing public records.",

    "fullText": "Accounts removed or restricted on Twitch, Kick, YouTube, Threads, Facebook, Instagram, Snap, X, TikTok and Reddit in world-leading ban\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nMore than 4.7m social media accounts held by Australians who platforms have judged to be under 16 years of age were deactivated, removed or restricted in the first days after the ban came into effect in December, the prime minister has said.\n\nAfter the social media ban came into effect on 10 December, the eSafety commissioner sent questions to each of the platforms covered by the ban asking how many accounts had been removed in order to comply with the law.\n\nThe 10 platforms the government announced were covered by the ban were Twitch, Kick, YouTube, Threads, Facebook, Instagram, Snap, X, TikTok and Reddit.\n\nAccording to data received in response to these questions, released by the prime minister on Thursday, more than 4.7m accounts were deactivated, removed or restricted in the first few days of the ban.\n\nThe government cited commercial confidentiality in declining to break down the number of accounts affected on each platform, however, Meta on Monday said it had deactivated almost 550,000 accounts across Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\n\nGuardian Australia has sought comment from other platforms regarding their individual numbers.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said preliminary analysis from eSafety suggested the platforms were preventing users from holding accounts.\n\n“It’s encouraging that social media companies are making meaningful effort to comply with laws and keep kids off their platforms,” he said.\n\n“Change doesn’t happen overnight. But these early signs show it’s important we’ve acted to make this change.”\n\nThe communications minister, Anika Wells, said eSafety would examine the data to see what it shows about the compliance of individual platforms.\n\n“We’ve said from the beginning that we weren’t expecting perfection straight away – but early figures are showing this law is making a real, meaningful difference.”\n\nThe federal opposition, which campaigned for the policy before it was adopted by the government, last week said the ban implementation had “fallen flat”.\n\n“Many under-16 accounts have not been deactivated, while others that were initially removed have since become active again,” the shadow communications minister, Melissa McIntosh, said.\n\n“New accounts are being created and the age-verification tools that the government assured Australians would be effective, have proven laughably easy to bypass with some makeup and good lighting.”\n\nMcIntosh said children who lost access had migrated to other platforms such as Yope and Lemon8, arguing they were not included in the ban.\n\nThe ban requires all platforms to self-assess as to whether the ban should apply to them, and the government indicated it would approach other platforms to seek compliance should teens migrate to those platforms.\n\nSome platforms such as X alternative Bluesky implemented age-assurance despite not being initially named in the list released by the government.\n\nWhile the UK and other countries are considering following Australia’s lead, a new study on Wednesday tracking 11 to 14-year-olds in the UK found no evidence for boys or girls that heavier social media use or more frequent gaming increased teenagers’ symptoms of anxiety or depression.\n\nIt found social media use from year 8 to year 9 and from year 9 to year 10 had no detrimental impact on their mental health the following year.",

    "fullText": "Meta, which operates social media platforms Instagram and Facebook, is rethinking its investments after a group of its products failed to yield profitable results over the past few years.\n\nMeta’s Reality Labs division produces its virtual reality headsets and augmented reality smart glasses, supporting the company's overall metaverse vision. The division has incurred approximately $73 billion in losses since 2021.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2025 alone, Reality Labs faced a loss of $4.43 billion from operations, according to Meta's latest earnings report.\n\nRecent data from market research firm IDC, obtained by The Register, revealed that Meta shipped only 1.7 million Quest virtual reality headsets during the first three quarters of 2025, representing a 16% decline compared to the same period in 2024.\n\n“All of these ideas that AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality) would replace smartphones didn’t happen,” said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for data and analytics at IDC, in a statement to The Register. “It will never happen.”\n\nThe losses come after Meta spent years investing billions of dollars in its metaverse concept (a 3D virtual world where people socialize, shop, play, etc.) amid innovations in virtual reality technology; however, consumer interest in the metaverse has declined in recent years.\n\nAccording to Google Trends data, “metaverse” was a search term that reached its peak between late 2021 and early 2022 and has since declined in popularity.\n\nA survey conducted by YouGov in February last year found that the majority of Americans had not used the metaverse in 2024.\n\nOnly 26% of Americans have used the metaverse in the past 12 months.\n\nApproximately 1 in 10 Americans said that no brand presence would tempt them into the metaverse.\n\nAdditionally, 29% of non-metaverse users said they would be more inclined to join if equipment costs were lower.\n\nAlso, 23% said that more metaverse activities or experiences that interest them would push them to join.\n\nIn comparison, 22% said stronger security and privacy protections could be a deciding factor and 19% would be more interested if they could use the metaverse without a VR headset.\n\nAs Meta faces declining metaverse consumer demand, it has decided to lay off over 1,000 employees in its Reality Labs division, according to a recent report from Bloomberg.\n\nThe division currently has about 15,000 employees, so the layoffs will shrink the team by about 10%. The job cuts come after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company executives began eyeing potential budget cuts as high as 30% for the company’s metaverse business last month.",

    "fullText": "(Correction: This story has been updated to correct the name of the company that owns WINK, which is Fort Myers Broadcasting.)\n\nLess than a week after WINK News fired its chief meteorologist, Matt Devitt, another member of the WINK News weather team announced her departure in a social media post on Tuesday (Jan. 13).\n\nMeteorologist Nikki Sheaks posted on Facebook she's leaving WINK News for a meteorologist position with WPBF 25 News in Palm Beach, an ABC affiliate owned by Hearst Television. WINK News is owned by Fort Myers Broadcasting.\n\n\"I am so excited to finally get to announce that I’m coming home to South Florida! I am thrilled to be joining the WPBF 25 News weather team as their newest meteorologist! It’s always been the dream to get home and I am so thankful for the journey that finally got me here! My last show on WINK will be January 25.\"\n\nVote! Florida weatherman Matt Devitt was fired. Who will replace him at WINK?\n\nWith the departure of Sheaks and the firing of Devitt, who announced on his social media on Jan. 9 that he was no longer employed at the Fort Myers CBS affiliate after a decade there, WINK is down to five on its \"weather authority\" team to cover the weather on its platforms.\n\nOn Tuesday (Jan. 13) Devitt went to his social media again to express frustration about not being able to delete his Facebook page associated with WINK News. He said this:\n\n\"They're not allowing me to (Facebook) take my former employer out of my name and \"rejecting\" my request to.\"\n\nMore: Schwartzel denies any role in WINK firing of meteorologist Matt Devitt\n\nHi all. Thanks everyone for the overwhelming support over the past several days, I really appreciate it. Some have asked why I haven't changed my name on @Facebook or been posting updates. They're not allowing me to (Facebook) take my former employer out of my name and…\n\n— Matt Devitt (@MattDevittWX) January 13, 2026\n\nAs of Wednesday morning (Jan. 14) the Devitt-WINK News Facebook page with 1.2 million followers was still active.\n\nAccording to the WINK News website, Sheaks joined WINK News in April 2023. She is a Miami native and Florida International University graduate. Sheets holds dual degrees in Atmospheric Science and Broadcast Journalism. In March 2023, she earned the Certified Broadcast Meteorologist designation from the American Meteorological Society.\n\nBefore joining WINK, Sheaks was a weekday meteorologist in Panama City Beach, covering tornado outbreaks, wildfires, and tropical weather across the Florida Panhandle. Her passion for science reporting also led her to produce in-depth environmental features on issues ranging from recycling to animal rescues. In 2022, she earned finalist recognition from the Florida Association of Broadcast Journalists.\n\nEarlier in her career, Sheaks forecasted live from high-profile events in Colorado, including the Aspen X-Games and the Junior College World Series. She began her broadcast journey behind the scenes as a writer at WSVN in Miami.\n\nPlease support local community journalism and stay informed about Southwest Florida news by subscribing to The News-Press and Naples Daily News; download the free News-Press or Naples Daily News app, and \n\nThis article originally appeared on Fort Myers News-Press: TV station of fired Florida weather man loses another meteorologist",

    "fullText": "Research finds no evidence heavier social media use or more gaming increases symptoms of anxiety or depression\n\nScreen time spent gaming or on social media does not cause mental health problems in teenagers, according to a large-scale study.\n\nWith ministers in the UK considering whether to follow Australia’s example by banning social media use for under-16s, the findings challenge concerns that long periods spent gaming or scrolling TikTok or Instagram are driving an increase in teenagers’ depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions.\n\nResearchers at the University of Manchester followed 25,000 11- to 14-year-olds over three school years, tracking their self-reported social media habits, gaming frequency and emotional difficulties to find out whether technology use genuinely predicted later mental health difficulties.\n\nParticipants were asked how much time on a normal weekday in term time they spent on TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and other social media, or gaming. They were also asked questions about their feelings, mood and wider mental health.\n\nThe study found no evidence for boys or girls that heavier social media use or more frequent gaming increased teenagers’ symptoms of anxiety or depression over the following year.\n\nIncreases in girls’ and boys’ social media use from year 8 to year 9 and from year 9 to year 10 had zero detrimental impact on their mental health the following year, the authors found. More time spent gaming also had a zero negative effect on pupils’ mental health.\n\n“We know families are worried, but our results do not support the idea that simply spending time on social media or gaming leads to mental health problems – the story is far more complex than that,” said the lead author Dr Qiqi Cheng.\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of Public Health, also examined whether how pupils use social media makes a difference, with participants asked how much time spent chatting with others, posting stories, pictures and videos, browsing feeds, profiles or scrolling through photos and stories. The scientists found that actively chatting on social media or passive scrolling feeds did not appear to drive mental health difficulties.\n\nThe authors stressed that the findings did not mean online experiences were harmless. Hurtful messages, online pressures and extreme content could have detrimental effects on wellbeing, but focusing on screen time alone was not helpful, they said.\n\n“Our findings tell us that young people’s choices around social media and gaming may be shaped by how they’re feeling but not necessarily the other way around,” said Prof Neil Humphrey, a co-author. “Rather than blaming technology itself, we need to pay attention to what young people are doing online, who they’re connecting with and how supported they feel in their daily lives.”",

    "fullText": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nOwning a home might be the American dream, but Kevin O'Leary thinks too many people are rushing into a nightmare.\n\nIn a Facebook post shared alongside his Fox Business interview in November, the \"Shark Tank\" investor gave blunt advice to young adults debating whether to rent or buy. When asked outright which path to take, O'Leary didn't hesitate: \"Rent.\"\n\nHis reasoning? \"Start by renting until you start a family and keep it small, 1,500 feet or less if you've got the average salary of $70,000 annually,\" he wrote. \"Once you decide to have a child, you gotta expand a little bit, get that second bedroom and also have an office in the house. Then you buy a home.\"\n\nMissed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs? This Platform Lets Everyday Investors Access Private Tech Early\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nIn the accompanying video, he doubled down, warning buyers not to jump into homeownership unless they plan to stay put for at least five years. \"The issue around a home, if you're gonna buy and go through expenses of buying it, paying all the commissions and all the taxes and everything else, you gotta be there for five years,\" O'Leary said.\n\nThat five-year rule is a common benchmark among financial experts. Closing costs, property taxes, realtor commissions, and interest-heavy mortgage payments make it difficult to build any real equity in the first few years. If you sell too soon, you may walk away with little to nothing—sometimes even a loss.\n\nO'Leary hinted at another reason for the wait: stability. \"There's a good chance you'll be there for five years, assuming the marriage lasts,\" he added dryly, suggesting that homeownership should follow—not precede—big life decisions like starting a family.\n\nTrending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nFor singles or couples still figuring it out, his advice is clear: rent something manageable, don't overextend, and keep your housing budget in line with your income. At a $70,000 salary, even modest homes can stretch affordability—especially with current mortgage rates hovering around 7%.\n\nInstead of viewing renting as \"throwing money away,\" O'Leary frames it as a strategic placeholder. It buys time, flexibility, and lets young adults figure out where they want to live long term, what kind of space they actually need, and whether buying makes sense in their city.",

    "fullText": "Silicon Valley is raising its standards for talent.\n\nAdrien Friggeri spent over a decade combined at Meta — including back when it was called Facebook — with stints at Michael Bloomberg's Hawkfish and Clubhouse as well. Now, he works as a partner software engineer at Microsoft, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe consequences of underperforming are \"more drastic\" now than they were 10 years ago, Friggeri said on \"The Peterman Pod.\"\n\nIn an email to Business Insider, Friggeri wrote that there is less \"organizational 'slack'\" and higher expectations for tech employees.\n\n\"That means performance gaps are identified and addressed faster, and if someone is not meeting clearly defined expectations over time, the path to a formal performance-management process (and potentially a role change or exit) can be shorter than it used to be,\" Friggeri wrote.\n\nMeta has been especially strict with its performance expectations. The tech giant laid off roughly 3,600 employees in February, labeling them low performers.\n\nThere are also benefits to being above the pack. Meta is introducing higher bonuses for top performers, Business Insider reported on Monday.\n\nIn his email, Friggeri clarified that the trend was not specific to Meta. Rather, it was industry-wide and reflected the state of the market. Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFriggeri shared four tips with Business Insider to stay ahead and avoid underperformance.\n\n1.) Workers should make expectations explicit.\n\n\"Align with your manager on priorities and what 'great' looks like for the next 30/60/90 days,\" Friggeri wrote.\n\n2.) Employees should seek out feedback.\n\nThey shouldn't wait for review cycles, Friggeri wrote. Feedback should be sought out \"early and often.\"\n\n3.) Focus on \"visible, high-leverage work.\"\n\n\"Pick projects tied to clear outcomes and communicate progress, risks, and tradeoffs,\" he wrote.\n\n4.) Keep investing in your skills\n\nFriggeri wrote that employees should \"treat learning as part of the job, especially as teams and priorities shift.\"\n\nOn the podcast, Friggeri advocated for being independent and building new projects — and not being silent about them. It's not helpful to \"lock yourself in a room,\" build for three months, and show up with the finished product.\n\n\"Overcommunicate is really the strategy I would recommend,\" he said.",

    "title": "Meta cuts more than 1k in Bay Area tech's first big layoff of 2026",
    "description": "The company wants to plow more money into its wearable tech.",
    "fullText": "Meta is laying off more than 1,000 workers, signaling a partial retreat from the company’s much-derided metaverse ambitions.\n\nThe layoff, the Bay Area tech industry’s first big job cut of 2026, was announced Tuesday morning in an internal post from Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, according to a Bloomberg report that Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed to SFGATE. The cuts won’t touch Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp; they’re within Meta’s Reality Labs arm, an operation that’s poured investment into the “metaverse” idea and also sells the company’s virtual reality headsets and Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables,” Clayton wrote in an emailed statement. “This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year.”\n\nAs of Tuesday at 9:15 a.m., the Menlo Park company had not filed a WARN document with California officials announcing the local scope of the layoffs.\n\nMeta’s pullback from its metaverse goals has been a long time coming. When Mark Zuckerberg changed his company’s name from Facebook in October 2021, he expounded on the idea of a virtual world where people could work, learn, play and shop together, calling it an “embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it.”\n\nHe wrote, “Feeling truly present with another person is the ultimate dream of social technology.” His ambitions were, like the rhetoric, grand: “Our hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers.”\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBut hype around the idea of a metaverse — at one point, people were buying virtual land on other companies’ versions of the metaverse — quickly faded into derision. Meta was mocked for its legless virtual avatars, and failed to turn its Horizon Worlds metaverse product into a hit.\n\nRather than renewing the company, the ambition instead has served as a drag on Meta’s finances. In 2024, the company reported spending 21% of its costs on the Reality Labs segment, even as it lost more than $17.7 billion in the division. Quarter after quarter, the long-term bet has eaten into Meta’s vast social media ad profits. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the division has turned a $71 billion loss since the start of 2021.\n\nZuckerberg’s choice to move that investment toward Meta’s wearables, rather than the metaverse, is a bet on products that Meta has been actually able to find large audiences for. The company’s Quest headsets are well-reviewed and far, far cheaper than Apple’s Vision Pro offering. Bloomberg reported that Meta is considering doubling its output of its new artificial intelligence-embedded glasses, thanks to high demand.\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAs SFGATE reported, Zuckerberg is imagining a future where anyone not wearing high-tech frames will be at a “cognitive disadvantage.” Moving money from the metaverse toward wearables means he’s swapping one lofty ambition for another.\n\nWork at a Bay Area tech company and want to talk?

    "fullText": "Michael Burry says he's betting against Nvidia instead of Meta, Alphabet, or Microsoft because the chipmaker is particularly vulnerable to the AI boom ending in disaster.\n\nNvidia is \"simply the purest play,\" Burry wrote in a Substack post last weekend. The company has become \"entirely dependent on hyperscaler spending, and I do not see how that math works,\" he continued.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing online late last year, added that Nvidia is likely to \"sell $400 billion of its chips this year and there are less than $100 billion in application layer use cases.\"\n\n\"Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,\" Burry wrote. \"So shorting it is cheap.\"\n\nBurry also name-checked CoreWeave, a provider of cloud services built for AI and a strategic partner of Nvidia, calling it the graphics-processor giant's \"pet.\"\n\nNvidia's stock price has surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, making the graphics-chip maker the world's most valuable public company with a $4.5 trillion market capitalization.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBurry said that betting against Meta would mean he was \"also shorting its social media/advertising dominance,\" and placing a wager against Alphabet would mean he was \"shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc.\"\n\nHe added that being short Microsoft would be tantamount to \"shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,\" referring to the company's software-as-a-service tools, including Word and Excel.\n\nThose Big Tech titans aren't \"pure shorts on AI\" and have staying power, Burry wrote.\n\n\"They will realize they should not be spending so much, write off assets, and possibly restate earnings,\" he said. \"But they still are dominant companies globally away from the AI buildout.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Burry said he would short OpenAI if it were a public company. He highlighted the ChatGPT maker's $500 billion valuation in October, which exceeds the market values of Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, and Costco.\n\nBurry said he owns bearish put options on Oracle, and directly shorted the database company in the last six months.\n\n\"I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making,\" he wrote, adding that the company, cofounded by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, is making unnecessary, inexplicable moves and \"ego\" might be the driver.\n\nBurry is famous for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, an episode of his career that was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short.\"\n\nHe wrote on Substack that \"technological obsolescence is on the menu as Nvidia now seems to introduce a new chip solution every year or less.\"\n\nThat echoed a previous post in which he said Nvidia's Big Tech customers were overstating the lifespan of its chips to drag out their depreciation and flatter their short-term profits, raising the prospect of future writedowns.\n\nBurry also warned of trouble ahead, saying he's betting against AI stocks to \"have the exposure on the right side when the music stops.\"\n\nBurry spoke about AI more broadly in his post, drawing a parallel between its rise and the history of electricity.\n\nHe pointed out that building power plants and grids in the late 1980s and early 1990s required \"massive upfront capital outlays,\" technological advances meant equipment such as transformers became quickly outdated and assets rapidly depreciated, and \"cutthroat price warfare\" between suppliers meant many ran into financial difficulties and were forced to merge with rivals.\n\n\"What I see in electrification is very similar to what happened during the 2000 data transmission bubble and what I see happening with the AI bubble,\" he wrote.\n\nBurry said that electricity was as transformative to the modern world as a medicine that enables a patient to walk 10 feet, whereas AI \"might be the anabolic steroid that allows superhuman feats of strength and ability,\" but could ultimately prove \"more dangerous than anything.\"\n\nHe also repeated his caution that if the US tries to win the AI race by going all-in on increasingly power-hungry chips, it will lose as China is ramping up its power-generation capacity much more quickly.\n\n\"I see a big inventory problem in the AI buildout as a result of the current power generation setup,\" Burry said.",

Meta has said it plans to invest $600 billion in US infrastructure and jobs, including AI data centers, by 2028.\n\nThe Department of Energy provides a few handy comparisons for the amount of power in one gigawatt: It's roughly half the output of the Hoover Dam, or the power of 2,627 Tesla Model 3s. Famously, the DeLorean, the iconic time machine in \"Back To The Future Part II,\" needed 1.21 gigawatts to travel through time.\n\nSantosh Janardhan, the company's head of infrastructure, and Daniel Gross, who joined Meta last year from AI startup Safe Superintelligence, will lead the new Meta Compute initiative.\n\nThe two executives will work closely with Dina Powell McCormick, Meta's newly appointed president and vice chairperson, who will focus on partnering with governments and sovereign entities to help build and finance infrastructure. Powell McCormick is a former deputy national security advisor to President Donald Trump and spent 16 years at Goldman Sachs.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHave a tip?

It has faced repeated rounds of cuts as Meta shifts its attention — and spending — toward AI.\n\nIn a memo obtained by Business Insider last year, Bosworth called 2025 \"the most critical\" year of his tenure and warned the outcome would determine whether Reality Labs is remembered as visionary work or \"a legendary misadventure.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Meta's new Checkpoint program restructures worker ratings and incentives, rewarding top performers with up to 300% of their base bonuses.",
    "fullText": "Meta is overhauling how it grades workers and rewarding top performers with up to 300% of their base bonuses, according to internal screenshots of a memo sent to employees on Monday that Business Insider obtained.\n\nThe social media giant is rolling out a new performance program called Checkpoint, which reshapes ratings into four buckets, according to the memo. It will start in \"mid-year 2026,\" aiming to make performance reviews less bureaucratic and more focused on outcomes.\n\n\"The new scale reflects what we know to be true: most people at Meta are high performers who consistently deliver meaningful impact,\" the memo said.\n\nIn particular, Meta said its new system will incentivize the strongest performers with higher bonuses.\n\nHere's how the memo outlines the new distribution and pay multipliers for base bonuses.\n\nAdditionally, Meta says it's introducing a new Meta Award, a 300% individual multiplier for a small number of top performers who deliver \"truly exceptional impact.\"\n\n\"We're evolving our performance program to simplify it and placing greater emphasis on rewarding outstanding performance,\" a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider. \"While our employees have always been held to a high-performance, impact-based culture, this new direction allows for more frequent feedback and recognition in a more efficient way.\"\n\nThe memo says most employees will fall into \"Excellent\" because \"most people at Meta are high-performers who consistently deliver meaningful impact.\"\n\nThe company plans to host a companywide meeting on January 22 to walk employees through the changes and answer questions. The new updates apply to the 2026 performance year and do not affect the current cycle.\n\nMeta pitched the redesign as a time-saver. Managers, the memo says, spend about 80 hours a year on performance-related tasks, while employees collectively spend 330,000 hours per cycle on peer feedback. Yet fewer than 25% of managers say that feedback is helpful, the memo adds.\n\nUnder Checkpoint, Meta will transition to two cycles a year — mid-year and year-end — using the same rating scale in both cycles, with bonuses paid out twice annually. Meta will still deliver equity refresher grants once a year, though they will be based on the average of two performance ratings rather than a single annual rating. Merit increases will happen once a year following the second cycle.\n\nCheckpoint rolled out after Zuckerberg framed 2025 as an \"intense\" year and said Meta would tighten performance management, including cutting about 5% of low performers. In interviews, Meta employees and managers described the result as a tougher, more competitive environment where ratings mattered more than before.\n\nThe new system also streamlines Meta's previous rating system.\n\nEarlier, employees navigated different sets of labels depending on the time of year, including three mid-year buckets (such as \"Exceeds Expectations\" and \"Below Expectations\"), and a more granular year-end ladder that ranged from \"Redefines Expectations\" to \"Does Not Meet Expectations.\"\n\nMeta's latest revamp comes as the company has been tightening performance management in recent years. Meta plans to assess performance by AI-driven impact starting this year, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nLast year, it expanded the number of employees managers are expected to place in the lowest bucket. Meta instructed managers of large teams to rank 15% to 20% of employees as \"below expectations,\" up from 12% to 15% the previous year, after the company had earlier that year cut nearly 4,000 employees it had labeled as low performers, Business Insider reported last May.\n\nOther tech giants, such as Google and Amazon, also revised their performance review systems and pay structures to incentivize top performers. As part of this year's performance review process, Amazon will ask corporate employees to submit three to five \"accomplishments\" that best reflect their work, Business Insider reported.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Meta named Dina Powell McCormick as its president and vice chairman. She previously advised President Donald Trump and worked at Goldman Sachs.",
    "fullText": "Meta has a new president — and she's a former advisor to President Donald Trump.\n\nThe tech giant named Dina Powell McCormick as its president and vice chairman on Monday. Powell McCormick joined Meta's board in April before resigning in December.\n\nBefore joining Meta, Powell McCormick served as a deputy national security advisor to Trump. The president applauded her appointment on Truth Social: \"A great choice by Mark Z!!\"\n\nPowell McCormick is the second former Trump official appointed to a Meta leadership position in 2026. Last week, the company hired C.J. Mahoney, a deputy US trade representative during Trump's first term, as its chief legal officer.\n\nHere are three things to know about Dina Powell McCormick:\n\nPowell McCormick worked as a Trump advisor during his first term, with a focus on the Middle East.\n\nShe had a personal tie to the region. Powell McCormick was born in Cairo, where her father was a captain in the Egyptian army. In 1977, her family moved to Dallas.\n\nDuring her stint with the Trump administration, Powell McCormick oversaw a $200 billion US-Saudi arms deal, spearheaded Trump's Middle East tour, and was considered to take over as Trump's chief of staff or representative to the United Nations.\n\nShe left the Trump administration in 2018.\n\nPowell McCormick also served under President George W. Bush. She started in a personnel role, before rising to senior White House assistant and assistant secretary of state under Condoleezza Rice.\n\nAt the time of her resignation in 2007, Powell McCormick was the highest-ranking Arab American in the Bush administration.\n\nAfter leaving the Bush administration, Powell McCormick went to Goldman Sachs, where she was hired as a managing director.\n\nPowell McCormick shot up in stature, making partner in three years. Her rapid rise sparked some bitterness among Goldman's underclass, according to The New York Times and Vanity Fair.\n\nUnder her leadership, Goldman launched its 10,000 Women program. She also oversaw the 10,000 Small Businesses program and served as the president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation.\n\nPowell McCormick was popular among some of Goldman's biggest names, including Anne Black, the former president of Goldman Sachs Gives and current managing partner at JP Morgan.\n\n\"She was really a steadfast champion for me and others of us on the team, who were all promoted thanks to her,\" Black told Vanity Fair. \"She elevated my game, inspired me to be creative and bold, and expected us to show results.\"\n\nPowell McCormick left Goldman Sachs in 2023.\n\nWhile Powell McCormick no longer works in politics, she's still involved through her husband: Pennsylvania senator Dave McCormick.\n\nThe couple wed in 2019. Soon after, Dave began eyeing a Senate run, and Dina became involved in the campaign. She made trips to Mar-a-Lago with her husband and appeared in several ads.\n\nDave ended up conceding the Republican nomination to Mehmet Oz — also known as television's Dr. Oz — in the 2022 race. Oz lost the general election to John Fetterman and was later appointed by Trump to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nIn 2024, Dave ran again, narrowly winning a Senate seat and beating incumbent Bob Casey. Dina accompanied him to his swearing-in.",

    "description": "No, your Instagram account wasn't hacked.",
    "fullText": "If you received an unsolicited password reset email from Instagram in recent days, you don't need to panic. These messages don't appear to be the result of a new data breach or account compromise, but rather a bug that Meta claims it has now fixed.\n\nFollowing a wave of suspicious account recovery requests, antivirus software provider Malwarebytes posted a warning on Jan. 9 that threat actors had stolen personal information from 17.5 million Instagram accounts. As BleepingComputer reports, there have been various claims that hackers have obtained Instagram account data from multiple API scraping incidents in the last several years but notes that there haven't been any confirmed incidents nor definitive proof of a new breach. Meta has said the issue was the result of a bug that allowed threat actors to request password reset emails, which it has since patched, and denies that user data has actually been compromised.\n\nOf course, data breaches aren't uncommon, and Meta platforms have been targeted in the past. So you should still practice good digital hygiene and stay vigilant to phishing attempts that could indicate account compromise.\n\nIf you do receive an Instagram password reset email that you didn't request, you don't need to do anything with it. You can just ignore and delete the message. In general, you should avoid clicking links in security-related messages that seem urgent or sound scary (again, if you didn't initiate account recovery) as these can be phishing attempts designed to steal your credentials or other sensitive information. If you do want to change a password or update other security details for any account, you should go directly to the website or app and do so there.\n\nIf you haven't already, you can (and should) enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for Instagram. On the mobile app, open the Menu from your profile page and go to Accounts Center > Password and security > Two-factor authentication. You can choose to receive login codes via authentication app (like Google Authenticator or Duo), SMS, or WhatsApp. As I've written, not all 2FA methods are created equal: SMS codes are especially easily phished, so an authentication app is probably your best option here.\n\nFinally, you can check for suspicious devices logged into your Instagram account under Accounts Center > Password and security > Where you're logged in. If you see any devices you don't recognize, select it and tap Log out.",

    "fullText": "TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Richard “Dick” Codey, a former acting governor of New Jersey and the longest serving legislator in the state's history, died Sunday. He was 79.\n\nCodey’s wife, Mary Jo Codey, confirmed her husband’s death to The Associated Press.\n\n“Gov. Richard J. Codey passed away peacefully this morning at home, surrounded by family, after a brief illness,” Codey's family wrote in a Facebook post on Codey's official page.\n\n\"Our family has lost a beloved husband, father and grandfather -- and New Jersey lost a remarkable public servant who touched the lives of all who knew him,\" the family said.\n\nKnown for his feisty, regular-guy persona, Codey was a staunch advocate of mental health awareness and care issues. The Democrat also championed legislation to ban smoking from indoor areas and sought more money for stem cell research.\n\nCodey, the son of a northern New Jersey funeral home owner, entered the state Assembly in 1974 and served there until he was elected to the state Senate in 1982. He served as Senate president from 2002 to 2010.\n\nCodey first served as acting governor for a brief time in 2002, after Christine Todd Whitman’s resignation to join President George W. Bush’s administration. He held the post again for 14 months after Gov. Jim McGreevey resigned in 2004.\n\nAt that time, New Jersey law mandated that the Senate president assume the governor’s role if a vacancy occurred, and that person would serve until the next election.\n\nCodey routinely drew strong praise from residents in polls, and he gave serious consideration to seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2005. But he ultimately chose not to run when party leaders opted to back wealthy Wall Street executive Jon Corzine, who went on to win the office.\n\nCodey would again become acting governor after Corzine was incapacitated in April 2007 due to serious injuries he suffered in a car accident. He held the post for nearly a month before Corzine resumed his duties.\n\nAfter leaving the governor’s office, Codey returned to the Senate and also published a memoir that detailed his decades of public service, along with stories about his personal and family life.\n\n“He lived his life with humility, compassion and a deep sense of responsibility to others,” his family wrote. “He made friends as easily with Presidents as he did with strangers in all-night diners.”\n\nCodey and his wife often spoke candidly about her past struggles with postpartum depression, and that led to controversy in early 2005, when a talk radio host jokingly criticized Mary Jo and her mental health on the air.\n\nCodey, who was at the radio station for something else, confronted the host and said he told him that he wished he could “take him outside.” But the host claimed Codey actually threatened to “take him out,” which Codey denied.\n\nHis wife told The Associated Press that Codey was willing to support her speaking out about postpartum depression, even if it cost him elected office.\n\n“He was a really, really good guy,” Mary Jo Codey said. “He said, ‘If you want to do it, I don’t care if I get elected again.’”\n\nJack Brook contributed reporting from New Orleans.",

    "description": "Stephen Hutyra was inspired by a Facebook post to build a pub in his backyard. He spent $61,000 and created the space of his dreams.",
    "fullText": "Stephen Hutyra was scrolling Facebook in November 2020 when a post caught his attention.\n\nIt showed a couple in England who'd built a small pub in their backyard. Their design was simple, but inspiring.\n\nThe 42-year-old program analyst, who lives in the small town of West, Texas, immediately started imagining what it'd be like to have his own.\n\n\"We have a saying that everything is bigger and better in Texas,\" he told Business Insider. \"So I wanted our pub to be bigger and better than the one I saw in the picture.\"\n\nHutyra asked his wife if she'd be on board, and as soon as she said yes, he began buying furniture on Facebook Marketplace — despite not having a structure yet.\n\nHe later took out a bank loan, enlisted a contractor, and spent months perfecting his dream space. Now, Hutyra is the proud owner of The Thirsty Goat, a private pub built right in his backyard.\n\nHutyra told Business Insider that he'd joined the Navy right after high school and was first stationed in England. He lived in the seaside town of Newquay, where he'd frequent its various nightlife spots.\n\n\"I fell in love with all the pubs, and walking down the street to hang out with both Navy and local friends I'd made,\" he said. \"I'd really missed that part of my life.\"\n\nSo when he saw a Facebook post about a UK couple building a small pub in their backyard, a lightbulb went off: Hutyra could create his own in his Texas backyard.\n\nFor years, the grassy area had been Hutyra's space to store wood and let the family dogs play.\n\nAs soon as he envisioned a backyard pub, though, he knew the open land was the perfect spot.\n\n\"I almost immediately started making floor plans, buying tables and chairs off Facebook Marketplace, decor off Amazon, and bar items on eBay,\" he said.\n\nHutyra also started to virtually design the future pub. He spent hours on Facebook, Pinterest, and Google, where he found inspiration and added ideas to a PowerPoint presentation.\n\n\"My wife and I were driving back from a vacation in Port Aransas on the Texas coastline, and I said we had to make a pit stop at a bank to sign some loan papers,\" Hutyra said. \"She asked what for, and I said, 'The pub. You gave me your blessing a long time ago.'\"\n\nShe laughed, Hutyra entered the bank, and the couple later left with a $44,320 loan. They also got a permit to build the structure.\n\nA month later, in August 2023, the Hutyras had a contractor on-site who broke ground and began building.\n\nHutyra had never taken on a project of this size, so hiring a contractor was crucial.\n\nHe first paid them $600 to draw actual building construction plans, inspired by the PowerPoint presentation Hutyra had put together.\n\nFrom there, the team helped run vital water and electricity lines, create the pub's concrete base, and craft its shell, framing, and roof. They also added foam insulation.\n\nContractors worked until November 2023, at which point the pub was turned over to Hutyra.\n\nHe got to work with the help of his son and father, who Hutyra described as a master carpenter and overall handyman, to complete the build.\n\nTogether, they installed ceilings, painted walls, stained wood, added shelving, built the pub's bar, and more.\n\n\"I had about three years to plan, so when the time came, I knew where I wanted everything to be,\" Hutyra said. \"I had it planned down to the light switches.\"\n\nWhen you enter the pub, you're greeted by a dark-wood bar with string-light decor and matching stools.\n\nThere are also tables and chairs throughout, televisions above the door, and framed photos around the room.\n\nA chalkboard tells you which drinks are available, and if you visit during the holidays, you'll see glowing Christmas trees.\n\nSimilar to the rest of the bar, the bathroom has dark-wood panelling, framed photo decor, and running water.\n\n\"All the shelving that goes around the top of the pub, I did myself, but the bar was probably the biggest challenge for me,\" Hutyra said. \"I had to make a lot of cuts at different angles, and make sure it was straight and level. It was a lot of work.\"\n\nHutyra has spent 24 years in the Navy and currently serves as a chief petty officer. Naturally, the inspiration behind his pub's name came from his years of service.\n\n\"The goat is kind of like the official mascot for the Navy,\" he said. \"In the earlier days of the service, goats were kept aboard ships to provide fresh meat and milk to the crew. Other livestock didn't fare as well.\"\n\nThe area where the goats were kept was named the Goat Locker, he said, and the phrase has stuck around for more than 200 years. Now, it's the name for the chief's working quarters.\n\nWith that in mind, he named his pub The Thirsty Goat.\n\n\"I've been in the reserves the last 19 years now, and I've traveled the world and seen a lot of different places and things,\" Hutyra said. \"But I've always returned to my hometown. After buying a house here, I've really started to feel that family connection.\"\n\nSo he wanted to feel it in his pub, too. Hutyra has a jar from 1903 that belonged to his great-grandmother, which now sits on his bar as a tip jar. The bar itself also has ties to his ancestors.\n\nAs Hutyra was building his pub, a nearby homestead barn — built and owned by his great-great-great-grandfather around 1880 — was being demolished, so he salvaged some materials.\n\n\"The wood was actually in a remarkable condition,\" Hutyra said. \"I took floorboards from the second-story hayloft, which were under the roof of the barn, so they were out of the rain and weather.\"\n\n\"My father and I brought the wood back to his woodworking shop just across town, a few miles from my childhood home, where he still lives today,\" he added.\n\nTogether, they turned that wood into the top of Hutyra's bar, which is now the focal point of his pub.\n\nHutyra said that he and his wife always dreamed of owning a big house where they could have parties and host friends and family.\n\nNow, their personal pub has become that dream spot.\n\n\"We find ourselves sitting out here in the middle of the week until midnight, or until 2 or 3 a.m. on the weekends with family and friends,\" he said. \"We've thoroughly enjoyed it since finishing back in August, but we're only just starting to see how much we're going to use it.\"",

It’s a rare and aggressive cancer, and there is no cure.”\n\nThe 23-year-old said she had returned home to be with her mother and sisters “as we navigate what comes next”, describing the impact of the diagnosis on her family.\n\n“We are still in shock and learning how to sit with the weight of this news,” she wrote. “My mum is my hero, my best friend, my everything, and the person who has shaped every part of who I am.\n\n“She is the reason I am where I am today. Her strength, love and belief in me has carried me through everything. Trying to put into words what she means to me feels impossible.”\n\nHer family have also set up a GoFundMe page to help support her mother and stepfather during treatment. The page states that the cancer has “metastasised (spread) to her liver and gall bladder” and describes the disease as “very rare and aggressive”, adding that chemotherapy is hoped to offer more time.\n\nArsenal have not placed a timescale on Cooney-Cross’s return, with the priority understood to be supporting the player during a difficult period for her and her family.",

    "description": "Meta's Manus deal faces a probe from China's regulator. Analysts say it's about sending a message that China's AI talent isn't easy pickings.",
    "fullText": "China has a message for US tech firms: Hands off our AI talent and tech.\n\nThat's what Beijing is signalling by announcing a probe into Meta's acquisition of Manus, analysts told Business Insider.\n\nThe probe, confirmed by China's Ministry of Commerce in a Thursday press conference, will investigate whether the acquisition complies with the country's laws and regulations concerning export controls, according to a statement translated by Google.\n\nManus was launched in China last March by the AI product studio Butterfly Effect and drew global attention after saying it had designed a \"general-purpose\" AI agent that can conduct tasks with limited human supervision. In mid-2025, the startup relocated to Singapore.\n\nIn December, Meta announced that it would acquire Manus and sever its ties with China completely. The deal reportedly exceeds $2 billion. Meta did not respond to a request for comment for this story from Business Insider.\n\nWhile China and the US have long engaged in tit-for-tat regulatory exchanges involving their tech companies, analysts told Business Insider this probe is notable because it appears to be aimed at discouraging so-called \"Singapore washing\" — the process of moving a company from China to Singapore to reduce regulatory scrutiny.\n\nTikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and fast-fashion giant Shein are among those that have shifted their headquarters from China to Singapore.\n\nThe probe is also a means to discourage Chinese AI startups from choosing the US, analysts said.\n\n\"I see Beijing's probe as an effort to prevent the loss of AI technology and talent to foreign acquisition, especially to the US,\" Wendy Chang, a senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, told Business Insider.\n\nMeta said it plans to bring over Manus' top leadership and will continue to run its AI agent platform separately, alongside integrating the technology into Meta's own products.\n\nNvidia, the world's most valuable company, has been the subject of US export controls for years, which limit the sale of its advanced chips to China. The Manus probe shows how the battleground has moved from beyond chips to \"models, agents, talent, and enterprise deployment,\" Murthy Grandhi, a company profiles analyst at research firm GlobalData, told Business Insider.\n\nHanna Dohmen, senior research analyst at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, told Business Insider that while the probe \"isn't entirely surprising,\" the approach regulators are taking is \"more novel\" because it \"appears to focus on the movement of talent and IP.\"\n\nTalent has become a focal point of the AI race, with companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google offering huge pay packages to entice the best and brightest. Last year, Meta invested $14 billion in AI training startup Scale AI, bringing its CEO, Alexandr Wang, over to run the tech giant's AI efforts.\n\nChina's Manus probe could signal that it was policing \"outbound AI technology transfer with greater rigor,\" said Grandhi, adding that it could accelerate the \"bifurcation of AI ecosystems.\"\n\nThe US and China have been taking diverging approaches to AI, with Chinese companies tending to favor AI models that are more open, such as DeepSeek.\n\nIt's not clear how long China's probe will last, should it progress into a full investigation. Other investigations from China's Ministry have taken more than a year.\n\nGrandhi said that in his view, the most likely outcome is that the deal will be approved \"with constraints, rather than an outright block.\"\n\n\"Whatever the outcome may be, this certainly sends a signal to other US or foreign companies that are considering similar acquisitions,\" added Dohmen.",

    "fullText": "Meta Platforms is turning to nuclear power to drive its AI ambitions, and its latest deal with a trio of companies is sending stocks in the sector soaring.\n\nThe tech giant revealed that it signed an agreement with several companies to help supply nuclear power for its data centers, including the massive Prometheus AI supercluster being built in New Albany, Ohio. The one gigawatt facility is expected to come online later this year.\n\nThe three companies that will help power it are Oklo, Vistra Corp, and privately held TerraPower. Both nuclear power stocks surged on news of the Meta deal, sparking momentum for many of their peers as well.\n\nHere are the big moves in the space on Friday:\n\nThis isn't the first nuclear power deal that Meta has inked. Last summer, it announced a similar agreement with Constellation Energy, which saw its shares spike on the news.\n\n\"State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America's position as a global leader in AI,\" said Joel Kaplan, chief of global affairs at Meta. \"Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country's energy infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone.\"\n\nBig tech's support of nuclear energy has risen in recent years as experts have touted the need for alternative sources of power to enable the AI buildout. Oklo is backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, though he stepped down from his position as chairman of its board of directors in August 2025.\n\n\"Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced nuclear powerhouses in Ohio,\" Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte said. \"Today, that vision is becoming a reality through the support of a multi-year effort with Meta.\"",

    "fullText": "Meta's Chief Technology Officer and head of Reality Labs, Andrew Bosworth, has called an all-hands meeting for January 14, describing it as the \"most important\" of the year.\n\nBosworth is also strongly recommending that Reality Labs employees attend the division's meeting in person, two Meta employees told Business Insider.\n\nThe emphasis on in-person attendance is unusual for the division, which oversees the company's wearables, virtual and augmented reality initiatives, and a nascent robotics unit, these employees said. Some managers have told employees to \"drop what they're doing\" to attend the all-hands in person, one employee told Business Insider.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the meeting.\n\nWhile the division has seen some success, such as its Ray-Ban smart glasses, Reality Labs has been a costly venture for Meta, incurring losses of more than $70 billion since 2020.\n\nLast year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shifted the company's strategic focus toward AI and away from the metaverse. In 2025, Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI and hired its CEO, Alexandr Wang, as part of the major reset of the company's AI efforts. Meta then embarked on a multibillion-dollar hiring spree, poaching top-tier AI researchers and engineers from rivals such as OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\n\nReality Labs has faced repeated rounds of cuts over the past year. In December, Business Insider reported that Meta was planning budget cuts up to 30% and considering job cuts in Reality Labs.\n\nLast April, Meta laid off employees in Oculus Studios, its in-house gaming division, and the team behind Supernatural, the VR fitness app Meta acquired for over $400 million. Those cuts followed Meta's broader January 2025 layoffs that eliminated nearly 4,000 roles companywide, with at least 560 affecting Reality Labs employees.\n\nIn a memo obtained by Business Insider earlier last year, Bosworth referred to 2025 as \"the most critical\" year in his eight-year tenure at Reality Labs.\n\n\"This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure,\" he wrote.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Nandita Giri is a senior software engineer with experience at Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. She recommends job seekers spend an hour a day learning AI.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nandita Giri, a 32-year-old software engineer at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy journey began with problem-solving and math long before I knew I'd end up in Big Tech.\n\nI studied at the National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, in India. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google often scout talent from this school.\n\nAmazon hired me straight out of college, and I moved to Seattle in 2018. To get the job, there was a logical analysis test, and only a handful of us passed. Then came multiple interviews based on problem-solving. That's how my journey in tech began.\n\nI'm now a senior software engineer at Microsoft, and my AI skills are in high demand.\n\nWhen applying for roles at Amazon, it's not about solving problems as quickly as possible, but solving them optimally. You must carefully consider the issue so that the solution can scale and be easily maintained. Amazon has a set of leadership principles that play a key role in hiring decisions, and understanding these principles is just as important as your coding skills.\n\nOn my own time, I practiced on LeetCode, a platform for coding challenges, because I liked it, not because I was preparing for interviews. Over time, I developed a strong interest in AI.\n\nOnce I arrived at Amazon, I identified tasks and patterns that could be automated and suggested AI-based solutions to management, primarily focusing on internal workflow automation and data-driven decision support systems. That experience shaped my interest in building intelligent tools for enterprise use. Leadership gave me the green light to implement them, and I successfully integrated AI into our team's workflow.\n\nAfter working at Amazon for about four years, a recruiter from Meta contacted me on LinkedIn. I never aimed to work at Meta, but my skills opened up new opportunities. I wanted to work more deeply in applied AI, and Meta offered an opportunity to focus on building intelligent systems with large-scale data and infrastructure. It was a natural next step to grow in the AI space.\n\nI went through the interview process, secured the job, and began working at Meta in 2022.\n\nI was referred internally to Microsoft based on my work at Meta. I decided to move because I wanted to work on enterprise-focused AI products, such as Copilot, which aligns more closely with my long-term interests in building impactful tools for productivity and business transformation. I've been at Microsoft since 2023.\n\nThroughout my career, I've had multiple competitive opportunities. With each role change, my scope of responsibility, impact, and overall compensation increased.\n\nMost of what I know about AI, I taught myself. I spent hours outside work watching YouTube tutorials, reading blogs, and practicing. I started small, creating AI agents for personal tasks, like sending outreach emails. Tasks that used to take me a day or two can now be completed in under an hour.\n\nSeeing those results motivated me to keep learning. What started as a personal side project has now become a central part of my career.\n\nAmazon and Meta both incorporate fast-paced learning, but Meta's codebase is more straightforward. Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all built from a single repository, allowing you to understand the system more quickly.\n\nAmazon's codebase is huge, which makes the first year challenging, but the learning curve is worth it. Microsoft feels different altogether. It's more enterprise-focused, operating at a massive scale.\n\nAI excels at repetitive or static tasks, and our job is to monitor and guide it. Managing AI, I believe, is the future of software engineering.\n\nDemand for AI roles is skyrocketing, while traditional software engineering roles have shrunk over the last five years. Many of my friends who don't work in AI have struggled to land new offers.\n\nI recommend dedicating just one hour a day to learning AI. Within six months, you'll see real progress, and these skills will be critical for the next decade. For beginners, I recommend the following:\n\nIf I were to advise my younger self, I would tell her to focus less on perfection and more on making an impact, to take ownership early, speak up with confidence, and prioritize learning and growth over titles.\n\nLong-term growth comes from solving meaningful problems and maintaining resilience.",

But we will keep facing up to it and trying to turn the situation around, for ourselves and for the club.\n\n\"At times like this, it should be other people coming out to speak, but they don't - as has been happening for several years now. They only show up when things are going well.\n\n\"We'll stay here, working, sticking together and giving our all to turn things around. Especially at times like this, keeping quiet, working harder and moving forward all together, is part of football.\"",

    "description": "AI slop is everywhere — except it's not so sloppy anymore. Just take a look at Instagram or TikTok. A lot of it looks real. That's where you come in.",
    "fullText": "There was a time, not so long ago, when AI-generated content was very easy to spot. It was surreal, ridiculous — like Jesus made out of Shrimp.\n\nWe're in a new time now, and AI slop looks so good, it's hard to tell from the real thing. I've been fooled by it. You probably have, too, even if you don't think you have. For example, this extremely realistic video of Nicolás Maduro doing TikTok dances in prison with Diddy. You know it's AI only because it's improbable, not because the video quality is poor.\n\n2025: “AI will be used to cure cancer”\n\n2026:\n\n pic.twitter.com/u6KbygoLtm\n\nSo in a post-slop world, what comes next? What does our future look like with AI?\n\nOne person who would know something about both is Instagram head Adam Mosseri, who posted a prediction to Threads: He says AI images, text, and videos will get more and more realistic, and it'll become harder to separate them from what's real — including on the platform he oversees.\n\n(That's already happening to some extent: Long are the days when it was easy to spot a \"Shrimp Jesus\"-like AI-generated picture.)\n\nWhat I appreciate about Mosseri's memo is that he seems optimistic about what probably sounds like a bad thing to most people. Admitting his platform will be filled with AI-generated content meant to fool people — for funsies or profit — should, theoretically, be taking an L. But he sees this as a problem that can be solved (on Instagram, at least) at the product level:\n\nHis other point is that people will naturally gravitate toward human-produced content because that's what will become trendy: authentic, less polished, intimate, real.\n\n\"Authenticity is fast becoming a scarce resource, which will in turn drive more demand for creator content, not less,\" he writes. Which is certainly a hopeful message if your job is to run a platform for creator content and you're trying to reassure creators (and advertisers) that they should continue to post authentic content to your platform.\n\nI think he's generally right. The idea that human-created content will become more premium amid a flood of machine-created content seems to be the prevailing wisdom.\n\nAnother optimistic prognostication comes from OpenAI's chief economist, Aaron \"Ronnie\" Chatterji, who told the Financial Times that he believes AI will help free us from mundane household chores.\n\nLook, I love the sound of that as much as anyone, but I'm skeptical. Sure, someone is working on a robot that folds clothes, but it seems like it'll be a long time before that's a real thing for most of us. And it's hard to imagine automation doing the chores I really hate, like scrubbing toilets or sorting through the piles of papers and junk that accumulate on countertops daily. And I am highly, highly skeptical of a robot helping with childcare.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Thompson of Stratechery also seems to fall into the \"humans rock!\" side of things, which I find much more appealing as a human.\n\nHe wrote about a Substack essay that had been going viral among a subset of influential people who care about economics and AI. The essay suggested that once AI and automation make it so that humans no longer have to work, income inequality will actually be far worse.\n\nBut Thompson thinks that even if there's an exponentially bigger gap between the haves and have-nots in the year 2126 (which doesn't sound great on paper), we will still value and prize human labor precisely because it is human. He writes:\n\nI like the sound of this! It's quite self-serving to me, a human who creates something (writing words) that I suppose could be done by AI, but you would probably hate and not want to pay for if it were. And also as a human being who would like to keep the species going for another few generations, I suppose. I like to think this is hope rather than cope.",

    "title": "I deleted Instagram from my phone for a year. Being desktop-only connected me to friends without the drawbacks.",
    "description": "In late 2024, I deleted Instagram from my phone and only used it on desktop. It made me want to be more offline.",
    "fullText": "A little over a year ago, I started my 2025 resolution early: purging Instagram from my phone.\n\nIf you're a boomer or Gen Xer — someone who didn't grow up uploading multiple albums of each college party onto Facebook — I understand your judgment. Removing Instagram from my phone (while still using my account on my desktop) sounds as dramatic as switching to skim milk.\n\nBut that app was a social lifeline. It was where people announced their engagements, graduations, and pregnancies. It was how I tapped into what my friends (and friends of friends) were up to on a random Tuesday — a breezy conversational springboard. It assured I never fully lost touch with anyone: not with high school classmates, distant family members, or people I vaguely remembered meeting once at a party, long ago.\n\nWhile I'd waste fewer hours scrolling through painstakingly staged influencer weddings and overly simplified political infographics, I'd also miss milestones and inside jokes. Recede too much, and I might lose entire connections.\n\nIn the end, it was the best decision I made last year — arguably, in many years. I became a significantly happier person, and even the annoying parts of being a desktop-only Instagram user felt like perks.\n\nAt first, I'd still compulsively tap into the \"social media\" folder on my phone, expecting to find that sunset-hued camera icon. After about a week, I adjusted to my new reality. Like a treat-deprived lab rat, I picked up my phone less.\n\nWhat I called \"ghost emotions\" were gone. For the decade-plus I've had Instagram on my smartphone, I was used to sleepwalking into the app, seeing an image that vaguely stirred some negative emotion in me (envy, annoyance, exclusion), and carrying the remnants of that feeling into whatever I was doing in the real world.\n\nThis lined up with what researchers have found: that, for some people, social media is linked to higher irritability and declines in mental health. These side effects can outweigh the positives, like staying more connected to friends.\n\nInstagram declined to comment on this story.\n\nWithout the overload of information that didn't add anything to my life — and the nagging pressure to contribute to it — I felt like my brain was freer to enjoy other pursuits. I finished more books (and seemed to better process what I read). I busied my hands with crocheting instead of scrolling. Parties became more fun because I no longer mentally pre-rehearsed the photos I would take or the captions I would write.\n\nThere were some downsides to no longer having the app on my phone.\n\nWhile I generally didn't miss the pressure to post, it was frustrating not to have that option on the desktop version. When someone posted my professional work, all I could do was \"like\" the post and move on instead of resharing it. And if I was tagged in a friend's story and didn't check within 24 hours, I had absolutely no idea what they said.\n\nThe biggest hurdle was remembering birthdays. I'd grown used to depending on friends' story announcements. Now, if I didn't want to look like an ice-cold jerk on everyone's special days, I had to get creative.\n\nSo, I set aside about an hour one day. For birthdays I didn't already have memorized, I combed through every DM on Instagram, scrolling back to when I said \"happy birthday!\" and wrote every date into a Notes document on my phone.\n\nDid I feel slightly unhinged? Yes. But I also know no one's ever been mad about you wishing them a happy birthday (though, perhaps a few in my circle were a little spooked).\n\nI also pushed myself to get over my lifelong fear of reaching out first. If I wanted to feel social without social media, I'd need to be a little more outgoing.\n\nSometimes, this meant writing down reminders to text people when I thought of them, but was too busy at the moment to reach out. Other times, I offered to host the next knitting club or book club, or took the initiative to coordinate group plans when I'd usually wait for someone else to pick up the slack.\n\nThe social isolation I was so worried about never happened. If anything, I felt more social because I was prioritizing in-person interaction.\n\nOnce I got a taste of how freeing being offline could be, I wanted to go a step further.\n\nI hated how often I woke up (or stayed up late) reading the news. My insatiable need to always be in the know left me more scattered and irritable. So, I cut down on that, too. Halfway through the year, I bought a Brick device to block apps like my email or the internet on my phone.\n\nYes, sometimes, there are downsides. I've missed (or been late to) big life updates from less-close friends. I've drifted apart from a few others, with whom I shared mostly a meme-exchanging sort of friendship. While bittersweet, it has also helped me focus on fewer, closer friends than an unmanageably large network.\n\nNow, I spend my mornings journaling, chatting longer with my husband, or actually making it to a workout without rushing out the door. Eventually, I check my Instagram DMs the way I'd peruse my email in the 2010s. I tap a heart, I laugh at a video, and I return to my life.",

    "description": "Big Tech is largely throwing in the towel on big, virtual-reality face computers. But they're trying again with smaller glasses like Meta's Ray-Bans.",
    "fullText": "The tech industry has spent roughly a gazillion dollars trying to convince people to strap face computers on their heads. It hasn't worked.\n\nBut the tech guys haven't given up. Their new pitch: Instead of buying bulky goggles that replace your reality with a computer-generated version of something else, what about some glasses?\n\nYou can see evidence of the switch-up with a couple of recent news stories:\n\nAt first glance, this makes a bunch of sense: People don't wear big heavy stuff on their head unless they have to — like if they're skiing, perhaps. But lots of people wear glasses. So if the tech guys want to sell new tech, they should stop trying to make things people don't wear and focus on the things people already wear.\n\nThe reality is a little more complicated: Shrinking a computer — or even parts of a computer — into something that looks, feels, and weighs like glasses is incredibly hard. The lighter and cheaper you make them, the less they can do — which makes it harder to justify why you'd wear them at all.\n\nSo when Meta says it has been selling a ton of Ray-Ban Display Glasses, which start at $800 a pair, you need to put that in context: The company sold an estimated 15,000 units in the last three months of 2025.\n\nWe are likely to get a much better sense of consumer demand for this stuff in the next couple years, as more competition arrives.\n\nGoogle plans to sell glasses that work much like Meta's this year, though I assume they will be cheaper, since they don't use the \"neural wristband\" Meta includes with its glasses. It is also working on more ambitious glasses with more functionality — seemingly like the \"Orion\" headset Meta showed off in 2024, but has yet to start selling.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has reportedly shifted resources from its Apple Vision Pro so it can make some Meta-style glasses itself. And Meta is plugging away at \"Phoenix\" — a headset that's bigger than its Ray-Bans but still much smaller than the Quest headsets it has been selling for years. Those were supposed to launch in 2026 but have been pushed back to 2027, Business Insider's Jyoti Mann reported this week.",

    "fullText": "My clearest memory from middle school is pacing in my bedroom, phone in hand, repeating the word 'wake' again and again. I was testing a voice app I had written. If I said the phrase just right, the app would respond. If not, I would tweak the code and try again.\n\nI had just learned to code from YouTube. My apps were getting downloads, and I was addicted. I would run home from school, drop my backpack, and open the reviews before starting my homework. It was the first time I saw that code written alone in my bedroom could reach people I would never meet.\n\nAfter studying engineering and business at UC, Berkeley, and spending nearly two years working at Meta, I'm now running Frontdesk, an AI startup that helps businesses automate millions of conversations with AI.\n\nMy early programming projects were playful. I built a text-to-speech app and a speech-to-text app. Then, one of my relatives slipped and fell at home. He was yelling for help, but nobody was home, and his phone was out of reach. If his phone had been able to hear him, it could've brought him help immediately.\n\nIn 2016, I developed Rescuer, a voice app that enabled users to trigger an alarm by shouting a secret phrase, automatically sending their location, photos, and audio to designated emergency contacts.\n\nRescuer earned recognition from political officials and the press. What mattered more was that I learned that code written from my bedroom could help someone. From then on, I began building for real impact.\n\nI started answering questions on coding forums, recording YouTube coding tutorials, and writing for an engineering blog. Over time, my answers on forums like Stack Overflow reached millions of developers, which only deepened my passion for continuous learning.\n\nThere was still one thing I couldn't figure out, no matter how many downloads my apps received. I didn't know how to turn an app into a real business. I didn't understand pricing, customers, or why some products became companies while others remained weekend projects.\n\nAs I was deciding where to attend college, I knew I wanted to learn about the business side.\n\nI chose UC Berkeley's M.E.T. program because I could study both engineering and business. I graduated with an EECS (electrical engineering & computer science) and business degree in three years.\n\nIn 2023, when ChatGPT had its big moment, I asked myself, What if I could just talk to this thing on a real phone line?\n\nOver a weekend, I hacked together one of the first prototypes that connected ChatGPT to a real phone number. I posted a short clip and a tweet, and it got a lot of attention.\n\nThe tech was not ready to be a real product. Latency was bad. Reliability was fragile. The models made strange errors. But that experiment planted a question in my mind that I could not shake: If this ever became good enough, what would it look like to use it to help real businesses?\n\nI shelved my phone experiment to join Meta. It was a dream setup. My team was incredibly supportive, I was learning how to build at a massive scale, and life was good — from the smart colleagues to the famous free food.\n\nI was part of a fintech team where I'd push one line of code, and millions of transactions would be affected. It felt less like a corporation and more like a high-growth startup; I was given incredible ownership from day one and learned \n\nBut I was spending all my time behind the code. The business side, the part I'd learned to love at Berkeley, felt far away. As an engineer at a big company, there was no clear path back to the center.\n\nI wasn't working directly on AI, but I could sense the momentum building. Every few months, the models improved noticeably. My ChatGPT phone hack stopped feeling like a viral stunt and started to feel like a glimpse of the future.\n\nAfter my post went viral in college, hundreds of businesses reached out, asking for a solution. I kept thinking about all those businesses, where a missed call meant a missed customer. I knew there was demand, I knew nobody was serving them, and I knew I wanted to be the one to build it.\n\nLeaving wasn't easy. Meta was comfortable, offering an incredible salary, stock refreshers, and interesting problems. Everyone told me to stay another year, vest more equity, and build more credentials. The rational move was to wait.\n\nI kept asking myself, if I waited, would I regret it? The window felt finite. Every month I stayed was a month these businesses were not being served.\n\nI raised capital, moved to NYC from California, and began building Frontdesk. I'm now the founder and CEO.\n\nFrontdesk is a comprehensive AI operating system that engages with customers across all channels and performs real-world tasks, such as scheduling and follow-ups.\n\nWe work in-person in an office in SoHo. Most people in our office share a similar story to mine; they left Microsoft, Amazon, or Meta, walking away from good salaries and stock options, because they believed this was worth building.\n\nI feel lucky to work with people who push me to be better every day.\n\nMost nights, my work looks the same as it did in middle school. I pace, talk into a phone, and listen for what feels off. The difference is that now, when it works, it works across millions of calls. It's the same instinct that led me to build Rescuer years ago.\n\nThe phones are still ringing, and the models are still getting better. I know where I want to be while that happens: close to the code and building something worth leaving comfort behind.\n\nDid you quit a Big Tech job to build your own company?

    "description": "Molly Graham, former Facebook and Google executive, shares how a risky career move and embracing a J-shaped career path grew her expertise.",
    "fullText": "At 25 years old, Molly Graham was thriving in Facebook's HR department when a senior executive urged her to transfer out of her stable role and help build a mobile phone instead.\n\nShe took the risk — and it could have derailed her career.\n\nBut Graham, who later became a C-suite executive at some of America's biggest companies and philanthropies, now views that risky bet as one of the most important moves she ever made.\n\n\"It just felt like falling off a cliff,\" Graham, now the founder of Glue Club, said in a recent interview on Lenny Rachitsky's podcast. \"Taking risks, accepting the terrible fall and that experience of falling has been more than worth it.\"\n\nGraham described the experience as part of what she calls the \"J-curve\" — a career trajectory where a risky move leads to an initial drop before eventually producing outsized gains. Visually, she describes it as standing on a ledge, stepping off, sinking briefly, and then rising far higher than where you started — just like the shape of the letter J.\n\nThe concept, which she has also written about in her Lessons Substack, challenges the idea of a steady career ladder that steadily moves up and to the right.\n\nInstead of climbing rung by rung with promotions every two to five years, Graham argues that some of the most valuable professional growth comes from jumping into roles you aren't ready for and surviving any setbacks.\n\nGraham's own J-curve began when billionaire investor and \"All-in\" podcast host Chamath Palihapitiya, then Facebook's vice president of growth, recruited her to help develop a smartphone, encouraging her to make the move by sketching out the J-shaped trajectory on a whiteboard.\n\nHe brought her on despite her having no experience in product development, dropping her into rooms filled with engineers and phone specialists with deep subject matter expertise. She recalled feeling like an \"idiot\" for much of her first six months.\n\nAt her midyear review, Palihapitiya delivered what Graham called the worst performance evaluation she had ever received. But the new experience eventually expanded her expertise.\n\n\"Slowly, I remember I had been doing all these trips to Taiwan because we were actually working on hardware and I, at some point, came back from Taiwan and I like drew on a whiteboard for him the layout of a mobile phone, trying to explain to him kind of like why something he wanted to do was not possible,\" Graham said. \"And I so vividly remember walking out of that meeting being like, 'Oh like I actually know things.' And slowly then over the following three years I became an expert in mobile.\"\n\nPalihapitiya did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\n\"The phone itself was a giant failure — a massive, costly failure for Facebook,\" Graham told Rachitsky on the podcast. \"But it was not a failure for me.\"\n\nShe credits the experience with teaching her that she could operate far outside her comfort zone — a lesson that later helped her take on senior leadership roles, including serving as COO of Quip, which Salesforce acquired for $750 million, and overseeing operations at the $7.4 billion Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\n\nThe J-curve, Graham said, is especially common at fast-moving companies like Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, and SpaceX, where leaders value employees who are willing to take big risks early and learn quickly. In those environments, proving adaptability can matter more than checking every qualification box.\n\nNot everyone supported Graham's decision at the time. She said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, then the number two at the tech giant, advised against the move — as did her father.\n\n\"When wiser, more experienced people questioned the job offer, it definitely made me pause,\" Graham told Business Insider in a follow-up email. \"But my gut felt really strongly that I needed to take the risk.\"\n\nThat instinct, she said, ultimately helped her discover what kind of work she didn't want to do, and where her strengths lay. She didn't want to sift through mock ups of hardware design and argue about a button's placement. Instead, she sharpened her management skills and prepared to help lead large organizations.\n\n\"The much more fun careers are like jumping off cliffs,\" Graham told Rachitsky. \"They can take you to places that you never could have imagined.\"",

Mahoney, a former senior Microsoft legal executive and onetime Trump administration official, as its next chief legal officer, Axios reported.\n\nMahoney will replace Jennifer Newstead, who announced in December that she would leave Meta after more than five years to become Apple's general counsel. Mahoney is set to start on Wednesday and will report directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the Axios report said.\n\n\"I'm excited to join Meta as it leads the way in AI innovation and continues to connect people around the world,\" Mahoney said in a statement that Meta shared with Business Insider. \"As I close an incredible chapter at Microsoft and begin a new one at Meta, I'm grateful for the trust Mark and the Board have placed in me.\"\n\n\"C.J. brings world-class legal expertise, passion for frontier technology, and deep insight into the global regulatory challenges facing our industry,\" said Zuckerberg in a statement shared with Business Insider. \"I'm looking forward to working with him to advance Meta's mission to build the future of human connection.\"\n\nMahoney previously served as Microsoft's corporate vice president and deputy general counsel and earlier worked as deputy US trade representative during President Donald Trump's first term.\n\nIn his new role, he will oversee Meta's global legal strategy as the company continues to face scrutiny over antitrust, data privacy, online safety, and the protection of children and teenagers.\n\nNewstead's departure marked the end of a consequential period for Meta's legal team. During her tenure, the company secured a major win against the Federal Trade Commission when a federal judge rejected the agency's attempt to force Meta to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nMahoney's appointment comes as Meta continues to navigate intensifying regulatory pressure worldwide, including debates over artificial intelligence, social media governance, and data protection.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Yasmin Santos left Meta to start Altar Native, an herbal alcohol alternative. Her products are taking off among sober-curious and stressed execs.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yasmin Santos, a former Meta ad specialist and the founder of the herbal alcohol alternative brand Altar Native. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I stopped drinking in 2018, it was for my health, not my career. It turned out to be great for both.\n\nI gave up alcohol to heal a gut issue, thinking it would just be temporary. But when I was finally healthy enough to drink again, I realized something had shifted. My body no longer wanted it. The buzz wasn't fun; it just felt wrong.\n\nStill, I missed the ritual. I missed the ease alcohol could bring in social settings. At the same time, I was caring for my mother, who was bedridden with early-onset dementia. I could see how much pain she was in, and how the pharmaceuticals she relied on often did more harm than good. I prayed for another way and felt a clear answer: \"The plants are there for you.\"\n\nThat's when I discovered herbalism — and the vast world of plants that humans have used for thousands of years to support their well-being. I learned about kava, CBD, kratom, and damiana — each with different properties that our ancestors used to calm, energize, or restore balance. It was like opening a door into a forgotten world of natural solutions.\n\nI'd bring little dropper bottles to social gatherings, letting friends try my blends. The response was overwhelming. People wanted to know where they could buy them. That was in 2021, and the spark became my company, Altar Native.\n\nThrough 2022, I refined the branding and recipes, and by January 2024, we were officially launched. I started small, still freelancing in marketing to fund the business, and using an $11,000 inheritance from my mom as seed money.\n\nBefore I started selling the tinctures themselves, I'd tested the idea with a \"cater bar\" — a mobile alcohol-free bar I could take to festivals and private events. It helped me prove the concept and reach my first customers. Between the events and tincture sales, I've had a 115% growth rate in the year since, and I'm projecting that I'll reach months with six-figure sales in the next few years.\n\nWhat has surprised me most is our customer base. I thought my audience would be \"wellness girlies\" who are into yoga and Pilates. But our biggest fans turned out to be van lifers, surfers, climbers, and outdoor adventurers; the sort of people who want to connect deeply to nature and stay clear-headed doing it.\n\nOur second demographic emerged unexpectedly: professional men, aged 40 to 55, often high-level business professionals. They order our \"Adapt\" blend, which helps regulate cortisol and balance energy.\n\nThey don't want alcohol, but they still want something to take the edge off — and since I come from the same corporate background, I get it, and I know exactly how to create what they're looking for.\n\nWe're riding a wave. Since the pandemic, people have woken up to the reality that how they care for their bodies defines their quality of life. They're drinking less, questioning what they put in their systems, and searching for alternatives that help them feel good without dulling their senses.\n\nThat's where I see Altar Native: at the intersection of wellness and ritual, bridging ancient plant wisdom with modern life. I call it \"herbal mixology\": the art of crafting functional, plant-based blends that elevate your mood and state of mind, without the use of alcohol.\n\nOur tinctures can be mixed into mocktails, added to tea or sparkling water, or taken straight on the tongue. My personal routine includes our \"Ecstatic\" blend in the morning with cacao instead of coffee to keep me focused without the afternoon crash. I take \"Adapt\" throughout the day when I need balance, and \"Lucid\" at night to calm my nerves and stave off anxiety.\n\nI haven't taken on investors yet. I've bootstrapped everything — through Meta income, freelancing, and careful reinvestment. My goal is to scale sustainably, eventually moving into ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages while staying true to our values of intentionality and environmental stewardship.\n\nMy co-manufacturer in Pennsylvania handles extraction, bottling, labeling, and fulfillment — allowing me to focus on building the brand.\n\nI'd love to grow Altar Native into a major player in this space, and maybe even exit one day, if it means partnering with a company that shares our vision for conscious, plant-based living.\n\nI was in a sorority in college, and each graduating senior was given a paper plate superlative award based on their personality and habits. Mine was \"Most likely to sell a million-dollar business to 'Shark Tank.'\" We'll see!\n\nBut for now, I'm focused on being a steward of this idea: helping it grow, and helping others find natural ways to reconnect with themselves.\n\nBecause for me, this isn't just about business. It's about remembering what the earth has always offered us — and choosing to listen.",

    "description": "Tired of Instagram and TikTok? My favorite alternatives include photo-sharing app Retro and social music platform Airbuds.",
    "fullText": "Dating apps, AI social networks, drama-clad \"tea\" apps — you name it, I've downloaded it.\n\nIn 2025, I tested out dozens of apps on my phone while reporting on social media for Business Insider.\n\nLike many other internet dwellers, a majority of my time was spent on apps like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.\n\nWhile some of the biggest splashes on the app charts were AI apps like OpenAI's Sora or Meta's stand-alone AI app — and I tested out both — these felt more like blips in the fast-churning digital trend cycle.\n\nInstead, I found myself frequently opening a small handful of apps that feel like an escape from the social media feeds of endless content and AI slop.\n\nHere are the apps I'm using, revisiting, and keeping an eye on as 2026 begins.\n\nMy go-to social media platform may not be on your radar, but it should be.\n\nRetro, a photo-sharing app that's focused on smaller-scale sharing for friends and family, remains one of my most-used apps since I first downloaded it in 2023. Founded by former Instagram employees, the app is where I now post my photo dumps to a small circle of about 15 friends. It recently launched a feature that lets you rewind through your old photos every week, making a supercut of memories.\n\nTwo other alternative social media apps I've been returning to are PI.FYI and Airbuds. PI.FYI, a social network from the popular culture newsletter Perfectly Imperfect, has become a tool for me to find new music, movies, and recommendations for just about anything. Meanwhile, Airbuds, a social app that shows you what music your friends are listening to, is where I turn when I'm on the hunt for new things to listen to.\n\nIf I'm making plans with friends, I'm opening Corner. The social map app has been around for a few years now, but relaunched this year with new AI-powered search tools designed with Gen Z in mind to help find nearby restaurants, bars, or shops.\n\nOne legacy social media platform that returned to my thumb-clicking rotation is Pinterest. The mood-boarding platform has undergone many changes since its new CEO, Bill Ready, took over in 2022. Search and shopping features now dominate the app, which, for me, is exactly what I come there for. I'm opening Pinterest when I am brainstorming what to wear or how to decorate a room in my apartment. Often, I'm saving things that I may want to buy later on.\n\nPinterest isn't entirely an escape from AI, however. A lot of its tools use AI, and the platform has rolled out features that attempt to give users more control over how much AI-generated content they see on the app.\n\nDanger Testing, a project by Carlos Mayers and Marc Mueller, has minted a handful of apps in the last year and describes itself as \"dropping apps like songs.\"\n\nOne app was essentially a virtual Labubu, while another let you digitally vandalize a Friend AI poster. A recent release, called \"My Brainrot,\" turns any video on your phone into a TikTok-style meme with an automated caption.\n\nIn the era of vibe coding, the apps coming from Danger Testing remind me of the silliness of early mobile apps, like the good old iBeer — just made more swiftly and with a pinch of irony for the chronically online.\n\nThere are a lot of apps I'll be trying out this year, and I'm sure a bunch of those will be even more dating apps touting AI as the solution for finding love. Otherwise, I'm still on the hunt for the next social network that'll stick, tools that help people get offline and into the real world, or creative ways to use AI.",

    "fullText": "AI pioneer Yann LeCun isn't sold on Mark Zuckerberg's $14 billion bet on Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old Scale AI cofounder recruited to lead Meta's Superintelligence Labs.\n\nIn a new interview with the Financial Times, LeCun, who was Meta's chief AI scientist before announcing in November that he was leaving to form his own startup, said Wang was \"inexperienced\" and didn't fully understand AI researchers.\n\n\"He learns fast, he knows what he doesn't know . . . There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher,\" LeCun said.\n\nWang was the crown jewel of Zuckerberg's aggressive moves in the AI talent war. Meta made a $14 billion investment in Scale AI, which included hiring Wang from the buzzy startup.\n\nLeCun said that Zuckerberg grew frustrated after disappointing progress on Llama, the company's flagship, open-sourced AI model.\n\nIn the interview, LeCun said that the AI team \"fudged\" some of the results of Llama 4. At the time, Meta was criticized for potentially gaming the results of benchmark tests. LeCun said the episode soured Zuckerberg on Meta's existing AI team.\n\n\"Mark was really upset and basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved in this,\" he told FT. \"And so basically sidelined the entire GenAI organisation.\"\n\nAs for his relationship with Wang, LeCun said that even though the 28-year-old was briefly his boss after Zuckerberg's AI reorg, he wasn't really directing him.\n\n\"You don't tell a researcher what to do,\" LeCun told the publication. \"You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do.\"\n\nLeCun said Zuckerberg remained supportive of his views on the future of AI, but that the Meta CEO's larger hires are focused on large language model development.\n\n\"I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence,\" LeCun said. \"But I'm not gonna change my mind because some dude thinks I'm wrong. I'm not wrong. My integrity as a scientist cannot allow me to do this.\"\n\nLeCun has repeatedly argued that LLMs are too limited and that to unlock the true power of AI, a different approach is needed. It's why his startup is reportedly called Advanced Machine Intelligence, the very approach he has argued is better suited than LLMs.\n\nHe will serve as executive chair, not as CEO, of the new company.\n\n\"I'm a scientist, a visionary. I can inspire people to work on interesting things. I'm pretty good at guessing what type of technology will work or not. But I can't be a CEO,\" LeCun said. \"I'm both too disorganised for this, and also too old!\"",

    "fullText": "Instagram's top executive thinks AI has made the social media site's carefully curated grid a thing of the past.\n\nIn an end-of-year message posted on Threads, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that the platform would have to evolve to cope with a coming flood of AI-generated content — and warned that the rise of AI had killed off Instagram's polished aesthetic.\n\n\"Unless you're under 25 and use Instagram, you probably think of the app as a feed of square photos. The aesthetic is polished: lots of make up, skin smoothing, high contrast photography, beautiful landscapes,\" wrote Mosseri on Wednesday.\n\n\"That feed is dead. People largely stopped sharing personal moments to feed years ago,\" the Meta executive said, adding that users now kept friends updated on their personal lives through unpolished \"shoe shots and unflattering candids\" shared via direct messages.\n\nMosseri said the growing ubiquity of AI images meant creators would have to embrace this trend, and shy away from curated grids and professional-style photography in favor of a \"more raw aesthetic.\"\n\n\"Flattering imagery is cheap to produce and boring to consume. People want content that feels real,\" he wrote, adding that social media feeds are starting to fill up with \"synthetic everything.\"\n\nSocial media platforms like Instagram are grappling with a flood of AI-generated content, with tools like Midjourney and Sora making it easy to produce images and videos of almost anything.\n\nAt the same time, Meta has raced to integrate AI tools into Instagram and Facebook. Instagram rolled out an AI studio last year that lets users create custom chatbots, including digital versions of themselves, and has previously experimented with AI Instagram influencers based on real celebrities.\n\nMosseri said social platforms will get worse at identifying AI-generated media over time as the technology improves, adding that one solution could be for camera companies to cryptographically sign photos when they are taken to prove they are real.\n\nThe former Facebook executive said Instagram needed to label AI-generated content clearly, provide more transparency about who is posting on the platform, and build better creative controls so human users could compete with content made entirely by AI.\n\n\"For most of my life I could safely assume that the vast majority of photographs or videos that I see are largely accurate captures of moments that happened in real life. This is clearly no longer the case,\" Mosseri wrote.",

    "description": "Adam Mosseri offered a notably candid assessment on how AI is upending Instagram.",
    "fullText": "It's no secret that AI-generated content took over our social media feeds in 2025. Now, Instagram's top exec Adam Mosseri has made it clear that he expects AI content to overtake non-AI imagery and the significant implications that shift has for its creators and photographers.\n\nMosseri shared the thoughts in a lengthy post about the broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. And he offered a notably candid assessment on how AI is upending the platform. \"Everything that made creators matter—the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked—is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,\" he wrote. \"The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.\"\n\nBut Mosseri doesn't seem particularly concerned by this shift. He says that there is \"a lot of amazing AI content\" and that the platform may need to rethink its approach to labeling such imagery by \"fingerprinting real media, not just chasing fake.\"\n\nSocial media platforms are going to come under increasing pressure to identify and label AI-generated content as such. All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality. There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media. Camera manufacturers could cryptographically sign images at capture, creating a chain of custody.\n\nOn some level, it's easy to understand how this seems like a more practical approach for Meta. As we've previously reported, technologies that are meant to identify AI content, like watermarks, have proved unreliable at best. They are easy to remove and even easier to ignore altogether. Meta's own labels are far from clear and the company, which has spent tens of billions of dollars on AI this year alone, has admitted it can't reliably detect AI-generated or manipulated content on its platform.\n\nThat Mosseri is so readily admitting defeat on this issue, though, is telling. AI slop has won. And when it comes to helping Instagram's 3 billion users understand what is real, that should largely be someone else's problem, not Meta's. Camera makers — presumably phone makers and actual camera manufacturers — should come up with their own system that sure sounds a lot like watermarking to \"to verify authenticity at capture.\" Mosseri offers few details about how this would work or be implemented at the scale required to make it feasible.\n\nMosseri also doesn't really address the fact that this is likely to alienate the many photographers and other Instagram creators who have already grown frustrated with the app. The exec regularly fields complaints from the group who want to know why Instagram's algorithm doesn't consistently surface their posts to their on followers.\n\nBut Mosseri suggests those complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of \"polished\" square images, he says, \"is dead.\" Camera companies, in his estimation, are \"are betting on the wrong aesthetic\" by trying to \"make everyone look like a professional photographer from the past.\" Instead, he says that more \"raw\" and \"unflattering\" images will be how creators can prove they are real, and not AI. In a world where Instagram has more AI content than not, creators should prioritize images and videos that intentionally make them look bad.",

    "description": "Mark Zuckerberg famously dropped out of college to focus on Facebook. The cofounder of Manus says he took the same path — and now they have merged.",
    "fullText": "Meta was cofounded by a college dropout — and so was its latest acquisition.\n\nJi Yichao, the cofounder and chief scientist of Manus, the AI startup snapped up by Meta, shared two pictures on X: one of his younger self behind a laptop, and another of a young Mark Zuckerberg, seemingly in the same room, also working at a laptop.\n\nBoth pictures appear to have been taken at the so-called \"Facebook House\" in Palo Alto, California, a five-bed home where Zuckerberg worked on Facebook after famously dropping out of Harvard University in 2004. The house was later rented by budding entrepreneurs and business students.\n\n\"21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge,\" Ji wrote in the Monday X post.\n\nThe 32-year-old Ji was the public face of Manus for its launch in March, introducing its \"general-purpose\" AI agent designed to carry out tasks autonomously. Meta announced its acquisition of Manus on Monday, which the Wall Street Journal reported exceeded $2 billion.\n\nAccording to reports in Chinese media, Ji started a computer science degree at the Beijing Information Science and Technology University (BISTU) in 2010, but later dropped out to focus on entrepreneurship. He returned to BISTU in 2015 and graduated in 2018, according to a blog from the university. Manus did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.\n\nZuckerberg and Ji have plenty of company. Meta's other big AI acquisition this year, Scale AI, was founded by another college dropout — Alexandr Wang. Microsoft cofounders Bill Gates and Paul Allen dropped out of college, along with Apple CEO Steve Jobs, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and many more.\n\n21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge. https://t.co/NpnNkqhuso pic.twitter.com/s6v7kDsq1y\n\nJi's post comes as college degrees are under renewed scrutiny. Gen Z in particular has been questioning whether a degree is worth the debt, while others are wondering if college can future-proof their career prospects in a job market being shaken up by AI.\n\nFei-Fei Li, a Stanford professor known as the \"Godmother of AI,\" said earlier this month that a college degree matters less now when her company hires software engineers.\n\nHowever, data published by the New York Federal Reserve in April suggested that a college degree can still pay off in the long run — provided students pick the right degree.\n\nManus was launched in March by the Chinese AI product studio Butterfly Effect. The startup relocated to Singapore in mid-2025 and said it has surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue. Meta said it would continue to offer Manus' subscription as a separate business while integrating the startup's technology into its own platforms.",

    "description": "Alexandr Wang says Neuralink and other brain-computer interfaces will help kids learn in \"crazy ways.\"",
    "fullText": "It's no surprise that wunderkinds want their children to be wunderkinds, too.\n\nAsAlexandr Wang, the 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, takes on a new role at Meta leading its superintelligence initiatives, he's also thinking about how to integrate superintelligence into the next generation.\n\nAnd that means he's not having kids anytime soon.\n\nOn the Shawn Ryan Show on Thursday, Wang said he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink or other brain-computer interfaces are available.\n\nNeuralink, one of Elon Musk's most futuristic endeavors, is developing coin-sized microchips that can be embedded into human brains. These chips will not only be able to record brain activity, but also stimulate it.\n\nStill in clinical trials, Neuralink has so far been embedded in seven patients. One of those patients, Brad Smith, who has ALS, said he was able to edit a video using his Neuralink brain chip.\n\nWhile Neuralink has received a ton of buzz, it's not the only one developing these interfaces. Synchron, backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, is already working with Apple to help those with disabilities, like ALS patients, use their iPhones. Motif Neurotech is developing a neurostimulator system that works like a pacemaker for the brain and is now used for treating severe depression.\n\nWang also believes these devices will have profound implications for child development. \"In your first like seven years of life, your brain is more neuroplastic than at any other point in your life,\" he said. \"When we get Neuralink and we get these other technologies, kids who are born with them are gonna learn how to use them in like crazy, crazy ways.\"\n\nNeuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt and change — whether that means rewiring its structure, shifting how it functions, or forming new connections — in response to things happening inside us or around us.\n\nIt's often enhanced in children because the \"organization of networks of neuronal synapses as well as white matter pathways remain 'under construction' well into adolescence and even later,\" according to a 2009 article published in the peer-reviewed journal Brain and Development. This is why children are also able to learn new skills quickly and recover from injuries faster.\n\nHowever, machines aren't the \"obvious answer\" to enhancing neuroplasticity, Dr. Matthew MacDougall, the head surgeon at Neuralink, told neuroscientist Andrew Huberman on his podcast in April. Even with implanted electrodes and computers, \"It's hard to know which area of the brain would be most potent as a stimulation target for an electrode to broadly juice plasticity,\" he said. Pharmacologic agents, including drugs like LSD and Psilocybin, which can impact the whole brain, are the most promising area of plasticity research, he added.\n\n\"I think with plasticity, you're talking, in general, you're talking about the entire brain. You're talking about altering a trillion synapses all in a similar way,\" he said. \"You're never going to get that broad targetability with any electrodes that I can see coming in our lifetimes.\"",

    "fullText": "Apple is soft-launching big plans for its fitness platform in 2026.\n\nOn Wednesday, the tech giant teased an update to its Apple Fitness+ service on Instagram coming in the new year. The changes could arrive as soon as January, according to the video.\n\n\"Word on the street is that Apple Fitness+ has big plans for 2026... stay tuned!\" the caption reads.\n\nA post shared by Apple Fitness+ (@applefitnessplus)\n\nThe ad featured Apple Fitness+ trainers Bakari Williams, Molly Fox, and Dice Iida-Klein holding newspapers with headlines that suggested major changes. Although Apple didn't share details of what's to come in 2026, some commenters shared what they want to see and speculated on what could be coming.\n\nSome Instagram users commented asking Apple to make small updates, such as reducing the music in workout videos or adding the ability to skip back and forth between workouts. Others asked for more programs to choose from.\n\nApple Fitness+ is a subscription-based digital fitness platform that includes instructor-led classes, on-demand workout videos, and health and fitness metrics. It competes with similar offerings from companies like Peloton. Apple Fitness+ launched in 2020, and Apple expanded it into 28 new markets in December. It costs $9.99 a month or $79.99 annually in the US.\n\nAlthough Apple doesn't report how many users pay for Apple Fitness+, its Services division, which includes those subscribers, hit an all-time high in revenue during its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nApple has also teased other major product reveals coming in 2026, including an upgrade to its virtual assistant Siri.\n\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Meta is buying Manus for over $2 billion. Here's what the AI agent does, who built it, and why the deal matters.",
    "fullText": "Manus is back in the spotlight.\n\nThe Chinese-founded artificial intelligence startup is being acquired by Meta in a deal reported to be worth more than $2 billion — one of the most high-profile instances of a US tech giant buying an Asian AI company.\n\nManus grabbed headlines in March when it unveiled an AI agent designed to autonomously execute tasks like résumé screening and stock analysis.\n\nThe startup was founded in China and moved its headquarters to Singapore in mid-2025.\n\nLaunched in March by the Chinese AI product studio Butterfly Effect, Manus has been pitched by its creators as the world's first \"general\" AI agent — a system designed to carry out tasks independently.\n\nSince its launch, the startup has continued to expand what the agent can do, rolling out features that allow users to use Manus for design work, slide creation, and completing tasks directly through a web browser.\n\nManus can independently execute complex tasks, such as market research, coding, and data analysis, Meta said when it announced the acquisition on Monday.\n\nBusiness Insider tested the tool in its early stages in March and found it ambitious but uneven in execution, including instances where it hallucinated data.\n\nEarlier this month, Manus said it had surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, with its total revenue run rate — including usage-based fees and other income streams — exceeding $125 million.\n\nThe company in April raised $75 million in funding led by Benchmark, at a valuation of about $500 million, Bloomberg reported. Manus said in an update this month that it now employs about 105 people across Singapore, Tokyo, and San Francisco, and plans to open a Paris office soon.\n\nManus was founded by Xiao Hong, a Chinese entrepreneur and software engineer who is also the CEO of Butterfly Effect.\n\nKnown as \"Red\" in China's tech circles, Xiao was born in 1992 and studied software engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in central China.\n\nAfter graduating, Xiao founded Nightingale Technology in 2015, where he developed enterprise productivity tools, including the Yi Ban assistant for WeChat, which gained millions of users in China.\n\nIn 2022, he launched Butterfly Effect and rolled out Monica, an AI-powered browser extension that aggregates multiple large language models. Following the acquisition, Xiao will take on a vice president role at Meta.\n\nXiao was joined at Manus by co-founder Ji Yichao, also known as \"Peak Ji,\" who was chief scientist at Butterfly Effect. Ji leads technical and infrastructure development at Manus.\n\nThe 32-year-old Ji was the public face of Manus at launch, introducing the AI agent in its debut video in March. Ji has a long track record of building consumer technology products, and was named to MIT Technology Review's Innovators Under 35 list this year.\n\nThe founding team also includes Zhang Tao, who leads product at Manus. He was head of global product at ByteDance from 2022 to 2023 and has held multiple product roles, including serving as a product manager at Tencent, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nMeta said the acquisition is part of its effort to scale general-purpose AI agents across its apps and services.\n\nThe company said in its announcement on Monday that it plans to keep Manus running as a stand-alone product while integrating its technology into Meta's wider AI offerings.\n\nManus said the deal would not be disruptive for its customers and that it would continue to sell and operate its subscription service. The company will also continue to operate from Singapore.\n\n\"Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,\" said Xiao.\n\nBuying Manus could give Meta an AI revenue boost and give it a distribution advantage, Business Insider's Hugh Langley wrote.\n\nManus's links to China have drawn scrutiny.\n\nIn May, Sen. John Cornyn questioned US investment in Manus in a post on X. He asked whether American capital should back AI companies with ties to China as competition with Beijing intensifies.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider on Tuesday, a Meta spokesperson said the deal would fully sever Manus's remaining ties to China.\n\n\"There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,\" the spokesperson told Business Insider. This includes shutting down the AI assistant, Monica, and relocating relevant employees.\n\nManus employees who join Meta will not have access to customer data, and Meta will continue to geo-block access to its AI models, the spokesperson added.",

    "description": "Meta is seen as lagging  behind OpenAI and Google in the AI race. Its acquisition of Singapore-based AI startup Manus could help with that.",
    "fullText": "AI dealmaking isn't slowing down — and it's Meta's turn again.\n\nThe social media giant is buying Manus, a Singapore-based artificial intelligence startup, the companies announced on Monday.\n\nManus went viral in March when it previewed an AI agent that could autonomously perform tasks like screening résumés and stock analysis. Manus was created in China but relocated to Singapore in mid-2025. Meta paid more than $2 billion for Manus, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe deal is the latest in a flurry of red-hot AI investment and acquisitions this year, which includes Meta's $14 billion investment in Scale AI in June. From providing an instant AI revenue source to giving it a leg up in AI agents, here's why buying Manus could give Meta a much-needed boost in the AI race.\n\nManus said in December that it had processed more than 147 trillion tokens of text and said its users were in the \"millions.\" It also claimed to have crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, achieving both milestones eight months after launch.\n\nThose numbers tell us Meta is getting a startup with a built-in audience of paying users. Meta's business model to date has largely revolved around building free products and making money from collecting user data and targeted advertising. Manus offers a free tier for basic tasks, but charges users up to $200 a month for its pro tier.\n\n\"The purchase gives Meta a functioning business with paying customers, meaningful revenue and infrastructure already proven at scale,\" said Murthy Grandhi, company profiles analyst at research firm GlobalData, in a note.\n\nIn its announcement, Meta said it plans to continue selling the Manus service separately while also integrating Manus's technology into its existing platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta did not elaborate on which ones or how it might do so. Meta has poured billions into building up its internal AI teams and developing what is termed \"superintelligence,\" with so far little in terms of returns. Manus could be a way for Meta to start making money directly from AI while it continues to build out its internal efforts.\n\nMeta has struggled to wow consumers and developers as much as OpenAI and Google when it comes to raw model power. However, as these models become increasingly commoditized, there is a growing need to show AI can actually be useful. One such way is AI agents, a type of software that can proactively make decisions and take actions, such as creating a marketing campaign or monitoring and fixing bugs in apps.\n\nBuying Manus could prove a smart bet on the idea that the real value will lie in the programs that sit on top of the models. Manus primarily uses other companies' AI models, like Anthropic's Claude, as building blocks and layers its own software on top.\n\n\"People keep assuming a small update from OpenAI or Google will wipe out a lot of AI startups,\" wrote Yuchen Jin, CEO of the AI startup Hyperbolic, in an X post about Meta's Manus deal. \"But in reality, the AI application layer should be where most of the opportunity is.\"\n\nA Meta spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about which models Manus would support following the acquisition.\n\nOne of Meta's strengths is that its platforms are used by billions of people, which, like Google, gives it a distribution advantage. Its challenge is to find ways to keep them coming back.\n\nUnlike Google with Gemini 3, Meta has yet to have a buzzy AI breakthrough moment with its own in-house models. Combining Manus's \"general-purpose agents\" with Meta's distribution channels gives the social media company another shot at that, particularly as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged that Facebook has shifted from being a place for friends to view each other's content to a \"broad discovery and entertainment space.\"\n\n\"Manus offers a ready-made, high-margin software layer that can be sold directly and integrated across Meta's consumer and enterprise products,\" said GlobalData's Grandhi.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: CST highlights volume of IS-supporting accounts and says social media firms ‘putting all of us in danger’\n\nFacebook hosted terrorist propaganda that celebrated the murder of Jews and praised Islamic State, a leading anti-hate group has alleged.\n\nThe posts included celebrations of the Bondi beach massacre that the Community Security Trust says Facebook has been too slow to take down. The posts were still on Facebook on 16 December, two days after the attack, and received shares and likes.\n\nSome accounts are Britain-based and those have been reported to counter-terrorism police in the UK as a matter of urgency.\n\nOne post shows video of the aftermath of the Bondi beach attack, which was allegedly carried out by a father and son who were IS supporters, and says: “Allah is the greatest and praise to Allah.” It has clearly been viewed, with more than 100 likes, 27 comments and four shares recorded.\n\nFifteen people were killed as they celebrated the Jewish festival of Hanukah in Sydney on 14 December. One of the attackers also died.\n\nAnother post shows a photo of one of the Bondi beach gunmen and says: “The coming years of art and hell,” and contains praise for an IS leader. This had 12 shares and more than 300 likes.\n\nFacebook said it was in the process of removing some of the posts after being contacted by the Guardian, and said some had already been spotted and removed.\n\nDave Rich, the director of policy for the CST, which works to keep Jewish people safe from attack, said: “The sheer volume of IS-supporting accounts promoting terrorist content on Facebook is deeply alarming, and the posts celebrating the Bondi terrorist attack are utterly nauseating.\n\n“Yet again, social media companies are incapable of meeting even their most basic of responsibilities and are putting all of us in danger as a result. This simply should not be happening any more. We will be calling on Ofcom to urgently investigate Meta’s failings and to take strong action where possible.”\n\nOfcom, the media regulator, said: “If a post is reported to a platform now, the platform must decide whether the content is illegal under UK law, and take it down swiftly if it is. Our job is to make sure sites and apps have appropriate measures in place to comply with their duties.”\n\nIt said it had received “evidence that suggests terrorist content and illegal hate speech is persisting on some of the largest social media sites”.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook, declined to answer a series of questions but said: “The content was removed for violating our policies around dangerous organisations and individuals.”\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: “Social media content promoting terrorism or violence against communities is absolutely unacceptable, and will not be tolerated. The law is clear: social media platforms must take action to prevent illegal content on their sites, including terrorist and violent material.”\n\nThe focus on pro-IS material on popular social media sites comes amid concern about an increase in terrorist efforts to target Jewish people across the west.\n\nTwo men were convicted on 22 December of a plot to get machine guns and shoot Jewish people around the north-west of England. In that plot and the Sydney massacre, both sets of terrorists’ approaches had a degree of sophistication.\n\nThough neither was “directed” by IS, the Sydney attackers visited the Philippines and the north-west England machine-gun plotters had contact with an IS person overseas and were sophisticated enough to try to bypass Jewish community security and infiltrate a Facebook group, giving them details of potential Jewish targets.\n\nRich said of the English plot: “This is an even more serious plot than the attack on the synagogue in Heaton Park and indicates a much greater level of training and sophistication.”\n\nVicki Evans, the senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, told the Guardian: “The terrorist threats we face do not stand still and we rarely confine them to history. Instead, they flex in intensity and risk over time – and so does our response.\n\n“Recent attacks in Manchester and Australia are clear reminders of the range of threats we face, and we continue to ask the public to … report any concerns they see in their real-world or online communities.”",

The pair, who post about their glamorous lives and occasionally offer a wry take on influencing, wondered what their move would mean for their careers. They were pleasantly surprised.\n\n\"Miami was a completely different city,\" Vale said. \"The amount of events in Miami, the amount of people that are there, brands that are present, it's almost as much as LA.\"\n\n\"Many of us know each other, so if you go to events that Gucci is throwing at the Design District, you're more than likely going to bump into five to 20 familiar faces,\" Sebastian said of the upscale fashion and design neighborhood.\n\nThe Gentas aren't alone. New research shared exclusively with Business Insider by Patrick Adler, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, reveals that Miami consistently ranks as the No. 3 metro area in the US by top Instagram creator count, after LA and New York City.\n\nMiami boasts over 6,000 top Instagram influencers. LA has roughly 12,000, and NYC nearly 11,000. (Seattle was next, with about 4,000.)\n\nAdler, who has also conducted research on the closely watched Otis Report on the Creative Economy, ranked metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by creators in the top 10% in terms of Instagram followers, using data from an influencer marketing firm. Adler said that other platforms, such as YouTube and TikTok, showed similar trends.\n\nMiami still has a ways to go in absolute numbers to catch up with LA and NYC, long known as the centers of US media and entertainment, but it's punching way above its weight. It's only the sixth-largest market by population and the seventh-largest traditional entertainment market.\n\nLooking at the data another way, Miami actually has more top influencers per capita than LA.\n\nOther markets that regularly came up in the top 10 by this measurement are creative hot spots like Las Vegas, Atlanta, Houston, and Nashville.\n\nVictoria Bachan, an SVP at Wasserman Creators, said that for the new guard of independent creators, being in LA or NYC matters less.\n\n\"Take the biggest YouTuber in the world, MrBeast — he's in Greenville, NC,\" she said.\n\nMiami experienced a relocation boom during the COVID-19 pandemic as people, creators included, flocked to South Florida for its warm weather and lack of state or local income taxes. Creators found a growing number of events like Formula 1's Miami Grand Prix, which debuted in Miami in 2022, as well as the Miami Open tennis tournament and Art Basel Miami Beach, which offer places for them to be seen. Brands like Geico and Vuori also seek out personalities there when they want to tap into the Miami lifestyle and Latino culture.\n\nTop Miami influencers include breakout TikTok star Alix Earle, who gained social media fame while attending the University of Miami, and Xandra Pohl, a DJ and model. The scene features prominent food influencers like Samantha Schnur, known as The Naughty Fork, and Nico Norena.\n\nCities like Miami have also offered a haven for Angelenos struggling with the high cost of living in LA and early 2025 wildfires, Wasserman Creators' Bachan said.\n\n\"They're crunching the numbers, and a lot of them did pick up and move to Atlanta and Vegas and Miami,\" she said.\n\nBecca Bahrke, CEO of Illuminate Social, a creator management firm with about 85 clients, estimated that before 2020, 80% of her clients were in LA and NYC. Since then, the ratio has flipped, and her clients are now sprinkled all around the US, from Hawaii to South Carolina.\n\n\"We saw a mass exodus,\" she said.\n\nLA is still the entertainment capital in terms of population. But this new data adds to the narrative of a traditional entertainment industry in decline.\n\nLA has lost ground in traditional film and TV, with the rise of lower-cost film hubs elsewhere. A growing number of A-listers have decamped for other cities.\n\nStill, there are limitations to living in secondary markets for certain types of creators. Being in LA or NYC is considered important in the industry if you aspire to be a Hollywood actor and want to collaborate in person with other creators and attend major events.\n\n\"Our advice is if you want to make money, have an address in New York and LA,\" said Kyle Hjelmeseth, CEO of G&B Digital Management. Some managers also caution against moving outside the US, saying it can impact your ability to get brand deals.\n\nThe Genta siblings said they wish Miami had a bigger TV and film scene to help their peers who are seeking those opportunities. They started #NextGen Creators, an events series where creators can learn and mingle with brands.\n\n\"Many creators want to move on to traditional media, like hosting television, acting, whatever that may look like, and I do think Miami still lacks in that,\" Sebastian said.",

    "description": "TikTok jumped into the top spot among social apps where young people regularly get news, according to data from the Pew Research Center.",
    "fullText": "TikTok has unseated its social media rivals as the top spot for young people to get their news.\n\nTikTok is now the most popular social app for news among 18- to 29-year-olds in the US, according to new survey data from the Pew Research Center. The app surpassed YouTube and Instagram, which were the top choices in 2024.\n\nForty-three percent of young adults said they regularly get news from TikTok in 2025, compared to 41% for both YouTube and Facebook. Forty percent named Instagram as a regular news source, while 21% said X (formerly Twitter) and 18% said Reddit.\n\nSocial media beat out every other format as a place where 18- to 29-year-olds said they get news, according to Pew's survey. Seventy-six percent of the cohort said they often or sometimes get news from social media, compared to 60% for news websites and 28% for email newsletters.\n\nHalf of the young adults who responded to Pew's survey said they have some or a lot of trust in social media as a news source. That roughly matched the level of trust the age group has for information from national news organizations.\n\nTikTok has been rising quickly as a go-to source for news. In 2023, 32% of respondents named the video app as a place for regular news consumption.\n\nWatching news on TikTok does not necessarily mean tuning into videos from traditional outlets like The Washington Post or NBC News. Young people view commentary from news influencers and user-generated videos tied to current events, such as from a war zone or protest, as news as well.\n\nA new crop of independent news influencers has emerged to report on current events, including creators like Philip DeFranco and Vitus \"V\" Spehar's @underthedesknews.\n\nSome professional news organizations, including NPR's \"Planet Money,\" have similarly centered videos on individual creators who can help build trust with their audiences. Gen Z social-media users told Business Insider that they are drawn to news creators who can deliver information in a more authentic and relatable manner.\n\nBeyond news commentary, social media creators and podcasters have taken on a bigger role in news gathering in recent months. Politicians and government institutions are turning to podcasts and other formats to reach people, and content creators had a big presence at national conventions for the Democrats and Republicans last year. Many independent creators have applied for access to White House press briefings in 2025.\n\nTikTok has introduced a handful of features tied to news on its app, including the ability for publishers to link to articles inside videos and a \"community notes\" style fact-checking tool called footnotes. It also works with \"independent fact-checkers in over 130 markets to determine if content is accurate,\" according to its website.",

He began his career as a researcher at IBM before joining Meta, where he advanced from researcher to manager in just three years, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then held director positions at Square and Snacphat, and was vice president of engineering at HubSpot, before he joined HeyGen, a visual storytelling platform, in 2024.\n\nOver the years, he said he has noticed that those he has mentored can make themselves miserable when they strive for a promotion.\n\n\"Don't do that,\" he said. \"When you start to get into that mindset, you start to count your happiness or your career growth toward something that you don't have full control over.\"\n\nIt's better to control the things you can control. \"Learn how to adjust, and you'll be a better self afterward,\" he said.\n\nFor those still determined to seek a promotion, however, timing matters.\n\nExecutive coach Andrea Wasserman previously told Business Insider that it's best to put yourself in your manager's shoes and think about what's happening across the team or company. Ask yourself, \"Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a 'yes?'\"",

    "description": "Four tech professionals, from an early career engineer to a former senior director of GenAI at Meta, said getting your hands dirty was important for breaking into the AI industry.",
    "fullText": "As the AI revolution continues to disrupt white collar jobs, many of us are looking for ways to get ahead.\n\nAs part of my first-person coverage for Business Insider in 2025, I asked people with aspirational jobs their formulas for success — including how tech workers in various stages of their careers landed cutting-edge AI jobs.\n\nThese conversations covered a variety of topics, from whether you need a Ph.D. to break into the field to how to earn big as an AI contractor.\n\nBut one remarkably simple piece of advice kept coming up: gain real-world experience with AI technology to help get your foot in the door.\n\nThey didn't view AI as something that can be mastered from a textbook or in a lecture hall. Instead, play around with AI, like an infant tinkering with a new toy, or \"get your hands dirty,\" to borrow a phrase from a couple of the techies I interviewed.\n\nBut what does that look like in practice? Here's how they applied this principle in their own careers.\n\nWhen Patrick Leung, who joined Google in 2007, first saw a demo for a calling assistant that used AI, which would later be called Google Duplex, he was blown away by how realistic the voice sounded.\n\nLeung joined the Duplex team in 2017. Although he'd been exposed to machine learning and AI concepts during previous company projects, he'd never worked on building models and had to retool himself on the job.\n\nLeveraging the expertise around him, including by having lengthy conversations with colleagues who explained how the system worked, helped him become proficient in AI.\n\nLeung witnessed Google Duplex's public launch in 2018, before leaving Google in 2019 to join a financial sciences company. He's continued to work with AI in the later stages of his career.\n\nAt the time of his interview with Business Insider, Leung said the barrier to getting into AI was lower than ever, and encouraged people to apply LLMs to real business problems. For instance, a friend with no coding experience used AI to personalize outreach messages for recruitment purposes at her job and improved her response rate.\n\nIf there aren't opportunities to do something like this in your current job, use AI in your spare time and put it on your résumé, Leung said, adding that people who can demonstrate they can wield LLMs effectively are going to find jobs.\n\nSophia Sun essentially put Leung's advice into action when she pitched a project that would use AI to help customers at Kajabi, the creator commerce platform she worked for as a senior product manager.\n\nThe tool Sun envisioned would help content creators generate marketing content, such as blog posts and short-form videos, for TikTok and Instagram.\n\nShe started working on the project in April 2023, alongside engineering and marketing teammates. Seeing it through to its March 2024 launch was a learning curve for Sun, who had never built an AI product before.\n\nThat July, Sun started a new job at Microsoft as a senior AI product manager, and told Business Insider she thought her end-to-end experience with building an AI product helped her land the role.\n\nSun's playbook for breaking into AI was to find a real user problem, design a lightweight AI solution, and turn it into proof of work. Having good grades is one thing, she said, but building a product that demonstrates your abilities is another, she said.\n\nWhen OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, Mostofa Adib Shakib knew the world was going to change.\n\nHe started his career in traditional software engineering at Snap Inc. and then ZipRecruiter, but became convinced he needed to build AI skills.\n\nShakib spent time learning about AI from books, videos, and research papers, and he built software projects to gain proficiency with agentic AI, such as a tool to help Bangladeshi professionals optimize their résumés.\n\nIn February 2025, he started an AI contractor role with Mercor, which, around the time of his interview with Business Insider, earned him a handsome sum of $6,400 a week.\n\nShakib decided not to go back to a full-time traditional software engineering job. He said he thought focusing on building AI skills before the market gets crowded was the right bet for him.\n\nWhile being a full-time employee at a company offers stability and benefits, it would restrict his time, meaning he could only focus on gaining agentic AI skills on weekends, he said. As a full-time AI contractor, he can spread out his hours as he pleases, he added.\n\nShakib advised people interested in staying relevant in the tech industry to embrace change, rather than fear it, and to focus on upskilling.\n\nAlthough Devi Parikh completed a Ph.D. in computer vision in 2009, before going on to become a senior director of GenAI at Meta years later, she said not to assume you need a Ph.D. to break into AI.\n\nAs the cofounder and co-CEO of the AI company Yutori, she doesn't consider Ph.D.s much when hiring, but looks for people with relevant practical experience, such as training models, she said.\n\nOther potential avenues into interesting AI work include spending time at startups or big labs, or trying side projects that make use of open source code and online communities.\n\nStarting and executing projects has been instrumental to her career success, Parikh said. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she started working on a YouTube series called \"Humans of AI,\" where she interviewed AI researchers about their daily habits. This gave her more professional visibility than her research alone could.\n\nDo you have a story to share about breaking into AI? Contact this reporter at ccheong@businessinsider.com",

    "title": "5 AI advertising controversies that turned heads this year, from Meta's AI granny to Coca-Cola's shape-shifting trucks",
    "description": "Brands, from McDonald's to H&M, drew backlash in some quarters over their AI-driven ads and marketing experiments.",
    "fullText": "Chief marketing officers at many of the world's biggest brands made artificial intelligence a centerpiece of their strategies this year.\n\nFor some brands, the enthusiasm ran into risky territory. From AI-generated ads that veered into the \"uncanny valley\" to backlash over replacing human models and advertising creatives, AI's growing role in advertising fueled a string of controversial marketing moments. The AI backlash even led to its own marketing trend: brands hating on AI.\n\nA survey of more than 6,000 US consumers conducted by the brand-tracking platform Tracksuit in November found that overall sentiment toward AI-generated advertising skewed negative (39%). Neutrality was also strong among respondents, at 36%, while only 18% felt positive about brands using AI-generated content in their ads.\n\nMatt Barash, chief commercial officer of the adtech platform Nova, said that while AI can be a useful tool for buying and placing ads, brands should be cautious when attempting to automate the creative process.\n\n\"When brands ask AI to invent stories from scratch, they don't get innovation — they get an approximation of human emotion, and the result can make headlines for all of the wrong reasons,\" Barash said.\n\nIndeed, several major marketers did make the news for their AI-related mishaps this year. Take a look at some of the most notable AI advertising controversies of the year, below.\n\nMcDonald's Netherlands cooked up an AI-generated holiday ad this month — and quickly sent it back to the kitchen when it became clear that viewers weren't lovin' it.\n\nThe \"most terrible time of the year\" ad was intended to be a satirical take on Christmas calamities that could occur over the festive period. The 45-second spot featured a quickfire montage of cooking mishaps, broken bones at the ice rink, and Santa's sleigh getting stuck in a traffic jam. The brand suggested its restaurants could act as a shelter from the chaos. \"Hide out in McDonald's 'til January's here,\" the ad's narrator said.\n\nSome social media commentators denounced the fast-food chain as a McGrinch, complaining the ad had a cynical sentiment and \"creepy\" characters. After initially turning off the comments on the ad's YouTube video, McDonald's later removed the ad from the site altogether.\n\nIn a statement, McDonald's Netherlands said that while the ad was intended to reflect some of the stressful moments that the holidays can bring, it recognized that many of its customers feel the season is \"the most wonderful time of the year.\"\n\n\"We respect that and remain committed to creating experiences that offer Good Times and Good Food for everyone,\" the statement said.\n\nCoca-Cola already had one AI-generated holiday ad misfire under its belt, after last year's \"Holidays are Coming\" rendition was criticized as \"dystopian\" and \"soulless.\" Despite that, this year it released three AI-generated holiday ads.\n\nOne of the ads, another AI rendition of the classic \"Holidays are Coming\" spot, caught the attention of the eagle-eyed creative community due to its lack of consistency. Sure, the wheels on the trucks went round and round — a criticism of last year's ad was that they appeared to glide across the road — but they also appeared to change in quantity as the ad rolled on.\n\nIn the spirit of Christmas, Dino Burbidge, an independent innovation specialist, shared the gift of this handy graphic to help everyone follow along:\n\nPJ Pereira, cofounder of Silverside AI, the production company behind the ad, defended Coca-Cola's use of AI in a statement.\n\n\"Coca-Cola became a pioneer in this space because, once they recognized AI as the future, they stopped debating whether it's perfect or not — and instead focused on how to use it in the best, most creative way possible,\" Pereira said.\n\nPereira also said that the ad performed well with consumers in testing. System1, which rates ads on a scale from 1 to 5.9 stars on their potential to drive long-term growth for brands, gave the 2025 \"Holidays are Coming\" ads the highest possible score: 5.9. A separate creative testing company, DAIVID, said the ad generated higher-than-average attention and brand recall scores.\n\nApparel brand True Classic is a poster child of digital performance marketing, honing platforms like Facebook and Instagram to build a community of devoted customers — typically men ages 30 to 45.\n\nSo imagine its marketing chief's shock when he realized Meta's ad platform had swapped out his top-performing ad — a millennial man in a matching fleece set, casually posing on a stool — with that of a cheerful, yet clearly AI-generated granny sitting in an armchair.\n\nHow do we go from this… to AI grandma. pic.twitter.com/n3cryUpLaT\n\nAdvertisers told Business Insider earlier this year that settings within Meta's Advantage+ suite of AI-powered ad products had led to the platform automatically generating ad creatives on their behalf.\n\nIn a statement, Meta said that advertisers who use its full image generation feature can review the images before running their ads.\n\nBut three advertisers also told Business Insider they'd encountered a problem where Meta automatically switched those toggles to \"on,\" even when they'd explicitly turned them off — meaning they inadvertently spent some of their budgets on AI-generated ads they didn't intend to run.\n\nAI has helped take airbrushing to the next level. Some brands are experimenting with using generative AI to eliminate photo shoots altogether — with mixed results.\n\nTake fast-fashion retailer H&M. In March, the company announced a plan to create \"digital twins\" of 30 models whose images could be used for social media posts and ad campaigns. H&M said the models would own the rights to their twins, which would include the ability to allow other brands to use them.\n\nH&M was aware that the move would be controversial.\n\n\"People will be divided. You know, 'Is this good? Is this bad?'\" Jörgen Andersson, H&M chief creative officer, told Business of Fashion at the time.\n\nH&M certainly got chins wagging. American fashion influencer Morgan Riddle described the plan as \"shameful.\" Sara Ziff, founder of Model Alliance, a nonprofit that focuses on workers' rights in the fashion industry, said the plan raised \"serious concerns.\"\n\n\"In an industry that has historically been a backwater for workers' rights, H&M's new initiative raises critical questions about consent and compensation, and has the potential to replace a host of fashion workers — including make-up artists, hair stylists, and other creative artists in our community,\" Ziff said in a statement.\n\nIn a statement sent to Business Insider for this article, an H&M spokesperson said that the brand was exploring how generative AI can support the creative process in thoughtful and responsible ways.\n\n\"We recognize that generative AI raises important questions and concerns, and we want to be transparent in acknowledging that we do not yet have all the answers, but are continuing to learn and evolve,\" the H&M spokesperson said.\n\nH&M wasn't the only fashion brand to give AI models a twirl this year.\n\nReaders flicking through the August 2025 issue of Vogue noticed ads for Guess carried a small label/disclaimer: \"Produced by Seraphinne Vallora on AI.\" The models, \"Vivienne\" and \"Anastasia,\" were created using AI by a London-based AI marketing agency.\n\nSocial media users slammed the ad, saying the images pushed unrealistic beauty standards and that the use of AI imagery portended bad news for creative industry jobs. Some online commenters said they would cancel their Vogue subscriptions in protest. (Vogue publisher Condé Nast said at the time that an AI model had never appeared \"editorially\" in Vogue.)\n\nThe cofounders of Seraphinne Vallora said in an interview with \"Good Morning America\" that they were looking to supplement the modeling industry, not replace it.\n\nVogue is facing criticism for running a Guess ad that used AI-generated models in its latest issue. Stephanie Ramos has more on the controversy and what it means for the fashion industry. #vogue #ai #aigenerated #fashion\n\n\"We are here to co-exist together, and we will always see photography, stylists, and everyone involved in a photo shoot as incredibly important,\" said Valentina Gonzalez, one of the cofounders.\n\nAI models and the controversies surrounding them weren't a new advertising phenomenon for 2025. Brands such as Mango and Levi's have also faced a similar backlash for featuring AI-generated models in their marketing in recent years. A new trend does appear to be emerging, though. Brand partnerships with AI social accounts dropped by around 30% in the first eight months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, according to transaction data from hundreds of campaigns provided by the influencer-marketing platform Collabstr.\n\nCould AI models be the latest fast-fashion casualty?",

    "fullText": "OpenAI had a year of high-profile departures.\n\nOver the summer, the ChatGPT creator lost at least seven researchers and scientists to Meta's billion-dollar effort to beef up its AI team at its Superintelligence Lab.\n\nThis came after the company saw an exodus of top executives in 2024 amid a restructuring effort, including chief technology officer Mira Murati, chief research officer Bob McGrew, and vice president of research Barret Zoph.\n\nCEO Sam Altman is now one of only two active remaining members of the company's original 11-person founding team.\n\nHere's a running list of researchers and executives OpenAI has lost this year and where they've ended up.\n\nWei, a research scientist who worked on OpenAI's o1 and deep research models, left in July for Meta's Superintelligence Lab.\n\nSun, who left for Meta's Superintelligence Labs in July, was a research scientist at OpenAI.\n\nChung is part of the trio of OpenAI research scientists who departed for Meta's Superintelligence Lab in July. He posted on LinkedIn alongside his two colleagues that they are having \"so much fun building from a clean slate with a truly talent-dense team.\"\n\nZhao became the chief scientist of the Meta Superintelligence Lab in July after co-creating ChatGPT and GPT-4 at OpenAI. The prominent researcher is working directly with Mark Zuckerberg and Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang .\n\nYu is widely credited with leading the Perception team in OpenAI to develop the \"senses\" of a Large Language Model, including images, audio, and sensor readings.
