    "fullText": "Snap’s chief executive had been due to testify in civil action also involving Meta, TikTok and YouTube\n\nSnapchat’s parent company has settled a civil lawsuit shortly before it was due to start in California, but other large tech companies still face a trial under the case.\n\nSnap’s chief executive, Evan Spiegel, had been due to testify in a tech addiction lawsuit which also involves the Instagram owner, Meta; ByteDance’s TikTok; and Alphabet-owned YouTube – which have not settled.\n\nSnap told the BBC the parties were “pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner”.\n\nThe Snapchat parent was among those being sued by a plaintiff named K.G.M, a 19-year-old woman who alleges that she developed mental health problems after becoming addicted to social media apps.\n\nThe California case is the first of three “bellwether” trials consolidating thousands of lawsuits. Last year a Los Angeles judge ruled that the platforms’ design features may be responsible for harm – and not just the third-party content posted on sites and apps.\n\nHistorically, tech firms have turned to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law underpinning US internet regulation that exempts platforms from legal liability for content generated by its users, as part of their legal defence. The first bellwether case is still due to begin on 27 January with jury selection.\n\nSnap remains a defendant in the other two cases.\n\nBeasley Allen, a law firm involved in the lawsuits on the plaintiff side, has said the cases could have profound consequences including billions of dollars in damages, forcing changes in platform design and new US regulations governing how tech firms interact with minors.\n\n“The litigation is being compared to past landmark cases against big tobacco and opioid manufacturers – industries that were held accountable for public health harms after years of denial,” the firm said in a statement last year.\n\nSnap, Meta, TikTok and YouTube have been contacted for comment.",

    "fullText": "Friends … followers … where is the line?\n\nInstagram is testing out new tweaks that emphasize friends. It also has a new definition of friends: People who mutually follow each other.\n\nThe Instagram test involves changing a user's \"following\" count on a profile to a \"friends\" count. That means if you follow thousands of people, but maybe only a few hundred of those people follow you back, that'll show up as your \"friends\" count.\n\nFor those of you who care about those precious follower-to-following ratios, get ready for a potentially even more telling public ratio: How many of those Instagram followers are friends?\n\nInstagram is quietly running this as a \"small global test,\" a Meta spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider, adding that the platform is trying to understand how users respond to seeing more content from friends in the app.\n\n\"Friends are central to the Instagram experience, so we're exploring ways to make these connections more visible and meaningful,\" a Meta spokesperson said. \"We're running a small test to highlight Friends throughout Instagram.\"\n\nAs part of the test, Meta is also labeling some content in the feed as \"friends\" instead of \"posts\" or \"following.\"\n\nAs influencers, brands, and now AI slop have invaded Instagram's feed, it's felt less and less like a space to share content with your friends.\n\nThat's part of the reason Instagram has doubled down on its \"Close Friends\" features over the years, focused on direct messaging (where friends and family often share content), and added more friend-focused features.\n\nFor instance, Instagram rolled out a feature called \"Blend,\" which lets you and a friend share a mutual feed of reels.\n\nLast year, Instagram also introduced features like a social mapping experience similar to Snapchat's map, as well as a \"Friends\" feed in the reels tab, where you can see content your friends (by Instagram's definition) are engaging with.\n\nInstagram's top executive, Adam Mosseri, said in an August post that he wants Instagram to be somewhere where users can \"actually engage with and connect with the people that you care about.\"",

    "fullText": "Italian fashion designer Valentino Garavani, known as Valentino, has died at 93, his foundation announced in an Instagram post on Monday.\n\n\"Our founder, Valentino Garavani passed away today at his Roman residence, surrounded by his loved ones,\" the caption read.\n\nValentino founded his eponymous fashion house in 1960 and quickly became one of fashion's defining figures. He was celebrated for his glamorous, elegant designs and his signature shade, \"Valentino Red.\"\n\nHis clothes were worn by numerous celebrities and even royalty, including Princess Diana, Jackie Kennedy Onassis, and Elizabeth Taylor.\n\n\"I know what women want,\" he said in \"Valentino: The Last Emperor,\" a 2008 documentary about his life and career. \"They want to be beautiful.\"\n\nHere's how women across fashion and Hollywood paid tribute to the designer after his death.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow paid tribute to Valentino in an Instagram post featuring a photo of her kissing the late designer on the cheek.\n\n\"I was so lucky to know and love Valentino-to know the real man, in private. The man who was in love with beauty, his family, his muses, his friends. His dogs, his gardens, and a good Hollywood story. I loved him so much. I loved how he always pestered me to 'at least wear a little mascara' when I came to dinner. I loved his naughty laugh,\" Paltrow wrote in the caption.\n\n\"This feels like the end of an era. He will be deeply missed by me and all who loved him.

Rest in peace #valentino.\"\n\nBruni has modeled for Valentino numerous times throughout her career.\n\nClaudia Schiffer paid tribute to Valentino with a series of Instagram photos, including shots of her with the designer and from her campaigns for the brand.\n\n\"Heartbroken to hear of the passing of my old friend Valentino. He is what true legends are made of, living on forever through the brand he created, the embodiment of timeless elegance and glamour. I loved the special times where I got to bring his creations to life on and off the runway. One of my favourite campaigns was in Rome where I became Anita Ekberg in La Dolce Vita, a memory I will cherish forever,\" Schiffer wrote in her caption.\n\n\"I will remember the fun holidays I spent with him in Mallorca, Ibiza and St Tropez. My Valentino wedding gown which I have framed at home as a constant reminder of his gentle, generous, sweet and loyal nature. Having him create my wedding gown was one of the great honors of my life, a moment I will cherish forever. I feel so proud to have been a part of his life. Repose en paix, Monsieur Valentino,\" she wrote.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker shared an Instagram post featuring a black background with red text that read \"RIP VAVA. May 11, 1932 - January 19, 2026.\"\n\n\"So many memories. So happy to recall. Of course, wish I had more.

    "description": "A Meta product manager says vibe coding is letting non-technical PMs ship features and work differently with engineers.",
    "fullText": "A product manager at Meta says vibe coding has changed what it means to do his job — even though he has no technical background and still finds code \"terrifying.\"\n\nZevi Arnovitz said in an episode of \"Lenny's Podcast\" released Sunday that discovering AI coding tools in mid-2024 marked a turning point in his career.\n\nIt felt like he was handed \"superpowers,\" Arnovitz said.\n\nUnderstanding how to use AI intentionally is \"one of the biggest game changers that will make you much better as a PM,\" he said, referring to product management.\n\nArnovitz joined Meta in September last year after about three years as a product manager at website-building company Wix, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nArnovitz said he has rebuilt his workflow around AI. He uses vibe coding tools like Cursor alongside models from Anthropic and Google to explore product ideas, generate build plans, execute code, review it, and update documentation.\n\nThe shift reshaped his role as a product manager. Instead of merely acting as a coordinator between engineering and design, Arnovitz operates more like a product owner with the capability to execute.\n\n\"Everyone's going to become a builder,\" he said. \"We're going to see that a lot in the next coming years.\"\n\nStill, Arnovitz said there are limits to what non-technical product managers should take on. He said he doesn't think product managers should be shipping complex infrastructure changes or big projects.\n\nAI has enabled product managers to take on smaller UI projects by building the feature and then handing the code to a developer for final review and completion, he added.\n\nAs AI tools improve, Arnovitz said titles and responsibilities are likely to \"collapse,\" and product managers should treat vibe coding as a \"collaborative learning opportunity\" with their engineering teams.\n\nThe rise of AI coding tools is blurring the lines for traditional roles, making it easier for non-technical workers, including product managers, to build products directly.\n\nFigma CEO Dylan Field said in October on \"Lenny's Podcast\" that AI has pushed many workers to experiment with building products.\n\nTasks that once required deep engineering expertise can now be done with vibe coding tools, he said.\n\n\"I think that we're seeing more designers, engineers, product managers, researchers, all these different folks that are involved in the product development process dip their toe into the other roles,\" he said.\n\n\"We're all product builders, and some of us are specialized in our particular area,\" he added.\n\nThat same thinking is showing up in how companies train new hires. LinkedIn replaced its long-running associate product manager program with an associate product builder track in January.\n\n\"We're going to teach them how to code, design, and PM at LinkedIn,\" said the company's former chief product officer, Tomer Cohen, in an episode of \"Lenny's Podcast\" published in December. It's more about training people \"who can flex across,\" he added.\n\nCohen, who spent nearly 14 years at LinkedIn, left the company in January and now works as an advisor, according to his LinkedIn profile.",

    "description": "Oculus founder Palmer Luckey said Meta's VR cuts targeted subsidized game studios that were crowding out developers and distorting the industry.",
    "fullText": "Meta's decision to cut more than a thousand jobs in Reality Labs and wind down parts of its metaverse strategy has reignited fears that the company is quietly backing away from virtual reality.\n\nOculus founder Palmer Luckey says that interpretation is wrong — and misses a deeper problem the cuts may actually solve.\n\nIn a series of posts on X on Monday, Luckey said that Meta's Reality Labs layoffs, which The New York Times reported were roughly 10% to 15% of the division's 15,000 employees, do not signal retreat.\n\nMeta still employs the largest VR workforce in the world, he said, dwarfing competitors \"by about an order of magnitude.\"\n\nFrom a numbers perspective, Luckey framed the layoffs as \"six months of normal churn concentrated into 60 days,\" not an existential blow.\n\nThe more consequential shift, he said, lies in where the cuts landed.\n\nAccording to Luckey, most of the eliminated roles were tied to first-party content — Meta-owned studios building internally developed VR games.\n\nThose teams, he said, had become a growing problem for the broader VR ecosystem.\n\n\"Meta heavily subsidizing their own (with money, marketing, placement, etc) at the expense of core technical progress and platform stability doesn't make sense,\" Luckey wrote. \"Crowding out the rest of the entire ecosystem, even less so.\"\n\nLuckey said third-party developers — even efficient, well-run studios — struggled to compete against Meta-owned teams backed by budgets that far exceeded what the market could realistically return.\n\nThe irony, he added, was that strong reviews and polished execution only worsened the imbalance by pulling attention and sales away from independent creators.\n\n\"People will point out that these teams did an awesome job and got awesome reviews from critics and customers alike — yes, and fucked up though it is, that makes the problem even worse!\" he wrote.\n\nIn a capital-constrained environment, Luckey said, Meta's resources are better spent on core technology and platform stability than on competing directly with developers it needs to keep VR viable.\n\nHe also framed the move as a return to Oculus's original philosophy. Internally, he said, the company aimed \"to NOT be Nintendo\" — avoiding a closed, first-party-dominated model in favor of building an ecosystem that others could profit from.\n\nLuckey acknowledged the human cost of layoffs and said he felt \"really bad for the people impacted.\"\n\nStill, he said that scaling back first-party content is ultimately \"a good thing for the long-term health of the industry,\" even if it's uncomfortable in the short term.",

The most prized employees today are \"player-coaches,\" people who ship work themselves while also guiding projects, mentoring peers, and shaping strategy. AI makes that hybrid role even more potent, allowing a single strong contributor to amplify their output, and their influence, without managing a large team, Musa wrote this week.\n\nThe result is a revival of the individual contributor track. You no longer have to become a full-time people manager to earn top-tier pay. At companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, senior ICs can now match (or beat) the compensation of managers simply by delivering outsized results, he noted.\n\nFor ambitious employees, the takeaway is simple: in the AI era, execution compounds. And Silicon Valley is increasingly willing to pay for it.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Progress of artificial general intelligence could stall, which may lead to a financial crash, says Yoshua Bengio, one of the ‘godfathers’ of modern AI\n\nWill the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) lead us to a land of financial plenty – or will it end in a 2008-style bust? Trillions of dollars rest on the answer.\n\nThe figures are staggering: an estimated $2.9tn (£2.2tn) being spent on datacentres, the central nervous systems of AI tools; the more than $4tn stock market capitalisation of Nvidia, the company that makes the chips powering cutting-edge AI systems; and the $100m signing-on bonuses offered by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to top engineers at OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nThese sky-high numbers are all propped up by investors who expect a return on their trillions. AGI, a theoretical state of AI where systems gain human levels of intelligence across an array of tasks and are able to replace humans in white-collar jobs such as accountancy and law, is a keystone of this financial promise.\n\nIt offers the prospect of computer systems carrying out profitable work without the associated cost of human labour – a hugely lucrative scenario for companies developing the technology and the customers who deploy it.\n\nThere will be consequences if AI companies fall short: US stock markets, boosted heavily by the performance of tech stocks, could fall and cause damage to people’s personal wealth; debt markets wrapped up in the datacentre boom could suffer a jolt that ripples elsewhere; GDP growth in the US, which has benefited from the AI infrastructure, could falter, which would have knock-on effects for interlinked economies.\n\nDavid Cahn, a partner at one leading Silicon Valley investment firm, Sequoia Capital, says tech companies now have to deliver on AGI.\n\n“Nothing short of AGI will be enough to justify the investments now being proposed for the coming decade,” he wrote in a blog published in October.\n\nIt means there is a lot hanging on progress towards advanced AI, and the trillions being poured into infrastructure and R&D to achieve it. One of the “godfathers” of modern AI, Yoshua Bengio, says the progress of AGI could stall and the outcome would be bad for investors.\n\n“There is a clear possibility that we will hit a wall, that there’s some difficulty that we don’t foresee right now, and we don’t find any solution quickly,” he says. “And that could be a real [financial] crash. A lot of the people who are putting trillions right now into AI are also expecting the advances to continue fairly regularly at the current pace.”\n\nBut Bengio, a prominent voice on the safety implications of AGI, is clear that continued progress towards a highly advanced state of AI is the more likely endgame.\n\n“Advances stalling is a minority scenario, like it’s an unlikely scenario. The more likely scenario is we continue to move forward,” he says.\n\nThe pessimistic view is that investors are backing an unrealistic outcome – that AGI will not happen without further breakthroughs.\n\nDavid Bader, the director of the institute for data science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, says trillions of dollars are being spent on scaling up – tech jargon for growing something quickly – the underlying technology for chatbots, known as transformers, in the expectation that increasing the amount of computing power behind current AI systems, by building more datacentres, will suffice.\n\n“If AGI requires a fundamentally different approach, perhaps something we haven’t yet conceived, then we’re optimising an architecture that can’t get us there no matter how large we make it. It’s like trying to reach the moon by building taller ladders,” he says.\n\nNonetheless, big US tech companies such as Google’s parent Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are ploughing ahead with datacentre plans with the financial cushion of being able to fund their AGI ambitions through the cash generated by their hugely profitable day-to-day businesses. This at least gives them some protection if the wall outlined by Bengio and Bader comes into view.\n\nBut there are other more worrying aspects to the boom. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, estimate that $2.9tn will be spent on datacentres between now and 2028, with half of that covered by the cashflow from “hyperscalers” such as Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nThe rest will have to be covered by alternative sources such as private credit, a corner of the shadow banking sector that is activating alarm bells at the Bank of England and elsewhere. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, has borrowed $29bn from the private credit market to finance a datacentre in Louisiana.\n\nAI-related sectors account for approximately 15% of investment grade debt in the US, which is even bigger than the banking sector, according to the investment bank JP Morgan.\n\nOracle, which has signed a $300bn datacentre deal with OpenAI, has had an increase in credit default swaps, which are a form of insurance on a company defaulting on its debts. High-yield, or “junk debt”, which represents the higher-risk end of the borrowing market, is also appearing in the AI sector via datacentre operators CoreWeave and TeraWulf. Growth is also being funded by asset-backed securities – a form of debt underpinned by assets such as loans or credit card debt, but in this case rent paid by tech companies to datacentre owners – in a form of financing that has risen sharply in recent years.\n\nIt is no wonder that JP Morgan says the AI infrastructure boom will require a contribution from all corners of the credit market.\n\nBader says: “If AGI doesn’t materialise on expected timelines, we could see contagion across multiple debt markets simultaneously – investment-grade bonds, high-yield junk debt, private credit and securitised products – all of which are being tapped to fund this buildout.”\n\nShare prices linked to AI and tech are also playing an outsized role in US stock markets. The so-called “magnificent 7” of US tech stocks – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia – account for more than a third of the value of the S&P 500 index, the biggest stock market index in the US, compared with 20% at the start of the decade.\n\nIn October the Bank of England warned of “the risk of a sharp correction” in US and UK markets due to giddy valuations of AI-linked tech companies. Central bankers are concerned stock markets could slump if AI fails to reach the transformative heights investors are hoping for. At the same time the International Monetary Fund said valuations were heading towards dotcom bubble-levels.\n\nEven tech execs whose companies are benefiting from the boom are acknowledging the speculative nature of the frenzy. In November Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, said there are “elements of irrationality” in the boom and that “no company is going to be immune” if the bubble bursts, while Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has said the AI industry is in a “kind of industrial bubble”, and OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, has said “there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.”\n\nAll three, to be clear, are AI optimists and expect the technology to keep improving and benefit society.\n\nBut when the numbers get this big there are obvious risks in a bubble bursting, as Pichai admits. Pension funds and anyone invested in the stock market will be affected by a share price collapse, while the debt markets will also take a hit. There is also a web of “circular” deals, such as OpenAI paying Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares. If these transactions unravel due to a lack of take-up of AI, or that wall being hit, then it could be messy.\n\nThere are also optimists who argue that generative AI, the catch-all term for tools such as chatbots and video generators, will transform whole industries and justify the expenditure. Benedict Evans, a technology analyst, says the expenditure numbers are not outrageous in the context of other industries, such as oil and gas extraction which runs at $600bn a year.\n\n“These AI capex figures are a lot of money but it’s not an impossible amount of money,” he says.\n\nEvans adds: “You don’t have to believe in AGI to believe that generative AI is a big thing. And most of what is happening here is not, ‘oh wow they’re going to create God’. It’s ‘this is going to completely change how advertising, search, software and social networks – and everything else our business is based on – is going to work’. It’s going to be a huge opportunity.”\n\nNonetheless, there is a multitrillion dollar expectation that AGI will be achieved. For many experts, the consequences of getting there are alarming. The cost of not getting there could also be significant.",

Roughly 10% to 15% of Reality Labs' 15,000 employees are expected to be laid off, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe metaverse has been a costly bet for Meta, racking up more than $70 billion in losses since 2020. It has faced repeated rounds of cuts as Meta shifts its attention — and spending — toward AI.\n\nIn a memo obtained by Business Insider last year, Meta's CTO, who oversees the company's metaverse efforts, called 2025 \"the most critical\" year of his tenure.\n\nWorkrooms showcased how Meta Horizon could bring people together to work, collaborate, and connect, the company said. But Meta Horizon has since developed into a social platform that supports a wide range of productivity apps and tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta said its Horizon managed services will no longer be available for purchase from February 20, although customers would continue to receive support until the start of 2030.",

    "fullText": "Get in, loser, we're going back to 2016.\n\nOpen Instagram this week, and you'd think you were back in the early days of Tumblr and Snapchat. Think Lo-Fi selfies, thick winged eyeliner, and the dog-ear Snapchat filter.\n\nPeople on Instagram and TikTok, influencers and regular folks alike, have been posting throwback pictures from 2016.\n\nIn some posts, millennials openly mourned for the halcyon days of 2016, when they were free to wear skinny jeans without being scorned by Gen Z coworkers, some 20 pounds lighter, and juicing up their feeds with the Clarendon and Gingham Instagram filters.\n\nIt was also a huge year for music, yielding 2010s-defining pop hits like The Chainsmokers' \"Closer,\" Justin Bieber's \"Love Yourself,\" and Alan Walker's \"Faded.\"\n\nNo surprise, millennials are craving a walk down memory lane.\n\nKar Brulhart, a Mexico City-based social media strategist and coach, said 2016 is trending because of nostalgia and a broader shift toward analogue — think paperback books, flip phones, and digital cameras.\n\nBut beyond that, Brulhart said, revisiting the 2016 era provides relief.\n\n\"Especially in the US, where the political and cultural climate feels increasingly charged, people genuinely don't know what — or how — to post anymore. Revisiting that era gives people a socially acceptable break from having to respond, react, or perform relevance,\" she said.\n\nCelebrities like Charlie Puth, Eva Longoria, Lucy Hale, and Karlie Kloss have jumped on the trend, posting awkward, unglamorous selfies.\n\nKylie Jenner's 2016 post on Thursday, captioned \"You just had to be there,\" has gotten over 2.4 million likes as of press time. The \"Keeping up with the Kardashians\" star posted pictures of herself wearing skinny jeans, black Converse high tops, and her iconic Kylie Lip Kit.\n\nMakeup artist and beauty influencer James Charles revived a full 2016 cut-crease eyeshadow routine in a TikTok video on Wednesday, which has garnered about 5.6 million views.\n\nOthers used the trend to remember milestones. John Legend posted a picture of himself and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, sharing a kiss after the birth of their first child in 2016.\n\nAnd brands wasted no time capitalizing on the throwback trend. LA-based fashion brand Reformation posted pictures of celebrities like Taylor Swift and Emily Ratajkowski in its 2016 range with the caption, \"We miss 2016 too.\"\n\nThe trend reveals a yearning for a simpler time, social media and PR experts say.\n\nHailey Bailey, the founder of Los Angeles-based PR and talent management firm Image PR, said the trend is a result of millennials like herself \"craving the innocence, promise, and naivety of our summer 2016 selves.\"\n\n\"I think most millennials look at where they are at in life right now and think, 'Wow, I thought I'd be in a different place,'\" Bailey said. \"Many of us can't afford to buy a house anytime soon, or haven't found the right partner, or are so career-focused we can't even think about having children.\"\n\nBrulhart said that in 2016, chronological posts were the only way to experience Instagram. That was before Reels, AI-generated \"slop,\" and hyper-clean, aesthetic-first feeds took over the app.\n\n\"There was far less curation, and people weren't trying to brand themselves with every post,\" she said. \"They were documenting life as it happened, not worrying about the likes or engagement.\"\n\nThe trend felt like a gentle moment of reflection to her.\n\n\"It's not about wanting to go backward, but about remembering a version of ourselves that perhaps felt lighter,\" Brulhart said.",

Subscribers can still access Supernatural's existing library of Beat Saber-workouts, and Meta says it will maintain the platform and Facebook page, but no new workouts, features, or other content is planned.\n\nBoth users and critics have nearly universally praised Supernatural—CNet scored it 9 out of 10, it won both Fast Company's Best App award in 2020 and a Webby in 2023, and boasted celebrity tie-ins with Jane Fonda and Bon Jovi. Meta doesn't publish subscriber numbers for Supernatural, but there are over 110,000 members of Supernatural's Facebook community. Not enough, apparently, to warrant keeping the app going.\n\nIn 2021, Meta spent an estimated $400 million to purchase Within, Supernatural's developer, even battling the FTC to make the deal, and the app was a heavily promoted part of the company's overall \"Metaverse\" strategy.\n\nThe shuttering of Supernatural is part of a larger shift at Meta. This week, the company laid off 1,500 people—about 10% of the staff—from Reality Labs, Meta's hardware and virtual reality division. “We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables. This is part of that effort,” a Meta spokesman told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAlong with cuts at Supernatural, Meta is closing three studios behind some of the most prominent, high-end VR games: Armature, who brought Resident Evil 4 to VR, Sanzaru, the studio behind Asgard’s Wrath, and Twisted Pixel, creators of Deadpool VR.",

But these early signs show it’s important we’ve acted to make this change.”\n\nThe communications minister, Anika Wells, said eSafety would examine the data to see what it shows about the compliance of individual platforms.\n\n“We’ve said from the beginning that we weren’t expecting perfection straight away – but early figures are showing this law is making a real, meaningful difference.”\n\nThe federal opposition, which campaigned for the policy before it was adopted by the government, last week said the ban implementation had “fallen flat”.\n\n“Many under-16 accounts have not been deactivated, while others that were initially removed have since become active again,” the shadow communications minister, Melissa McIntosh, said.\n\n“New accounts are being created and the age-verification tools that the government assured Australians would be effective, have proven laughably easy to bypass with some makeup and good lighting.”\n\nMcIntosh said children who lost access had migrated to other platforms such as Yope and Lemon8, arguing they were not included in the ban.\n\nThe ban requires all platforms to self-assess as to whether the ban should apply to them, and the government indicated it would approach other platforms to seek compliance should teens migrate to those platforms.\n\nSome platforms such as X alternative Bluesky implemented age-assurance despite not being initially named in the list released by the government.\n\nWhile the UK and other countries are considering following Australia’s lead, a new study on Wednesday tracking 11 to 14-year-olds in the UK found no evidence for boys or girls that heavier social media use or more frequent gaming increased teenagers’ symptoms of anxiety or depression.\n\nIt found social media use from year 8 to year 9 and from year 9 to year 10 had no detrimental impact on their mental health the following year.",

    "fullText": "Meta, which operates social media platforms Instagram and Facebook, is rethinking its investments after a group of its products failed to yield profitable results over the past few years.\n\nMeta’s Reality Labs division produces its virtual reality headsets and augmented reality smart glasses, supporting the company's overall metaverse vision. The division has incurred approximately $73 billion in losses since 2021.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2025 alone, Reality Labs faced a loss of $4.43 billion from operations, according to Meta's latest earnings report.\n\nRecent data from market research firm IDC, obtained by The Register, revealed that Meta shipped only 1.7 million Quest virtual reality headsets during the first three quarters of 2025, representing a 16% decline compared to the same period in 2024.\n\n“All of these ideas that AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality) would replace smartphones didn’t happen,” said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for data and analytics at IDC, in a statement to The Register. “It will never happen.”\n\nThe losses come after Meta spent years investing billions of dollars in its metaverse concept (a 3D virtual world where people socialize, shop, play, etc.) amid innovations in virtual reality technology; however, consumer interest in the metaverse has declined in recent years.\n\nAccording to Google Trends data, “metaverse” was a search term that reached its peak between late 2021 and early 2022 and has since declined in popularity.\n\nA survey conducted by YouGov in February last year found that the majority of Americans had not used the metaverse in 2024.\n\nOnly 26% of Americans have used the metaverse in the past 12 months.\n\nApproximately 1 in 10 Americans said that no brand presence would tempt them into the metaverse.\n\nAdditionally, 29% of non-metaverse users said they would be more inclined to join if equipment costs were lower.\n\nAlso, 23% said that more metaverse activities or experiences that interest them would push them to join.\n\nIn comparison, 22% said stronger security and privacy protections could be a deciding factor and 19% would be more interested if they could use the metaverse without a VR headset.\n\nAs Meta faces declining metaverse consumer demand, it has decided to lay off over 1,000 employees in its Reality Labs division, according to a recent report from Bloomberg.\n\nThe division currently has about 15,000 employees, so the layoffs will shrink the team by about 10%. The job cuts come after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company executives began eyeing potential budget cuts as high as 30% for the company’s metaverse business last month.",

    "description": "WINK News weather team member Nikki Sheaks announced her departure on Facebook.",
    "fullText": "(Correction: This story has been updated to correct the name of the company that owns WINK, which is Fort Myers Broadcasting.)\n\nLess than a week after WINK News fired its chief meteorologist, Matt Devitt, another member of the WINK News weather team announced her departure in a social media post on Tuesday (Jan. 13).\n\nMeteorologist Nikki Sheaks posted on Facebook she's leaving WINK News for a meteorologist position with WPBF 25 News in Palm Beach, an ABC affiliate owned by Hearst Television. WINK News is owned by Fort Myers Broadcasting.\n\n\"I am so excited to finally get to announce that I’m coming home to South Florida! I am thrilled to be joining the WPBF 25 News weather team as their newest meteorologist! It’s always been the dream to get home and I am so thankful for the journey that finally got me here! My last show on WINK will be January 25.\"\n\nVote! Florida weatherman Matt Devitt was fired. Who will replace him at WINK?\n\nWith the departure of Sheaks and the firing of Devitt, who announced on his social media on Jan. 9 that he was no longer employed at the Fort Myers CBS affiliate after a decade there, WINK is down to five on its \"weather authority\" team to cover the weather on its platforms.\n\nOn Tuesday (Jan. 13) Devitt went to his social media again to express frustration about not being able to delete his Facebook page associated with WINK News. He said this:\n\n\"They're not allowing me to (Facebook) take my former employer out of my name and \"rejecting\" my request to.\"\n\nMore: Schwartzel denies any role in WINK firing of meteorologist Matt Devitt\n\nHi all. Thanks everyone for the overwhelming support over the past several days, I really appreciate it. Some have asked why I haven't changed my name on @Facebook or been posting updates. They're not allowing me to (Facebook) take my former employer out of my name and…\n\n— Matt Devitt (@MattDevittWX) January 13, 2026\n\nAs of Wednesday morning (Jan. 14) the Devitt-WINK News Facebook page with 1.2 million followers was still active.\n\nAccording to the WINK News website, Sheaks joined WINK News in April 2023. She is a Miami native and Florida International University graduate. Sheets holds dual degrees in Atmospheric Science and Broadcast Journalism. In March 2023, she earned the Certified Broadcast Meteorologist designation from the American Meteorological Society.\n\nBefore joining WINK, Sheaks was a weekday meteorologist in Panama City Beach, covering tornado outbreaks, wildfires, and tropical weather across the Florida Panhandle. Her passion for science reporting also led her to produce in-depth environmental features on issues ranging from recycling to animal rescues. In 2022, she earned finalist recognition from the Florida Association of Broadcast Journalists.\n\nEarlier in her career, Sheaks forecasted live from high-profile events in Colorado, including the Aspen X-Games and the Junior College World Series. She began her broadcast journey behind the scenes as a writer at WSVN in Miami.\n\nPlease support local community journalism and stay informed about Southwest Florida news by subscribing to The News-Press and Naples Daily News; download the free News-Press or Naples Daily News app, and \n\nThis article originally appeared on Fort Myers News-Press: TV station of fired Florida weather man loses another meteorologist",

    "fullText": "Research finds no evidence heavier social media use or more gaming increases symptoms of anxiety or depression\n\nScreen time spent gaming or on social media does not cause mental health problems in teenagers, according to a large-scale study.\n\nWith ministers in the UK considering whether to follow Australia’s example by banning social media use for under-16s, the findings challenge concerns that long periods spent gaming or scrolling TikTok or Instagram are driving an increase in teenagers’ depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions.\n\nResearchers at the University of Manchester followed 25,000 11- to 14-year-olds over three school years, tracking their self-reported social media habits, gaming frequency and emotional difficulties to find out whether technology use genuinely predicted later mental health difficulties.\n\nParticipants were asked how much time on a normal weekday in term time they spent on TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and other social media, or gaming. They were also asked questions about their feelings, mood and wider mental health.\n\nThe study found no evidence for boys or girls that heavier social media use or more frequent gaming increased teenagers’ symptoms of anxiety or depression over the following year.\n\nIncreases in girls’ and boys’ social media use from year 8 to year 9 and from year 9 to year 10 had zero detrimental impact on their mental health the following year, the authors found. More time spent gaming also had a zero negative effect on pupils’ mental health.\n\n“We know families are worried, but our results do not support the idea that simply spending time on social media or gaming leads to mental health problems – the story is far more complex than that,” said the lead author Dr Qiqi Cheng.\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of Public Health, also examined whether how pupils use social media makes a difference, with participants asked how much time spent chatting with others, posting stories, pictures and videos, browsing feeds, profiles or scrolling through photos and stories. The scientists found that actively chatting on social media or passive scrolling feeds did not appear to drive mental health difficulties.\n\nThe authors stressed that the findings did not mean online experiences were harmless. Hurtful messages, online pressures and extreme content could have detrimental effects on wellbeing, but focusing on screen time alone was not helpful, they said.\n\n“Our findings tell us that young people’s choices around social media and gaming may be shaped by how they’re feeling but not necessarily the other way around,” said Prof Neil Humphrey, a co-author. “Rather than blaming technology itself, we need to pay attention to what young people are doing online, who they’re connecting with and how supported they feel in their daily lives.”",

    "fullText": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nOwning a home might be the American dream, but Kevin O'Leary thinks too many people are rushing into a nightmare.\n\nIn a Facebook post shared alongside his Fox Business interview in November, the \"Shark Tank\" investor gave blunt advice to young adults debating whether to rent or buy. When asked outright which path to take, O'Leary didn't hesitate: \"Rent.\"\n\nHis reasoning? \"Start by renting until you start a family and keep it small, 1,500 feet or less if you've got the average salary of $70,000 annually,\" he wrote. \"Once you decide to have a child, you gotta expand a little bit, get that second bedroom and also have an office in the house. Then you buy a home.\"\n\nMissed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs? This Platform Lets Everyday Investors Access Private Tech Early\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nIn the accompanying video, he doubled down, warning buyers not to jump into homeownership unless they plan to stay put for at least five years. \"The issue around a home, if you're gonna buy and go through expenses of buying it, paying all the commissions and all the taxes and everything else, you gotta be there for five years,\" O'Leary said.\n\nThat five-year rule is a common benchmark among financial experts. Closing costs, property taxes, realtor commissions, and interest-heavy mortgage payments make it difficult to build any real equity in the first few years. If you sell too soon, you may walk away with little to nothing—sometimes even a loss.\n\nO'Leary hinted at another reason for the wait: stability. \"There's a good chance you'll be there for five years, assuming the marriage lasts,\" he added dryly, suggesting that homeownership should follow—not precede—big life decisions like starting a family.\n\nTrending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nFor singles or couples still figuring it out, his advice is clear: rent something manageable, don't overextend, and keep your housing budget in line with your income. At a $70,000 salary, even modest homes can stretch affordability—especially with current mortgage rates hovering around 7%.\n\nInstead of viewing renting as \"throwing money away,\" O'Leary frames it as a strategic placeholder. It buys time, flexibility, and lets young adults figure out where they want to live long term, what kind of space they actually need, and whether buying makes sense in their city.",

    "description": "Adrien Friggeri worked at Meta for over 10 years. He shared four strategies to avoid being a low performer across the tech industry.",
    "fullText": "Silicon Valley is raising its standards for talent.\n\nAdrien Friggeri spent over a decade combined at Meta — including back when it was called Facebook — with stints at Michael Bloomberg's Hawkfish and Clubhouse as well. Now, he works as a partner software engineer at Microsoft, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe consequences of underperforming are \"more drastic\" now than they were 10 years ago, Friggeri said on \"The Peterman Pod.\"\n\nIn an email to Business Insider, Friggeri wrote that there is less \"organizational 'slack'\" and higher expectations for tech employees.\n\n\"That means performance gaps are identified and addressed faster, and if someone is not meeting clearly defined expectations over time, the path to a formal performance-management process (and potentially a role change or exit) can be shorter than it used to be,\" Friggeri wrote.\n\nMeta has been especially strict with its performance expectations. The tech giant laid off roughly 3,600 employees in February, labeling them low performers.\n\nThere are also benefits to being above the pack. Meta is introducing higher bonuses for top performers, Business Insider reported on Monday.\n\nIn his email, Friggeri clarified that the trend was not specific to Meta. Rather, it was industry-wide and reflected the state of the market. Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFriggeri shared four tips with Business Insider to stay ahead and avoid underperformance.\n\n1.) Workers should make expectations explicit.\n\n\"Align with your manager on priorities and what 'great' looks like for the next 30/60/90 days,\" Friggeri wrote.\n\n2.) Employees should seek out feedback.\n\nThey shouldn't wait for review cycles, Friggeri wrote. Feedback should be sought out \"early and often.\"\n\n3.) Focus on \"visible, high-leverage work.\"\n\n\"Pick projects tied to clear outcomes and communicate progress, risks, and tradeoffs,\" he wrote.\n\n4.) Keep investing in your skills\n\nFriggeri wrote that employees should \"treat learning as part of the job, especially as teams and priorities shift.\"\n\nOn the podcast, Friggeri advocated for being independent and building new projects — and not being silent about them. It's not helpful to \"lock yourself in a room,\" build for three months, and show up with the finished product.\n\n\"Overcommunicate is really the strategy I would recommend,\" he said.",

    "description": "The company wants to plow more money into its wearable tech.",
    "fullText": "Meta is laying off more than 1,000 workers, signaling a partial retreat from the company’s much-derided metaverse ambitions.\n\nThe layoff, the Bay Area tech industry’s first big job cut of 2026, was announced Tuesday morning in an internal post from Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, according to a Bloomberg report that Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed to SFGATE. The cuts won’t touch Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp; they’re within Meta’s Reality Labs arm, an operation that’s poured investment into the “metaverse” idea and also sells the company’s virtual reality headsets and Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables,” Clayton wrote in an emailed statement. “This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year.”\n\nAs of Tuesday at 9:15 a.m., the Menlo Park company had not filed a WARN document with California officials announcing the local scope of the layoffs.\n\nMeta’s pullback from its metaverse goals has been a long time coming. When Mark Zuckerberg changed his company’s name from Facebook in October 2021, he expounded on the idea of a virtual world where people could work, learn, play and shop together, calling it an “embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it.”\n\nHe wrote, “Feeling truly present with another person is the ultimate dream of social technology.” His ambitions were, like the rhetoric, grand: “Our hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers.”\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBut hype around the idea of a metaverse — at one point, people were buying virtual land on other companies’ versions of the metaverse — quickly faded into derision. Meta was mocked for its legless virtual avatars, and failed to turn its Horizon Worlds metaverse product into a hit.\n\nRather than renewing the company, the ambition instead has served as a drag on Meta’s finances. In 2024, the company reported spending 21% of its costs on the Reality Labs segment, even as it lost more than $17.7 billion in the division. Quarter after quarter, the long-term bet has eaten into Meta’s vast social media ad profits. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the division has turned a $71 billion loss since the start of 2021.\n\nZuckerberg’s choice to move that investment toward Meta’s wearables, rather than the metaverse, is a bet on products that Meta has been actually able to find large audiences for. The company’s Quest headsets are well-reviewed and far, far cheaper than Apple’s Vision Pro offering. Bloomberg reported that Meta is considering doubling its output of its new artificial intelligence-embedded glasses, thanks to high demand.\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAs SFGATE reported, Zuckerberg is imagining a future where anyone not wearing high-tech frames will be at a “cognitive disadvantage.” Moving money from the metaverse toward wearables means he’s swapping one lofty ambition for another.\n\nWork at a Bay Area tech company and want to talk?

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said Nvidia is \"simply the purest play\" for an investor to bet against the AI boom.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says he's betting against Nvidia instead of Meta, Alphabet, or Microsoft because the chipmaker is particularly vulnerable to the AI boom ending in disaster.\n\nNvidia is \"simply the purest play,\" Burry wrote in a Substack post last weekend. The company has become \"entirely dependent on hyperscaler spending, and I do not see how that math works,\" he continued.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing online late last year, added that Nvidia is likely to \"sell $400 billion of its chips this year and there are less than $100 billion in application layer use cases.\"\n\n\"Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,\" Burry wrote. \"So shorting it is cheap.\"\n\nBurry also name-checked CoreWeave, a provider of cloud services built for AI and a strategic partner of Nvidia, calling it the graphics-processor giant's \"pet.\"\n\nNvidia's stock price has surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, making the graphics-chip maker the world's most valuable public company with a $4.5 trillion market capitalization.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBurry said that betting against Meta would mean he was \"also shorting its social media/advertising dominance,\" and placing a wager against Alphabet would mean he was \"shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc.\"\n\nHe added that being short Microsoft would be tantamount to \"shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,\" referring to the company's software-as-a-service tools, including Word and Excel.\n\nThose Big Tech titans aren't \"pure shorts on AI\" and have staying power, Burry wrote.\n\n\"They will realize they should not be spending so much, write off assets, and possibly restate earnings,\" he said. \"But they still are dominant companies globally away from the AI buildout.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Burry said he would short OpenAI if it were a public company. He highlighted the ChatGPT maker's $500 billion valuation in October, which exceeds the market values of Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, and Costco.\n\nBurry said he owns bearish put options on Oracle, and directly shorted the database company in the last six months.\n\n\"I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making,\" he wrote, adding that the company, cofounded by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, is making unnecessary, inexplicable moves and \"ego\" might be the driver.\n\nBurry is famous for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, an episode of his career that was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short.\"\n\nHe wrote on Substack that \"technological obsolescence is on the menu as Nvidia now seems to introduce a new chip solution every year or less.\"\n\nThat echoed a previous post in which he said Nvidia's Big Tech customers were overstating the lifespan of its chips to drag out their depreciation and flatter their short-term profits, raising the prospect of future writedowns.\n\nBurry also warned of trouble ahead, saying he's betting against AI stocks to \"have the exposure on the right side when the music stops.\"\n\nBurry spoke about AI more broadly in his post, drawing a parallel between its rise and the history of electricity.\n\nHe pointed out that building power plants and grids in the late 1980s and early 1990s required \"massive upfront capital outlays,\" technological advances meant equipment such as transformers became quickly outdated and assets rapidly depreciated, and \"cutthroat price warfare\" between suppliers meant many ran into financial difficulties and were forced to merge with rivals.\n\n\"What I see in electrification is very similar to what happened during the 2000 data transmission bubble and what I see happening with the AI bubble,\" he wrote.\n\nBurry said that electricity was as transformative to the modern world as a medicine that enables a patient to walk 10 feet, whereas AI \"might be the anabolic steroid that allows superhuman feats of strength and ability,\" but could ultimately prove \"more dangerous than anything.\"\n\nHe also repeated his caution that if the US tries to win the AI race by going all-in on increasingly power-hungry chips, it will lose as China is ramping up its power-generation capacity much more quickly.\n\n\"I see a big inventory problem in the AI buildout as a result of the current power generation setup,\" Burry said.",

    "fullText": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Monday that the company is launching a new \"top-level\" initiative called Meta Compute, as it pours more money into the data centers and infrastructure powering its AI push.\n\nZuckerberg said Meta plans to build \"tens of gigawatts\" of capacity this decade and \"hundreds of gigawatts or more\" over time.\n\n\"How we engineer, invest, and partner to build this infrastructure will become a strategic advantage,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe move signals that Zuckerberg views AI infrastructure as a key competitive advantage and is placing it under a dedicated unit that reports directly to him. Meta has said it plans to invest $600 billion in US infrastructure and jobs, including AI data centers, by 2028.\n\nThe Department of Energy provides a few handy comparisons for the amount of power in one gigawatt: It's roughly half the output of the Hoover Dam, or the power of 2,627 Tesla Model 3s. Famously, the DeLorean, the iconic time machine in \"Back To The Future Part II,\" needed 1.21 gigawatts to travel through time.\n\nSantosh Janardhan, the company's head of infrastructure, and Daniel Gross, who joined Meta last year from AI startup Safe Superintelligence, will lead the new Meta Compute initiative.\n\nThe two executives will work closely with Dina Powell McCormick, Meta's newly appointed president and vice chairperson, who will focus on partnering with governments and sovereign entities to help build and finance infrastructure. Powell McCormick is a former deputy national security advisor to President Donald Trump and spent 16 years at Goldman Sachs.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Meta's new Checkpoint program restructures worker ratings and incentives, rewarding top performers with up to 300% of their base bonuses.",
    "fullText": "Meta is overhauling how it grades workers and rewarding top performers with up to 300% of their base bonuses, according to internal screenshots of a memo sent to employees on Monday that Business Insider obtained.\n\nThe social media giant is rolling out a new performance program called Checkpoint, which reshapes ratings into four buckets, according to the memo. It will start in \"mid-year 2026,\" aiming to make performance reviews less bureaucratic and more focused on outcomes.\n\n\"The new scale reflects what we know to be true: most people at Meta are high performers who consistently deliver meaningful impact,\" the memo said.\n\nIn particular, Meta said its new system will incentivize the strongest performers with higher bonuses.\n\nHere's how the memo outlines the new distribution and pay multipliers for base bonuses.\n\nAdditionally, Meta says it's introducing a new Meta Award, a 300% individual multiplier for a small number of top performers who deliver \"truly exceptional impact.\"\n\n\"We're evolving our performance program to simplify it and placing greater emphasis on rewarding outstanding performance,\" a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider. \"While our employees have always been held to a high-performance, impact-based culture, this new direction allows for more frequent feedback and recognition in a more efficient way.\"\n\nThe memo says most employees will fall into \"Excellent\" because \"most people at Meta are high-performers who consistently deliver meaningful impact.\"\n\nThe company plans to host a companywide meeting on January 22 to walk employees through the changes and answer questions. The new updates apply to the 2026 performance year and do not affect the current cycle.\n\nMeta pitched the redesign as a time-saver. Managers, the memo says, spend about 80 hours a year on performance-related tasks, while employees collectively spend 330,000 hours per cycle on peer feedback. Yet fewer than 25% of managers say that feedback is helpful, the memo adds.\n\nUnder Checkpoint, Meta will transition to two cycles a year — mid-year and year-end — using the same rating scale in both cycles, with bonuses paid out twice annually. Meta will still deliver equity refresher grants once a year, though they will be based on the average of two performance ratings rather than a single annual rating. Merit increases will happen once a year following the second cycle.\n\nCheckpoint rolled out after Zuckerberg framed 2025 as an \"intense\" year and said Meta would tighten performance management, including cutting about 5% of low performers. In interviews, Meta employees and managers described the result as a tougher, more competitive environment where ratings mattered more than before.\n\nThe new system also streamlines Meta's previous rating system.\n\nEarlier, employees navigated different sets of labels depending on the time of year, including three mid-year buckets (such as \"Exceeds Expectations\" and \"Below Expectations\"), and a more granular year-end ladder that ranged from \"Redefines Expectations\" to \"Does Not Meet Expectations.\"\n\nMeta's latest revamp comes as the company has been tightening performance management in recent years. Meta plans to assess performance by AI-driven impact starting this year, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nLast year, it expanded the number of employees managers are expected to place in the lowest bucket. Meta instructed managers of large teams to rank 15% to 20% of employees as \"below expectations,\" up from 12% to 15% the previous year, after the company had earlier that year cut nearly 4,000 employees it had labeled as low performers, Business Insider reported last May.\n\nOther tech giants, such as Google and Amazon, also revised their performance review systems and pay structures to incentivize top performers. As part of this year's performance review process, Amazon will ask corporate employees to submit three to five \"accomplishments\" that best reflect their work, Business Insider reported.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Meta named Dina Powell McCormick as its president and vice chairman. She previously advised President Donald Trump and worked at Goldman Sachs.",
    "fullText": "Meta has a new president — and she's a former advisor to President Donald Trump.\n\nThe tech giant named Dina Powell McCormick as its president and vice chairman on Monday. Powell McCormick joined Meta's board in April before resigning in December.\n\nBefore joining Meta, Powell McCormick served as a deputy national security advisor to Trump. The president applauded her appointment on Truth Social: \"A great choice by Mark Z!!\"\n\nPowell McCormick is the second former Trump official appointed to a Meta leadership position in 2026. Last week, the company hired C.J. Mahoney, a deputy US trade representative during Trump's first term, as its chief legal officer.\n\nHere are three things to know about Dina Powell McCormick:\n\nPowell McCormick worked as a Trump advisor during his first term, with a focus on the Middle East.\n\nShe had a personal tie to the region. Powell McCormick was born in Cairo, where her father was a captain in the Egyptian army. In 1977, her family moved to Dallas.\n\nDuring her stint with the Trump administration, Powell McCormick oversaw a $200 billion US-Saudi arms deal, spearheaded Trump's Middle East tour, and was considered to take over as Trump's chief of staff or representative to the United Nations.\n\nShe left the Trump administration in 2018.\n\nPowell McCormick also served under President George W. Bush. She started in a personnel role, before rising to senior White House assistant and assistant secretary of state under Condoleezza Rice.\n\nAt the time of her resignation in 2007, Powell McCormick was the highest-ranking Arab American in the Bush administration.\n\nAfter leaving the Bush administration, Powell McCormick went to Goldman Sachs, where she was hired as a managing director.\n\nPowell McCormick shot up in stature, making partner in three years. Her rapid rise sparked some bitterness among Goldman's underclass, according to The New York Times and Vanity Fair.\n\nUnder her leadership, Goldman launched its 10,000 Women program. She also oversaw the 10,000 Small Businesses program and served as the president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation.\n\nPowell McCormick was popular among some of Goldman's biggest names, including Anne Black, the former president of Goldman Sachs Gives and current managing partner at JP Morgan.\n\n\"She was really a steadfast champion for me and others of us on the team, who were all promoted thanks to her,\" Black told Vanity Fair. \"She elevated my game, inspired me to be creative and bold, and expected us to show results.\"\n\nPowell McCormick left Goldman Sachs in 2023.\n\nWhile Powell McCormick no longer works in politics, she's still involved through her husband: Pennsylvania senator Dave McCormick.\n\nThe couple wed in 2019. Soon after, Dave began eyeing a Senate run, and Dina became involved in the campaign. She made trips to Mar-a-Lago with her husband and appeared in several ads.\n\nDave ended up conceding the Republican nomination to Mehmet Oz — also known as television's Dr. Oz — in the 2022 race. Oz lost the general election to John Fetterman and was later appointed by Trump to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nIn 2024, Dave ran again, narrowly winning a Senate seat and beating incumbent Bob Casey. Dina accompanied him to his swearing-in.",

    "description": "No, your Instagram account wasn't hacked.",
    "fullText": "If you received an unsolicited password reset email from Instagram in recent days, you don't need to panic. These messages don't appear to be the result of a new data breach or account compromise, but rather a bug that Meta claims it has now fixed.\n\nFollowing a wave of suspicious account recovery requests, antivirus software provider Malwarebytes posted a warning on Jan. 9 that threat actors had stolen personal information from 17.5 million Instagram accounts. As BleepingComputer reports, there have been various claims that hackers have obtained Instagram account data from multiple API scraping incidents in the last several years but notes that there haven't been any confirmed incidents nor definitive proof of a new breach. Meta has said the issue was the result of a bug that allowed threat actors to request password reset emails, which it has since patched, and denies that user data has actually been compromised.\n\nOf course, data breaches aren't uncommon, and Meta platforms have been targeted in the past. So you should still practice good digital hygiene and stay vigilant to phishing attempts that could indicate account compromise.\n\nIf you do receive an Instagram password reset email that you didn't request, you don't need to do anything with it. You can just ignore and delete the message. In general, you should avoid clicking links in security-related messages that seem urgent or sound scary (again, if you didn't initiate account recovery) as these can be phishing attempts designed to steal your credentials or other sensitive information. If you do want to change a password or update other security details for any account, you should go directly to the website or app and do so there.\n\nIf you haven't already, you can (and should) enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for Instagram. On the mobile app, open the Menu from your profile page and go to Accounts Center > Password and security > Two-factor authentication. You can choose to receive login codes via authentication app (like Google Authenticator or Duo), SMS, or WhatsApp. As I've written, not all 2FA methods are created equal: SMS codes are especially easily phished, so an authentication app is probably your best option here.\n\nFinally, you can check for suspicious devices logged into your Instagram account under Accounts Center > Password and security > Where you're logged in. If you see any devices you don't recognize, select it and tap Log out.",

    "fullText": "TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Richard “Dick” Codey, a former acting governor of New Jersey and the longest serving legislator in the state's history, died Sunday. He was 79.\n\nCodey’s wife, Mary Jo Codey, confirmed her husband’s death to The Associated Press.\n\n“Gov. Richard J. Codey passed away peacefully this morning at home, surrounded by family, after a brief illness,” Codey's family wrote in a Facebook post on Codey's official page.\n\n\"Our family has lost a beloved husband, father and grandfather -- and New Jersey lost a remarkable public servant who touched the lives of all who knew him,\" the family said.\n\nKnown for his feisty, regular-guy persona, Codey was a staunch advocate of mental health awareness and care issues. The Democrat also championed legislation to ban smoking from indoor areas and sought more money for stem cell research.\n\nCodey, the son of a northern New Jersey funeral home owner, entered the state Assembly in 1974 and served there until he was elected to the state Senate in 1982. He served as Senate president from 2002 to 2010.\n\nCodey first served as acting governor for a brief time in 2002, after Christine Todd Whitman’s resignation to join President George W. Bush’s administration. He held the post again for 14 months after Gov. Jim McGreevey resigned in 2004.\n\nAt that time, New Jersey law mandated that the Senate president assume the governor’s role if a vacancy occurred, and that person would serve until the next election.\n\nCodey routinely drew strong praise from residents in polls, and he gave serious consideration to seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2005. But he ultimately chose not to run when party leaders opted to back wealthy Wall Street executive Jon Corzine, who went on to win the office.\n\nCodey would again become acting governor after Corzine was incapacitated in April 2007 due to serious injuries he suffered in a car accident. He held the post for nearly a month before Corzine resumed his duties.\n\nAfter leaving the governor’s office, Codey returned to the Senate and also published a memoir that detailed his decades of public service, along with stories about his personal and family life.\n\n“He lived his life with humility, compassion and a deep sense of responsibility to others,” his family wrote. “He made friends as easily with Presidents as he did with strangers in all-night diners.”\n\nCodey and his wife often spoke candidly about her past struggles with postpartum depression, and that led to controversy in early 2005, when a talk radio host jokingly criticized Mary Jo and her mental health on the air.\n\nCodey, who was at the radio station for something else, confronted the host and said he told him that he wished he could “take him outside.” But the host claimed Codey actually threatened to “take him out,” which Codey denied.\n\nHis wife told The Associated Press that Codey was willing to support her speaking out about postpartum depression, even if it cost him elected office.\n\n“He was a really, really good guy,” Mary Jo Codey said. “He said, ‘If you want to do it, I don’t care if I get elected again.’”\n\nJack Brook contributed reporting from New Orleans.",

    "title": "A man spent $61,000 to transform part of his backyard into a pub he could enjoy with friends and family",
    "description": "Stephen Hutyra was inspired by a Facebook post to build a pub in his backyard. He spent $61,000 and created the space of his dreams.",
    "fullText": "Stephen Hutyra was scrolling Facebook in November 2020 when a post caught his attention.\n\nIt showed a couple in England who'd built a small pub in their backyard. Their design was simple, but inspiring.\n\nThe 42-year-old program analyst, who lives in the small town of West, Texas, immediately started imagining what it'd be like to have his own.\n\n\"We have a saying that everything is bigger and better in Texas,\" he told Business Insider. \"So I wanted our pub to be bigger and better than the one I saw in the picture.\"\n\nHutyra asked his wife if she'd be on board, and as soon as she said yes, he began buying furniture on Facebook Marketplace — despite not having a structure yet.\n\nHe later took out a bank loan, enlisted a contractor, and spent months perfecting his dream space. Now, Hutyra is the proud owner of The Thirsty Goat, a private pub built right in his backyard.\n\nHutyra told Business Insider that he'd joined the Navy right after high school and was first stationed in England. He lived in the seaside town of Newquay, where he'd frequent its various nightlife spots.\n\n\"I fell in love with all the pubs, and walking down the street to hang out with both Navy and local friends I'd made,\" he said. \"I'd really missed that part of my life.\"\n\nSo when he saw a Facebook post about a UK couple building a small pub in their backyard, a lightbulb went off: Hutyra could create his own in his Texas backyard.\n\nFor years, the grassy area had been Hutyra's space to store wood and let the family dogs play.\n\nAs soon as he envisioned a backyard pub, though, he knew the open land was the perfect spot.\n\n\"I almost immediately started making floor plans, buying tables and chairs off Facebook Marketplace, decor off Amazon, and bar items on eBay,\" he said.\n\nHutyra also started to virtually design the future pub. He spent hours on Facebook, Pinterest, and Google, where he found inspiration and added ideas to a PowerPoint presentation.\n\n\"My wife and I were driving back from a vacation in Port Aransas on the Texas coastline, and I said we had to make a pit stop at a bank to sign some loan papers,\" Hutyra said. \"She asked what for, and I said, 'The pub. You gave me your blessing a long time ago.'\"\n\nShe laughed, Hutyra entered the bank, and the couple later left with a $44,320 loan. They also got a permit to build the structure.\n\nA month later, in August 2023, the Hutyras had a contractor on-site who broke ground and began building.\n\nHutyra had never taken on a project of this size, so hiring a contractor was crucial.\n\nHe first paid them $600 to draw actual building construction plans, inspired by the PowerPoint presentation Hutyra had put together.\n\nFrom there, the team helped run vital water and electricity lines, create the pub's concrete base, and craft its shell, framing, and roof. They also added foam insulation.\n\nContractors worked until November 2023, at which point the pub was turned over to Hutyra.\n\nHe got to work with the help of his son and father, who Hutyra described as a master carpenter and overall handyman, to complete the build.\n\nTogether, they installed ceilings, painted walls, stained wood, added shelving, built the pub's bar, and more.\n\n\"I had about three years to plan, so when the time came, I knew where I wanted everything to be,\" Hutyra said. \"I had it planned down to the light switches.\"\n\nWhen you enter the pub, you're greeted by a dark-wood bar with string-light decor and matching stools.\n\nThere are also tables and chairs throughout, televisions above the door, and framed photos around the room.\n\nA chalkboard tells you which drinks are available, and if you visit during the holidays, you'll see glowing Christmas trees.\n\nSimilar to the rest of the bar, the bathroom has dark-wood panelling, framed photo decor, and running water.\n\n\"All the shelving that goes around the top of the pub, I did myself, but the bar was probably the biggest challenge for me,\" Hutyra said. \"I had to make a lot of cuts at different angles, and make sure it was straight and level. It was a lot of work.\"\n\nHutyra has spent 24 years in the Navy and currently serves as a chief petty officer. Naturally, the inspiration behind his pub's name came from his years of service.\n\n\"The goat is kind of like the official mascot for the Navy,\" he said. \"In the earlier days of the service, goats were kept aboard ships to provide fresh meat and milk to the crew. Other livestock didn't fare as well.\"\n\nThe area where the goats were kept was named the Goat Locker, he said, and the phrase has stuck around for more than 200 years. Now, it's the name for the chief's working quarters.\n\nWith that in mind, he named his pub The Thirsty Goat.\n\n\"I've been in the reserves the last 19 years now, and I've traveled the world and seen a lot of different places and things,\" Hutyra said. \"But I've always returned to my hometown. After buying a house here, I've really started to feel that family connection.\"\n\nSo he wanted to feel it in his pub, too. Hutyra has a jar from 1903 that belonged to his great-grandmother, which now sits on his bar as a tip jar. The bar itself also has ties to his ancestors.\n\nAs Hutyra was building his pub, a nearby homestead barn — built and owned by his great-great-great-grandfather around 1880 — was being demolished, so he salvaged some materials.\n\n\"The wood was actually in a remarkable condition,\" Hutyra said. \"I took floorboards from the second-story hayloft, which were under the roof of the barn, so they were out of the rain and weather.\"\n\n\"My father and I brought the wood back to his woodworking shop just across town, a few miles from my childhood home, where he still lives today,\" he added.\n\nTogether, they turned that wood into the top of Hutyra's bar, which is now the focal point of his pub.\n\nHutyra said that he and his wife always dreamed of owning a big house where they could have parties and host friends and family.\n\nNow, their personal pub has become that dream spot.\n\n\"We find ourselves sitting out here in the middle of the week until midnight, or until 2 or 3 a.m. on the weekends with family and friends,\" he said. \"We've thoroughly enjoyed it since finishing back in August, but we're only just starting to see how much we're going to use it.\"",

    "description": "Meta's Manus deal faces a probe from China's regulator. Analysts say it's about sending a message that China's AI talent isn't easy pickings.",
    "fullText": "China has a message for US tech firms: Hands off our AI talent and tech.\n\nThat's what Beijing is signalling by announcing a probe into Meta's acquisition of Manus, analysts told Business Insider.\n\nThe probe, confirmed by China's Ministry of Commerce in a Thursday press conference, will investigate whether the acquisition complies with the country's laws and regulations concerning export controls, according to a statement translated by Google.\n\nManus was launched in China last March by the AI product studio Butterfly Effect and drew global attention after saying it had designed a \"general-purpose\" AI agent that can conduct tasks with limited human supervision. In mid-2025, the startup relocated to Singapore.\n\nIn December, Meta announced that it would acquire Manus and sever its ties with China completely. The deal reportedly exceeds $2 billion. Meta did not respond to a request for comment for this story from Business Insider.\n\nWhile China and the US have long engaged in tit-for-tat regulatory exchanges involving their tech companies, analysts told Business Insider this probe is notable because it appears to be aimed at discouraging so-called \"Singapore washing\" — the process of moving a company from China to Singapore to reduce regulatory scrutiny.\n\nTikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and fast-fashion giant Shein are among those that have shifted their headquarters from China to Singapore.\n\nThe probe is also a means to discourage Chinese AI startups from choosing the US, analysts said.\n\n\"I see Beijing's probe as an effort to prevent the loss of AI technology and talent to foreign acquisition, especially to the US,\" Wendy Chang, a senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, told Business Insider.\n\nMeta said it plans to bring over Manus' top leadership and will continue to run its AI agent platform separately, alongside integrating the technology into Meta's own products.\n\nNvidia, the world's most valuable company, has been the subject of US export controls for years, which limit the sale of its advanced chips to China. The Manus probe shows how the battleground has moved from beyond chips to \"models, agents, talent, and enterprise deployment,\" Murthy Grandhi, a company profiles analyst at research firm GlobalData, told Business Insider.\n\nHanna Dohmen, senior research analyst at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, told Business Insider that while the probe \"isn't entirely surprising,\" the approach regulators are taking is \"more novel\" because it \"appears to focus on the movement of talent and IP.\"\n\nTalent has become a focal point of the AI race, with companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google offering huge pay packages to entice the best and brightest. Last year, Meta invested $14 billion in AI training startup Scale AI, bringing its CEO, Alexandr Wang, over to run the tech giant's AI efforts.\n\nChina's Manus probe could signal that it was policing \"outbound AI technology transfer with greater rigor,\" said Grandhi, adding that it could accelerate the \"bifurcation of AI ecosystems.\"\n\nThe US and China have been taking diverging approaches to AI, with Chinese companies tending to favor AI models that are more open, such as DeepSeek.\n\nIt's not clear how long China's probe will last, should it progress into a full investigation. Other investigations from China's Ministry have taken more than a year.\n\nGrandhi said that in his view, the most likely outcome is that the deal will be approved \"with constraints, rather than an outright block.\"\n\n\"Whatever the outcome may be, this certainly sends a signal to other US or foreign companies that are considering similar acquisitions,\" added Dohmen.",

    "fullText": "Meta Platforms is turning to nuclear power to drive its AI ambitions, and its latest deal with a trio of companies is sending stocks in the sector soaring.\n\nThe tech giant revealed that it signed an agreement with several companies to help supply nuclear power for its data centers, including the massive Prometheus AI supercluster being built in New Albany, Ohio. The one gigawatt facility is expected to come online later this year.\n\nThe three companies that will help power it are Oklo, Vistra Corp, and privately held TerraPower. Both nuclear power stocks surged on news of the Meta deal, sparking momentum for many of their peers as well.\n\nHere are the big moves in the space on Friday:\n\nThis isn't the first nuclear power deal that Meta has inked. Last summer, it announced a similar agreement with Constellation Energy, which saw its shares spike on the news.\n\n\"State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America's position as a global leader in AI,\" said Joel Kaplan, chief of global affairs at Meta. \"Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country's energy infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone.\"\n\nBig tech's support of nuclear energy has risen in recent years as experts have touted the need for alternative sources of power to enable the AI buildout. Oklo is backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, though he stepped down from his position as chairman of its board of directors in August 2025.\n\n\"Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced nuclear powerhouses in Ohio,\" Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte said. \"Today, that vision is becoming a reality through the support of a multi-year effort with Meta.\"",

    "description": "Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth calls key all-hands meeting at Reality Labs as the division faces budget cuts, strategic shifts to AI, and layoffs last year.",
    "fullText": "Meta's Chief Technology Officer and head of Reality Labs, Andrew Bosworth, has called an all-hands meeting for January 14, describing it as the \"most important\" of the year.\n\nBosworth is also strongly recommending that Reality Labs employees attend the division's meeting in person, two Meta employees told Business Insider.\n\nThe emphasis on in-person attendance is unusual for the division, which oversees the company's wearables, virtual and augmented reality initiatives, and a nascent robotics unit, these employees said. Some managers have told employees to \"drop what they're doing\" to attend the all-hands in person, one employee told Business Insider.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the meeting.\n\nWhile the division has seen some success, such as its Ray-Ban smart glasses, Reality Labs has been a costly venture for Meta, incurring losses of more than $70 billion since 2020.\n\nLast year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shifted the company's strategic focus toward AI and away from the metaverse. In 2025, Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI and hired its CEO, Alexandr Wang, as part of the major reset of the company's AI efforts. Meta then embarked on a multibillion-dollar hiring spree, poaching top-tier AI researchers and engineers from rivals such as OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\n\nReality Labs has faced repeated rounds of cuts over the past year. In December, Business Insider reported that Meta was planning budget cuts up to 30% and considering job cuts in Reality Labs.\n\nLast April, Meta laid off employees in Oculus Studios, its in-house gaming division, and the team behind Supernatural, the VR fitness app Meta acquired for over $400 million. Those cuts followed Meta's broader January 2025 layoffs that eliminated nearly 4,000 roles companywide, with at least 560 affecting Reality Labs employees.\n\nIn a memo obtained by Business Insider earlier last year, Bosworth referred to 2025 as \"the most critical\" year in his eight-year tenure at Reality Labs.\n\n\"This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure,\" he wrote.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Nandita Giri is a senior software engineer with experience at Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. She recommends job seekers spend an hour a day learning AI.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nandita Giri, a 32-year-old software engineer at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy journey began with problem-solving and math long before I knew I'd end up in Big Tech.\n\nI studied at the National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, in India. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google often scout talent from this school.\n\nAmazon hired me straight out of college, and I moved to Seattle in 2018. To get the job, there was a logical analysis test, and only a handful of us passed. Then came multiple interviews based on problem-solving. That's how my journey in tech began.\n\nI'm now a senior software engineer at Microsoft, and my AI skills are in high demand.\n\nWhen applying for roles at Amazon, it's not about solving problems as quickly as possible, but solving them optimally. You must carefully consider the issue so that the solution can scale and be easily maintained. Amazon has a set of leadership principles that play a key role in hiring decisions, and understanding these principles is just as important as your coding skills.\n\nOn my own time, I practiced on LeetCode, a platform for coding challenges, because I liked it, not because I was preparing for interviews. Over time, I developed a strong interest in AI.\n\nOnce I arrived at Amazon, I identified tasks and patterns that could be automated and suggested AI-based solutions to management, primarily focusing on internal workflow automation and data-driven decision support systems. That experience shaped my interest in building intelligent tools for enterprise use. Leadership gave me the green light to implement them, and I successfully integrated AI into our team's workflow.\n\nAfter working at Amazon for about four years, a recruiter from Meta contacted me on LinkedIn. I never aimed to work at Meta, but my skills opened up new opportunities. I wanted to work more deeply in applied AI, and Meta offered an opportunity to focus on building intelligent systems with large-scale data and infrastructure. It was a natural next step to grow in the AI space.\n\nI went through the interview process, secured the job, and began working at Meta in 2022.\n\nI was referred internally to Microsoft based on my work at Meta. I decided to move because I wanted to work on enterprise-focused AI products, such as Copilot, which aligns more closely with my long-term interests in building impactful tools for productivity and business transformation. I've been at Microsoft since 2023.\n\nThroughout my career, I've had multiple competitive opportunities. With each role change, my scope of responsibility, impact, and overall compensation increased.\n\nMost of what I know about AI, I taught myself. I spent hours outside work watching YouTube tutorials, reading blogs, and practicing. I started small, creating AI agents for personal tasks, like sending outreach emails. Tasks that used to take me a day or two can now be completed in under an hour.\n\nSeeing those results motivated me to keep learning. What started as a personal side project has now become a central part of my career.\n\nAmazon and Meta both incorporate fast-paced learning, but Meta's codebase is more straightforward. Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all built from a single repository, allowing you to understand the system more quickly.\n\nAmazon's codebase is huge, which makes the first year challenging, but the learning curve is worth it. Microsoft feels different altogether. It's more enterprise-focused, operating at a massive scale.\n\nAI excels at repetitive or static tasks, and our job is to monitor and guide it. Managing AI, I believe, is the future of software engineering.\n\nDemand for AI roles is skyrocketing, while traditional software engineering roles have shrunk over the last five years. Many of my friends who don't work in AI have struggled to land new offers.\n\nI recommend dedicating just one hour a day to learning AI. Within six months, you'll see real progress, and these skills will be critical for the next decade. For beginners, I recommend the following:\n\nIf I were to advise my younger self, I would tell her to focus less on perfection and more on making an impact, to take ownership early, speak up with confidence, and prioritize learning and growth over titles.\n\nLong-term growth comes from solving meaningful problems and maintaining resilience.",

    "description": "AI slop is everywhere — except it's not so sloppy anymore. Just take a look at Instagram or TikTok. A lot of it looks real. That's where you come in.",
    "fullText": "There was a time, not so long ago, when AI-generated content was very easy to spot. It was surreal, ridiculous — like Jesus made out of Shrimp.\n\nWe're in a new time now, and AI slop looks so good, it's hard to tell from the real thing. I've been fooled by it. You probably have, too, even if you don't think you have. For example, this extremely realistic video of Nicolás Maduro doing TikTok dances in prison with Diddy. You know it's AI only because it's improbable, not because the video quality is poor.\n\n2025: “AI will be used to cure cancer”\n\n2026:\n\n pic.twitter.com/u6KbygoLtm\n\nSo in a post-slop world, what comes next? What does our future look like with AI?\n\nOne person who would know something about both is Instagram head Adam Mosseri, who posted a prediction to Threads: He says AI images, text, and videos will get more and more realistic, and it'll become harder to separate them from what's real — including on the platform he oversees.\n\n(That's already happening to some extent: Long are the days when it was easy to spot a \"Shrimp Jesus\"-like AI-generated picture.)\n\nWhat I appreciate about Mosseri's memo is that he seems optimistic about what probably sounds like a bad thing to most people. Admitting his platform will be filled with AI-generated content meant to fool people — for funsies or profit — should, theoretically, be taking an L. But he sees this as a problem that can be solved (on Instagram, at least) at the product level:\n\nHis other point is that people will naturally gravitate toward human-produced content because that's what will become trendy: authentic, less polished, intimate, real.\n\n\"Authenticity is fast becoming a scarce resource, which will in turn drive more demand for creator content, not less,\" he writes. Which is certainly a hopeful message if your job is to run a platform for creator content and you're trying to reassure creators (and advertisers) that they should continue to post authentic content to your platform.\n\nI think he's generally right. The idea that human-created content will become more premium amid a flood of machine-created content seems to be the prevailing wisdom.\n\nAnother optimistic prognostication comes from OpenAI's chief economist, Aaron \"Ronnie\" Chatterji, who told the Financial Times that he believes AI will help free us from mundane household chores.\n\nLook, I love the sound of that as much as anyone, but I'm skeptical. Sure, someone is working on a robot that folds clothes, but it seems like it'll be a long time before that's a real thing for most of us. And it's hard to imagine automation doing the chores I really hate, like scrubbing toilets or sorting through the piles of papers and junk that accumulate on countertops daily. And I am highly, highly skeptical of a robot helping with childcare.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Thompson of Stratechery also seems to fall into the \"humans rock!\" side of things, which I find much more appealing as a human.\n\nHe wrote about a Substack essay that had been going viral among a subset of influential people who care about economics and AI. The essay suggested that once AI and automation make it so that humans no longer have to work, income inequality will actually be far worse.\n\nBut Thompson thinks that even if there's an exponentially bigger gap between the haves and have-nots in the year 2126 (which doesn't sound great on paper), we will still value and prize human labor precisely because it is human. He writes:\n\nI like the sound of this! It's quite self-serving to me, a human who creates something (writing words) that I suppose could be done by AI, but you would probably hate and not want to pay for if it were. And also as a human being who would like to keep the species going for another few generations, I suppose. I like to think this is hope rather than cope.",

    "description": "In late 2024, I deleted Instagram from my phone and only used it on desktop. It made me want to be more offline.",
    "fullText": "A little over a year ago, I started my 2025 resolution early: purging Instagram from my phone.\n\nIf you're a boomer or Gen Xer — someone who didn't grow up uploading multiple albums of each college party onto Facebook — I understand your judgment. Removing Instagram from my phone (while still using my account on my desktop) sounds as dramatic as switching to skim milk.\n\nBut that app was a social lifeline. It was where people announced their engagements, graduations, and pregnancies. It was how I tapped into what my friends (and friends of friends) were up to on a random Tuesday — a breezy conversational springboard. It assured I never fully lost touch with anyone: not with high school classmates, distant family members, or people I vaguely remembered meeting once at a party, long ago.\n\nWhile I'd waste fewer hours scrolling through painstakingly staged influencer weddings and overly simplified political infographics, I'd also miss milestones and inside jokes. Recede too much, and I might lose entire connections.\n\nIn the end, it was the best decision I made last year — arguably, in many years. I became a significantly happier person, and even the annoying parts of being a desktop-only Instagram user felt like perks.\n\nAt first, I'd still compulsively tap into the \"social media\" folder on my phone, expecting to find that sunset-hued camera icon. After about a week, I adjusted to my new reality. Like a treat-deprived lab rat, I picked up my phone less.\n\nWhat I called \"ghost emotions\" were gone. For the decade-plus I've had Instagram on my smartphone, I was used to sleepwalking into the app, seeing an image that vaguely stirred some negative emotion in me (envy, annoyance, exclusion), and carrying the remnants of that feeling into whatever I was doing in the real world.\n\nThis lined up with what researchers have found: that, for some people, social media is linked to higher irritability and declines in mental health. These side effects can outweigh the positives, like staying more connected to friends.\n\nInstagram declined to comment on this story.\n\nWithout the overload of information that didn't add anything to my life — and the nagging pressure to contribute to it — I felt like my brain was freer to enjoy other pursuits. I finished more books (and seemed to better process what I read). I busied my hands with crocheting instead of scrolling. Parties became more fun because I no longer mentally pre-rehearsed the photos I would take or the captions I would write.\n\nThere were some downsides to no longer having the app on my phone.\n\nWhile I generally didn't miss the pressure to post, it was frustrating not to have that option on the desktop version. When someone posted my professional work, all I could do was \"like\" the post and move on instead of resharing it. And if I was tagged in a friend's story and didn't check within 24 hours, I had absolutely no idea what they said.\n\nThe biggest hurdle was remembering birthdays. I'd grown used to depending on friends' story announcements. Now, if I didn't want to look like an ice-cold jerk on everyone's special days, I had to get creative.\n\nSo, I set aside about an hour one day. For birthdays I didn't already have memorized, I combed through every DM on Instagram, scrolling back to when I said \"happy birthday!\" and wrote every date into a Notes document on my phone.\n\nDid I feel slightly unhinged? Yes. But I also know no one's ever been mad about you wishing them a happy birthday (though, perhaps a few in my circle were a little spooked).\n\nI also pushed myself to get over my lifelong fear of reaching out first. If I wanted to feel social without social media, I'd need to be a little more outgoing.\n\nSometimes, this meant writing down reminders to text people when I thought of them, but was too busy at the moment to reach out. Other times, I offered to host the next knitting club or book club, or took the initiative to coordinate group plans when I'd usually wait for someone else to pick up the slack.\n\nThe social isolation I was so worried about never happened. If anything, I felt more social because I was prioritizing in-person interaction.\n\nOnce I got a taste of how freeing being offline could be, I wanted to go a step further.\n\nI hated how often I woke up (or stayed up late) reading the news. My insatiable need to always be in the know left me more scattered and irritable. So, I cut down on that, too. Halfway through the year, I bought a Brick device to block apps like my email or the internet on my phone.\n\nYes, sometimes, there are downsides. I've missed (or been late to) big life updates from less-close friends. I've drifted apart from a few others, with whom I shared mostly a meme-exchanging sort of friendship. While bittersweet, it has also helped me focus on fewer, closer friends than an unmanageably large network.\n\nNow, I spend my mornings journaling, chatting longer with my husband, or actually making it to a workout without rushing out the door. Eventually, I check my Instagram DMs the way I'd peruse my email in the 2010s. I tap a heart, I laugh at a video, and I return to my life.",

    "description": "Big Tech is largely throwing in the towel on big, virtual-reality face computers. But they're trying again with smaller glasses like Meta's Ray-Bans.",
    "fullText": "The tech industry has spent roughly a gazillion dollars trying to convince people to strap face computers on their heads. It hasn't worked.\n\nBut the tech guys haven't given up. Their new pitch: Instead of buying bulky goggles that replace your reality with a computer-generated version of something else, what about some glasses?\n\nYou can see evidence of the switch-up with a couple of recent news stories:\n\nAt first glance, this makes a bunch of sense: People don't wear big heavy stuff on their head unless they have to — like if they're skiing, perhaps. But lots of people wear glasses. So if the tech guys want to sell new tech, they should stop trying to make things people don't wear and focus on the things people already wear.\n\nThe reality is a little more complicated: Shrinking a computer — or even parts of a computer — into something that looks, feels, and weighs like glasses is incredibly hard. The lighter and cheaper you make them, the less they can do — which makes it harder to justify why you'd wear them at all.\n\nSo when Meta says it has been selling a ton of Ray-Ban Display Glasses, which start at $800 a pair, you need to put that in context: The company sold an estimated 15,000 units in the last three months of 2025.\n\nWe are likely to get a much better sense of consumer demand for this stuff in the next couple years, as more competition arrives.\n\nGoogle plans to sell glasses that work much like Meta's this year, though I assume they will be cheaper, since they don't use the \"neural wristband\" Meta includes with its glasses. It is also working on more ambitious glasses with more functionality — seemingly like the \"Orion\" headset Meta showed off in 2024, but has yet to start selling.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has reportedly shifted resources from its Apple Vision Pro so it can make some Meta-style glasses itself. And Meta is plugging away at \"Phoenix\" — a headset that's bigger than its Ray-Bans but still much smaller than the Quest headsets it has been selling for years. Those were supposed to launch in 2026 but have been pushed back to 2027, Business Insider's Jyoti Mann reported this week.",

    "fullText": "My clearest memory from middle school is pacing in my bedroom, phone in hand, repeating the word 'wake' again and again. I was testing a voice app I had written. If I said the phrase just right, the app would respond. If not, I would tweak the code and try again.\n\nI had just learned to code from YouTube. My apps were getting downloads, and I was addicted. I would run home from school, drop my backpack, and open the reviews before starting my homework. It was the first time I saw that code written alone in my bedroom could reach people I would never meet.\n\nAfter studying engineering and business at UC, Berkeley, and spending nearly two years working at Meta, I'm now running Frontdesk, an AI startup that helps businesses automate millions of conversations with AI.\n\nMy early programming projects were playful. I built a text-to-speech app and a speech-to-text app. Then, one of my relatives slipped and fell at home. He was yelling for help, but nobody was home, and his phone was out of reach. If his phone had been able to hear him, it could've brought him help immediately.\n\nIn 2016, I developed Rescuer, a voice app that enabled users to trigger an alarm by shouting a secret phrase, automatically sending their location, photos, and audio to designated emergency contacts.\n\nRescuer earned recognition from political officials and the press. What mattered more was that I learned that code written from my bedroom could help someone. From then on, I began building for real impact.\n\nI started answering questions on coding forums, recording YouTube coding tutorials, and writing for an engineering blog. Over time, my answers on forums like Stack Overflow reached millions of developers, which only deepened my passion for continuous learning.\n\nThere was still one thing I couldn't figure out, no matter how many downloads my apps received. I didn't know how to turn an app into a real business. I didn't understand pricing, customers, or why some products became companies while others remained weekend projects.\n\nAs I was deciding where to attend college, I knew I wanted to learn about the business side.\n\nI chose UC Berkeley's M.E.T. program because I could study both engineering and business. I graduated with an EECS (electrical engineering & computer science) and business degree in three years.\n\nIn 2023, when ChatGPT had its big moment, I asked myself, What if I could just talk to this thing on a real phone line?\n\nOver a weekend, I hacked together one of the first prototypes that connected ChatGPT to a real phone number. I posted a short clip and a tweet, and it got a lot of attention.\n\nThe tech was not ready to be a real product. Latency was bad. Reliability was fragile. The models made strange errors. But that experiment planted a question in my mind that I could not shake: If this ever became good enough, what would it look like to use it to help real businesses?\n\nI shelved my phone experiment to join Meta. It was a dream setup. My team was incredibly supportive, I was learning how to build at a massive scale, and life was good — from the smart colleagues to the famous free food.\n\nI was part of a fintech team where I'd push one line of code, and millions of transactions would be affected. It felt less like a corporation and more like a high-growth startup; I was given incredible ownership from day one and learned \n\nBut I was spending all my time behind the code. The business side, the part I'd learned to love at Berkeley, felt far away. As an engineer at a big company, there was no clear path back to the center.\n\nI wasn't working directly on AI, but I could sense the momentum building. Every few months, the models improved noticeably. My ChatGPT phone hack stopped feeling like a viral stunt and started to feel like a glimpse of the future.\n\nAfter my post went viral in college, hundreds of businesses reached out, asking for a solution. I kept thinking about all those businesses, where a missed call meant a missed customer. I knew there was demand, I knew nobody was serving them, and I knew I wanted to be the one to build it.\n\nLeaving wasn't easy. Meta was comfortable, offering an incredible salary, stock refreshers, and interesting problems. Everyone told me to stay another year, vest more equity, and build more credentials. The rational move was to wait.\n\nI kept asking myself, if I waited, would I regret it? The window felt finite. Every month I stayed was a month these businesses were not being served.\n\nI raised capital, moved to NYC from California, and began building Frontdesk. I'm now the founder and CEO.\n\nFrontdesk is a comprehensive AI operating system that engages with customers across all channels and performs real-world tasks, such as scheduling and follow-ups.\n\nWe work in-person in an office in SoHo. Most people in our office share a similar story to mine; they left Microsoft, Amazon, or Meta, walking away from good salaries and stock options, because they believed this was worth building.\n\nI feel lucky to work with people who push me to be better every day.\n\nMost nights, my work looks the same as it did in middle school. I pace, talk into a phone, and listen for what feels off. The difference is that now, when it works, it works across millions of calls. It's the same instinct that led me to build Rescuer years ago.\n\nThe phones are still ringing, and the models are still getting better. I know where I want to be while that happens: close to the code and building something worth leaving comfort behind.\n\nDid you quit a Big Tech job to build your own company?

    "description": "Molly Graham, former Facebook and Google executive, shares how a risky career move and embracing a J-shaped career path grew her expertise.",
    "fullText": "At 25 years old, Molly Graham was thriving in Facebook's HR department when a senior executive urged her to transfer out of her stable role and help build a mobile phone instead.\n\nShe took the risk — and it could have derailed her career.\n\nBut Graham, who later became a C-suite executive at some of America's biggest companies and philanthropies, now views that risky bet as one of the most important moves she ever made.\n\n\"It just felt like falling off a cliff,\" Graham, now the founder of Glue Club, said in a recent interview on Lenny Rachitsky's podcast. \"Taking risks, accepting the terrible fall and that experience of falling has been more than worth it.\"\n\nGraham described the experience as part of what she calls the \"J-curve\" — a career trajectory where a risky move leads to an initial drop before eventually producing outsized gains. Visually, she describes it as standing on a ledge, stepping off, sinking briefly, and then rising far higher than where you started — just like the shape of the letter J.\n\nThe concept, which she has also written about in her Lessons Substack, challenges the idea of a steady career ladder that steadily moves up and to the right.\n\nInstead of climbing rung by rung with promotions every two to five years, Graham argues that some of the most valuable professional growth comes from jumping into roles you aren't ready for and surviving any setbacks.\n\nGraham's own J-curve began when billionaire investor and \"All-in\" podcast host Chamath Palihapitiya, then Facebook's vice president of growth, recruited her to help develop a smartphone, encouraging her to make the move by sketching out the J-shaped trajectory on a whiteboard.\n\nHe brought her on despite her having no experience in product development, dropping her into rooms filled with engineers and phone specialists with deep subject matter expertise. She recalled feeling like an \"idiot\" for much of her first six months.\n\nAt her midyear review, Palihapitiya delivered what Graham called the worst performance evaluation she had ever received. But the new experience eventually expanded her expertise.\n\n\"Slowly, I remember I had been doing all these trips to Taiwan because we were actually working on hardware and I, at some point, came back from Taiwan and I like drew on a whiteboard for him the layout of a mobile phone, trying to explain to him kind of like why something he wanted to do was not possible,\" Graham said. \"And I so vividly remember walking out of that meeting being like, 'Oh like I actually know things.' And slowly then over the following three years I became an expert in mobile.\"\n\nPalihapitiya did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\n\"The phone itself was a giant failure — a massive, costly failure for Facebook,\" Graham told Rachitsky on the podcast. \"But it was not a failure for me.\"\n\nShe credits the experience with teaching her that she could operate far outside her comfort zone — a lesson that later helped her take on senior leadership roles, including serving as COO of Quip, which Salesforce acquired for $750 million, and overseeing operations at the $7.4 billion Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\n\nThe J-curve, Graham said, is especially common at fast-moving companies like Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, and SpaceX, where leaders value employees who are willing to take big risks early and learn quickly. In those environments, proving adaptability can matter more than checking every qualification box.\n\nNot everyone supported Graham's decision at the time. She said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, then the number two at the tech giant, advised against the move — as did her father.\n\n\"When wiser, more experienced people questioned the job offer, it definitely made me pause,\" Graham told Business Insider in a follow-up email. \"But my gut felt really strongly that I needed to take the risk.\"\n\nThat instinct, she said, ultimately helped her discover what kind of work she didn't want to do, and where her strengths lay. She didn't want to sift through mock ups of hardware design and argue about a button's placement. Instead, she sharpened her management skills and prepared to help lead large organizations.\n\n\"The much more fun careers are like jumping off cliffs,\" Graham told Rachitsky. \"They can take you to places that you never could have imagined.\"",

During her tenure, the company secured a major win against the Federal Trade Commission when a federal judge rejected the agency's attempt to force Meta to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nMahoney's appointment comes as Meta continues to navigate intensifying regulatory pressure worldwide, including debates over artificial intelligence, social media governance, and data protection.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Yasmin Santos left Meta to start Altar Native, an herbal alcohol alternative. Her products are taking off among sober-curious and stressed execs.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yasmin Santos, a former Meta ad specialist and the founder of the herbal alcohol alternative brand Altar Native. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I stopped drinking in 2018, it was for my health, not my career. It turned out to be great for both.\n\nI gave up alcohol to heal a gut issue, thinking it would just be temporary. But when I was finally healthy enough to drink again, I realized something had shifted. My body no longer wanted it. The buzz wasn't fun; it just felt wrong.\n\nStill, I missed the ritual. I missed the ease alcohol could bring in social settings. At the same time, I was caring for my mother, who was bedridden with early-onset dementia. I could see how much pain she was in, and how the pharmaceuticals she relied on often did more harm than good. I prayed for another way and felt a clear answer: \"The plants are there for you.\"\n\nThat's when I discovered herbalism — and the vast world of plants that humans have used for thousands of years to support their well-being. I learned about kava, CBD, kratom, and damiana — each with different properties that our ancestors used to calm, energize, or restore balance. It was like opening a door into a forgotten world of natural solutions.\n\nI'd bring little dropper bottles to social gatherings, letting friends try my blends. The response was overwhelming. People wanted to know where they could buy them. That was in 2021, and the spark became my company, Altar Native.\n\nThrough 2022, I refined the branding and recipes, and by January 2024, we were officially launched. I started small, still freelancing in marketing to fund the business, and using an $11,000 inheritance from my mom as seed money.\n\nBefore I started selling the tinctures themselves, I'd tested the idea with a \"cater bar\" — a mobile alcohol-free bar I could take to festivals and private events. It helped me prove the concept and reach my first customers. Between the events and tincture sales, I've had a 115% growth rate in the year since, and I'm projecting that I'll reach months with six-figure sales in the next few years.\n\nWhat has surprised me most is our customer base. I thought my audience would be \"wellness girlies\" who are into yoga and Pilates. But our biggest fans turned out to be van lifers, surfers, climbers, and outdoor adventurers; the sort of people who want to connect deeply to nature and stay clear-headed doing it.\n\nOur second demographic emerged unexpectedly: professional men, aged 40 to 55, often high-level business professionals. They order our \"Adapt\" blend, which helps regulate cortisol and balance energy.\n\nThey don't want alcohol, but they still want something to take the edge off — and since I come from the same corporate background, I get it, and I know exactly how to create what they're looking for.\n\nWe're riding a wave. Since the pandemic, people have woken up to the reality that how they care for their bodies defines their quality of life. They're drinking less, questioning what they put in their systems, and searching for alternatives that help them feel good without dulling their senses.\n\nThat's where I see Altar Native: at the intersection of wellness and ritual, bridging ancient plant wisdom with modern life. I call it \"herbal mixology\": the art of crafting functional, plant-based blends that elevate your mood and state of mind, without the use of alcohol.\n\nOur tinctures can be mixed into mocktails, added to tea or sparkling water, or taken straight on the tongue. My personal routine includes our \"Ecstatic\" blend in the morning with cacao instead of coffee to keep me focused without the afternoon crash.

    "description": "Tired of Instagram and TikTok? My favorite alternatives include photo-sharing app Retro and social music platform Airbuds.",
    "fullText": "Dating apps, AI social networks, drama-clad \"tea\" apps — you name it, I've downloaded it.\n\nIn 2025, I tested out dozens of apps on my phone while reporting on social media for Business Insider.\n\nLike many other internet dwellers, a majority of my time was spent on apps like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.\n\nWhile some of the biggest splashes on the app charts were AI apps like OpenAI's Sora or Meta's stand-alone AI app — and I tested out both — these felt more like blips in the fast-churning digital trend cycle.\n\nInstead, I found myself frequently opening a small handful of apps that feel like an escape from the social media feeds of endless content and AI slop.\n\nHere are the apps I'm using, revisiting, and keeping an eye on as 2026 begins.\n\nMy go-to social media platform may not be on your radar, but it should be.\n\nRetro, a photo-sharing app that's focused on smaller-scale sharing for friends and family, remains one of my most-used apps since I first downloaded it in 2023. Founded by former Instagram employees, the app is where I now post my photo dumps to a small circle of about 15 friends. It recently launched a feature that lets you rewind through your old photos every week, making a supercut of memories.\n\nTwo other alternative social media apps I've been returning to are PI.FYI and Airbuds. PI.FYI, a social network from the popular culture newsletter Perfectly Imperfect, has become a tool for me to find new music, movies, and recommendations for just about anything. Meanwhile, Airbuds, a social app that shows you what music your friends are listening to, is where I turn when I'm on the hunt for new things to listen to.\n\nIf I'm making plans with friends, I'm opening Corner. The social map app has been around for a few years now, but relaunched this year with new AI-powered search tools designed with Gen Z in mind to help find nearby restaurants, bars, or shops.\n\nOne legacy social media platform that returned to my thumb-clicking rotation is Pinterest. The mood-boarding platform has undergone many changes since its new CEO, Bill Ready, took over in 2022. Search and shopping features now dominate the app, which, for me, is exactly what I come there for. I'm opening Pinterest when I am brainstorming what to wear or how to decorate a room in my apartment. Often, I'm saving things that I may want to buy later on.\n\nPinterest isn't entirely an escape from AI, however. A lot of its tools use AI, and the platform has rolled out features that attempt to give users more control over how much AI-generated content they see on the app.\n\nDanger Testing, a project by Carlos Mayers and Marc Mueller, has minted a handful of apps in the last year and describes itself as \"dropping apps like songs.\"\n\nOne app was essentially a virtual Labubu, while another let you digitally vandalize a Friend AI poster. A recent release, called \"My Brainrot,\" turns any video on your phone into a TikTok-style meme with an automated caption.\n\nIn the era of vibe coding, the apps coming from Danger Testing remind me of the silliness of early mobile apps, like the good old iBeer — just made more swiftly and with a pinch of irony for the chronically online.\n\nThere are a lot of apps I'll be trying out this year, and I'm sure a bunch of those will be even more dating apps touting AI as the solution for finding love. Otherwise, I'm still on the hunt for the next social network that'll stick, tools that help people get offline and into the real world, or creative ways to use AI.",

    "fullText": "AI pioneer Yann LeCun isn't sold on Mark Zuckerberg's $14 billion bet on Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old Scale AI cofounder recruited to lead Meta's Superintelligence Labs.\n\nIn a new interview with the Financial Times, LeCun, who was Meta's chief AI scientist before announcing in November that he was leaving to form his own startup, said Wang was \"inexperienced\" and didn't fully understand AI researchers.\n\n\"He learns fast, he knows what he doesn't know . . . There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher,\" LeCun said.\n\nWang was the crown jewel of Zuckerberg's aggressive moves in the AI talent war. Meta made a $14 billion investment in Scale AI, which included hiring Wang from the buzzy startup.\n\nLeCun said that Zuckerberg grew frustrated after disappointing progress on Llama, the company's flagship, open-sourced AI model.\n\nIn the interview, LeCun said that the AI team \"fudged\" some of the results of Llama 4. At the time, Meta was criticized for potentially gaming the results of benchmark tests. LeCun said the episode soured Zuckerberg on Meta's existing AI team.\n\n\"Mark was really upset and basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved in this,\" he told FT. \"And so basically sidelined the entire GenAI organisation.\"\n\nAs for his relationship with Wang, LeCun said that even though the 28-year-old was briefly his boss after Zuckerberg's AI reorg, he wasn't really directing him.\n\n\"You don't tell a researcher what to do,\" LeCun told the publication. \"You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do.\"\n\nLeCun said Zuckerberg remained supportive of his views on the future of AI, but that the Meta CEO's larger hires are focused on large language model development.\n\n\"I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence,\" LeCun said. \"But I'm not gonna change my mind because some dude thinks I'm wrong. I'm not wrong. My integrity as a scientist cannot allow me to do this.\"\n\nLeCun has repeatedly argued that LLMs are too limited and that to unlock the true power of AI, a different approach is needed. It's why his startup is reportedly called Advanced Machine Intelligence, the very approach he has argued is better suited than LLMs.\n\nHe will serve as executive chair, not as CEO, of the new company.\n\n\"I'm a scientist, a visionary. I can inspire people to work on interesting things. I'm pretty good at guessing what type of technology will work or not. But I can't be a CEO,\" LeCun said. \"I'm both too disorganised for this, and also too old!\"",

    "fullText": "Instagram's top executive thinks AI has made the social media site's carefully curated grid a thing of the past.\n\nIn an end-of-year message posted on Threads, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that the platform would have to evolve to cope with a coming flood of AI-generated content — and warned that the rise of AI had killed off Instagram's polished aesthetic.\n\n\"Unless you're under 25 and use Instagram, you probably think of the app as a feed of square photos. The aesthetic is polished: lots of make up, skin smoothing, high contrast photography, beautiful landscapes,\" wrote Mosseri on Wednesday.\n\n\"That feed is dead. People largely stopped sharing personal moments to feed years ago,\" the Meta executive said, adding that users now kept friends updated on their personal lives through unpolished \"shoe shots and unflattering candids\" shared via direct messages.\n\nMosseri said the growing ubiquity of AI images meant creators would have to embrace this trend, and shy away from curated grids and professional-style photography in favor of a \"more raw aesthetic.\"\n\n\"Flattering imagery is cheap to produce and boring to consume. People want content that feels real,\" he wrote, adding that social media feeds are starting to fill up with \"synthetic everything.\"\n\nSocial media platforms like Instagram are grappling with a flood of AI-generated content, with tools like Midjourney and Sora making it easy to produce images and videos of almost anything.\n\nAt the same time, Meta has raced to integrate AI tools into Instagram and Facebook. Instagram rolled out an AI studio last year that lets users create custom chatbots, including digital versions of themselves, and has previously experimented with AI Instagram influencers based on real celebrities.\n\nMosseri said social platforms will get worse at identifying AI-generated media over time as the technology improves, adding that one solution could be for camera companies to cryptographically sign photos when they are taken to prove they are real.\n\nThe former Facebook executive said Instagram needed to label AI-generated content clearly, provide more transparency about who is posting on the platform, and build better creative controls so human users could compete with content made entirely by AI.\n\n\"For most of my life I could safely assume that the vast majority of photographs or videos that I see are largely accurate captures of moments that happened in real life. This is clearly no longer the case,\" Mosseri wrote.",

    "description": "Adam Mosseri offered a notably candid assessment on how AI is upending Instagram.",
    "fullText": "It's no secret that AI-generated content took over our social media feeds in 2025. Now, Instagram's top exec Adam Mosseri has made it clear that he expects AI content to overtake non-AI imagery and the significant implications that shift has for its creators and photographers.\n\nMosseri shared the thoughts in a lengthy post about the broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. And he offered a notably candid assessment on how AI is upending the platform. \"Everything that made creators matter—the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked—is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,\" he wrote. \"The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.\"\n\nBut Mosseri doesn't seem particularly concerned by this shift. He says that there is \"a lot of amazing AI content\" and that the platform may need to rethink its approach to labeling such imagery by \"fingerprinting real media, not just chasing fake.\"\n\nSocial media platforms are going to come under increasing pressure to identify and label AI-generated content as such. All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality. There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media. Camera manufacturers could cryptographically sign images at capture, creating a chain of custody.\n\nOn some level, it's easy to understand how this seems like a more practical approach for Meta. As we've previously reported, technologies that are meant to identify AI content, like watermarks, have proved unreliable at best. They are easy to remove and even easier to ignore altogether. Meta's own labels are far from clear and the company, which has spent tens of billions of dollars on AI this year alone, has admitted it can't reliably detect AI-generated or manipulated content on its platform.\n\nThat Mosseri is so readily admitting defeat on this issue, though, is telling. AI slop has won. And when it comes to helping Instagram's 3 billion users understand what is real, that should largely be someone else's problem, not Meta's. Camera makers — presumably phone makers and actual camera manufacturers — should come up with their own system that sure sounds a lot like watermarking to \"to verify authenticity at capture.\" Mosseri offers few details about how this would work or be implemented at the scale required to make it feasible.\n\nMosseri also doesn't really address the fact that this is likely to alienate the many photographers and other Instagram creators who have already grown frustrated with the app. The exec regularly fields complaints from the group who want to know why Instagram's algorithm doesn't consistently surface their posts to their on followers.\n\nBut Mosseri suggests those complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of \"polished\" square images, he says, \"is dead.\" Camera companies, in his estimation, are \"are betting on the wrong aesthetic\" by trying to \"make everyone look like a professional photographer from the past.\" Instead, he says that more \"raw\" and \"unflattering\" images will be how creators can prove they are real, and not AI. In a world where Instagram has more AI content than not, creators should prioritize images and videos that intentionally make them look bad.",

    "fullText": "Meta was cofounded by a college dropout — and so was its latest acquisition.\n\nJi Yichao, the cofounder and chief scientist of Manus, the AI startup snapped up by Meta, shared two pictures on X: one of his younger self behind a laptop, and another of a young Mark Zuckerberg, seemingly in the same room, also working at a laptop.\n\nBoth pictures appear to have been taken at the so-called \"Facebook House\" in Palo Alto, California, a five-bed home where Zuckerberg worked on Facebook after famously dropping out of Harvard University in 2004. The house was later rented by budding entrepreneurs and business students.\n\n\"21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge,\" Ji wrote in the Monday X post.\n\nThe 32-year-old Ji was the public face of Manus for its launch in March, introducing its \"general-purpose\" AI agent designed to carry out tasks autonomously. Meta announced its acquisition of Manus on Monday, which the Wall Street Journal reported exceeded $2 billion.\n\nAccording to reports in Chinese media, Ji started a computer science degree at the Beijing Information Science and Technology University (BISTU) in 2010, but later dropped out to focus on entrepreneurship. He returned to BISTU in 2015 and graduated in 2018, according to a blog from the university. Manus did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.\n\nZuckerberg and Ji have plenty of company. Meta's other big AI acquisition this year, Scale AI, was founded by another college dropout — Alexandr Wang. Microsoft cofounders Bill Gates and Paul Allen dropped out of college, along with Apple CEO Steve Jobs, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and many more.\n\n21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge. https://t.co/NpnNkqhuso pic.twitter.com/s6v7kDsq1y\n\nJi's post comes as college degrees are under renewed scrutiny. Gen Z in particular has been questioning whether a degree is worth the debt, while others are wondering if college can future-proof their career prospects in a job market being shaken up by AI.\n\nFei-Fei Li, a Stanford professor known as the \"Godmother of AI,\" said earlier this month that a college degree matters less now when her company hires software engineers.\n\nHowever, data published by the New York Federal Reserve in April suggested that a college degree can still pay off in the long run — provided students pick the right degree.\n\nManus was launched in March by the Chinese AI product studio Butterfly Effect. The startup relocated to Singapore in mid-2025 and said it has surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue. Meta said it would continue to offer Manus' subscription as a separate business while integrating the startup's technology into its own platforms.",

    "description": "Alexandr Wang says Neuralink and other brain-computer interfaces will help kids learn in \"crazy ways.\"",
    "fullText": "It's no surprise that wunderkinds want their children to be wunderkinds, too.\n\nAsAlexandr Wang, the 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, takes on a new role at Meta leading its superintelligence initiatives, he's also thinking about how to integrate superintelligence into the next generation.\n\nAnd that means he's not having kids anytime soon.\n\nOn the Shawn Ryan Show on Thursday, Wang said he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink or other brain-computer interfaces are available.\n\nNeuralink, one of Elon Musk's most futuristic endeavors, is developing coin-sized microchips that can be embedded into human brains. These chips will not only be able to record brain activity, but also stimulate it.\n\nStill in clinical trials, Neuralink has so far been embedded in seven patients. One of those patients, Brad Smith, who has ALS, said he was able to edit a video using his Neuralink brain chip.\n\nWhile Neuralink has received a ton of buzz, it's not the only one developing these interfaces. Synchron, backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, is already working with Apple to help those with disabilities, like ALS patients, use their iPhones. Motif Neurotech is developing a neurostimulator system that works like a pacemaker for the brain and is now used for treating severe depression.\n\nWang also believes these devices will have profound implications for child development. \"In your first like seven years of life, your brain is more neuroplastic than at any other point in your life,\" he said. \"When we get Neuralink and we get these other technologies, kids who are born with them are gonna learn how to use them in like crazy, crazy ways.\"\n\nNeuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt and change — whether that means rewiring its structure, shifting how it functions, or forming new connections — in response to things happening inside us or around us.\n\nIt's often enhanced in children because the \"organization of networks of neuronal synapses as well as white matter pathways remain 'under construction' well into adolescence and even later,\" according to a 2009 article published in the peer-reviewed journal Brain and Development. This is why children are also able to learn new skills quickly and recover from injuries faster.\n\nHowever, machines aren't the \"obvious answer\" to enhancing neuroplasticity, Dr. Matthew MacDougall, the head surgeon at Neuralink, told neuroscientist Andrew Huberman on his podcast in April. Even with implanted electrodes and computers, \"It's hard to know which area of the brain would be most potent as a stimulation target for an electrode to broadly juice plasticity,\" he said. Pharmacologic agents, including drugs like LSD and Psilocybin, which can impact the whole brain, are the most promising area of plasticity research, he added.\n\n\"I think with plasticity, you're talking, in general, you're talking about the entire brain. You're talking about altering a trillion synapses all in a similar way,\" he said. \"You're never going to get that broad targetability with any electrodes that I can see coming in our lifetimes.\"",

Although Apple didn't share details of what's to come in 2026, some commenters shared what they want to see and speculated on what could be coming.\n\nSome Instagram users commented asking Apple to make small updates, such as reducing the music in workout videos or adding the ability to skip back and forth between workouts. Others asked for more programs to choose from.\n\nApple Fitness+ is a subscription-based digital fitness platform that includes instructor-led classes, on-demand workout videos, and health and fitness metrics. It competes with similar offerings from companies like Peloton. Apple Fitness+ launched in 2020, and Apple expanded it into 28 new markets in December. It costs $9.99 a month or $79.99 annually in the US.\n\nAlthough Apple doesn't report how many users pay for Apple Fitness+, its Services division, which includes those subscribers, hit an all-time high in revenue during its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nApple has also teased other major product reveals coming in 2026, including an upgrade to its virtual assistant Siri.\n\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Meta is buying Manus for over $2 billion. Here's what the AI agent does, who built it, and why the deal matters.",
    "fullText": "Manus is back in the spotlight.\n\nThe Chinese-founded artificial intelligence startup is being acquired by Meta in a deal reported to be worth more than $2 billion — one of the most high-profile instances of a US tech giant buying an Asian AI company.\n\nManus grabbed headlines in March when it unveiled an AI agent designed to autonomously execute tasks like résumé screening and stock analysis.\n\nThe startup was founded in China and moved its headquarters to Singapore in mid-2025.\n\nLaunched in March by the Chinese AI product studio Butterfly Effect, Manus has been pitched by its creators as the world's first \"general\" AI agent — a system designed to carry out tasks independently.\n\nSince its launch, the startup has continued to expand what the agent can do, rolling out features that allow users to use Manus for design work, slide creation, and completing tasks directly through a web browser.\n\nManus can independently execute complex tasks, such as market research, coding, and data analysis, Meta said when it announced the acquisition on Monday.\n\nBusiness Insider tested the tool in its early stages in March and found it ambitious but uneven in execution, including instances where it hallucinated data.\n\nEarlier this month, Manus said it had surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, with its total revenue run rate — including usage-based fees and other income streams — exceeding $125 million.\n\nThe company in April raised $75 million in funding led by Benchmark, at a valuation of about $500 million, Bloomberg reported. Manus said in an update this month that it now employs about 105 people across Singapore, Tokyo, and San Francisco, and plans to open a Paris office soon.\n\nManus was founded by Xiao Hong, a Chinese entrepreneur and software engineer who is also the CEO of Butterfly Effect.\n\nKnown as \"Red\" in China's tech circles, Xiao was born in 1992 and studied software engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in central China.\n\nAfter graduating, Xiao founded Nightingale Technology in 2015, where he developed enterprise productivity tools, including the Yi Ban assistant for WeChat, which gained millions of users in China.\n\nIn 2022, he launched Butterfly Effect and rolled out Monica, an AI-powered browser extension that aggregates multiple large language models. Following the acquisition, Xiao will take on a vice president role at Meta.\n\nXiao was joined at Manus by co-founder Ji Yichao, also known as \"Peak Ji,\" who was chief scientist at Butterfly Effect. Ji leads technical and infrastructure development at Manus.\n\nThe 32-year-old Ji was the public face of Manus at launch, introducing the AI agent in its debut video in March. Ji has a long track record of building consumer technology products, and was named to MIT Technology Review's Innovators Under 35 list this year.\n\nThe founding team also includes Zhang Tao, who leads product at Manus. He was head of global product at ByteDance from 2022 to 2023 and has held multiple product roles, including serving as a product manager at Tencent, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nMeta said the acquisition is part of its effort to scale general-purpose AI agents across its apps and services.\n\nThe company said in its announcement on Monday that it plans to keep Manus running as a stand-alone product while integrating its technology into Meta's wider AI offerings.\n\nManus said the deal would not be disruptive for its customers and that it would continue to sell and operate its subscription service. The company will also continue to operate from Singapore.\n\n\"Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,\" said Xiao.\n\nBuying Manus could give Meta an AI revenue boost and give it a distribution advantage, Business Insider's Hugh Langley wrote.\n\nManus's links to China have drawn scrutiny.\n\nIn May, Sen. John Cornyn questioned US investment in Manus in a post on X. He asked whether American capital should back AI companies with ties to China as competition with Beijing intensifies.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider on Tuesday, a Meta spokesperson said the deal would fully sever Manus's remaining ties to China.\n\n\"There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,\" the spokesperson told Business Insider. This includes shutting down the AI assistant, Monica, and relocating relevant employees.\n\nManus employees who join Meta will not have access to customer data, and Meta will continue to geo-block access to its AI models, the spokesperson added.",

    "description": "Meta is seen as lagging  behind OpenAI and Google in the AI race. Its acquisition of Singapore-based AI startup Manus could help with that.",
    "fullText": "AI dealmaking isn't slowing down — and it's Meta's turn again.\n\nThe social media giant is buying Manus, a Singapore-based artificial intelligence startup, the companies announced on Monday.\n\nManus went viral in March when it previewed an AI agent that could autonomously perform tasks like screening résumés and stock analysis. Manus was created in China but relocated to Singapore in mid-2025. Meta paid more than $2 billion for Manus, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe deal is the latest in a flurry of red-hot AI investment and acquisitions this year, which includes Meta's $14 billion investment in Scale AI in June. From providing an instant AI revenue source to giving it a leg up in AI agents, here's why buying Manus could give Meta a much-needed boost in the AI race.\n\nManus said in December that it had processed more than 147 trillion tokens of text and said its users were in the \"millions.\" It also claimed to have crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, achieving both milestones eight months after launch.\n\nThose numbers tell us Meta is getting a startup with a built-in audience of paying users. Meta's business model to date has largely revolved around building free products and making money from collecting user data and targeted advertising. Manus offers a free tier for basic tasks, but charges users up to $200 a month for its pro tier.\n\n\"The purchase gives Meta a functioning business with paying customers, meaningful revenue and infrastructure already proven at scale,\" said Murthy Grandhi, company profiles analyst at research firm GlobalData, in a note.\n\nIn its announcement, Meta said it plans to continue selling the Manus service separately while also integrating Manus's technology into its existing platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta did not elaborate on which ones or how it might do so. Meta has poured billions into building up its internal AI teams and developing what is termed \"superintelligence,\" with so far little in terms of returns. Manus could be a way for Meta to start making money directly from AI while it continues to build out its internal efforts.\n\nMeta has struggled to wow consumers and developers as much as OpenAI and Google when it comes to raw model power. However, as these models become increasingly commoditized, there is a growing need to show AI can actually be useful. One such way is AI agents, a type of software that can proactively make decisions and take actions, such as creating a marketing campaign or monitoring and fixing bugs in apps.\n\nBuying Manus could prove a smart bet on the idea that the real value will lie in the programs that sit on top of the models. Manus primarily uses other companies' AI models, like Anthropic's Claude, as building blocks and layers its own software on top.\n\n\"People keep assuming a small update from OpenAI or Google will wipe out a lot of AI startups,\" wrote Yuchen Jin, CEO of the AI startup Hyperbolic, in an X post about Meta's Manus deal. \"But in reality, the AI application layer should be where most of the opportunity is.\"\n\nA Meta spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about which models Manus would support following the acquisition.\n\nOne of Meta's strengths is that its platforms are used by billions of people, which, like Google, gives it a distribution advantage. Its challenge is to find ways to keep them coming back.\n\nUnlike Google with Gemini 3, Meta has yet to have a buzzy AI breakthrough moment with its own in-house models. Combining Manus's \"general-purpose agents\" with Meta's distribution channels gives the social media company another shot at that, particularly as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged that Facebook has shifted from being a place for friends to view each other's content to a \"broad discovery and entertainment space.\"\n\n\"Manus offers a ready-made, high-margin software layer that can be sold directly and integrated across Meta's consumer and enterprise products,\" said GlobalData's Grandhi.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: CST highlights volume of IS-supporting accounts and says social media firms ‘putting all of us in danger’\n\nFacebook hosted terrorist propaganda that celebrated the murder of Jews and praised Islamic State, a leading anti-hate group has alleged.\n\nThe posts included celebrations of the Bondi beach massacre that the Community Security Trust says Facebook has been too slow to take down. The posts were still on Facebook on 16 December, two days after the attack, and received shares and likes.\n\nSome accounts are Britain-based and those have been reported to counter-terrorism police in the UK as a matter of urgency.\n\nOne post shows video of the aftermath of the Bondi beach attack, which was allegedly carried out by a father and son who were IS supporters, and says: “Allah is the greatest and praise to Allah.” It has clearly been viewed, with more than 100 likes, 27 comments and four shares recorded.\n\nFifteen people were killed as they celebrated the Jewish festival of Hanukah in Sydney on 14 December. One of the attackers also died.\n\nAnother post shows a photo of one of the Bondi beach gunmen and says: “The coming years of art and hell,” and contains praise for an IS leader. This had 12 shares and more than 300 likes.\n\nFacebook said it was in the process of removing some of the posts after being contacted by the Guardian, and said some had already been spotted and removed.\n\nDave Rich, the director of policy for the CST, which works to keep Jewish people safe from attack, said: “The sheer volume of IS-supporting accounts promoting terrorist content on Facebook is deeply alarming, and the posts celebrating the Bondi terrorist attack are utterly nauseating.\n\n“Yet again, social media companies are incapable of meeting even their most basic of responsibilities and are putting all of us in danger as a result. This simply should not be happening any more. We will be calling on Ofcom to urgently investigate Meta’s failings and to take strong action where possible.”\n\nOfcom, the media regulator, said: “If a post is reported to a platform now, the platform must decide whether the content is illegal under UK law, and take it down swiftly if it is. Our job is to make sure sites and apps have appropriate measures in place to comply with their duties.”\n\nIt said it had received “evidence that suggests terrorist content and illegal hate speech is persisting on some of the largest social media sites”.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook, declined to answer a series of questions but said: “The content was removed for violating our policies around dangerous organisations and individuals.”\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: “Social media content promoting terrorism or violence against communities is absolutely unacceptable, and will not be tolerated. The law is clear: social media platforms must take action to prevent illegal content on their sites, including terrorist and violent material.”\n\nThe focus on pro-IS material on popular social media sites comes amid concern about an increase in terrorist efforts to target Jewish people across the west.\n\nTwo men were convicted on 22 December of a plot to get machine guns and shoot Jewish people around the north-west of England. In that plot and the Sydney massacre, both sets of terrorists’ approaches had a degree of sophistication.\n\nThough neither was “directed” by IS, the Sydney attackers visited the Philippines and the north-west England machine-gun plotters had contact with an IS person overseas and were sophisticated enough to try to bypass Jewish community security and infiltrate a Facebook group, giving them details of potential Jewish targets.\n\nRich said of the English plot: “This is an even more serious plot than the attack on the synagogue in Heaton Park and indicates a much greater level of training and sophistication.”\n\nVicki Evans, the senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, told the Guardian: “The terrorist threats we face do not stand still and we rarely confine them to history. Instead, they flex in intensity and risk over time – and so does our response.\n\n“Recent attacks in Manchester and Australia are clear reminders of the range of threats we face, and we continue to ask the public to … report any concerns they see in their real-world or online communities.”",

    "description": "Miami creators, influencers, and social media personalities are finding success as the city becomes a creative hot spot.",
    "fullText": "Los Angeles has the entertainment pedigree, but there's another city in the US that's home to even more top influencers per capita: Miami.\n\nVale and Sebastian Genta understand why. The siblings and social media personalities moved back to their hometown of Miami in 2021, after spending five years in LA. The pair, who post about their glamorous lives and occasionally offer a wry take on influencing, wondered what their move would mean for their careers. They were pleasantly surprised.\n\n\"Miami was a completely different city,\" Vale said. \"The amount of events in Miami, the amount of people that are there, brands that are present, it's almost as much as LA.\"\n\n\"Many of us know each other, so if you go to events that Gucci is throwing at the Design District, you're more than likely going to bump into five to 20 familiar faces,\" Sebastian said of the upscale fashion and design neighborhood.\n\nThe Gentas aren't alone. New research shared exclusively with Business Insider by Patrick Adler, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, reveals that Miami consistently ranks as the No. 3 metro area in the US by top Instagram creator count, after LA and New York City.\n\nMiami boasts over 6,000 top Instagram influencers. LA has roughly 12,000, and NYC nearly 11,000. (Seattle was next, with about 4,000.)\n\nAdler, who has also conducted research on the closely watched Otis Report on the Creative Economy, ranked metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by creators in the top 10% in terms of Instagram followers, using data from an influencer marketing firm. Adler said that other platforms, such as YouTube and TikTok, showed similar trends.\n\nMiami still has a ways to go in absolute numbers to catch up with LA and NYC, long known as the centers of US media and entertainment, but it's punching way above its weight. It's only the sixth-largest market by population and the seventh-largest traditional entertainment market.\n\nLooking at the data another way, Miami actually has more top influencers per capita than LA.\n\nOther markets that regularly came up in the top 10 by this measurement are creative hot spots like Las Vegas, Atlanta, Houston, and Nashville.\n\nVictoria Bachan, an SVP at Wasserman Creators, said that for the new guard of independent creators, being in LA or NYC matters less.\n\n\"Take the biggest YouTuber in the world, MrBeast — he's in Greenville, NC,\" she said.\n\nMiami experienced a relocation boom during the COVID-19 pandemic as people, creators included, flocked to South Florida for its warm weather and lack of state or local income taxes. Creators found a growing number of events like Formula 1's Miami Grand Prix, which debuted in Miami in 2022, as well as the Miami Open tennis tournament and Art Basel Miami Beach, which offer places for them to be seen. Brands like Geico and Vuori also seek out personalities there when they want to tap into the Miami lifestyle and Latino culture.\n\nTop Miami influencers include breakout TikTok star Alix Earle, who gained social media fame while attending the University of Miami, and Xandra Pohl, a DJ and model. The scene features prominent food influencers like Samantha Schnur, known as The Naughty Fork, and Nico Norena.\n\nCities like Miami have also offered a haven for Angelenos struggling with the high cost of living in LA and early 2025 wildfires, Wasserman Creators' Bachan said.\n\n\"They're crunching the numbers, and a lot of them did pick up and move to Atlanta and Vegas and Miami,\" she said.\n\nBecca Bahrke, CEO of Illuminate Social, a creator management firm with about 85 clients, estimated that before 2020, 80% of her clients were in LA and NYC. Since then, the ratio has flipped, and her clients are now sprinkled all around the US, from Hawaii to South Carolina.\n\n\"We saw a mass exodus,\" she said.\n\nLA is still the entertainment capital in terms of population. But this new data adds to the narrative of a traditional entertainment industry in decline.\n\nLA has lost ground in traditional film and TV, with the rise of lower-cost film hubs elsewhere. A growing number of A-listers have decamped for other cities.\n\nStill, there are limitations to living in secondary markets for certain types of creators. Being in LA or NYC is considered important in the industry if you aspire to be a Hollywood actor and want to collaborate in person with other creators and attend major events.\n\n\"Our advice is if you want to make money, have an address in New York and LA,\" said Kyle Hjelmeseth, CEO of G&B Digital Management. Some managers also caution against moving outside the US, saying it can impact your ability to get brand deals.\n\nThe Genta siblings said they wish Miami had a bigger TV and film scene to help their peers who are seeking those opportunities. They started #NextGen Creators, an events series where creators can learn and mingle with brands.\n\n\"Many creators want to move on to traditional media, like hosting television, acting, whatever that may look like, and I do think Miami still lacks in that,\" Sebastian said.",

    "description": "TikTok jumped into the top spot among social apps where young people regularly get news, according to data from the Pew Research Center.",
    "fullText": "TikTok has unseated its social media rivals as the top spot for young people to get their news.\n\nTikTok is now the most popular social app for news among 18- to 29-year-olds in the US, according to new survey data from the Pew Research Center. The app surpassed YouTube and Instagram, which were the top choices in 2024.\n\nForty-three percent of young adults said they regularly get news from TikTok in 2025, compared to 41% for both YouTube and Facebook. Forty percent named Instagram as a regular news source, while 21% said X (formerly Twitter) and 18% said Reddit.\n\nSocial media beat out every other format as a place where 18- to 29-year-olds said they get news, according to Pew's survey. Seventy-six percent of the cohort said they often or sometimes get news from social media, compared to 60% for news websites and 28% for email newsletters.\n\nHalf of the young adults who responded to Pew's survey said they have some or a lot of trust in social media as a news source. That roughly matched the level of trust the age group has for information from national news organizations.\n\nTikTok has been rising quickly as a go-to source for news. In 2023, 32% of respondents named the video app as a place for regular news consumption.\n\nWatching news on TikTok does not necessarily mean tuning into videos from traditional outlets like The Washington Post or NBC News. Young people view commentary from news influencers and user-generated videos tied to current events, such as from a war zone or protest, as news as well.\n\nA new crop of independent news influencers has emerged to report on current events, including creators like Philip DeFranco and Vitus \"V\" Spehar's @underthedesknews.\n\nSome professional news organizations, including NPR's \"Planet Money,\" have similarly centered videos on individual creators who can help build trust with their audiences. Gen Z social-media users told Business Insider that they are drawn to news creators who can deliver information in a more authentic and relatable manner.\n\nBeyond news commentary, social media creators and podcasters have taken on a bigger role in news gathering in recent months. Politicians and government institutions are turning to podcasts and other formats to reach people, and content creators had a big presence at national conventions for the Democrats and Republicans last year. Many independent creators have applied for access to White House press briefings in 2025.\n\nTikTok has introduced a handful of features tied to news on its app, including the ability for publishers to link to articles inside videos and a \"community notes\" style fact-checking tool called footnotes. It also works with \"independent fact-checkers in over 130 markets to determine if content is accurate,\" according to its website.",

    "fullText": "Careers are long and not always linear.\n\nAt least, that's how Rong Yan, now the chief technology officer at HeyGen, thinks about it.\n\nSo his best advice for those who want to climb the tech ladder: Don't aim for promotions.\n\n\"Don't make promotions the objective of your work,\" he said on \"The Peterman Pod\" recently.\n\nThings are going to get \"painful\" if you focus too much on promotions, he said.\n\nIt's surprising advice from someone who has swiftly leaped up the corporate ladder during his career.\n\nYan has been working in the tech industry since he earned his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2006. He began his career as a researcher at IBM before joining Meta, where he advanced from researcher to manager in just three years, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then held director positions at Square and Snacphat, and was vice president of engineering at HubSpot, before he joined HeyGen, a visual storytelling platform, in 2024.\n\nOver the years, he said he has noticed that those he has mentored can make themselves miserable when they strive for a promotion.\n\n\"Don't do that,\" he said. \"When you start to get into that mindset, you start to count your happiness or your career growth toward something that you don't have full control over.\"\n\nIt's better to control the things you can control. \"Learn how to adjust, and you'll be a better self afterward,\" he said.\n\nFor those still determined to seek a promotion, however, timing matters.\n\nExecutive coach Andrea Wasserman previously told Business Insider that it's best to put yourself in your manager's shoes and think about what's happening across the team or company. Ask yourself, \"Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a 'yes?'\"",

    "description": "Four tech professionals, from an early career engineer to a former senior director of GenAI at Meta, said getting your hands dirty was important for breaking into the AI industry.",
    "fullText": "As the AI revolution continues to disrupt white collar jobs, many of us are looking for ways to get ahead.\n\nAs part of my first-person coverage for Business Insider in 2025, I asked people with aspirational jobs their formulas for success — including how tech workers in various stages of their careers landed cutting-edge AI jobs.\n\nThese conversations covered a variety of topics, from whether you need a Ph.D. to break into the field to how to earn big as an AI contractor.\n\nBut one remarkably simple piece of advice kept coming up: gain real-world experience with AI technology to help get your foot in the door.\n\nThey didn't view AI as something that can be mastered from a textbook or in a lecture hall. Instead, play around with AI, like an infant tinkering with a new toy, or \"get your hands dirty,\" to borrow a phrase from a couple of the techies I interviewed.\n\nBut what does that look like in practice? Here's how they applied this principle in their own careers.\n\nWhen Patrick Leung, who joined Google in 2007, first saw a demo for a calling assistant that used AI, which would later be called Google Duplex, he was blown away by how realistic the voice sounded.\n\nLeung joined the Duplex team in 2017. Although he'd been exposed to machine learning and AI concepts during previous company projects, he'd never worked on building models and had to retool himself on the job.\n\nLeveraging the expertise around him, including by having lengthy conversations with colleagues who explained how the system worked, helped him become proficient in AI.\n\nLeung witnessed Google Duplex's public launch in 2018, before leaving Google in 2019 to join a financial sciences company. He's continued to work with AI in the later stages of his career.\n\nAt the time of his interview with Business Insider, Leung said the barrier to getting into AI was lower than ever, and encouraged people to apply LLMs to real business problems. For instance, a friend with no coding experience used AI to personalize outreach messages for recruitment purposes at her job and improved her response rate.\n\nIf there aren't opportunities to do something like this in your current job, use AI in your spare time and put it on your résumé, Leung said, adding that people who can demonstrate they can wield LLMs effectively are going to find jobs.\n\nSophia Sun essentially put Leung's advice into action when she pitched a project that would use AI to help customers at Kajabi, the creator commerce platform she worked for as a senior product manager.\n\nThe tool Sun envisioned would help content creators generate marketing content, such as blog posts and short-form videos, for TikTok and Instagram.\n\nShe started working on the project in April 2023, alongside engineering and marketing teammates. Seeing it through to its March 2024 launch was a learning curve for Sun, who had never built an AI product before.\n\nThat July, Sun started a new job at Microsoft as a senior AI product manager, and told Business Insider she thought her end-to-end experience with building an AI product helped her land the role.\n\nSun's playbook for breaking into AI was to find a real user problem, design a lightweight AI solution, and turn it into proof of work. Having good grades is one thing, she said, but building a product that demonstrates your abilities is another, she said.\n\nWhen OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, Mostofa Adib Shakib knew the world was going to change.\n\nHe started his career in traditional software engineering at Snap Inc. and then ZipRecruiter, but became convinced he needed to build AI skills.\n\nShakib spent time learning about AI from books, videos, and research papers, and he built software projects to gain proficiency with agentic AI, such as a tool to help Bangladeshi professionals optimize their résumés.\n\nIn February 2025, he started an AI contractor role with Mercor, which, around the time of his interview with Business Insider, earned him a handsome sum of $6,400 a week.\n\nShakib decided not to go back to a full-time traditional software engineering job. He said he thought focusing on building AI skills before the market gets crowded was the right bet for him.\n\nWhile being a full-time employee at a company offers stability and benefits, it would restrict his time, meaning he could only focus on gaining agentic AI skills on weekends, he said. As a full-time AI contractor, he can spread out his hours as he pleases, he added.\n\nShakib advised people interested in staying relevant in the tech industry to embrace change, rather than fear it, and to focus on upskilling.\n\nAlthough Devi Parikh completed a Ph.D. in computer vision in 2009, before going on to become a senior director of GenAI at Meta years later, she said not to assume you need a Ph.D. to break into AI.\n\nAs the cofounder and co-CEO of the AI company Yutori, she doesn't consider Ph.D.s much when hiring, but looks for people with relevant practical experience, such as training models, she said.\n\nOther potential avenues into interesting AI work include spending time at startups or big labs, or trying side projects that make use of open source code and online communities.\n\nStarting and executing projects has been instrumental to her career success, Parikh said. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she started working on a YouTube series called \"Humans of AI,\" where she interviewed AI researchers about their daily habits. This gave her more professional visibility than her research alone could.\n\nDo you have a story to share about breaking into AI? Contact this reporter at ccheong@businessinsider.com",

    "title": "5 AI advertising controversies that turned heads this year, from Meta's AI granny to Coca-Cola's shape-shifting trucks",
    "description": "Brands, from McDonald's to H&M, drew backlash in some quarters over their AI-driven ads and marketing experiments.",
    "fullText": "Chief marketing officers at many of the world's biggest brands made artificial intelligence a centerpiece of their strategies this year.\n\nFor some brands, the enthusiasm ran into risky territory. From AI-generated ads that veered into the \"uncanny valley\" to backlash over replacing human models and advertising creatives, AI's growing role in advertising fueled a string of controversial marketing moments. The AI backlash even led to its own marketing trend: brands hating on AI.\n\nA survey of more than 6,000 US consumers conducted by the brand-tracking platform Tracksuit in November found that overall sentiment toward AI-generated advertising skewed negative (39%). Neutrality was also strong among respondents, at 36%, while only 18% felt positive about brands using AI-generated content in their ads.\n\nMatt Barash, chief commercial officer of the adtech platform Nova, said that while AI can be a useful tool for buying and placing ads, brands should be cautious when attempting to automate the creative process.\n\n\"When brands ask AI to invent stories from scratch, they don't get innovation — they get an approximation of human emotion, and the result can make headlines for all of the wrong reasons,\" Barash said.\n\nIndeed, several major marketers did make the news for their AI-related mishaps this year. Take a look at some of the most notable AI advertising controversies of the year, below.\n\nMcDonald's Netherlands cooked up an AI-generated holiday ad this month — and quickly sent it back to the kitchen when it became clear that viewers weren't lovin' it.\n\nThe \"most terrible time of the year\" ad was intended to be a satirical take on Christmas calamities that could occur over the festive period. The 45-second spot featured a quickfire montage of cooking mishaps, broken bones at the ice rink, and Santa's sleigh getting stuck in a traffic jam. The brand suggested its restaurants could act as a shelter from the chaos. \"Hide out in McDonald's 'til January's here,\" the ad's narrator said.\n\nSome social media commentators denounced the fast-food chain as a McGrinch, complaining the ad had a cynical sentiment and \"creepy\" characters. After initially turning off the comments on the ad's YouTube video, McDonald's later removed the ad from the site altogether.\n\nIn a statement, McDonald's Netherlands said that while the ad was intended to reflect some of the stressful moments that the holidays can bring, it recognized that many of its customers feel the season is \"the most wonderful time of the year.\"\n\n\"We respect that and remain committed to creating experiences that offer Good Times and Good Food for everyone,\" the statement said.\n\nCoca-Cola already had one AI-generated holiday ad misfire under its belt, after last year's \"Holidays are Coming\" rendition was criticized as \"dystopian\" and \"soulless.\" Despite that, this year it released three AI-generated holiday ads.\n\nOne of the ads, another AI rendition of the classic \"Holidays are Coming\" spot, caught the attention of the eagle-eyed creative community due to its lack of consistency. Sure, the wheels on the trucks went round and round — a criticism of last year's ad was that they appeared to glide across the road — but they also appeared to change in quantity as the ad rolled on.\n\nIn the spirit of Christmas, Dino Burbidge, an independent innovation specialist, shared the gift of this handy graphic to help everyone follow along:\n\nPJ Pereira, cofounder of Silverside AI, the production company behind the ad, defended Coca-Cola's use of AI in a statement.\n\n\"Coca-Cola became a pioneer in this space because, once they recognized AI as the future, they stopped debating whether it's perfect or not — and instead focused on how to use it in the best, most creative way possible,\" Pereira said.\n\nPereira also said that the ad performed well with consumers in testing. System1, which rates ads on a scale from 1 to 5.9 stars on their potential to drive long-term growth for brands, gave the 2025 \"Holidays are Coming\" ads the highest possible score: 5.9. A separate creative testing company, DAIVID, said the ad generated higher-than-average attention and brand recall scores.\n\nApparel brand True Classic is a poster child of digital performance marketing, honing platforms like Facebook and Instagram to build a community of devoted customers — typically men ages 30 to 45.\n\nSo imagine its marketing chief's shock when he realized Meta's ad platform had swapped out his top-performing ad — a millennial man in a matching fleece set, casually posing on a stool — with that of a cheerful, yet clearly AI-generated granny sitting in an armchair.\n\nHow do we go from this… to AI grandma. pic.twitter.com/n3cryUpLaT\n\nAdvertisers told Business Insider earlier this year that settings within Meta's Advantage+ suite of AI-powered ad products had led to the platform automatically generating ad creatives on their behalf.\n\nIn a statement, Meta said that advertisers who use its full image generation feature can review the images before running their ads.\n\nBut three advertisers also told Business Insider they'd encountered a problem where Meta automatically switched those toggles to \"on,\" even when they'd explicitly turned them off — meaning they inadvertently spent some of their budgets on AI-generated ads they didn't intend to run.\n\nAI has helped take airbrushing to the next level. Some brands are experimenting with using generative AI to eliminate photo shoots altogether — with mixed results.\n\nTake fast-fashion retailer H&M. In March, the company announced a plan to create \"digital twins\" of 30 models whose images could be used for social media posts and ad campaigns. H&M said the models would own the rights to their twins, which would include the ability to allow other brands to use them.\n\nH&M was aware that the move would be controversial.\n\n\"People will be divided. You know, 'Is this good? Is this bad?'\" Jörgen Andersson, H&M chief creative officer, told Business of Fashion at the time.\n\nH&M certainly got chins wagging. American fashion influencer Morgan Riddle described the plan as \"shameful.\" Sara Ziff, founder of Model Alliance, a nonprofit that focuses on workers' rights in the fashion industry, said the plan raised \"serious concerns.\"\n\n\"In an industry that has historically been a backwater for workers' rights, H&M's new initiative raises critical questions about consent and compensation, and has the potential to replace a host of fashion workers — including make-up artists, hair stylists, and other creative artists in our community,\" Ziff said in a statement.\n\nIn a statement sent to Business Insider for this article, an H&M spokesperson said that the brand was exploring how generative AI can support the creative process in thoughtful and responsible ways.\n\n\"We recognize that generative AI raises important questions and concerns, and we want to be transparent in acknowledging that we do not yet have all the answers, but are continuing to learn and evolve,\" the H&M spokesperson said.\n\nH&M wasn't the only fashion brand to give AI models a twirl this year.\n\nReaders flicking through the August 2025 issue of Vogue noticed ads for Guess carried a small label/disclaimer: \"Produced by Seraphinne Vallora on AI.\" The models, \"Vivienne\" and \"Anastasia,\" were created using AI by a London-based AI marketing agency.\n\nSocial media users slammed the ad, saying the images pushed unrealistic beauty standards and that the use of AI imagery portended bad news for creative industry jobs. Some online commenters said they would cancel their Vogue subscriptions in protest. (Vogue publisher Condé Nast said at the time that an AI model had never appeared \"editorially\" in Vogue.)\n\nThe cofounders of Seraphinne Vallora said in an interview with \"Good Morning America\" that they were looking to supplement the modeling industry, not replace it.\n\nVogue is facing criticism for running a Guess ad that used AI-generated models in its latest issue. Stephanie Ramos has more on the controversy and what it means for the fashion industry. #vogue #ai #aigenerated #fashion\n\n\"We are here to co-exist together, and we will always see photography, stylists, and everyone involved in a photo shoot as incredibly important,\" said Valentina Gonzalez, one of the cofounders.\n\nAI models and the controversies surrounding them weren't a new advertising phenomenon for 2025. Brands such as Mango and Levi's have also faced a similar backlash for featuring AI-generated models in their marketing in recent years. A new trend does appear to be emerging, though. Brand partnerships with AI social accounts dropped by around 30% in the first eight months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, according to transaction data from hundreds of campaigns provided by the influencer-marketing platform Collabstr.\n\nCould AI models be the latest fast-fashion casualty?",

    "description": "Meta poached at least seven OpenAI researchers over summer. Here are some big names who left the startup in 2025.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI had a year of high-profile departures.\n\nOver the summer, the ChatGPT creator lost at least seven researchers and scientists to Meta's billion-dollar effort to beef up its AI team at its Superintelligence Lab.\n\nThis came after the company saw an exodus of top executives in 2024 amid a restructuring effort, including chief technology officer Mira Murati, chief research officer Bob McGrew, and vice president of research Barret Zoph.\n\nCEO Sam Altman is now one of only two active remaining members of the company's original 11-person founding team.\n\nHere's a running list of researchers and executives OpenAI has lost this year and where they've ended up.\n\nWei, a research scientist who worked on OpenAI's o1 and deep research models, left in July for Meta's Superintelligence Lab.\n\nSun, who left for Meta's Superintelligence Labs in July, was a research scientist at OpenAI.\n\nChung is part of the trio of OpenAI research scientists who departed for Meta's Superintelligence Lab in July. He posted on LinkedIn alongside his two colleagues that they are having \"so much fun building from a clean slate with a truly talent-dense team.\"\n\nZhao became the chief scientist of the Meta Superintelligence Lab in July after co-creating ChatGPT and GPT-4 at OpenAI. The prominent researcher is working directly with Mark Zuckerberg and Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang .\n\nYu is widely credited with leading the Perception team in OpenAI to develop the \"senses\" of a Large Language Model, including images, audio, and sensor readings. He departed for Meta's Superintelligence Lab in late June.\n\nRen was poached by Meta's Superintelligence Lab over the summer. He was a core contributor to OpenAI's GPT-4o model.\n\nBi was an OpenAI researcher on multimodal and reinforcement learning. He left in June for Meta's Superintelligence Lab to work on reinforcement learning, post-training, and AI agents.\n\nSummers, who is also a former Treasury secretary and former Harvard president, resigned from the OpenAI board in November. The resignation came shortly after a House panel released years of email exchanges between Summers and Jeffrey Epstein, who was charged with sex trafficking minors.\n\nIn August, Villagra resigned as chief people officer after being promoted to the role in March.\n\nFedus was the vice president of research and post-training at OpenAI until he left the company in March. In September, he co-founded an AI startup called Periodic Labs, which aims to create an AI scientist.\n\nCunningham was OpenAI's data scientist and economic researcher until he resigned in November. He joined Model Evaluation and Threat Research, a non-profit research institute that evaluates AI models' capabilities and safety level.\n\nWeeks before the end of the year, Wong, OpenAI's chief communications officer, announced her departure for her \"next chapter,\" according to a post on her LinkedIn. She added that Lindsey Held Bolton will lead the communications team as the interim, while the company searches for a new CCO. It is unclear what Wong's next job will be.",

    "fullText": "There was no shortage of fun and video games in the Diamond household in the last 12 months. Which ones did we play so much our thumbs hurt? And which one saved my soul? Let the ceremony begin …\n\n The 20 best video games of 2025\n\nSo, how was 2025 for your household? Was it really all as good as you pretended it was on Facebook? Full of A-grades for the kids and riotous themed fancy dress birthday parties for the grownups? Or was it a sea of disappointment with only occasional fun flotsam? And was any of it actually real, or are we all now seven-fingered AI slop beings with Sydney Sweeney’s teeth?\n\nI have gathered my thoughts (and the Diamond household) together, whether they wanted to or not, to reflect on the most important thing in any given year: which video games we enjoyed the most. Without further ado:\n\nGame eldest daughter played the most: Just Dance 2024/Horizon Zero Dawn/Pikmin\n\nOn her phone, meanwhile, she’s been playing Cityscapes and “trying to find decent healthcare”.\n\nGame middle son played the most: Overwatch\n“I don’t play games on my phone.” He was offended that I even asked him that question. I respect that.\n\nGame youngest daughter played the most: Resident Evil Biohazard\nShe is trying to get into theatre school, but when she wasn’t singing, she was playing Resident Evil. She also went on in great detail about her achievements on The Sims, where the Shark has a thriving utopia with infinitely better healthcare than her big sister has in real life.\n\nGame the wife played the most: Crash Bandicoot: It’s About Time\nShe started the year at 60% completion and ended it at 82%. It’s a marathon not a sprint for her. On her phone: something called Woodle, where you have to unscrew pins.\n\nGame I laughed at my kids for still playing: Minecraft\nAny time I see my 21-year-old son playing Minecraft, I set about him like a cross between Steve Martin with that guy in the pub in Roxanne, and Joe Pesci with Spider in Goodfellas. When he complains, I reply that I am doing this to toughen him up so he can be a man and play games for grownups. It’s a very Scottish father/son relationship.\n\nMost impressive gaming family member 2025: Eldest daughter on Just Dance 2024\nThere was no contest for this one. She is a machine. Even better than I was at the Cure’s Lovecats on Dancing Stage MegaMix in my prime.\n\nGame I played the most: Marvel Snap\nNothing came close to the hours I spent on this insanely well-crafted deck building wizard’s poker, with its constantly evolving range of cards and game variations.\n\nGame I wish I had played less: Marvel Snap\nThe worst thing about games that constantly evolve their range of cards and variations is you wake up one day and realise it is all just an attempt to suck you into fomo-fuelled microtransactions. So love turned to hate halfway through the year and it went into the bin.\n\nGame I wish I had played more: Doom: The Dark Ages\nGlorious reinvention of a classic. Immersive atmosphere from the off. I wish I could eviscerate my demons so effectively in real life.\n\nGame I wish I had played more (cerebral edition): Blue Prince\nI refuse to rush this beautiful, unique game and I just didn’t have the time or headspace to give it what it deserved earlier this year. My mother is staying with us over Christmas and the New Year, so I will be playing this in the wee small hours after I have prosecco’d her into oblivion.\n\nGame that saved my soul when I needed It: Balatro\nI know Balatro was 2024’s breakout game, but I was late to it. And it is remarkable. It just gets every single thing right. Crazy Poker is a wonderful concept, but the powers behind the different joker cards are so imaginative it has become a game I literally would play any time of the day or night. Throw in the wittiness of the card design, and this is an absolute high-water mark of gaming. I dream of being stuck in a broken-down lift for hours just so I have nothing to do but play it.\n\nGame I got the most criticism for criticising: Outer Worlds 2\nI experienced a minor pile-on when I wrote about how the Paintress boss battle bug in Clair Obscur ruined the whole game for me, but it’s still a gargantuan gaming achievement in terms of art, sound, acting, battle gameplay and ambition – which I appreciated even more after slogging through Outer Worlds 2. So thank you to the reader who took the time to email me personally, through my website, to say that my Outer Worlds 2 review was “bitter, confused resentment because YOU DON’T GET THE GAME OLD MAN and your son is an idiot as well sorry to inform you.” I present that in the exact way it was written, because I appreciate the effort, and he is obviously an excellent judge of character where my son is concerned.\n\nGame everybody loved that I just didn’t get: Hollow Knight: Silksong\nSure. Give me a bastard-hard Metroidvania-esque thing and don’t tell me what I am supposed to be doing, except “explore”. Great fun. I get that it looks ace and is perfection if you are into this kind of thing, but I cannot think of a gaming experience I want less of in my mid-fifties. I was around back when all games were like this, and I’ve had enough. It was fine when I was a kid, but so was polyester.\n\nBiggest gaming scandal of 2025: Toss-up between EA getting in bed with Jared Kushner and the Saudis, and Outer Worlds 2 costing £70. Both morally indefensible and repugnant.\n\nGames I would name my children after, if I was ever stupid enough to have more: Clair Obscur, Despelote and Bananza would all sound good bellowed from the doorstep at tea time.\n\nPart of my body that aches most from gaming: Right thumb joint. Seriously. I don’t know if it’s because of video games or doomscrolling on my phone, but it burns like the mines of sulphur in the mornings now. I knew I should have got my thumbs insured back in the 90s.\n\nGame I am looking forward to the most in 2026: GTA 6. \n\n And it will come out in 2026, even if we have to make 2026 last until the heat death of the universe.\n\nGame I am looking forward to the most in 2036: The Witcher 4.",

Here are the best games you weren’t playing this year\n\n The 20 best video games of 2025\n\n More on the best culture of 2025\n\nPS5, Xbox, Switch, PC\nHave you ever wanted to romance your record player? Date Everything! offers players the chance to develop relationships with everyday objects around your house, in a fully voiced sandbox romp featuring over 100 anthropomorphised characters. Wonderfully meta; you can put the moves on the textbox, or even “Michael Transaction” (microtransaction – get it?) himself. Meghan Ellis\n\nPS4/5, Xbox, Switch, PC\nA raucous debut by indie studio à la mode games, Sorry We’re Closed is a survival horror where the monster is love and the dungeon is a dingy London neighbourhood. Fight demons, fend off unwanted admirers and survive work shifts in this queer, neon homage to 1990s PlayStation-era horror. ME\n\nWeb browser\nThe trick of this daily logic puzzle is that you can’t guess, or make wrong answers. Presented with a grid of characters, you must identify the “innocent” and the “criminal” based on clues revealed with each correct answer. But the game will only accept an answer if it’s sure you know it for a fact. An idealistic vision of a criminal justice system. Duncan Fyfe\n\nSwitch, Playdate, PC\nBlippo+ is a channel surfing simulator that rides the line between video game and absurd cable subscription service. Experienced entirely by trawling through the interface of a virtual TV guide, you can tune into intergalactic music videos, curious cooking shows, and psychic weather reports, learning an alien culture through charming live-action skits that evoke the sketch comedy of Tim and Eric. Sarah Thwaites\n\nSwitch, PC\nA sequel in all but name to Love-de-Lic’s 1997 role-playing game satire Moon, Stray Children is a monster-taming adventure where you whisper away the worries of troubled “Olders” that have come to dominate the inhabitants of an unfinished video game. Finessed by a crunchy pixel art style and a combat system inspired by Undertale, this nostalgic odyssey will pull on your heartstrings while testing your reflexes at the same time. ST\n\nPS5, Xbox, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nA fiendish, almost cruelly addictive mashup of Vampire Survivors-esque monster horde control and Breakout-style ball-bouncing. Descend into a pit full of demons and shoot a continuous stream of richocheting, burning, poisonous and otherwise deadly balls at them until the screen is just a brain-melting confusion of visual effects. Keza MacDonald\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nYou are a cheerful pubescent boy with a unique problem: your arms are stuck out in a T-pose. How do you navigate school, family, friendships and brushing your teeth when you can’t bend your arms? A sweet, family friendly slice-of-life physical comedy game with an unexpectedly affecting message, and excellent songs sung by a gourmand giraffe. KM\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nJust a chill bike-racing game where your ride is possessed by an ancient speed spirit. Wheel around a soothingly minimalist island of cycling obsessives, picking up new swappable bike parts and blasting past local gangs of racers on downhill courses. Uncomplicated, good looking and thoughtfully put together. KM\n\nPC\nPowerhoof’s excellent pixelated point-and-click game teases its dystopian plot throughout, mixing influences such as The Thing, Michael Crichton’s Coma and Total Recall. It’s an intriguing mix: combined with a heartfelt story full of painful human emotions and some fantastic audio, it’s a tense yet warming tale, guaranteed to coil its way around your heart. Graeme Mason\n\nXbox, PC\nWhile the combat mechanics are familiar, it’s South of Midnight’s evocative backdrop that marks it apart. Set in an overgrown and misty American deep south, it stars Hazel, a young woman thrust into the aftermath of a hurricane and forced to battle the evil manifestations of deep-rooted sorrows. Beautiful and engaging, its soundtrack is also wonderful, perfectly complementing the uncanny scenery. GM\n\nPC\nYour task is simple in the brilliantly silly Skin Deep: save a bunch of talking cats from marauding space pirates. The execution is anything but as you crouch in vents, pull glass from your feet, and deploy sneezing powder and slippery soap bars to incapacitate your foes. Like Metal Gear Solid meets a Looney Tunes cartoon, the pleasure here lies in pushing the game’s miniature sandboxes to their slapstick limit. Lewis Gordon\n\nPS5, PC\nCasting you as a knight with a hoverboard, Sword of the Sea is a mystical journey through a desert which roils like an ocean. You pull grab tricks and get big air on cresting dunes, but the greater enjoyment stems from simply soaking up the game’s breathtaking, nature-infused landscapes at high speed. A gorgeously dreamy, new age take on extreme sport. LG\n\nPC\nIf ancestry.com has yet to reveal your hidden royal lineage, try digging into the Roottree clan instead. Armed with a 1998 web browser, you have to deduce the loves, losses and lies of a sprawling candy dynasty (no relation to Rowntree). A compelling blend of Her Story and Who Do You Think You Are? Matthew Castle\n\nPS4/5, Xbox, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nShakespearean dialogue, bruising boss battles and a tale steeped in class struggle make this a refreshingly different Final Fantasy. As you command a troupe of society’s most downtrodden, excellent voice acting lends this once silent PlayStation 1 game new life. As rewarding to play as it is affecting, in 2025, Yasumi Matsuno’s tale of inequality and division has never felt more relevant. Tom Regan\n\nPS4/5, Switch, PC\nCombining the best parts of Hades with the immediacy of Streets of Rage, this colourful co-operative caper is an endless delight. As you roam Talamh’s lived-in fantasy world, this roguelike rewards you with satisfying new powers and beguiling side quests. With precise combat and varied movesets, Absolum adds some much-needed depth to the oft shallow beat ’em up genre. A co-op classic. TR\n\nPS5, Xbox, Switch, PC\nIf the prospect of a disgraced mobster tooling around small-town Japan accompanied by a giant depraved thumb doesn’t intrigue you, keep moving. But give Promise Mascot Agency some time and you’ll discover this compact open-world adventure is filled with chaotic charm. At its heart it’s a story of redemption, as you manage a gang of weirdo mascots and restore a dilapidated community, all while driving the best pickup truck in any video game. Christian Donlan\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nHere’s a fantasy role-playing game that’s happy to embrace elemental powers, even if it leads to pinwheeling chaos. In a world where fire attacks can spread uncontrollably and ice can lead to giant dragons dropping out of the sky as their wings freeze up, this colourful piece of whimsy offers fun that genuinely scales to your own imagination. CD\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nMatt Newell’s hymn to photography is also a gorgeous investigation into the creative power of solitude and of paying attention to your surroundings. Learn your way around a beautifully simulated digital camera, but also explore the visual potential of a range of exquisitely crafted 3D landscapes. There are no puzzles and not much in the way of scoring, just you and your ever-developing eye. CD\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nA football game that’s closer to the likes of Rocket League than it is Fifa, Rematch has you feeling as if you’re playing an actual match of five-a-side: developer Sloclap have utterly mastered the sensation and pace of charging up a field and passing between your mates before knocking the ball into the back of the net. Daniella Lucas\n\nPS5, PC\nProof that love and hate can be two sides of the same coin, this ridiculous adventure has you taking control of a grown man in a onesie trying to remember how to walk. You have to separately control each of your legs over a series of obstacles that lead to some absurdly funny moments, but equally has you kneeling in despair as you fall, yet again, off a wooden plank while trying to get a stupid hat. Worth it though. DL\n\nSwitch, PC\nA game all about slowing life down, While Waiting takes mundane situations – from breaking down in your car to waiting for a delayed train – and gives you multiple choices on how to handle them. Due to the way it rewards experimentation, and squeezing the fun out of everyday moments, While Waiting has taught me how to be more patient – and that wasting time by fiddling around with things is the key to a healthy life-balance. Thomas Hobbs\n\nSwitch, PC\nOne for the Halloween-loving girlies and ghoulies, this companion to Strange Horticulture has you dealing in occult objects rather than plants. Explore gothic Cumbrian locales to find artefacts, identify them via vague tomes, solve puzzles and occasionally divert the plot by giving a customer something other than what they wanted. Jordan Erica Webber\n\nSwitch, PC\nDeveloper Wadjet Eye keeps the point-and-click adventure genre alive in an apt tale of time-travelling tourism. As punters pay to revisit lost loves and settle scores, it’s your job to protect the timeline. From a timeloop farce to an urgent visit to pre-9/11 New York, Old Skies unfolds like a short story anthology. A surprise on every page. MC\n\nSwitch, PC, iOS, Android\nSudoku meets speed dating. This charming puzzle game sees you play matchmaker via seating plans, seating cute little characters together based on their hilarious pet peeves and preferences in a host of fun settings. Its puzzles are cosy, relaxing and never frustrating. Bex April May\n\nPC\nWhat if your friendly neighbourhood turned into a waking nightmare? That’s the premise of this RPG-style survival horror set in an apartment complex where unspeakable horrors are going on right outside your window – but whatever you do, you mustn’t look at them, or you risk mutating like your poor, revolting neighbours. Best enjoyed with the curtains drawn. BAM\n\nPS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nFrom its tongue-in-cheek writing to its ridiculous creatures, Toby Fox’s episodic role-playing game is charming and witty. Like Undertale before it, Deltarune flips the genre on its head with humour and heart, leaving you itching for more. (The game’s next chapter isn’t until the second half of 2026 at the earliest.) We dare you not to crack a smile at this one. Vic Hood\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nThis psychological horror immediately tells you what to expect: “This is a story about death.” As Sam, you attempt to escape your home, an increasingly twisted labyrinth of puzzles and memories. Channelling the unsettling atmosphere of Hideo Kojima’s PT, Luto delivers a powerful message about grief and life after loss. VH\n\nPS5, Switch, PC\nYou play as a fly in Time Flies, buzzing around different environments – a home or a museum, for instance – doing fly things, such as tickling people’s feet or avoiding lightbulbs. The time you have to complete the fly’s bucket list depends on your actual location, leaving just minutes or seconds to get everything done. Who knew speedrunning a fly’s life could be so delightful? Nicole Carpenter\n\nSwitch, PC\nAnd Roger is disorienting, devastating and one of the most emotional games to be released this year. From developer TearyHand Studio, And Roger’s evocative story and simple-yet-distinct art is reminiscent of Mountains’ 2018 release Florence. Within three chapters, a mystery unfolds: Who is this man in the house? Where’s my father? The answers reveal a tragic, beautiful story of love and family. NC\n\nXbox, PC\nSoft Not Weak’s Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To is a visual novel, dating simulator, and match-three game all in one. While it’s driven by its classic puzzle gameplay,this is a masterclass in characters and character design: Each individual you meetis just as interesting and well-developed as the last. It’s a must-play for both puzzle fanatics and visual novel lovers. NC",

    "fullText": "A Pinterest executive who worked at Meta said there's one thing she looks for in potential hires: how they talk about failure.\n\nAyumi Nakajima began her career at Nielsen before taking on a leadership role at Meta — then Facebook — in 2013. She joined Pinterest in 2015, where she's now a senior director in Singapore, heading its Asia-Pacific content partnerships.\n\nShe leads a team of about 20 people across APAC and has interviewed several hundred candidates throughout her career.\n\nNakajima said she pays close attention to how potential hires respond to the interview question: \"What are some failures you have experienced?\"\n\nShe said some candidates tell stories about failures in which they ultimately look good.\n\n\"I'm sure they've prepped in a way to not look too bad, but I actually appreciate it when someone says, 'Actually, this was a failure,'\" she said. \"When they say, 'This was when I messed up,' instead of blaming others.\"\n\n\"Those are some of the soft signals that I look for, when the person can accept when things are not working, or can accept that there was a mistake, and evolve and learn from that,\" Nakajima said.\n\nShe said the tech landscape is changing rapidly, so while there are certain skills she needs in a candidate, she values adaptability and receptiveness to criticism over all else.\n\n\"When I interview candidates, I always look for people who are more flexible and versatile rather than having specific experiences and ticking off a box,\" she said. \"I'd prefer to have someone who's really dynamic and has a growth mindset, because six months down the line, the scope might change.\"\n\nOn the flip side, Nakajima also has a piece of advice for hirers: Don't rush into it.\n\nNakajima said she likes to take her time during the hiring process, with the mindset that the person will stay in the role for four to five years, rather than just one to two.\n\n\"If you think of them as staying for five plus years, then a month delay in the hiring process is not going to ruin things,\" she said. She added that being shortsighted and hiring someone to rush through a project is how employers often pick someone who might not be the best fit.\n\nShe said that she had changed her mind about candidates who were close to being confirmed, after giving it more thought.\n\n\"The recruiting team was obviously not so happy with me, but I think those are just some of the trade-offs that you can make to make the right hiring decision,\" she said.",

    "description": "Business Insider's Pranav Dixit takes Tech Memo through Meta's 'year of intensity' and what 2026 will bring for Mark Zuckerberg's company.",
    "fullText": "Business Insider's Pranav Dixit has been covering Meta for a year now. He recently reported on the company's \"year of intensity\" with colleague Jyoti Mann. I asked Pranav for his take on a turbulent 12 months.\n\nQ: You've been covering Meta for a year now. What has that been like?\n\n\"Intense\" is the only way to describe it — exactly what Mark Zuckerberg promised employees. I joined BI a day before Meta scrapped third-party fact-checking, and almost immediately the culture shifted: DEI rollbacks, an embrace of \"masculine\" energy, and moves that seemed more aligned with the Trump administration. Then came thousands of layoffs of people labeled low performers and a noticeable spike in performance pressure.\n\nThe second half of the year brought a very different pivot. Meta effectively admitted Llama hadn't lived up to the hype and reset around a new mission: building \"personal superintelligence.\" That meant hiring Alexandr Wang, reorganizing AI under Meta Superintelligence Labs, and aggressively poaching talent while high-profile figures — including Yann LeCun — departed. It felt like covering a company reinventing its business, values, and culture all at once.\n\nQ: What stood out most from your reporting with Jyoti Mann on this \"year of intensity\"?\n\nA pervasive survival mindset. Over and over, employees told us the goal wasn't to do great work — it was to avoid landing in the bottom performance tier. Some people left on principle, saying Meta no longer resembled the company they joined. Yet others insisted this is the best job in tech: great product challenges, unmatched scale, exceptional pay. Those two realities sit side by side — one group bracing for impact, another thriving.\n\nQ: Your reporting found managers sometimes hiring people just to fill low-performance slots. How does that work?\n\nMeta's forced ranking requires a set percentage of \"low performers.\" Some managers gamed the system. Some told us they avoided backfilling roles; others hired into fuzzy positions with near-impossible expectations so they didn't have to put existing trusted team members in the bottom bucket. (Meta didn't respond to specific questions on this.)\n\nQ: What will you be watching for in 2026?\n\nThe big question is whether Meta's massive AI spend becomes a durable business or an expensive experiment. Will Meta AI become a distinct, everyday product? Will the capex binge translate into real revenue and profit? And can the culture stabilize enough to keep the AI talent Meta is betting the company on? Meta can execute — history proves that — but \"intensity\" can't last forever. 2026 will show whether the trade-offs were worth it.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Like many of his US counterparts, the Russian science prodigy turned hugely successful ‘digital populist’ has a deep suspicion of government constraint\n\nTech visionary, Kremlin dissident, FSB agent, free speech absolutist, health guru. These are just some of the labels admirers and critics have attached to Pavel Durov over the past decade.\n\nThe Russian-born tech entrepreneur founded Russia’s version of Facebook before going on to create the messaging app Telegram, launch a cryptocurrency ecosystem and amass a multibillion-dollar fortune, all while clashing repeatedly with authorities in Russia and beyond.\n\nBut much of Durov’s real story – and the logic that drives him – remains obscured.\n\nA new biography aims to change that.\n\nThe Populist, by the independent Russian writer Nikolay Kononov, traces the 41-year-old’s rise from a St Petersburg schoolboy science prodigy to the founder of Telegram, one of the world’s most influential communications platforms, which has more than a billion users.\n\nKononov describes the book as the product of a 14-year attempt to map Durov’s strategy and mindset, drawing on conversations with Durov himself and people who worked with him, as well as rivals and critics.\n\nThe book’s title, he said, refers to a thread running through Durov’s life: his desire to address Telegram’s millions of users directly, allowing him to bypass institutions, the press and any system of representation.\n\n“Durov is one of the first digital populists,” Kononov said in an interview, explaining that “from the very beginning, as soon as he started making his digital products, he programmed into them the ability to write and communicate his ideas directly to his audience.”.\n\nBoth VKontakte, Durov’s first venture, and Telegram have at times pushed messages from Durov directly to all users, including users who had not opted in, outlining his libertarian worldview.\n\n“He sees himself as a visionary. And obviously wants to be heard,” the author said.\n\nThat strategy has helped promote Durov’s central promise – almost absolute freedom of expression – even as Telegram has become a go-to tool for dissidents, extremists, scammers and war propagandists.\n\nIf Durov’s public brand is built on libertarianism, Kononov says his private management style points in the opposite direction: power concentrated in one man’s hands, with few visible checks.\n\n“He is essentially the only one making all the product decisions at Telegram,” Kononov said. “Marketing, PR – it’s a one-man show.”\n\nThe portrait he draws is of a tech founder whose worldview has not wavered over the years, remaining most comfortable within an ultra-libertarian, anti-institutional strand of the right that is often misogynistic and, at times, conspiratorial.\n\n“What surprised me most is that Durov hasn’t changed or evolved in all the years that I have interviewed him,” Kononov said.\n\nDurov is not an outlier, Kononov writes, but part of a broader new wave of moguls – most visibly in the US – who pair technological dominance with an outsized sense of personal mythology and a deep suspicion of government constraint.\n\nLike Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, he has shown a strong interest in longevity science as well as pronatalism, the belief that having as many children as possible is a social or civilisational duty.\n\nDurov does not drink or use drugs, Kononov says, regularly dispenses spartan health advice – often alongside photos of him shirtless – and has said he has fathered dozens of children through sperm donation.\n\nOne of the book’s most striking sections tells for the first time of Durov’s tense early meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2014, held behind closed doors.\n\nKononov writes that Durov described the encounter as a one-way conversation, in which the Kremlin leader reprimanded him over illegal content on Vkontakte and suggested that Durov leave the country.\n\nUnder pressure from the authorities, Durov sold his stake in Vkontakte, left Russia and eventually settled in Dubai, where he founded Telegram.\n\nBut the clearest mark on Durov in recent years, Kononov suggests, came not from Russia but from France.\n\nDurov, who also holds French citizenship, was detained and held for three days in France in August last year as part of an investigation into crimes linked to Telegram, including the circulation of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions.\n\nHis detention came as a shock to the tech mogul. In interviews conducted in Paris after his arrest, Durov described to Kononov a harsh, disorienting ordeal – a permanently lit cell and little sleep – that rattled a man who had spent years insulating himself from the reach of the state.\n\nIt also appears to have sharpened his hostility towards the west. Kononov says Durov now frames Europe as sliding toward “total digital control”, and increasingly conspiratorial rhetoric.\n\nMost recently, Durov appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory promoted by the far-right blogger Candace Owens, suggesting that Paris was behind the killing of Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What interests me about Durov is that, on the one hand, he clearly has a very high IQ,” Kononov said. “But at the same time, he is prone to conspiracy theories.”\n\nKononov is adamant, however, that Durov’s views should not be conflated with formal political allegiances.\n\nOne of the most persistent claims surrounding Durov is that he is secretly aligned with Russian security services.\n\nBut Kononov said that in the course of his research, he found no evidence that Durov has worked with, or on behalf of, the Russian state. “He has a huge number of flaws – but not the sin of Telegram acting as a backdoor for the FSB,” Kononov said.\n\nKononov argues that what Durov has ultimately learned is the need to compromise – with both Russian and western authorities – when it serves his interests and allows Telegram to continue operating.\n\nKononov recalls Durov once telling him: “I never waste time on things that are unnecessary or that cannot be useful to me personally.” That self-serving mindset, Kononov said, ultimately ended their personal relationship.\n\nAbout a year ago, the writer asked Durov whether he saw a contradiction between Telegram’s highly centralised, almost authoritarian internal structure and his professed devotion to freedom of expression. After that, Durov stopped responding.\n\n“He quickly realised it wasn’t going to be a book to his liking,” Kononov said.",

    "fullText": "Questions about Sherrone Moore’s judgment and mental state had persisted long before the Michigan head football coach was arrested after he allegedly broke into the home of a female football staff member and threatened suicide while holding butter knives and a pair of scissors.\n\nAn investigation from The Athletic published Monday revealed numerous red flags — including exchanges with women on Instagram beginning in 2020 and as recently as last month — that preceded the arrest and the firing, with cause, over what the school said was an “inappropriate relationship with a staff member.”\n\nThe Athletic spoke with five women who said they had strange or uncomfortable exchanges with Moore on social media. These interactions were raised to university officials by fall 2024 — early in his first year as head coach — two people briefed on the matter told The Athletic. The behavior was not seen to be criminal and was not known to involve school employees, according to the report, but it might have hinted at deeper issues.\n\n“It was not sexual harassment,” one official told The Athletic. “It was propriety, ‘Are you an idiot?’ kind of stuff.”\n\nMoore, who is a married father of three, reportedly reached out to the women through Instagram by direct messaging or “liking” a story they posted. According to one woman, Moore asked if he could fly her in to Michigan to see him. She asked about the expectations associated with the request and whether she would be “holed up in some hotel?”\n\n“I guess we will have to see ! I would say yes but you would also have a driver haha,” Moore reportedly wrote.\n\n“We will go into that detail later,” he wrote.\n\nIn his most recent known interactions with women on Instagram, Moore reportedly reached out to one woman shortly before beating Purdue on Nov. 1. The woman, who had no connections to the Michigan program, according to The Athletic, said she replied to his hand-waving emoji with a hello.\n\nMichigan coach’s bleary-eyed mugshot emerges after his shocking firing, arrest\n\nDisgraced ex-University of Michigan coach Sherrone Moore had ‘long history’ of abusing mistress, her lawyer alleges\n\nMichigan football coach jailed on suspicion of assault after shocking firing over ‘inappropriate relationship’\n\nInside Michigan coach’s ‘strange’ behavior before his firing for ‘inappropriate’ relationship with staffer, shocking arrest\n\nMichigan fires head coach for ‘inappropriate relationship’ in college football bombshell\n\nShortly after the victory, Moore reached out again to the woman, who at first could not believe it was Moore and then congratulated him. Two days later, he reportedly put a fire emoji on a story that featured her on a stairmaster at the gym.\n\nThese interactions might have served as warning signs. Further concerns were raised concerning Moore’s mental state, according to the report, as he would break down sobbing in staff meetings and lash out at other coaches, program sources told The Athletic. In anoother incident, Moore reportedly was seen eavesdropping on closed-door meetings inside the Michigan football facility.\n\nUltimately, it was the alleged relationship with a staffer that prompted his downfall. According to the report, an anonymous tip given to the university’s human resources department led first to an inquiry and then the hiring of the law firm Jenner & Block to conduct an external investigation into Moore and the relationship.\n\nAfter the arrest, Moore told police the relationship had existed for about two years, dating to his days as an assistant. According to The Athletic, one program source remembered seeing Moore’s car in the staffer’s apartment complex late at night.\n\nMoore and the staffer also were spotted at a Michigan lacrosse game in spring 2024. According to The Athletic, Moore grew angry when a member of the Michigan staff warned him about the video of the two at the game and the appearance of impropriety.",

    "description": "Former Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun said current and prospective CS students need to focus on skills \"with a long shelf life.\"",
    "fullText": "Yann LeCun said if computer science majors don't spend their time wisely, they may find out their degree doesn't add up.\n\n\"If you are a CS major and take the minimum required math courses for a typical CS curriculum, you might find yourself unable to adapt to major technological shifts,\" LeCun said in an email to Business Insider.\n\nLeCun, who teaches computer science at NYU, said during a recent podcast appearance that he jokes that he's \"a computer science professor arguing against studying computer science\" based on his push on where students should focus their time.\n\n\"My recommendation was not to avoid CS as a major but to take the maximum number of courses on foundations (e.g. math, physics, or EE courses) rather than take courses on the trendy technology du jour,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe former chief AI scientist at Meta said his advice is that students \"learn things with a long shelf life.\" Depending on the computer science program, not all of these skills may be baked into a degree.\n\n\"What we should do is learn kind of basic things in mathematics, in modeling, mathematics that can be connected with reality,\" LeCun said on \"The Information Bottleneck\" podcast. \"You tend to learn this kind of stuff in engineering in some schools that's linked with computer science, but sort of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, et cetera.\"\n\nUniversities and computer science students continue to grapple with how to adapt their programs to the age of generative and increasingly agentic AI. Earlier this year, UC Berkeley professor Hany Farid described the struggle students face in finding jobs, compared to how graduates used to have \"the run of the place.\"\n\nLeaders in the field, including OpenAI's Bret Taylor, have stressed that computer science is about so much more than simply learning to code. Others, including Nobel Laureate Geoffrey Hinton, have stressed that learning critical thinking is what's the key to staying ahead of AI's advancements.\n\n\"Some skills that are always going to be valuable, like knowing some math, and some statistics, and some probability theory, knowing things like linear algebra that will always be valuable,\" Hinton recently told Business Insider. \"That's not knowledge that's going to disappear.\"\n\nLeCun jokingly pointed out that he did not initially study CS. He studied electrical engineering at ESIEE in Paris before earning a Ph.D. CS from the renowned Sorbonne Université in 1987. LeCun said some CS schools are linked to engineering programs, which tend to require more advanced math.\n\n\"Engineering disciplines, you know, in the US, you learn Calculus 1, 2, 3 that gives you a good basis, right?\" he said. In computer science, you can get away with just Calculus 1. That's not enough, right?\"\n\nEngineering also exposes students to concepts like control theory and signal processing, which LeCun said are \"really useful for things like AI.\"\n\nAll of this isn't to say basic programming should be thrown out, LeCun said. Vibe coding is nice, but it's not a substitute for fundamental knowledge.\n\n\"Obviously, you need to learn enough computer science to kind of program and use computers,\" he said. \"And even though AI is going to help you be more efficient at programming, you still need to know how to do this.\"",

    "fullText": "US law enforcement officers say Meta and Snapchat routinely delay or reject warrants. The companies disagree\n\nMax Osterman was 18 when he connected with a drug dealer on Snapchat who used the handle skyhigh.303. Max would message him whenever he wanted to buy Percocet, and they would meet. After about a year, and just days after their last exchange, Max collapsed. The pills he ordered had been laced with fentanyl. He died from the overdose in February 2021 at his home in Broomfield, Colorado.\n\nThe dealer continued selling prescription painkillers until 2023, when he was jailed on two drug distribution convictions. When handing down the sentence, the judge said he was responsible for four deaths, yet he never faced charges for supplying the pills that killed Max.\n\n“Snapchat never gave this critical evidence, never took action, never stopped the dealer who had been selling drugs on their platform for years before Max’s death and even after,” said Kim Osterman, his mother. “It took three separate requests from law enforcement for Snapchat to even respond, and when they did, they claimed there was no information.”\n\nA police report reviewed by the Guardian shows a delay in obtaining data from the dealer’s Snapchat account, which investigators said they needed to definitively link him to Max’s death. The report also states that Snapchat did not provide law enforcement with any content from Max’s account apart from his user information. When Colorado detectives first sent Snap Inc, the app’s parent company, a production of records request for account information on skyhigh.3o3, it took more than two months to receive a reply. When the response did arrive, Snap said it would not comply, citing a grammar technicality in the order. The inclusion of a “/,” the company argued, made the request “ambiguous”, according to a field case report from the Broomfield police department. The company eventually sent detectives information on the drug dealer’s account, skyhigh.303, in response to several separate warrants law enforcement filed in the year after Max’s death. No content from Max’s Snapchat account was ever provided to law enforcement, the police report states.\n\nThe Guardian has reviewed four cases where Snap Inc and Meta have delayed or declined to comply with warrants and subpoenas requesting information related to serious crimes linked to their platforms. Eight law enforcement officers interviewed have said multiple cases reviewed by the Guardian are emblematic of a wider problem they face with the companies, which often delay or decline to comply with warrants and subpoenas requesting information related to serious crimes on their platforms. According to court records, police reports and interviews with law enforcement officials, these refusals and lags can derail investigations into crimes ranging from fentanyl deaths to child sexual exploitation.\n\nA Snap Inc statement reads: “Our deepest sympathies go out to the families who have suffered such heartbreaking loss. A critical part of our efforts to help keep our community safe includes our longstanding and crucial engagement with law enforcement to help bring criminals to justice for the harm they cause our community. In both instances, Snap responded to multiple legal requests relating to the cases, so the suggestion that we did not support these investigations is simply inaccurate.”\n\nMeta said in a statement: “We strongly disagree with the assertions made in this story, and our fast cooperation with law enforcement led to arrests in the cases in question. Last year, we received over 9,000 emergency requests from US authorities and resolved them within an average of 67 minutes – and even more quickly for cases involving child safety and suicide. To protect user privacy, it’s important that we follow appropriate legal processes and request clarifications where necessary, but we work to support law enforcement as much as we can.”\n\nThe spokesperson added that Meta produced data in 88% of the nearly 75,000 requests it received from US authorities between July and December last year.\n\nIn a statement, the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC) called for clearer rules, faster processes and collaboration between law enforcement, lawyers and tech leaders reaching across the aisle.\n\n“Every day of delay puts a child at risk. It can exacerbate damage and even cost lives. We can’t afford to let the delays continue,” said Shawnna Hoffman, chief executive of ICMEC and a former legal technology expert witness. “But the problems now are real, and if cooperation and alignment can’t rapidly make these processes happen faster, then we would in principle support new regulations to force greater urgency.”\n\nWhen platforms are not responsive, suspects can go unidentified and arrests can be postponed, giving perpetrators more opportunities to offend and putting the public at risk, said eight federal and state law enforcement officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\n“These suspects are often transient. They might be at college for a semester, or just crashing with a friend, and by the time we get the data, they’ve already moved on,” said one officer with the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) taskforce, a national network of law enforcement agencies dedicated to combating online child exploitation. “If we’d had the information in time, they would have been arrested. Instead, we show up and hear, ‘They moved out a few weeks ago.’”\n\nFor ICAC officers pursuing cases of online exploitation, two companies stand out for their lack of cooperation: Meta and Snap. Investigators say some refusals are based on minor technicalities. “It can be something as minimal as a dash or comma,” said another ICAC officer. “It feels like they’re playing legal games. We’ve had objections from companies over clerical details that delay cases for a while.”\n\nSuch lags can be especially devastating in cases of online child sexual exploitation and the production and distribution of child sexual abuse material, said members of law enforcement specializing in cases of crimes against children.\n\nIn June, a Boston court sentenced Charlese Horton, a registered sex offender, to at least 25 years in prison for kidnapping and assaulting a boy lured to meet them through Facebook. Investigators say solving the case was made more difficult when Meta did not fully comply with the subpoenas they sent as exigent requests for information they urgently needed to identify Horton.\n\n“It can be weeks or months when we send a search warrant for data before companies get back to us,” said a current ICAC commanding officer. “When we are finally able to knock on the door and find the child victim, we determine that there has been additional abuse since we were waiting on that search warrant return.”\n\nSubpoenas and warrants form the backbone of these investigations, allowing law enforcement to obtain evidence from social media profiles. Subpoenas can be issued by a court or government agency without needing a judge’s approval. With regards to social media, these legal orders can compel a company to provide basic account information such as a user’s name, email address or IP login records. They generally cannot access private communications. Warrants, which require judicial approval and a demonstration of probable cause, permit investigators to obtain sensitive material, such as private messages, photos and videos.\n\nPart of the tension between police and tech platforms stems from the legal framework that governs digital privacy and access to communications in the United States.\n\nThe fourth amendment, which prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures” by the government, requires law enforcement to show probable cause and secure a judge’s approval before accessing private communications. In practice, that means investigators must obtain a search warrant before companies like Meta and Snap release sensitive material such as private messages.\n\nLayered on top of that barrier is the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) and its Stored Communications Act (SCA) provision, which set rules for how companies store and disclose user data. Advocates for digital privacy say this law serves as one of the only federal protections in a country that relies on a haphazard patchwork of statutes to govern online behavior.\n\nCritics say the law is outdated, as it was written decades before social media or smartphones existed and includes ambiguities that tech companies use to slow-walk or reject requests.\n\n“They are looking for reasons not to give information,” said a former commander of a state ICAC taskforce, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Big tech is going to protect their companies first. Their priority it’s not to share information. It’s to protect themselves from any liability.”\n\nOfficials say this resistance is unique to big tech. Law enforcement officials characterized the response of industries like banking as much quicker, a matter of days rather than weeks or months. While entities that refuse could theoretically be held in contempt, tech firms bank on low appetite from law enforcement to take them on, said law enforcement officials.\n\n“You send a grand jury subpoena to them, and they don’t give anything back,” said a lieutenant from ICAC. “Or sometimes they say, ‘We don’t have anything for what you requested, or we can’t find anything based on your request,’ and they won’t tell you why.”\n\nIn May, the Colorado governor, Jared Polis, vetoed a state bill on children’s online safety in the face of heavy lobbying from across industries. He cited the bill’s potential to “erode privacy, freedom and innovation” as the reason for his veto. The bill included a mandate for a 72-hour deadline for social media companies to respond to police requests, and to provide direct hotlines for law enforcement.\n\nTestifying in support of the bill before the state’s Senate judiciary committee in April, Brian Mason, the district attorney for Adams and Broomfield counties, where Max Osterman lived, stated that social media companies “regularly” failed to respond to legal documents they had been served in Colorado. Warrants, he said, often vanish into “a black hole”.\n\n“They’re massive social media companies that don’t seem to care when they get a valid warrant from a jurisdiction like mine in Colorado,” said Mason.\n\nIn child sex trafficking cases, limited access to digital records not only deepens the trauma for victims but also makes it harder to investigate crimes, members of law enforcement said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials note that when cases involve traumatized victims, their cooperation with investigations can be temporary. To avoid the investigation relying solely on the victim’s testimony, law enforcement focuses on building cases through digital evidence.\n\nEven in emergency cases – when police have reasonable grounds to believe someone is in imminent danger and file what they dub an “exigent request”, which is a legal demand meant to trigger immediate compliance – tech companies often pick and choose which requests to honor, according to five members of law enforcement. Investigators say those decisions come at a cost to public safety.\n\nBoston police’s investigation into Charlese Horton began after a 14-year-old boy was kidnapped and assaulted at gunpoint in an alley in the city’s Dorchester neighborhood. Four months later, the same boy was kidnapped again. He reported the attacks to police, and two more boys soon came forward with similar accounts. None of the victims knew each other, but all had been contacted through Facebook accounts tied to four aliases the attacker controlled, according to court documents.\n\nDetectives subpoenaed Meta for data on four accounts. Meta refused to honor the exigency requests for two of the accounts being used, without explanation, said two members of law enforcement. That decision, investigators said, likely allowed additional victims to go undiscovered.\n\n“Meta shouldn’t be the arbiter of what is and isn’t exigent,” said one member of law enforcement dealing with the case. “This was the company making its own judgment about whether we had an exigency case.”\n\nA statement from Meta asserts the company fully cooperated with the Boston police investigation.\n\n“Meta scrutinizes every law enforcement request, as bad actors have been known to use social engineering to access government email accounts so they can request information from tech companies,” a spokesperson said.\n\nIn a statement, Meta asserted that the two accounts it did not provide information on were actually duplicate requests. Law enforcement officers interviewed, however, dispute that characterization.\n\nLaw enforcement has no direct line to communicate with some companies to question decisions or press their case further. For Meta and Snap, requests are routed through a web portal that offers no phone number and no direct access to the employees deciding whether to release evidence, a point of frustration mentioned by almost all members of law enforcement who spoke to the Guardian.\n\n“We make it as easy as possible for law enforcement to submit legal requests via an online portal and provide regular training sessions to the FBI and US local law enforcement on how to send in valid requests,” said a Meta spokesperson. “Our dedicated law enforcement response team in the US is also in ongoing contact with law enforcement to support them on live cases as needed, and our legal teams are regularly in touch with prosecutors and investigators to help with legal issues.”\n\nWhen Michigan teen Jordan DeMay died by suicide after being targeted by Nigerian sextortion scammers on Instagram in 2022, Meta initially declined the Marquette county sheriff’s detectives’ requests, filed as exigent, for the transcripts of DeMay’s direct messages on the platform. This meant his family had to wait 48 hours for crucial details about why he died, and the sextortionists were able to continue to target other victims.\n\n“Possibly it wasn’t considered an emergency because Jordan was already dead,” said John DeMay, Jordan’s father. “It was only when the FBI got involved that the warrant was accepted.”\n\nDeMay, who now has a copy of the transcript of the conversation between Jordan and the sextortionists, said it is obvious from the dialogue how urgent the situation was.\n\n“They wrote to Jordan, ‘I’m gonna watch you die a miserable death.’ And, Jordan replies to say, ‘I’m killing myself.’ And they say, ‘Good, do it now,’” said DeMay. “After reading that transcript and knowing that the sextortionist’s account was still active, and somebody had already died, there’s no reason that Meta should have not given that information. There’s zero reason for that.”\n\nIn its statement, Meta noted that the justice department had publicly praised the company for cooperating with the FBI investigation into Jordan’s sextortionists. The company did not, however, address the early delays in the case, when the investigation was still being handled by local police.\n\nEven when companies do comply with warrants, the information they provide can be of little use. On 19 December 2024, 16-year-old Avery Ping died in Olympia, Washington, of a drug overdose after buying what he thought was ecstasy over Snapchat. The pills turned out to be a lethal mix of fentanyl, amphetamine and methamphetamine.\n\nAvery’s drug dealer had been under law enforcement surveillance since October 2024 in relation to other narcotics cases. Local police sent a warrant for the dealer’s Snapchat account data to Snap Inc on 5 November 2024 and waited 10 days. They did not receive a response from Snap until 25 November, when the company sent a file that law enforcement couldn’t open, said Aaron Ping, Avery’s father.\n\n“The detective told me they needed specific software to open it, and Snap didn’t give instructions on this,” said Ping. Ultimately, law enforcement could not open the file until early December.\n\n“Snap impeded on a big investigation on the dealer before Avery died. This guy was a prolific dealer, and had surveillance on his house, and they just were waiting for the Snapchat records,” said Ping. “The guy should have been in jail. Avery should be alive.”\n\nSnap Inc did not provide a response to these allegations.\n\n“Every day of delay means children remain in danger who could have been rescued, and there’s no legal consequence for dragging their feet,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project. “We need public visibility into how these companies perform. We need mandatory public reporting on response times and compliance rates. Self-regulation has failed – it’s time for lawmakers to act.”",

    "fullText": "From celebrity endorsements to digital fatigue, the once-obsolete white wire has become a fashion statement and a quiet act of opting out\n\nWith white-wired headphones endorsed by celebrities including Lily-Rose Depp, Paul Mescal, Bella Hadid and Apple Martin, a growing number of people are breaking away from wireless listening.\n\nFor inspiration, there is the Instagram account @wireditgirls, or a Balenciaga campaign featuring the model Mona Tougaard reclining bed, wired headphones in place.\n\nDaniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at British Vogue, is familiar with the trend. “[It says] ‘I’m very effortless. I’m very nonchalant,” he says. “It’s become a real styleable accessory.”\n\nBut in a culture where the forward march of technology is often treated as compulsory, wired headphones represent more than aesthetics. “It’s an analogue way of opting out – of both tech but also life,” says Rodgers. “They’re visible in a way that AirPods aren’t. There is a sense of ‘do not disturb’.”\n\nThat symbolism is on full display on the cover of New York magazine’s latest issue, which features celebrities riding the subway: Debbie Harry with the Geese frontman Cameron Winter, Ben Stiller with the Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns and Macaulay Culkin with the SubwayTakes presenter Kareem Rahma. The real story, however, is not the star power but the shared accessory in each image: wired headphones.\n\nThe pictures were taken by Hannah La Follette Ryan, the Brooklyn-based photographer behind the Instagram account @SubwayTakes, which documents New Yorkers on public transport. She says: “I see the revival as an extension of digital fatigue. Who wants another glitchy expensive gadget to charge?”\n\nPrice is clearly part of the appeal of wired headphones – Apple’s EarPods cost £17 compared with £99 for AirPods – but nostalgia is also a factor.\n\n“We’re seeing retro tech come back,” says Tom Morgan-Freelander, the deputy editor of the technology magazine Stuff. “And as part of that, brands are starting to bring back wired headphones.”\n\nHe says some younger consumers are switching to wired for sound quality, which is typically better with cables. “Bluetooth became the norm, and there was an acceptance that, for wireless convenience, you’re going to lose a bit of quality,” he adds.\n\nThen there is the issue of tangles. While wireless headphones are stored neatly in a case, wired varieties are often found in a knot at the bottom of a bag.\n\nLa Follette Ryan suggests this is part of the appeal. “The tangle is inevitable,” she says. “Think of a headphone knot as a more user-friendly Rubik’s Cube. Relish the opportunity to slow down and solve a little puzzle.”\n\nIf wired headphones have become the choice of the fashion-conscious despite these inconveniences, that could change soon. AirPods remain the bestseller at Currys but the retailer reports sales of Beats Solo 4 over-ear headphones have risen by 193% since last year.\n\nMorgan-Freelander also points to the £20 FiiO Snowsky Wind, a design that looks like the earphones worn with a Sony Walkman in the 1980s.\n\nRodgers still believes wired headphones have the edge. “Even though we are constantly being [sold upgrades], there’s a sort of disengagement [with wired headphones], which is always really hot, right?” he says. “You never want to look like you’re too into anything.”\n\nLa Follette Ryan, however, thinks there is room for every option. “I just bought a Discman and Sony headphones,” she says, “but I will always keep my wired headphones for sharing an earbud with a friend.”",

    "description": "Teenagers, Alexandr Wang argues, have a built-in edge.",
    "fullText": "Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk.\n\nAlexandr Wang—who became the world’s youngest self-made billionaire at 24—is now, at 28, running one of the most ambitious AI efforts in Silicon Valley. In his first 60 days at Meta, he built a 100-person lab he described to TBPN hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays as “smaller and more talent dense than any of the other labs.”\n\nHis goal: nothing less than superintelligence.\n\nWang, with his aerial view of the industry, has advice for kids, especially those in Gen Alpha now entering middle school: Forget gaming, sports, or traditional after-school hobbies.\n\n“If you are like 13 years old, you should spend all of your time vibe coding,” he said in his recent TBPN interview. “That’s how you should live your life.”\n\nFor Wang, the reasoning is simple. Every engineer, himself included, is now writing code he believes will be obsolete within five years.\n\n“Literally all the code I’ve written in my life will be replaced by what will be produced by an AI model,” he said.\n\nThat realization has left him, in his words, “radicalized by AI coding.” What matters most now isn’t syntax, or learning a particular language, but time spent experimenting with and steering AI tools.\n\n“It’s actually an incredible moment of discontinuity,” Wang said. “If you just happen to spend 10,000 hours playing with the tools and figuring out how to use them better than other people, that’s a huge advantage.”\n\nTeenagers have a clear advantage over adults: time and freedom to immerse themselves in new technology. And while in the past, entrepreneurial teenagers leveraged this time to be “sneaker flippers” or run Minecraft servers, Wang says the focus should now be on the code.\n\nHe compares the moment to the dawn of the PC revolution. The Bill Gateses and Mark Zuckerbergs of the world had an “immense advantage” simply because they grew up tinkering with the earliest machines.\n\n“That moment is happening right now,” Wang said. “And the people who spend the most time with it will have the edge in the future economy.”\n\nWang isn’t coy about Meta’s ambitions. He calls the company’s infrastructure, scale, and product distribution unmatched.\n\n“We have the business model to support building literally hundreds of billions of dollars of compute,” he said.\n\nHis team, just over 100 people, is deliberately designed to be “smaller and more talent dense” than rivals. “The other labs are like 10 times bigger,” Wang said, but their lab had “cracked” coders.\n\nThe lab is split into three pillars: research, product, and infrastructure. Research builds the models Wang says will “ultimately be superintelligent.” Product ensures they get distributed across billions of users through Meta’s platforms. And infrastructure focuses on what he calls “literally the largest data centers in the world.”\n\nWang is particularly excited about hardware. Like many Meta executives now, he points to the company’s new smart glasses, which had a hilariously foppish demo, as the “natural delivery mechanism for superintelligence.”\n\nPlaced right next to the human senses, they will merge digital perception with cognition.\n\n“It will literally feel like cognitive enhancement,” Wang said. “You will gain 100 IQ points by having your superintelligence right next to you.”\n\nVibe coding is the shorthand for this shift: using natural language prompts to generate and iterate on code. Rather than writing complex syntax, users describe their intent, and AI produces functioning prototypes.\n\nThe concept is spreading across Silicon Valley’s C-suites. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has said he can now test ideas in 20 minutes, instead of burning weeks of engineering cycles. Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed that AI already generates more than 30% of new code at the company, calling it the biggest leap in software creation in 25 years.\n\nWang takes that further. For him, vibe coding isn’t just a productivity hack, but a future cultural mandate. What matters isn’t the code itself — it’s the hours of intuition-building that come from pushing AI tools to their limits, which is why he urges Gen Alpha to start early.\n\n“The role of an engineer is just very different now than it was before,” he said.\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on September 19, 2025.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Lawsuit is the first UK case of its kind, with Ros and Mark Dowey accusing Meta of ‘putting profit before our young people’\n\nThe parents of a 16-year-old who took his own life after he fell victim to a sextortion gang on Instagram are suing Meta for the alleged wrongful death of their son, in the first UK case of its kind.\n\nMurray Dowey died in December 2023 at his family home in Dunblane, after being tricked into sending intimate pictures to an Instagram contact. He thought it was a girl his own age, but it turned out to be overseas criminals involved in financially motivated sexual extortion.\n\nSpeaking as the lawsuit was filed in Delaware, where Meta Platforms is incorporated, Murray’s parents Ros and Mark said: “We know what we’re up against. But it’s time social media companies took accountability for what they’ve done to our young people.\n\n“It’s not just sextortion, they’re causing multiple harms, and they’ve been allowed to get away with it.”\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Delaware superior court by the US-based Social Media Victims Law Center on behalf of the Doweys, as well as the family of Levi Maciejewski, a 13-year-old from Pennsylvania who was also a victim of sextortion.\n\nIt states that the boys’ deaths were “the foreseeable result of Meta’s design decisions and repeated refusals to implement affordable, available and identified safety features due to Meta’s prioritisation of engagement over user safety”.\n\nAccording to the complaint, these design flaws include “collection of personal data without informed consent”, and use of that data to program recommendation products “it knew [were] operating in a manner that recommended teen Instagram users to sextortionists who Meta itself already had identified as predators”.\n\nThe suit alleges Meta’s “failure to safeguard user privacy, including through its continued sharing of Follower and Following data … even after Meta knew that this engagement-focused product feature was resulting in sextortion-related deaths of teen users across the world”.\n\nIt also contends that Meta made “false and misleading statements designed to convince children and parents that Instagram was safe for teens at the same time that internal testing showed that Instagram was matchmaking children to adult predators”.\n\nWhile four British parents are suing TikTok for the alleged wrongful deaths of their children as a result of attempting the viral “blackout challenge” in 2021, this is the first UK case to centre on the crime of sextortion.\n\nCases have risen sharply in recent years across the UK, US and Australia, with teenage boys and young men typically the victims of loosely organised cybercriminal gangs often based in south-east Asia and west Africa.\n\nEarlier this year, the Guardian reported that children as young as 11 to 13 were being targeted for the first time, as criminals behind extortion attempts cast their nets wider in an attempt to trap victims.\n\nThe Doweys’ lawyer, Matthew Bergman, who set up the Social Media Victims Law Center in 2021, said Meta was involved in all the US-based sextortion cases that he had filed to date.\n\n“There are reasons for that. It is a product defect issue and Meta knows it. This complaint cites Meta records only recently made known to the public through [previous joint civil proceedings] and those documents make the deliberateness of these design defects, lack of safeguards, and failures to warn clear,” he said.\n\nReflecting on the two years since his son’s passing, Mark Dowey said: “Nothing’s really changed since Murray died. These predators can still get at our children.”\n\nAs well as their battle to hold Meta to account, Ros and Mark have regularly spoken out about the dangers of sextortion in the hope of raising awareness among parents and young people.\n\nRos said: “As a parent who has first-hand experience of how devastating the flaws can be, you have a duty to warn other parents. You think your kids are safe looking at pictures on Instagram and they’re not.”\n\nMark said that the lawsuit was “a way to get a wee bit of justice for Murray”: “There has to be accountability here because those statements are absolutely damning. [Meta] have known that their products are killing children by their unsafe design and they haven’t done anything about it. They chose to put profit before our young people.”\n\nInstagram, which has previously condemned sextortion as a “horrific” crime, rolled out new safety features – which included preventing screenshots or screen recordings of disappearing images and videos – specifically to protect children from scammers in October 2024.\n\nMeta announced last October that accounts it detects as showing signals of suspicious behaviour would not be able to see people’s follower or following lists, removing their ability to exploit this feature, and would be blocked from being able to request to follow teens.\n\nIn June alone, accounts were blocked one million times. This July, it introduced new block and report features for direct messages.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta said: “Sextortion is a horrific crime. We support law enforcement to prosecute the criminals behind it and we continue to fight them on our apps on multiple fronts.\n\n“Since 2021, we’ve placed teens under 16 into private accounts when they \n\n“We work to prevent accounts showing suspicious behaviour from following teens and avoid recommending teens to them.\n\n“We also take other precautionary steps, like blurring potentially sensitive images sent in DMs and reminding teens of the risks of sharing them, and letting people know when they’re chatting to someone who may be in a different country.”",

    "fullText": "Creators and publishers have long worried about Meta's ability to throttle links to outside content. Now, the company is testing out a new scheme that effectively puts link-sharing behind a paywall for creators on Facebook.\n\nUnder the test, a Meta Verified subscription will determine how many links a creator can share another profile per month. According to a screenshot shared by social meda consultant Matt Navarra, creators in the test recently received a notification from Meta informing them that \"certain Facebook profiles without Meta Verified, including yours, will be limited to sharing links in 2 organic posts per month.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Meta confirmed the test to Engadget. The test is currently affecting an unspecified number of creators and pages using \"professional mode\" on Facebook. Publishers aren't affected for now. \"This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nWhile Meta seems to be trying to downplay the significance of the test, it's a notable shift for the company. Many creators and businesses rely on Facebook and reducing their ability to send traffic to outside websites could be a significant hit. Many creators are already frustrated that the company puts its better customer service features behind the Meta Verified subscription, which starts at $14.99/month. Making link-sharing a premium feature as well would be even more unpopular.\n\nHave a tip for Karissa?

    "fullText": "As winter temps drop, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski is sharing some cold, hard facts.\n\nThe 57-year-old fast-food executive recently shared his top career tip in a viral Instagram video, warning that it might \"hurt your feelings.\"\n\n\"Remember, nobody cares about your career as much as you do,\" Kempczinski said.\n\n\"This idea that there's somebody out there who's looking out for you, who's going to make sure that you get that opportunity, who puts you in the right thing — great if it happens,\" he said. \"You've got to make things happen for yourself.\"\n\nA post shared by Chris Kempczinski (@chrisk_mcd)\n\nKempczinski is, of course, not the first corporate leader to make this observation.\n\nSeveral, including Business Insider founder Henry Blodget, have for years recommended that workers \"be the CEO of your career.\"\n\n\"When people enter the workforce, they often imagine that their job and career success and satisfaction is someone else's responsibility,\" Blodget wrote in 2023.\n\nBlodget said that some school and early-career situations involve predictable requirements and progressions, often with a mentor whose job it is to help you succeed. However, that model often stops working sooner or later, leaving the individual solely responsible for their own direction.\n\nKempczinski's comments also come amid a broader shift away from loyalty between employees and employers, a shift that was probably best summarized earlier this year in a memo from AT&T CEO John Stankey.\n\n\"I understand that some of you may have started your tour with this company expecting an 'employment deal' rooted in loyalty, tenure, and conformance with the associated compensation, work structure, and benefits,\" Stankey said. \"We have consciously shifted away from some of these elements and towards a more market-based culture — focused on rewarding capability, contribution, and commitment.\"\n\nIn an earlier video, Kempczinski shared a key tip to help workers get control over their time, energy, and attention: \"Be organized.\"\n\nKempczinski said he keeps a tidy email inbox, computer, and workspace.\n\n\"Staying organized is a way to make me stay focused,\" he said.\n\nTaken together, it's safe to say that you should keep track of what you need to do for your own life and career because nobody else is going to do it for you.",

    "fullText": "If you miss the days of gathering around the TV surfing channels, you're in luck.\n\nInstagram launched Instagram for TV on Tuesday, bringing its popular Reels content to the big screen via Amazon Fire TV devices.\n\nThe app, which is first being rolled out in the US, groups Reels into channels, including trending comedy, sports, or hidden travel gems. Users can choose a channel and start watching, with the Reels playing automatically.\n\nInstagram for TV is part of the platform's ongoing effort to adapt to the ways users are connecting via the app. The company said in a press release that it has heard from its community that \"watching Reels together is more fun,\" so the product was designed with that social aspect in mind.\n\nTessa Lyons, VP of product at Instagram, told Business Insider that the team heard from users who were finding ways to cast their Reels to the TV so they could watch them with friends.\n\n\"People already want to get together and connect with each other over Reels on the TV,\" she said, adding that this allows them to actually share with friends. \"Not just DMing them, but actually be together enjoying them.\"\n\nLyons said she personally felt the need for this feature when she realized, while on the couch watching TV with her husband, she was often actually watching Reels on her phone instead.\n\nInstagram for TV is in a testing phase, with plans to eventually expand to more devices and countries. Instagram said this early test is designed to learn which features are best for shared viewing on a TV screen.\n\nFuture features could include using your phone as a remote, more intuitive ways to surf channels, and channels that combine your and your friends' interests into one shared feed, like Instagram's Blend feature.\n\nUp to five Instagram accounts can be connected to the Amazon Fire TV device. Once you click into your account, Instagram will automatically group Reels into a channel based on your interests.\n\nLyons said Instagram's North Star has always been \"helping people connect with their friends over creativity,\" adding that the goal has remained even as the platform and the way people use it have changed.\n\n\"The way in which people share evolves,\" she said. \"I think that's natural.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Meta is testing an Instagram TV app, starting with Amazon devices.",
    "fullText": "As I write this, I'm coming off a lunch break that lasted a little too long because I couldn't stop watching YouTube Shorts on my TV. And if Instagram Reels are your own vertical video poison—and you own an Amazon Fire TV device—you can now do the same. Starting today, you can download the new Instagram for TV app to watch Reels on your big screen via a dedicated interface that should be way more natural than simply casting the mobile app from your phone.\n\nCurrently exclusive to Amazon devices, the Instagram for TV app supports up to five accounts and comes with full functionality for searching for Reels and profiles, as well as liking Reels and browsing comments or reactions (although text posts and photo posts are not included). Unlike on the standard mobile feed, Amazon says \"Reels are organized into channels tuned to your interests,\" which you can see from a horizontal home screen.\n\nThese channels are somewhat similar to the YouTube Shorts interface that's baked into the standard YouTube TV app, showing you a small selection of shorts you can choose from based on a thumbnail. Examples include \"For you\" and \"Popular with Friends,\" but you're also still able to swipe past any Reel to your heart's content, and let the algorithm take you for a ride. A post from Meta also says channels could include Reels tailored to a specific topics that match your interests, like \"sports highlights\" or \"hidden travel gems,\" although the company hasn't provided any screenshots or videos showing this off quite yet.\n\nAccording to Meta, the new app is currently \"an early test.\" It's starting with U.S.-based Amazon devices, and the company says it will \"expand to more devices and countries\" as it learns more (Amazon also says it's the \"first\" company to get the app, implying others will get their own versions in the future).\n\nCurrently, the Instagram for TV app is available in the Amazon Appstore for the following devices:\n\nFire TV Stick 4K Max (1st and 2nd Gen)\n\nIn addition to adding channels to the Reels experience, Meta says that future updates may also add ways to use your phone as a remote, share feeds with friends, and explore \"a more intuitive way to channel surf.\"\n\nInstagram for TV leaves TikTok as the last major short form video platform without a dedicated TV app, although The Information reported earlier this Summer that TikTok is looking to catch up soon.\n\nWhile official Instagram for TV support is currently limited to Amazon devices, that doesn't mean you're out of luck if you don't have a Fire TV stick or display. To watch Instagram Reels on your TV without using the Instagram for TV app, open Instagram Reels on your phone and start browsing. Next, pull up your phone's quick settings menu by swiping down from the top-right corner.\n\nOn iOS, search for the screen mirroring button (which looks like two overlapping screens), and on Android, search for a button that says something like \"Cast\" (it will vary depending on your device). Tap it to see any compatible wireless screen mirroring devices nearby, which will let you view the mobile Instagram app on a TV screen, and even send audio over with it. It's not foolproof—my LG OLED TV works with iOS Screen Mirroring but not Pixel casting—but it's worth a shot.",

    "description": "Companies like AT&T, Amazon, JPMorgan, and Instagram have a RTO problem: there's not enough places for workers to sit.",
    "fullText": "Your mileage may vary on Instagram's recent corporate culture updates (to the extent you care at all). Fewer meetings: excellent. Faster decisions: great. Return-to-office five days a week: woof, but such is life. Return-to-office five days a week when there aren't enough places for people to sit: What??? At least Instagram chief Adam Mosseri is aware of the issue — in a memo to staff, he said New York employees get a pass on the butts-in-seats mandate until the company figures out where all those butts will go. The timeline is TBD.\n\nAfter the pandemic-driven wave of remote work, many employees are being dragged, kicking and screaming, back into the office. For workers at companies such as Amazon, JPMorgan, and Starbucks, the perpetual workday-in-your-pajamas party is over. The odd wrinkle is that in some cases, it's not just employees who aren't ready to be back at work every day. Their employers aren't ready for it, either, at least logistically. They're telling people to come to the office without having the actual space for them to be there. So, workers are competing for desks, setting up shop in common areas, or refusing to show up altogether until their employers have a more well-thought-out plan. It's emblematic of the broader issues surrounding RTO mandates: Many companies are implementing them without a solid logic as to how or why and alienating their employees — intentionally or not — in the process.\n\nMultiple big-name companies have had some small-time whoopsie daisies on back-to-office space constraints.\n\nIn late 2024, AT&T acknowledged in a memo to employees that they would not offer \"one-for-one seating per employee\" as they were called back in. At the time, employees told Business Insider that workers were filling up hallways or hanging out in the cafeteria in order to check the attendance box. Around the same time, Amazon wound up delaying its RTO ask for some employees because their spots weren't ready. Not only were there not enough desks, but workers also complained that offices and meeting rooms were lacking in chairs.\n\nEarlier this year, JPMorgan employees required to come back found themselves in a sort of Hunger Games situation for spots, showing up extra early and leaving behind possessions to mark their spots and signing on from vacation to try to book scarce desk space. On Reddit, some employees described the situation as \"pure chaos,\" and complained of being unable to accomplish work because \"half the morning is spent on desk f***ery.\" One JPMorgan employee told me that they often find themselves seated far away from the rest of their team because someone else reserved their regular spot, and there are often lines for the women's bathroom at the New York office where they work.\n\nHow much office space is needed and what to do with it is a perpetual conundrum. Just look at all the hate for open-office floor plans. But the pandemic added more complications to an already complicated situation. As the RTO wave has picked up momentum, space has become a significant issue at many companies, both large and small, including giant federal agencies. So what gives?\n\nSome of it is simply a result of poor planning, explains Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work. Decisions are made at the executive level without proper consultation with facilities personnel, who have detailed information on desks and seating. \"It's not as easy as adding up people and comparing to desks, as it matters which cities and offices they are in,\" he says in an email. \"Kind of like airlines that some flights may be overbooked and others half-empty.\"\n\nSome of the shortages may be on purpose. Strict RTO mandates are often viewed, at least in part, as a soft layoff — companies expect some level of attrition when they force people back, even if they won't openly admit it. \"Having insufficient seating is all part of the plan,\" Bloom says. \"If you want a 10% head count reduction, you only need seating for 90% of the folks.\"\n\nBrian Elliott, the CEO of Work Forward, a future of work think tank and consultancy, says that when executives started to think about bringing people back to the office in about 2021, many were surprised to learn how low the percentage of their workforce actually showing up on a given day had been pre-2020, because of sick time, vacations, workers visiting customers, etc. \"So your average CFO looks at this and goes, 'It's a 60% utilized asset on average. Why am I doing assigned seating? Why not go to hoteling and hot desking?'\" Elliott says. Add in the belief that at least some sort of remote work would stick around (especially as companies offered it as a perk to attract workers in a tight labor market), and many companies decided to downsize their overall office footprint to save some cash. Now, as businesses decide they want everyone back in full-time, they're realizing they axed too many desks.\n\nSome companies are moving in the other direction, and are on the hunt for more spacious offices. But that process takes time, and economic uncertainty has leaders nervous to go too big. Commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE says economic jitters, high interest rates, and slow growth in in-person jobs has been somewhat of a drag on office leasing activity this year, but the overall trend is up: A growing majority of its office occupants expect to maintain or expand their space over the next three years, while the share anticipating downsizing is steadily decreasing.\n\n\"Companies are taking more spaces, so clearly, they are very comfortable in expansionary mode,\" says Henry Chin, global head of research at CBRE.\n\nThat doesn't mean employees should expect to be drowning in spacious offices anytime soon — businesses are driving toward higher people-to-desk ratios, not lower. So instead of a single assigned desk for every person, there are multiple people sharing. Per CBRE, the most common ratio today is 1-1.49 employees per seat, and the plan is to up it. \"Ultimately, they want to have the higher ratio, that two or three people share a desk,\" Chin says.\n\nIn other words, however you feel about hotel desking, you might want to get used to it.\n\nThe RTO battle in America is proving to be quite the push-and-pull. Remote work is falling, but it hasn't gone away: According to Bloom's tracker, about 25% of work is being done from home in the US, compared to 62% in the spring of 2020, the height of the pandemic, and well under 10% prior to the lockdowns. And just because companies ask workers to come back doesn't mean they're all complying — there's a delta between what employers are asking, and employees are giving, RTO-wise. As the job market weakens, employees may be inclined to give in and commute more. You want your boss to see you enough that they at least feel a little guilty when they fire you.\n\nThese space-related headaches are reflective of broader questions about where and how it's best for people to work, and what sort of planning needs to be put into it. Some executives seem to be knee-jerk demanding people come back in without considering whether that's how their teams work best, or whether the infrastructure can handle it. A five-day-a-week office mandate isn't super helpful if teams are located all over the country and everyone's just sitting on video calls all day. Some companies are discovering they need more small meeting rooms, not just a few large ones, so people can gather if they are in the same place. And some are falling short on basic blocking and tackling — having working WiFi, or supplying sufficient monitors and equipment. In the internet age, it's a little tough to get work done when you don't have the internet itself, or a keyboard or a mouse.\n\nEmployers may be \"conflating productivity and effectiveness with proximity\" in insisting people show up full-time, explains Melissa Daimler, a corporate culture consultant. \"If I can see you and I know that you're working, then I feel good about how productive we are as a company.\" Much of the issue comes down to trust — businesses feeling confident that their people will get the work done when they're in the office collaborating and when they're at home for the day. \"It takes an extra kind of set of planning skills and a system that you put in place as a company and a team,\" she says.\n\nThe space problem is one that companies should fix, whether they actually will is another question. Your employees aren't going to love the return of long commutes and sad salad desk lunches, whatever you do, but they're probably going to be even more annoyed if, at the end of that commute, they find themselves eating that sad salad on the floor in the hallway, seated next to their laptop.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "Adtech company Fluency uses automation, and now AI agents, to run digital ad campaigns across the web, Meta, Google, TikTok, and more.",
    "fullText": "Adtech company Fluency has built a platform that helps brands and agencies automate their campaigns across Meta, TikTok, Google, and other platforms. Now, it aims to introduce AI agents to the mix.\n\nLarge brands and agencies typically manage campaigns across multiple platforms and ad buying tools, known as demand-side platforms, each with separate logins and interfaces.\n\nFounded in 2017 in Burlington, Vermont, Fluency created what it describes as a digital advertising operating system. It connects to the various platforms' application programming interfaces (APIs) and lets its customers manage their digital ads using a single workflow.\n\n\"It takes a lot of people, and hours, and button clicking to be able to effectively execute your advertising,\" Fluency CEO Mike Lane said in an interview with Business Insider.\n\nHe added that Fluency wanted to \"help simplify and streamline that, much like HubSpot or Salesforce\" did in the customer relationship management (CRM) space. Fluency's competitor set includes other campaign management and ad automation tools, such as Hootsuite, Smartly, and Sprinklr, though these companies tend to cater to larger advertisers and agencies.\n\nThe company said it manages around $3 billion in annual ad spend for brands and agencies, including Cox Automotive, Innocean, and The Johnson Group.\n\nFluency is set to announce on Tuesday that it has raised a $40 million Series A investment round, led and fully funded by Integrity Growth Partners.\n\nFluency said it plans to invest the funds in enhancing its agentic AI capabilities, which can autonomously oversee marketers' digital ad campaigns. This could mean AI agents automatically swapping out ad creatives or copy with better-performing versions, for example.\n\nFluency mostly uses Amazon's Bedrock generative AI models, as well as Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini, the company said.\n\nLane said that for agentic AI to work effectively for a marketer's digital advertising, the AI needs robust frameworks and structures to operate within, connections to all major media platforms, and for everything to be integrated into a single system.\n\nHe said these factors make Fluency well-positioned to be \"the premium platform for agentic\" AI in the digital ads space.\n\nCheck out the pitch deck Fluency used to secure its $40 million Series A investment, shared exclusively with Business Insider. Some of the slides have been omitted or redacted.\n\nFluency says marketers often use \"point solutions\" that don't interact with each other, which can also bring in issues around compliance and performance.\n\nFluency says ad strategists often have to cobble together several different tech solutions to handle tasks like targeting or reviewing campaign performance.\n\nFluency's platform aims to address these concerns as a kind of \"one-stop shop\" across various channels.\n\nThose attributes include a blue-chip client base and high customer-retention rates.\n\nThere's been a shift in budgets from big agency holding companies to independent agencies, though smaller firms have constrained resources, Fluency says.\n\nFluency says its \"serviceable addressable market\" is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11%, reaching $6.4 billion by 2028.\n\nFluency says its platform serves agencies and brands better than agency-developed tech, in-house channel management, legacy omni-channel tools, and point solutions.\n\nThe slide showcases how the Fluency platform integrates a marketer's own data, big media platforms, and DSPs using AI automation to manage campaigns and assess their performance.\n\nFluency says its tools can save customers time, improve ad performance, and boost their revenue.",

    "description": "Meta has given employees access to Google Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-5 alongside its own AI tools to help boost productivity.",
    "fullText": "In its push to create an \"AI-first\" workplace, Meta is expanding employees' access to tools from rivals such as Google and OpenAI, Business Insider has learned.\n\nThe social media giant has been encouraging employees to integrate AI tools into nearly everything they do, according to multiple internal documents and posts seen by Business Insider.\n\nOne of the company's priorities is to \"make AI core to how we work,\" Meta's chief information officer, Atish Banerjea, told employees in a June memo outlining a plan to use Meta's own models — which use the naming convention \"Llama\" — alongside products from other firms.\n\nIn November, a Meta engineer said in an internal post that all employees have access to Google's Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI's ChatGPT-5. The post included a list of AI tools Meta employees have access to, including their use cases. Business Insider has recreated the list below.\n\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed the revamped suite of AI tools and pointed to an earlier comment shared with Business Insider about AI adoption, stating: \"It's well-known that this is a priority, and we're focused on using AI to help employees with their day-to-day work.\"\n\nThe social media giant opened the floodgates to rival AI models in June.\n\nAmong those is an internal coding tool called Devmate that uses Anthropic's Claude, Business Insider previously reported. Google's Gemini and NotebookLM Pro are also available across the company to help employees \"work smarter and have more impact,\" Banerjea told employees in the June memo.\n\nMeta has invested tens of billions into its own consumer-facing AI models, and employees have access to an internal AI assistant called Metamate, which is built on its Llama models.\n\nAfter Meta struck a deal over the summer the startup Midjourney to weave its AI-image generator into its products and models, the company made the tool available to employees in October for \"concept and production uses\" to speed up design work and creative prototyping, according to an internal post ahead of the rollout, seen by Business Insider.\n\nGemini isn't the only Google tool Meta is embracing. The company migrated its internal productivity suite over the summer to Google Workspace — including Chat, Gmail, Docs, and Drive — describing the move in a June memo as a way to \"unlock AI-driven capabilities\" and better integrate with its expanding toolset.\n\nOn the engineering side, Meta has expanded access to agentic coding systems, adding Google's Gemini 3 Pro and exploring new integrations with tools like OpenAI's Codex CLI and Google's Gemini CLI. \"Rather than focusing on specific solutions, our strategy centers on outcomes: increasing productivity, accelerating development, and ensuring you have access to the best agentic coding experiences,\" Reality Labs executive Maher Saba told employees in a November memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nTo encourage adoption and experimentation, Meta has gamified the use of AI, Business Insider previously reported. Earlier this year, it launched an internal game called \"Level Up,\" which rewards employees with badges for using AI in different ways. Leaders are also tying performance to results achieved through AI, rewarding those who can prove \"AI-driven impact\" this year, and including it as part of performance reviews in 2026.\n\nHave a tip?
