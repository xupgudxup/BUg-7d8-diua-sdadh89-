    "description": "The most advanced and highly anticipated phone in the S26 series, now with a $200 Amazon gift card.",
    "fullText": "Right now, those in the Samsung ecosystem can take advantage of a pre-order deal on a brand-new Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra unlocked phone. $1,299 discount is the standard retail price, but Amazon is offering a free $200 gift card to sweeten the deal on the phone, which officially releases on March 11, 2026, and is available in four colors.\n\nThe Ultra is the largest and most feature-rich model in the S26 line, weighing close to half a pound. Its 5,000mAh battery is the largest of the lineup, and its 6.9-inch display is perfect for those who want more of an e-reader feel to their phone. This model comes with 512GB of storage, an S Pen, and the new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, which enables more AI features, stronger gaming,  better multitasking capabilities, and overall faster speeds than its predecessors.\n\nThe camera system is also the most advanced in the S26 series, with a 200-megapixel main sensor, a 50-megapixel ultrawide, and two dedicated telephoto lenses with 3x and 5x optical zoom that let you get closer without sacrificing image quality. The Ultra is also the only phone in the S26 lineup to feature the new privacy display, which is vetted by PCMag and limits the viewing angles so people can’t see the screen from off-angle, making it ideal for avoiding prying eyes. It can be used on the entire screen or just portions.\n\nIf you want the most powerful and largest Galaxy and don’t mind that it’s a little bulkier than the Plus and the S26, this unlocked Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra is your best bet with top-of-the-line performance in every area and AI baked in everywhere.",

    "fullText": "Samsung Unpacked 2026 is nearly upon us. On Wednesday, Feb. 25, Samsung will take the stage in San Francisco to make some pretty major product and feature announcements. Unlike some other big tech companies, however, Samsung isn't being 100% secretive here. The company has already told us that it will reveal the next Galaxy S Series, and while they haven't said exactly what it will be called, it's pretty safe to assume this will be the Galaxy S26 series. The rumors suggest Samsung has plenty of other updates up its sleeve, too, including the new Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy AI announcements.\n\nBased on the leaks and rumors, it seems the S26 series will likely be a small year-over-year update to the S25 series, which is largely to be expected from a smartphone OEM as big as Samsung. While there may not be too much incentive to update from the S25 series, users of older Galaxy devices, or older smartphones in general, may find the processor and camera upgrades worthwhile. There may also be unique features, like Privacy Display, which can make it more difficult for others to see your screen when they're not looking at it head-on. We'll have to see exactly which rumors pan out to know for sure.\n\nYou don't need to be seated in San Francisco in order to keep up with all the Samsung news, though. We'll be covering the event live as it happens, posting to this live blog throughout the day. That means we'll be reporting when Samsung reveals the Galaxy S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra; all the new features those devices come with; and any new accessories and AI advancements you can expect from the Samsung ecosystem. For all the latest Samsung Unpacked 2026 news, keep checking this live blog throughout Wednesday.",

    "title": "Samsung's New S26 'Privacy Display' Will Make Third-Party Privacy Screens Obsolete",
    "description": "Samsung just introduced the first built-in privacy screen for cell phones.",
    "fullText": "I have a bad habit, and you probably do too: When someone opens their phone near me, I instinctively look. I'm not looking for anything intentionally—my eyes glance involuntarily, hovering for a moment before I return someone's privacy—but I've seen everything from harmless wallpapers to lock codes, bank statements, and text messages during relationship fights.\n\nI'm not a nosy person, nor am I overly concerned about my own privacy when it becomes too inconvenient. But the most common form of privacy invasion is likely the simplest: glancing at someone's phone screen, or someone glancing at yours.\n\nYears ago, I protected my privacy with privacy screens on both my laptop and phone, but I let that practice lapse so much that I almost forgot privacy screens existed. Today, at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked, the company introduced the privacy screen I wanted all along.\n\nSamsung's new Privacy Display can narrow the pixel light on your phone screen so it's only visible to you. The feature can be toggled on and off, and it's also customizable by app, allowing some apps to be viewable to others while keeping sensitive apps, like your banking app or an HBO show, unviewable to passersby. When the Privacy Display feature is off, pixels are viewable from every angle, but when it's on, the pixel lights narrow to you. Essentially, you can control when you want people to see your phone from over your shoulder, which is probably rare compared to when you'd rather have your phone protected from side angles. The Privacy Display will be available on the new Galaxy S26 Ultra, but the feature is so useful that it was the most interesting announcement from Galaxy Unpacked, and once competitors catch on, I expect a built-in privacy screen to become the standard in smartphones. It doesn't take much to imagine third-party privacy screens soon becoming obsolete.\n\nAfter expensive device upgrades and buying a long list of accessories, adding a privacy screen protector can feel like a waste of money. To save a few bucks, I simply tell myself that I'll be more aware of my surroundings. Still, just yesterday on the subway, I noticed someone's harmless Shadow the Hedgehog screensaver, followed by their private, potentially embarrassing app notifications. Realistically, others have likely glanced at the same kind of information on my phone, too, no matter how \"aware of my surroundings\" I hope to be.\n\nSo far, the new Privacy Display appears to be available only on the new Galaxy S26 Ultra, which will have a starting price of $1,299. Hopefully, the feature will be adopted more broadly, including on the cheaper S26, which will start at $899, and the S26+, which will start at $1,099. I don't know what took phone manufacturers so long to build such a useful tool, but I would guess it comes down to focusing on clumsily forcing AI into features I'll rarely use. Samsung Unpacked had plenty of hamfisted AI announcements—you should check out the longer list of those—but the simple utility of the privacy display stole the show. And it's better late than never.",

    "title": "Samsung Is Very Confident in the Galaxy S26 Series' Cameras",
    "description": "The hardware hasn't really changed, but there've been some key upgrades this year.",
    "fullText": "It probably will come as no surprise that Samsung claims its new S26 series delivers \"the most powerful Galaxy experience yet.\" The company announced the new phones during its big Unpacked 2026 event, and, like most new smartphones these days, this year's models appear to be iterative updates to last year's S25 phones.\n\nThe company particularly touted the S26 series' cameras, but the interesting thing is, the camera hardware hasn't much changed. If you look at the on-paper specs, you'll mostly see the same numbers across the lens and sensor sizes. The S26 and S26+ have three rear cameras, while the S26 Ultra adds a fourth; all three phones have the same 12MP selfie camera. Really, the only hardware change is to the S26 Ultra's 200MP main camera, which now has an f/1.4 aperture, compared to the f/1.7 aperture on the S25 Ultra's 200MP camera. Otherwise, Samsung kept things pretty much the same.\n\nAnd yet, there are some clear advantages to the S26 series, especially the S26 Ultra. While the selfie cameras are the same as last year, they now use a new AI processor to bring out more detail: When there's too much light in a shot, the S26 series can add virtual light to balance out the image. These phones are also better than previous models at filming video in low-light conditions, expanding on the company's \"Nightography\" feature, which previously boosted the detail in photos; now, it works for video as well.\n\nSpeaking of video, Samsung says the S26 can automatically stabilize shots while maintaining a level image, even if you're not looking at the frame, using \"Super Steady with Horizontal Lock\" (catchy name!).\n\nIf you pick up the Ultra, you'll also get some pro video features. First, the phone supports the APV video codec, Samsung's pro video codec, ideal for professional editors. Presumably, shooting in 8K APV will produce some large file sizes, which is why it's great that the S26 Ultra supports recording to external storage, like the recent Pro iPhones. If shooting in log, you'll be able to apply LUTs to your footage, to customize the overall color-grading of your images.\n\nOne smaller upgrade is Ocean Mode, which takes detailed images in underwater environments. This feature was previously available to professionals only, but the S26 series gets it as part of the Expert RAW setting.\n\nSamsung added a surprise twist to Unpacked, revealing towards the end of the show that the entire livestream was filmed using S26 Ultras. That follows Apple's playbook of recording events with iPhones, though Apple doesn't do livestreams anymore. As far as I can tell, this is the first time a company like Samsung has livestreamed its entire presentation on one of its smartphone cameras. (Though both Apple and Samsung also deck out their smartphones with expensive equipment to capture these images.)\n\nSamsung's event focused a lot on Galaxy AI, and its benefits also applied to the cameras. For instance, the document scanner on the S26 can remove extraneous subjects from scans, such as your thumb or finger, and can combine multiple scans into one PDF.\n\nYou can also use Galaxy AI for prompt-based editing. Samsung showed off how to merge two photos at once, so that the subject of one image is \"seamlessly\" edited into another. The example added a dog from one image into the arms of a woman sitting at a coffee shop in another. Other examples of prompt-based edits include swapping outfits in an image, or editing a bite out of a cupcake.\n\nNone of these upgrades alone are necessarily worth upgrading from the S25, but they show that Samsung is quite confident in the features and quality of its cameras. Even if you don't care for AI editing, it's helpful to have added details when shooting in low light, and any budding cinematographers may enjoy the pro features—especially codec support and the ability to shoot to external storage. But, as always, we'll need to wait for reviewers to get their hands on the phones before we know how good these cameras really are.",

    "description": "Andrew Left says SanDisk is vulnerable to competition from Samsung, which has the power to flood the market with cheaper memory capacity.",
    "fullText": "Andrew Left thinks he sees a big mismatch between investor perception and reality when it comes to SanDisk stock.\n\nSanDisk has been on a tear, surging more than 1,200% in six months as the market eyes a shortage of memory capacity that's driving up pricing power for companies in the space. Yet, Left thinks the stock is highly overvalued, laying out in an X post why his firm, Citron Research, is shorting the shares.\n\nLeft has expressed skepticism that certain tech stocks can continue to rally, citing fellow AI standout Palantir as another example of an overhyped and overvalued name. He used a different company to illustrate the problem he sees with SanDisk, though.\n\n\"The market is pricing SanDisk like it's $NVDA,\" Left wrote. \n\"There's one problem: NVIDIA has a moat. SanDisk sells a commodity. We've seen this movie before 2008, 2012, 2018. It's never different this time. Memory is a cycle, and cycles peak.\"\n\nSanDisk, Left says, is particularly vulnerable to competition from Samsung, which he calls the \"800-pound gorilla\" that's been in the space for 30 years.\n\nLeft's post comes as markets reprice certain AI trades, with a brutal sell-off in recent weeks hammering many tech sectors.\n\nBut in his view, the bigger problem isn't new companies disrupting the space, but a bigger incumbent muscling into SanDisk's territory. Left thinks Samsung will ultimately flood the industry with lower-cost memory chips, leaving SanDisk unable to compete.\n\n\"They're not just the capacity gorilla anymore,\" Left said, of Samsung. \"They're going after SanDisk's best customers with cheaper, newer technology. And the only thing keeping supply tight right now? Samsung's temporary yield problems in another product line. \nThat bottleneck has an expiration date.\"\n\nWhen it reaches that inflection point, Left expects SanDisk stock to start trading at lower levels, though he has not specified a price target.\n\n\"Shorting [SNDK] is skating to where the puck is going,\" he wrote. \"By the time the cycle normalizes, this stock will already be much lower.\n\nLeft isn't the only finance pro who sees it as an effective short play. Former JPMorgan quant chief Marko Kolanovic posted on Monday that bets against memory chip stocks are likely to pay off, naming SanDisk as a specific example.",

    "title": "The New Galaxy S26 Ultra S Pen Still Doesn’t Have Bluetooth",
    "description": "The Galaxy S24 Ultra remains the most recent Samsung phone to have an S Pen with Bluetooth.",
    "fullText": "Samsung's Galaxy S26 lineup is here, and in most ways, it's an upgrade. There are new features like the privacy display, alongside more expected upgrades to the chipset, battery life (for the base model), and charging speed (for the Ultra). But one key part of the S26 ecosystem remains a downgrade from even the Galaxy S24's: Samsung removed Bluetooth from the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen last year, and unfortunately, it's not back for the S26 Ultra.\n\nIt's a hit to fans of the S Pen's former wireless control features, which debuted on the Galaxy Note 10 in 2019 and allowed the S Pen to do things like take a photo or switch between camera modes from afar. Essentially, it was a built-in remote control for your phone, so you wouldn't need to fuss with camera timers or PowerPoint remotes anymore. Users were clear that they didn't like it being removed from the S25 Ultra, but it seems like that wasn't enough to keep Samsung from leaving the feature in the past.\n\nWith the S26 Ultra's announcement, the last glimmer of hope that Bluetooth on the S Pen might make a triumphant return seems pretty dead. Samsung's been quiet about it this time around, but the company did offer some explanation for why the feature was removed back when the S25 Ultra was revealed.\n\nIn a statement to Android Police, Samsung blamed the feature's discontinuation on low user adoption, saying \"Bluetooth Low Energy is not supported on the Galaxy S25 Ultra as Samsung found that S Pen usage for BLE-enabled features was very low.\" However, the company also took the opportunity to plug products that still offered some of the features cut from the S Pen, adding that \"Galaxy users are utilizing gesture controls on the Galaxy Ring and Galaxy Watch for hands-free photo capture instead.\"\n\nWhile it's heartening that Samsung hasn't given up on remote control for its phones entirely, it should be noted that the current generation Galaxy Watch starts at $350, while the Galaxy Ring is $400. These aren't exactly replacements for an accessory that comes with your phone.\n\nBluetooth on the S Pen was also a bit more versatile than gesture controls on the Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Ring. While the S Pen was useful for photo capture, its full list of Bluetooth features included:\n\nCapturing photos and adjusting camera modes from afar.\n\nMoving to the next photo in the Samsung Gallery app.\n\nMoving forward and back in the Samsung Internet browser with the function button, and using gestures to navigate the page.\n\nNavigating around the Samsung Notes app and selecting pens from afar.\n\nMoving between slides in PowerPoint.\n\nControlling audio and media playback.\n\nUsing Air Actions, which functioned like gesture controls for activating specific, sometimes customizable phone features.\n\nThe most recent phone to have Bluetooth included in the S Pen is Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra, and if you're a diehard Bluetooth S Pen user, I've got good news for you. The Galaxy S24 line was Samsung's first to promise seven years of updates, meaning the Galaxy S24 Ultra will get official support straight from Samsung until 2031. That leaves you plenty of time until you'll need to upgrade, so you can stubbornly stick to your handset for at least a little while longer. And despite being a few years old, the S24 Ultra is still plenty powerful, with the same display resolution and amount of RAM as the S26 Ultra, a still competitive Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, and a 200MP main rear camera lens. Unless you absolutely need the most cutting edge technology possible, that's a great setup, and can run even demanding apps like Genshin Impact on high settings without issue.\n\nNow that we're two generations past the S24 Ultra, it seems unlikely that Bluetooth is going to leave Samsung's graveyard. But if you have an older device, you won't have to mourn for at least a little while longer.",

    "title": "Samsung Just Announced the Galaxy S26 Series",
    "description": "The latest Galaxy phones are a slight upgrade from the S25 series with some new AI features mixed in.",
    "fullText": "The newest Galaxy series is officially here. Samsung announced its latest batch of flagship phones During its big Unpacked 2026 event. The company had announced as much ahead of the presentation but was silent on the name, though few will be surprised to learn this year's phones are the Galaxy S26 series—specifically, the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ and Galaxy S26 Ultra. While the new devices look similar to last year's models, there are some new features and changes (including ones exclusive to the S26 Ultra) that may make them worth upgrading.\n\nSince Samsung is all-in on AI, it's only fitting there are a couple of new Galaxy AI features making their debut on the Galaxy S26 series. First is the \"Now Nudge,\" Samsung's answer to the Pixel 10's Magic Cue feature. Now Nudge uses AI to understand the context of what's currently on your screen and prompts users with helpful information, such relevant photos, calendar availability and more.\n\nThe Galaxy S26 series supports switching between three AI assistants at once. You can access Google Gemini and Bixby, of course, but users will now be able to use Perplexity as well. This includes hands-free voice commands (e.g. \"Hey Plex.\") Galaxy S26 users can utilize Perplexity to get info, manage tasks, or even navigate through their device using natural voice or text prompts.\n\nSamsung is also upgrading Circle to Search with version 3.0. Now, users can circle multiple items within an image, such as a whole outfit, and Galaxy AI can identify and itemize each item at once. Then, there's Notification Intelligence, where the AI will prioritize your most important messages and notifications, such as conversations with humans, above promotional or subscription notifications. The higher priority notifications will appear higher in your incoming notifications list.\n\nOne of the S26 Ultra's exclusive features is Privacy Display, which allows users to make their screen only visible when viewing straight on, as if you're using a privacy screen protectors. Privacy Display can be enabled all the time or during certain conditions, like using certain apps or when entering a passcode or password.\n\nAll models in the Galaxy S26 series are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy chip, a slightly overclocked version of the SoC exclusive to Samsung phones. Compared to last year's Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, the 8 Elite Gen 5 brings a 20% performance boost and 35% CPU power efficiency, thanks to the 3 nanometer manufacturing process. The new Adreno GPU in the 8 Elite Gen 5 should also improve graphics performance by 23%.\n\nLike the Galaxy S25 series, all three Galaxy S26 models feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, which supports an adaptive refresh rate of 1-120Hz. Storage options include 256GB and 512GB on the S26 and S26+, while the S26 Ultra comes in an optional 1TB variant as well. All three come with 12GB of RAM, but the 1TB S26 Ultra comes with 16GB of RAM. Screen sizes have stayed relatively the same apart from the base S26, which has gone up to 6.3 inches:\n\nGalaxy S26: 6.3-inch display (2340 x 1080)\n\nGalaxy S26+: 6.7-inch display (3120 x 1440)\n\nGalaxy S26 Ultra: 6.9-inch display (3120 x 1440)\n\nThe base model S26 comes with a 4,300 mAh battery, up from the 4,000 mAh battery on the S25, while the S26+ stays with a 4,900 mAh battery and the S26 Ultra continues with a 5,000 mAh battery. The S26 supports 25W wired and 15W wireless charging, while the S26+ supports 45W wired and 20W wireless charging. The S26 Ultra, however, has the fastest speeds of all, with 60W wired and 25W wireless charging. Despite those speeds, the Galaxy S26 series does not support Qi2 with the built-in magnetic array like Pixelsnap on the Pixel 10 series. That being said, Samsung will happily sell you their official cases with magnets built-in and will offer a magnetic charging puck and magnet battery pack.\n\nAs far as the cameras go, Samsung isn't changing much with the Galaxy S26 series. The S26 and S26+ have the same 12MP ultra-wide, 50MP wide, and 10MP telephoto lenses as the S25 and S25+. The Galaxy S26 Ultra gets a slight upgrade, at least to the 200MP wide lens, which now comes with a new f/1.4 aperture. It carries over the 50MP ultra-wide and two telephoto lenses, 10MP (3x) and 50MP (5x), of the S25 Ultra. The 12MP selfie camera on all three models also hasn't changed from the S25 series. Thanks to the wider aperture on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, you can shoot what Samsung calls Nightography Video. It allows users to capture more detail in low light environments, to complement Samsung's Nightography photo mode.\n\nThe Galaxy S26 series is available for pre-order starting today. The phones will be available in a number of colors including, Cobalt Violet, Sky Blue and Black.",

    "fullText": "This is going to be a big week for Samsung. The company is making some major announcements at Galaxy Unpacked 2026 on Wednesday, revealing the next generation Galaxy S Series devices (which almost assuredly means the Galaxy S26), as well as some new AI updates. In the lead up to this event, Samsung is also now rolling out its latest security updates for its Galaxy devices—at least, some of its devices.\n\nSamsung's February security update contains 37 patches for issues the company discovered since the January update. This time, there are no critical patches, but there are plenty of fixes for \"High\" severity issues. According to SamMobile, 25 of these patches were provided by Google, which fix issues with Android in general, while the other 12 were specific to Samsung to patch issues within its own ecosystem. That includes issues for Emergency Sharing, Knox Guard Manager, Samsung Dialer, Samsung's Settings app, face and fingerprint authentication systems, and the PACM module—things that only apply to Samsung's own OS.\n\nNot all Galaxy phones are getting this update right away. Samsung is kicking things off with its Galaxy S25 series, meaning the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. It also appears to be rolling out to its latest foldable devices as well, including the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7, and Z TriFold. If you bought Samsung's latest and greatest—at least until the S26 series launches—you'll likely see the update in your Settings app imminently. If your Galaxy device is on the older side (or even one year older than the S25 series), you may need to wait a bit before the patches appear.\n\nSpeaking of waiting, Samsung started rolling this update out to Korean users first, so if you're in another region, you might not see it right away. But it does seem evident the patch is on its way, especially with Unpacked airing Wednesday.\n\nOnce the security update hits your device, open the Settings app, then choose either Software update or System updates. (This may differ depending on your device.) From here, depending on your carrier, tap either Download and install, Check for system updates, or Check for software updates. The latest update may begin downloading automatically, but if it doesn't, tap Download now. Finally, follow the on-screen instructions to install the update.",

    "fullText": "Samsung Unpacked 2026 is nearly upon us. On Wednesday, Feb. 25, Samsung will take the stage in San Francisco to make some pretty major product and feature announcements. Unlike some other big tech companies, however, Samsung isn't being 100% secretive here. The company has already told us that it will reveal the next Galaxy S Series, and while they haven't said exactly what it will be called, it's pretty safe to assume this will be the Galaxy S26 series. The rumors suggest Samsung has plenty of other updates up its sleeve, too, including the new Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy AI announcements.\n\nBased on the leaks and rumors, it seems the S26 series will likely be a small year-over-year update to the S25 series, which is largely to be expected from a smartphone OEM as big as Samsung. While there may not be too much incentive to update from the S25 series, users of older Galaxy devices, or older smartphones in general, may find the processor and camera upgrades worthwhile. There may also be unique features, like Privacy Display, which can make it more difficult for others to see your screen when they're not looking at it head-on. We'll have to see exactly which rumors pan out to know for sure.\n\nYou don't need to be seated in San Francisco in order to keep up with all the Samsung news, though. We'll be covering the event live as it happens, posting to this live blog throughout the day. That means we'll be reporting when Samsung reveals the Galaxy S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra; all the new features those devices come with; and any new accessories and AI advancements you can expect from the Samsung ecosystem. For all the latest Samsung Unpacked 2026 news, keep checking this live blog throughout Wednesday.",
