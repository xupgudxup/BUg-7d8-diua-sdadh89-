    "fullText": "He worked in Big Tech. Now, he fears half of its software engineers are on the chopping block.\n\nSteve Yegge worked with Jeff Bezos in Amazon's early years. Then he went to Google, where he worked for over 12 years and earned the title of senior staff software engineer. He also knows a thing or two about AI engineering, having written a book on the topic titled \"Vibe Coding.\"\n\nOn \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" podcast and newsletter, Yegge described an imaginary dial of the percentage of engineering staff a company can lay off, ranging from zero to 100. He said he believes the dial is being set at 50 in the age of AI.\n\n\"You're going to have to get rid of half of them to make the other half maximally productive,\" Yegge said. \"We're going to lose around half the engineers from big companies, which is scary\".\n\nThere's a capital-to-labor tradeoff happening in tech. Companies are paying vast sums for tokens and enterprise AI licenses, GPUs, and computing capacity. That money needs to come from somewhere — and for some, it could come from labor costs.\n\nYegge pointed to this tradeoff as the reason for his forecast of 50% cuts becoming the norm. Companies will lay off some engineers to help pay for the others to have adequate access to AI, he said.\n\nHost Gergely Orosz said that 50% cuts would be more than during the COVID-19 pandemic, when tech went through an intense layoff cycle.\n\n\"It's going to be way bigger,\" Yegge said. \"It's going to be awful.\"\n\nThey aren't the only ones referencing the pandemic. In a popular X article, HyperWrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that AI's impact on work would be \"much, much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nIn recent years, the question of AI-driven layoffs has haunted workers at Big Tech companies, many of which went on a hiring spree during the pandemic. While it's often impossible to boil job loss down a single reason, many suspect productivity gains from AI and ballooning capex spending are fueling the cuts. Some business leaders have also explicitly cited AI when announcing layoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, tech leaders describe smaller teams working more efficiently. On a recent earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said one engineer could now do the work of a whole team, thanks to AI.\n\nAs AI productivity grows, so have complaints of AI fatigue. Software engineer Siddhant Khare penned a lengthy essay about growing more productive, but also feeling more drained than ever. He told Business Insider that he felt like a \"reviewer\" as opposed to an engineer.\n\nYegge said it's not all bad news for the engineers — just those who want to work at a big company. Engineers who have \"seen the light\" are now getting together, leaving their companies, and creating startups that outpace the industry's giants, he said.\n\n\"We've got this mad rush of innovation coming up, bottom up,\" he said. \"And we've got knowledge workers being laid off by big companies because clearly big businesses are not the right size anymore.\"",

    "description": "Is it just for the dogs?",
    "fullText": "A new AI-powered Search Party feature can scan footage from neighborhood cameras to find lost dogs. Critics worry it could be used to search for people.\n\nA new AI-powered Search Party feature can scan footage from neighborhood cameras to find lost dogs. Critics worry it could be used to search for people.\n\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\n\nRing’s new Search Party feature has once again drawn backlash for the company. A 30-second ad that aired during Sunday’s Super Bowl showed Ring cameras “surveilling” neighborhoods to locate a lost dog. In the current political climate, a prime-time ad celebrating neighborhood surveillance struck a nerve.\n\nPeople voiced concerns across social media that the AI-powered technology Ring uses to identify dogs could soon be used to search for humans. Combined with Ring’s recent rollout of its new facial recognition capability, it feels like a short leap for a pet-finding feature to be turned into a tool for state surveillance.\n\nPrivacy expert Chris Gilliard told 404 Media that the ad was “a clumsy attempt by Ring to put a cuddly face on a rather dystopian reality: widespread networked surveillance by a company that has cozy relationships with law enforcement and other equally invasive surveillance companies.”\n\n“This definitely isn’t about dogs — it’s about mass surveillance”\n\nThe fears center on the Amazon-owned Ring’s partnership with Flock Safety, a surveillance technology company that has contracts with law enforcement to use its automated license plate readers, video surveillance systems, and other technologies.\n\nThe partnership connects Ring’s massive residential camera network with an organization that has reportedly allowed ICE to access data from its own nationwide camera network.\n\n“This definitely isn’t about dogs — it’s about mass surveillance,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) posted on X. A vocal critic of Ring’s ties to law enforcement, Markey has pressed for greater transparency into Ring’s connections with law enforcement, along with stronger privacy protections for consumers.\n\nComments on the YouTube video of the ad ranged from “This is a huge problem disguised as a solution,” to “Smart way to gaslight people in mass surveillance.” Video: Ring\n\nRing spokesperson Emma Daniels told The Verge that Search Party is designed to match images of dogs and is “not capable of processing human biometrics.” Additionally, she maintains that the Familiar Faces facial recognition feature is separate from Search Party. It operates on the individual account level, she said, and there’s no communal sharing as there is with Search Party.\n\nWhile Familiar Faces is opt-in for each user, Search Party is enabled by default on any outdoor camera enrolled in Ring’s subscription plan. It works by using AI to scan footage in the cloud for the missing dog once the owner uploads a picture to Ring’s Neighbors app. If a match is found, Ring alerts the camera’s owner, who can then choose to share the video or notify the owner through the app.\n\n“These are not tools for mass surveillance.”\n\n“These are not tools for mass surveillance,” Daniels said. “We build the right guardrails, and we’re super transparent about them.”\n\nWhile that may be the case today, I asked whether Ring cameras could one day be used to specifically search for people. “The way these features are built, they are not capable of that today,” she said. “We don’t comment on feature road maps, but I have no knowledge or indication that we’re building features like that at this point.”\n\nRing users can currently share footage from their cameras with local law enforcement during an active investigation through a feature called Community Requests. Unlike previous Ring police partnerships, Community Request goes through third-party companies — the Taser company Axon and, soon, Flock. “The reason we did that is these third-party evidence management systems offer a much more secure chain of custody,” says Daniels. If a user declines a request, no one will be notified.\n\nThe company maintains that neither the government nor law enforcement can access its network, and that footage is shared only by users or in response to a legal request. Daniels reiterated what the company had previously told The Verge, that it has no partnerships with ICE or any other federal agency, and said you can see every request agencies have made on its Neighbors app profile.\n\nAdditionally, the Flock integration is not currently live, although Daniels had no update on the company’s plans for the partnership following the backlash. She referred me to an earlier response. “As we explore the integration, we will ensure the feature is built for the use of local public safety agencies only — which is what the program is designed for.”\n\nHistory has shown that tools capable of large-scale surveillance are rarely limited to their original purpose\n\nThe problem is that there’s nothing preventing local agencies from sharing footage with federal ones. And while the Super Bowl ad played up heartwarming images of a girl reunited with her puppy, the leap to this technology that can track people in your neighborhood is still very small. Combined with government overreach, it’s not hard to imagine how a powerful network of AI-enabled cameras goes from finding lost dogs to hunting people.\n\nAnd Ring has a history of partnering with the police. While it has rolled back some of that in recent years, since founder Jamie Siminoff returned, the company has renewed its focus on using its products to prevent crime.\n\nSiminoff said he came back because of the possibilities AI brings. With this technology, he believes neighborhood cameras could be used to virtually “zero out crime” within a year. Given these stated goals and the new capabilities AI can bring, why wouldn’t Ring be planning to add some form of Search Party for People to its cameras?\n\nEliminating crime is an admirable goal, but history has shown that tools capable of large-scale surveillance are rarely limited to their original purpose. Ring has a responsibility here to protect its users, which it says it is doing. But ultimately, it comes down to how much you can trust a company – and the company it keeps – to never overstep. If Ring is cloaking its ambitions behind our instinct to protect our furry friends, that trust will be hard to find.",

My job never felt particularly secure.\n\nBecause of the financial cushion I'd built, the paychecks I would receive from Amazon during my continuation period, the severance that followed, and my experience dealing with layoffs before, I didn't feel immediate financial pressure.\n\nRather than jump into the job hunt, I decided to take a pause from October through the end of the year. This time period felt a little like a paid vacation, and given that it overlapped with the holidays, it was almost the perfect time to get laid off.\n\nThen January came. I'd done some research in the prior months to help inform my next career move, but I knew I'd have to ramp up my job search.\n\nI've started actively applying for jobs — including creative project management and creative operations management roles — but I haven't had much success landing interviews yet. I'm not too stressed for now, but I know my paychecks and severance won't last forever; I'll eventually need additional income to stay afloat financially. Accounting for my severance and emergency fund, I have about 10 to 12 months before I run out of funds.\n\nI've had a hard time staying employed at large corporations for any extended period of time. I've been either laid off or left because the pay and benefits weren't good enough. For now, I'm targeting roles at smaller companies that may not be able to pay as much as a larger company, but where I wouldn't feel like just a \"number\" and the job security might be better.\n\nSmaller companies might also offer more work-from-home flexibility. Prior to the layoff, I'd been required to work from the office five days a week, which was about 45-to-50 minutes each way of commuting. I was still the only one in my office on my team, so there was no in-person collaboration for me to benefit from.\n\nI'd like to take a lower-stress, lower-paying job with good health benefits and bridge the financial gap with income from my own business, though I'm not sure what this would be yet.

    "description": "The tech giant's internal policy promotes an in-house tool called Kiro over Anthropic's Claude Code. Some Amazon engineers are unhappy about this.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors and a key partner in bringing the startup's AI models and products to customers.\n\nInside Amazon, however, employees aren't allowed to use Anthropic's Claude Code for production work or for live products without formal approval.\n\nThat disconnect became more visible late last year, when Amazon rolled out internal guidance steering teams toward Kiro, its in-house AI coding assistant, according to internal messages seen by Business Insider. The guidance encourages using Kiro over non-approved third-party tools, including Claude Code, for production code.\n\nThe policy prompted criticism across internal Amazon forums. In one discussion thread, roughly 1,500 Amazon employees endorsed the formal adoption of Claude Code, according to the messages.\n\nThe restrictions have been particularly awkward for engineers who help sell AWS Bedrock, Amazon's platform that offers customers access to third-party AI services, including Claude Code. Some questioned how they could credibly promote a product they are not permitted to use themselves in official work.\n\n\"Customers will ask why they should trust or use a tool that we did not approve for internal use,\" one employee wrote.\n\nThe episode highlights the complexity of Amazon's relationship with Anthropic. While Amazon is racing to build and promote its own AI tools, it is also marketing a partner's competing technology. Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors, with a stake valued at more than $60 billion. Anthropic, in turn, is a major AWS customer, committing to use Amazon's cloud services and at least one million of Amazon's Trainium chips.\n\n\"We are seeing incredible improvements in efficiency and delivery from Kiro, our customer growth is rapidly accelerating, and we want to make sure our internal employees all take advantage of this capability to deliver faster for our customers,\" an Amazon spokesperson said. \"While we continue to support existing tools in use today, we do not plan to support additional, third-party AI development tools.\"\n\nAmazon maintains \"a strong strategic partnership with Anthropic,\" and while there's no explicit ban on Claude Code, the company applies \"stricter requirements for the tools used to develop production code specifically,\" the spokesperson said, noting that Amazon provides a process for seeking exceptions.\n\nAn Anthropic spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn one of the internal forums, an Amazon sales engineer flagged the irony of being asked to sell Claude Code even though it isn't formally supported inside the company. The employee wrote that they need to be able to \"use, demo, and build\" with Claude Code to support Amazon's directive to get more customers to use it through AWS Bedrock.\n\nOther Amazon engineers also debated whether the emphasis on Kiro was hindering productivity. Some argued that Claude Code outperformed Amazon's in-house tool and warned that forcing adoption of a weaker product could slow development.\n\n\"A tool that can't keep pace with rivals offers no real innovation,\" one of the Amazon employees wrote. \"And without competitive strength, Kiro's only survival mechanism becomes forced adoption rather than genuine value.\"\n\nClaude Code has become one of the most widely used AI coding services, and it underpins many other similar offerings from other providers. An Amazon spokesperson said about 70% of the company's software engineers used Kiro at least once in January.\n\nIn one forum thread, a manager overseeing Amazon's internal developer tools said he understood the \"frustration\" and \"significant\" interest in Claude Code, citing about 1,500 internal endorsements calling for its formal adoption.\n\nSome employees said frustration deepened after Amazon had previously indicated that Claude Code had cleared security and legal review for production use, according to an internal guideline and messages reviewed by Business Insider. That language was later edited and removed, employees said.\n\nOthers criticized the lack of transparency around the decision not to formally adopt Claude Code, asking what data informed the decision.\n\n\"The trend is clear,\" one employee wrote internally. \"More and more people would like to start using Claude Code and be officially supported by Amazon.\"\n\nHave a tip?

If you can swing it financially, take some time to think about where you want to go and what you want to do.\n\nWhile job searching can be frustrating, it's also given me the opportunity to reexamine what I want in my career. If there's anything good that's come from the layoff, it's that it's forced me to take time to reflect.",

    "description": "Andy Jassy said Ring's Search Party feature was a \"compelling\" use case for AI. Amazon's Super Bowl ad for the feature was called \"dystopian\" by some.",
    "fullText": "First, there were collars, then there were microchips. Now, we're using doorbell cameras to track down lost dogs.\n\nRing, Amazon's smart doorbell security system, launched Search Party, an AI system that helps locate lost dogs, last fall. In its first three months, the feature has brought home 99 lost dogs in just 90 days, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.\n\n\"Good example of real-world impact, and proud of what the Ring team has built here,\" Jassy wrote.\n\nRing ran a heartstring-tugging ad about Search Party during the Super Bowl. In it, a family finds their lost dog Milo, thanks to the company's tech.\n\nSome viewers didn't find the ad so heartwarming. Users on X and TikTok posted about how the ad made them feel overly surveilled. Others called it \"dystopian.\"\n\nSome of the online backlash also referenced Ring's recent partnership with Flock Safety. A May story from 404 Media alleged ties between Flock and ICE. Local law enforcement may access Ring videos, but they must submit requests that users can deny or ignore.\n\n\"Ring has no partnership with ICE, does not give ICE videos, feeds, or back-end access, and does not share video with them,\" the company wrote in an earlier statement to Wirecutter.\n\nSearch Party does require sign-offs from individual users to release footage. When a pet owner posts about their lost dog in the Ring app, local cameras begin searching. If your camera spots something that looks like the missing dog, you can approve (or deny) sharing the video.\n\n\"The AI is trained on tens of thousands of dog videos so it can recognize different breeds, sizes, fur patterns, body features, unique marks, shape, and color,\" Jassy wrote. \"And privacy stays in your control—you decide each time whether to help.\"\n\nJassy called it one of the \"compelling use cases of AI.\" Indeed, Amazon's Ring has gone all in on AI — both in its products and in the workplace.\n\nWhen founder Jamie Siminoff returned to lead the department in 2025, he mandated that staff show how they use AI when applying for promotions, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nSiminoff later confirmed the change in an interview. \"We're going to promote based on AI. We're going to promote based on how you're integrating AI into your job,\" Siminoff told Business Insider.\n\nHe also said that the RBKS department — Ring, Blink, Key, and Sidewalk — asked about AI in hiring interviews. The department is looking to hire AI natives, he said.\n\nSearch Party is just one initiative in Siminoff's push to refocus Ring on security. One of his first moves was to replace Ring's socially driven mission (\"Keep people close to what's important\") with one emphasizing safety.\n\nRing's new mission: \"Make neighborhoods safer.\"\n\nAs for those dogs, Jassy shouted out some pups that had made their way home. One military veteran lost his service dog, Lainey. Ring found her later that day.\n\nNyx dug a hole under the fence. Ring found him within 15 minutes.",

    "description": "Big Tech's capital expenditures soar with Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft at the forefront, ushering a new era of AI infrastructure spending.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech is taking the AI age to a whole new level.\n\nWhen Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta announced earnings recently, one set of numbers stole the show: The massive projections for data center spending this year.\n\nThough the industry's capital expenditures — spending on property and equipment — have ramped up in recent years, 2026 is shaping up to be leaps and bounds ahead of any private-sector infrastructure spending in modern history.\n\nThe projections draw comparisons to previous transformational eras, such as the Gilded Age of the late 1800s and the Information Age of the 1990s.\n\nStill, Wall Street questions whether it will bring a return on investment — and investors are starting to get antsy. Shares of Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta were all down as of Friday morning. Microsoft was slightly up.\n\n\"Investors needed more than promises to underwrite this story,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote Thursday in a research note following Amazon's earnings call.\n\nAmazon said Thursday it is planning $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, a more than 50% increase from 2025 and the largest estimated budget among Big Tech companies.\n\nThe forecast came in $50 billion above analysts' expectations, and they were less than impressed — despite Amazon's 14% revenue growth for the quarter compared with the same period last year.\n\nThe company's stock dropped as much as 10% after the bell on Thursday, and was down 8% on Friday morning.\n\nWith spending this extreme, a beat on earnings should be \"table-stakes,\" Bernstein's Shmulik wrote Thursday night in a research note that dripped with sarcasm.\n\n\"If we're going to peg the share price to 2026 CapEx, maybe Amazon should have guided even higher, Shmulik wrote. \"Why not at this point?\"\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet stunned investors on Wednesday when it said it is planning $175 billion to $185 billion in capex for 2026, doubling its budget for the second year in a row.\n\nGoogle, which trails behind Amazon and Microsoft in cloud services, has dramatically increased its spending as demand for its Gemini AI models grows. Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users, the company said on its fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nGoogle's stock was down about 2% Friday morning as investors digested Big Tech's big spending plans for 2026.\n\nOne thing Google has going for it is the growing enthusiasm for Gemini.\n\n\"We believe these investments are rational, given its fast-growing backlog, supporting our view that Alphabet is among the best positioned to emerge as one of the leading, if not the leading, AI platform,\" BNP Paribas analyst Nick Jones wrote Thursday in a research note.\n\nLike its Big Tech peers, Meta will up the ante on AI investment in 2026. It was the only company that seemed to get a pass from investors this earnings season — at first, that is.\n\nMeta said last week it is planning $115 billion to $135 billion in capex, close to doubling its spend from last year. Meta's stock surged 8% on January 29, the morning after its fourth-quarter earnings call. Investors were pleased with the social media giant's strong advertising business, which reported $58.14 billion in ad revenue that quarter. What's more, it saw gains from its advertising AI tools.\n\nSince then, enthusiasm has waned, and the stock has been on a downward slope this week.\n\nMicrosoft reported $37.5 billion in capex for the second quarter of its fiscal 2026. While the company hasn't released full-year capex guidance, S&P last week estimated the figure could be around $97.7 billion, with some analysts projecting slightly more.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud business heavily depends on OpenAI. The ChatGPT-maker represents 45% of its backlog, meaning Microsoft's future cloud revenue largely depends on it. The company's stock fell 12% on January 29, the morning after it reported earnings last week — Microsoft's biggest decline since March 2020.\n\nInvestors seemed pleased with the 17% jump in total revenue, including a 39% spike in revenue from Azure and other cloud services.",

    "description": "After co-creating Amazon Alexa, William Tunstall-Pedoe became an angel investor. When he started his second business, he drew on the invaluable experience of his mentees.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with William Tunstall-Pedoe, 56, an angel investor and founder based in the UK. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2012, I sold my first startup, Evi, to Amazon. It later became Alexa.\n\nThat gave me the capital to invest in the next generation of startups when I left Amazon in 2016. I leaned into that opportunity, becoming both a mentor and a very active angel investor.\n\nIt was one of the best experiences I've had for career development, because I saw almost every situation that a startup can encounter, both good and bad.\n\nWhen I left Amazon, I suddenly found myself with an empty calendar.\n\nI wanted to take a break — six months or so — but I still needed to do something with my days. My calendar filled up faster than I expected.\n\nI started saying yes to things I would have turned down while working at Amazon. I was invited to a party in San Francisco, which is a long way to go when you live in the UK, but I went anyway. I booked a hotel for a couple of weeks and let my time fill up with meetings and other activities.\n\nThe year I left Amazon, 2016, turned out to be a really extraordinary time for me, when I traveled a lot and did some very interesting things.\n\nOne of those was being invited to help the Creative Destruction Lab, a seed-stage program for scalable science and technology-based ventures, founded in 2012 by economists at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\n\nThe premise was simple: mentors who successfully launched companies, like me, provided startups with expertise. Every few months, the mentors and startups would meet to set clear objectives for the next stage of development.\n\nIt was a bit like the \"Weakest Link.\" We'd cut companies, sometimes if they'd fallen short of their goals, at each meeting. Over the course of about nine months, the cohort would narrow, and mentor time and resources would be focused on fewer and fewer businesses.\n\nI did this for about six years. I would fly back and forward from London to Toronto every few months, making angel investments in dozens of promising companies, and for another two years when the program moved to the University of Oxford in 2019.\n\nAround the same time, I became involved with Cambridge Angels, an invite-only network of experienced investors, which gave me exposure to a wide range of early-stage companies and investors.\n\nI knew I wanted to be a founder again one day, but waiting turned out to be the right decision. My time as a mentor and angel investor was great preparation.\n\nWhen I founded my second startup, UnlikelyAI, in 2019, the experience was very different from the first time. I still made mistakes and ran into problems, but I was no longer a novice founder with no support.\n\nThis time, I had the capital to fund the business myself for a while. When I later raised a friends-and-family round, it was largely made up of prominent angel investors I'd met through mentoring and angel investing.\n\nAs a second-time founder, not only did I have a decade of experience from my first startup, but I also had something to complement it: the invaluable, vicarious experience of mentoring hundreds of other startups.",

    "fullText": "At its new Stone Mountain, Georgia, facility, Roomba-like robots shuffle between stacks, another adds shipping labels while another arranges packages in pallets\n\nOne of the reasons Amazon is spending billions on robots? They don’t need bathroom breaks. Arriving a few minutes early to the public tour of Amazon’s hi-tech Stone Mountain, Georgia, warehouse, my request to visit the restroom was met with a resounding no from the security guard in the main lobby.\n\nBetween the main doors and the entrance security gate, I paced and paced after being told I would have to wait for the tour guide to collect me and other guests for a tour of the 640,000-sq-ft, four-story warehouse.\n\nAmazon offers tours to the public at 28 of its 1,200 US warehouses – a recruiting and public-relations tool to boost brand trust and address criticisms of poor working conditions. It was something to consider as I wound up having to go in the parking lot, propping open my rental car door for privacy.\n\nBathroom access is one of the most notorious criticisms of Amazon’s treatment of workers. Amazon delivery drivers and warehouse workers have reported having to pee in water bottles due to lack of time and access, and have even said their bathroom breaks are timed.\n\nZoe Hoffman, an Amazon spokesperson, said it was “absurd and false to connect a visitor’s tour experience to that of our employees”, adding that workers were allowed “regularly scheduled breaks” throughout their shifts.\n\nNone of this will be an issue if Amazon’s multibillion-dollar robot dreams come true.\n\nAmazon cites 10 different robots through its warehouse network, though the Stone Mountain warehouse had only a handful of them, including the Roomba-like robots moving shelves of products around to stowers and pickers, an automated crane arm palletizing products, and a robot along a conveyor belt printing and adding shipping labels to boxes of products set to be mailed out of the warehouse.\n\nSeveral sections of the warehouse were closed off during the tour for construction for upgrades, though specifics weren’t disclosed.\n\nThe tour began with a spiel about how Amazon is a great place to work, rattling off Amazon’s 1.5 million global employees and 1 million workers in the US, before playing a brief video of Amazon workers at a warehouse in the UK that made similar claims.\n\nThe tour guide touted Amazon’s vast seasonal workforce of 250,000 workers, claiming many of those workers are then hired full-time.\n\nCriticisms of Amazon’s safety record, high injury rates, high employee turnover or the worker organizing efforts at the Stone Mountain warehouse after workers passed out on the job from heat exhaustion in 2022 were not mentioned. The tour guide, however, did finally offer guests a bathroom break before leading us through the warehouse.\n\nThe tour guide, from the local area, explained that the warehouse, which opened in late 2020, “came out of nowhere” from an area once covered in forest.\n\nThroughout the first floor of the warehouse, the ceilings were covered with an assembly line conveyor belt of yellow Amazon totes, either empty or filled with miscellaneous goods from grocery items to electronics. The sounds of the conveyor belt bellowing through the warehouse’s first-floor ceiling is loud, and tour guests were given headphones to be able to hear the tour guide. Signs around the warehouse stated “hearing protection required” but several of the workers didn’t appear to have any earplugs or other protection.\n\nThe second floor of the warehouse included worker stations surrounding stacks of products in a dark room. Robots resembling Roombas shuffled the stacks between stations to a worker, directed by a computer about what to pick or stow, where to place it or pull it from and where to move it.\n\nThe tour guide claimed that before the robots’ arrival, and in some facilities where the robots aren’t used, a worker with a pushcart used to go around pulling or stocking products.\n\nBack on the first floor, a single robotic arm was palletizing yellow totes of products. The tour guide claimed the facility had only one, had no plans to add more, and said it was only there to help human workers. The robot seemed to need human helpers as much as they needed it, unable to reach products that were too high in the tote, which were shuffled to the side for a human worker to fix and send back to them.\n\nNot so long ago, one of Amazon’s top robot executives (to be clear, he oversees robotics and is not himself a robot) was telling journalists they need not worry about robots taking people’s jobs.\n\nTye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, told the Guardian in 2022 he disagreed with the notion that artificial intelligence and robots wouold lead to the elimination of jobs at Amazon. “I just don’t see that at all,” said Brady. “We made our first serious investment in robotics over 10 years ago and in those 10 years we created more than a million jobs.”\n\nHe said: “The need for people to solve problems and use common sense will always be there. We are nowhere near that with robotics. It’s not even close. We have millions of years of evolution for the human brain that’s powered off 20 watts and a banana – that’s incredible.”\n\nNow the message from the top is very different. Last June, Andy Jassy, the Amazon chief executive, told white-collar workers at the company that the advancement of AI would eliminate jobs at the company over the next few years.\n\n“It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years we expect this will reduce our total corporate workforce,” Jassy said in a memo.\n\nIn October, the New York Times reported on internal documents at Amazon that were presented to the company’s board, which included plans by the company to replace more than 500,000 jobs at Amazon and avoid hiring 160,000 workers by 2027. The documents cited an ultimate goal to automate 75% of its operations.\n\nAmazon denied the report, claiming “the documents referenced paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans”.\n\nThe company laid off about 14,000 corporate employees the same month in anticipation of adopting more broadly artificial intelligence technology, and recently announced plans to lay off an additional 16,000 employees, though Amazon denied that AI and automation had any role in this round of cuts. An Amazon spokesperson added: “AI is not the reason behind the vast majority of these reductions.”\n\nAmazon is reportedly developing “humanoid” robots to pop out of delivery vans to deliver packages, eventually replacing the work of delivery drivers.\n\nIn November, more than 1,000 Amazon workers signed an open letter expressing concern that the company’s “all-costs-justified, warp-speed” approach to developing the technology puts jobs, democracy and the environment at risk.\n\nStaff are seeing the impact already. An Amazon picker and stower at a warehouse in northern Georgia, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told the Guardian that human resources at their Amazon site had gradually shifted from humans to artificial intelligence and computers.\n\n“We have had a big change at my warehouse in HR over the past six months. At first I noticed that the human resource personnel were just not available as much,” they said. “We now have a reduced staff for our HR, and we now have an automated texting service for us to use to contact HR.”\n\nThey also claimed Amazon pushes for cross-training and that workers in areas such as picking and stowing are learning other technical skills such as robot repair, in anticipation that their jobs may eventually be automated.\n\n“People are getting hurt stowing and picking, so that’s one of the reasons why Amazon is wanting to get robots that can do the work of the picker and the stower,” the worker said. “They’re letting us know that it’s smart for us to learn how to do something different, like robot repair work or something in it, because eventually this might be replaced.”\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said: “We’re preparing employees for the roles of the future because we believe investing in workers and our employees is more crucial than ever in this rapidly advancing technological age, especially with AI.”",

    "description": "UPDATED: LLMs automated most phases of the attack",
    "fullText": "UPDATED A digital intruder broke into an AWS cloud environment and in just under 10 minutes went from initial access to administrative privileges, thanks to an AI speed assist.\n\nThe Sysdig Threat Research Team said they observed the break-in on November 28, and noted it stood out not only for its speed, but also for the \"multiple indicators\" suggesting the criminals used large language models to automate most phases of the attack, from reconnaissance and privilege escalation to lateral movement, malicious code writing, and LLMjacking - using a compromised cloud account to access cloud-hosted LLMs.\n\n\"The threat actor achieved administrative privileges in under 10 minutes, compromised 19 distinct AWS principals, and abused both Bedrock models and GPU compute resources,\" Sysdig's threat research director Michael Clark and researcher Alessandro Brucato said in a blog post about the cloud intrusion. \"The LLM-generated code with Serbian comments, hallucinated AWS account IDs, and non-existent GitHub repository references all point to AI-assisted offensive operations.\"\n\nThe attackers initially gained access by stealing valid test credentials from public Amazon S3 buckets. The credentials belonged to an identity and access management (IAM) user with multiple read and write permissions on AWS Lambda and restricted permissions on AWS Bedrock. Plus, the S3 bucket also contained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) data for AI models, which would come in handy later during the attack.\n\nTo prevent this type of credential theft, don't leave access keys in public buckets. Sysdig recommends using temporary credentials for IAM roles, and for organizations that insist on granting long-term credentials to IAM users, make sure you rotate them periodically.\n\nAfter unsuccessfully trying usernames such as \"sysadmin\" and \"netadmin\" typically associated with admin-level privileges, the attacker ultimately achieved privilege escalation through Lambda function code injection, abusing the compromised user's UpdateFunctionCode and UpdateFunctionConfiguration permissions:\n\nThey replaced the code of an existing Lambda function named EC2-init three times, iterating on their target user. The first attempt targeted adminGH, which, despite its name, lacked admin privileges. Subsequent attempts eventually succeeded in compromising the admin user frick.\n\nThe security sleuths note that the comments in the code are written in Serbian - likely indicating the intruder's origin - the code itself listed all IAM users and their access keys, created access keys for frick, and listed S3 buckets along with their content.\n\nPlus, the attacker's code contained \"comprehensive\" exception handling, according to the security sleuths, including logic to limit S3 bucket listings and an increase to the Lambda execution timeout from three seconds to 30 seconds.\n\nThese factors, combined with the short time from credential theft to Lambda execution, \"strongly suggest\" the code was written by an LLM, according to the threat hunters.\n\nNext, the miscreant set about collecting account IDs and attempting to assume OrganizationAccountAccessRole in all AWS environments. Interestingly, they included account IDs that did not belong to the victim organization: two with ascending and descending digits (123456789012 and 210987654321), and one ID that appeared to belong to a legitimate external account.\n\n\"This behavior is consistent with patterns often attributed to AI hallucinations, providing further potential evidence of LLM-assisted activity,\" Clark and Brucato wrote.\n\nIn total, the attacker gained access to 19 AWS identities, including six different IAM roles across 14 sessions, plus five other IAM users. And then, with the new admin user account they had created, the crims snarfed up a ton of sensitive data: secrets from Secrets Manager, SSM parameters from EC2 Systems Manager, CloudWatch logs, Lambda function source code, internal data from S3 buckets, and CloudTrail events.\n\nThey then turned to the LLMjacking part of the attack to gain access to the victim's cloud-hosted LLMs. For this, they abused the user's Amazon Bedrock access to invoke multiple models including Claude, DeepSeek, Llama, Amazon Nova Premier, Amazon Titan Image Generator, and Cohere Embed.\n\nSysdig notes that \"invoking Bedrock models that no one in the account uses is a red flag,\" and enterprises can create Service Control Policies (SCPs) to allow only certain models to be invoked.\n\nAfter Bedrock, the intruder focused on EC2, querying machine images suitable for deep learning applications. They also began using the victim's S3 bucket for storage, and one of the scripts stored therein looks like it was designed for ML training - but it uses a GitHub repository that doesn't exist, suggesting an LLM hallucinated the repo in generating the code.\n\nWhile the researchers say they can't determine the attacker's goal - possibly model training or reselling compute access - they note that the script launches a publicly accessible JupyterLab server on port 8888, providing a backdoor to the instance that doesn't require AWS credentials.\n\nHowever, they terminated the instance after five minutes for unknown reasons.\n\nThis is the latest in examples of attackers increasingly relying on AI to help them at almost every stage in the attack chain, and some security chiefs have warned that it's just a matter of time before criminals can fully automate attacks at scale.\n\nThere are things organizations can do to defend against similar intrusions and most involve hardening identity security and access management. First off: apply principles of least privilege to all IAM users and roles.\n\nSysdig also recommends restricting UpdateFunctionConfiguration and PassRole permission in Lambda, limiting UpdateFunctionCode permissions to specific functions and assigning them only to identities that need code deployment capabilities to do their jobs.\n\nAlso, make sure S3 buckets containing sensitive data, including RAG data and AI model artifacts, are not publicly accessible.\n\nAnd it's a good idea to enable model invocation logging for Amazon Bedrock to detect unauthorized usage.\n\nWe reached out to Amazon for comment, but they said they wouldn't be able to get us anything by publication time. We'll update this story with any relevant information we receive from them. ®\n\nto add the following comment sent by AWS.\n\n“AWS services and infrastructure are not affected by this issue, and they operated as designed throughout the incident described,\" the company told The Reg by email. \"The report describes an account compromised through misconfigured S3 buckets. We recommend all customers secure their cloud resources by following security, identity, and compliance best practices, including never opening up public access to S3 buckets or any storage service, least-privilege access, secure credential management, and enabling monitoring services like GuardDuty, to reduce risks of unauthorized activity.\"\n\nThe cloud giant also wants its customers who suspect or become aware of malicious activity within their AWS accounts to check out guidance for remediating potentially compromised credentials or contact AWS Support for assistance.\"",

    "description": "On the earnings call, analysts pushed CEO Andy Jassy for assurances on future returns from this capex boom.",
    "fullText": "Amazon said Thursday it plans a staggering $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, sparking concern that the AI spending boom has entered an even more bubbly stage.\n\nThe company's capex forecast was more than $50 billion above Wall Street expectations. That left some analysts uneasy about whether these huge investments will pay off.\n\n\"The strong long-term return on investing capital — I think that's the debate in the market today,\" Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at Evercore ISI, said during a conference call with Amazon executives following the results. \"So could you give us a little bit more insight into how you think investors will be able to see that?\"\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said new AI capacity is being monetized as quickly as it is deployed, calling it \"a very unusual opportunity,\" and argued that AI adoption is accelerating customers' shift to the cloud. He added that AWS' experience forecasting demand helps limit wasted capacity.\n\n\"This isn't some sort of quixotic top-line grab,\" Jassy said during the call. \"We have confidence that these investments will yield strong returns on invested capital.\"\n\nJassy's comments did little to calm investors. Amazon shares fell more than 10% in extended trading after the company detailed its outsized spending plans. A profit forecast also missed Wall Street expectations, adding to ROI concerns.\n\nBig Tech's AI infrastructure buildout has entered a new, breathtaking phase in recent days. On Wednesday, Google said it expects capex of $175 billion to $185 billion in 2026, well ahead of Wall Street estimates. Meta and Microsoft also raised capex.\n\nDuring Thursday's Amazon earnings call, other analysts pressed for assurances around returns on investment. JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth asked Jassy whether the company had \"financial guardrails\" in place for the spending plan.\n\nJassy said AI represents an \"extraordinarily unusual opportunity\" that could reshape the scale of AWS and Amazon. He said the company's in-house chips, Trainium and Graviton, are on track to generate more than $10 billion in revenue this year and added that its partnership with Anthropic has gone \"very well.\"\n\n\"We see this as an unusual opportunity, and we are going to invest aggressively here to be the leaders like we've been the last number of years,\" Jassy said.\n\nJassy described the AI market as \"barbelled,\" with heavy spending by leading AI labs on one end and productivity-focused enterprise uses on the other.\n\nHe said the middle — enterprise production workloads and new AI-native businesses — remains early but could become \"the largest and the most durable\" source of demand as costs fall and adoption broadens.\n\n\"The lion's share of that demand is still yet to come in the middle of that barbell, and that will come over time,\" he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "US stock futures moved lower early Monday as Amazon’s (AMZN) post-earnings slide weighed heavily on tech sentiment and investors braced for further wreckage after a bruising session on Wall Street.\n\nS&P 500 futures (ES=F) dropped 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) slid 0.3%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) fell 0.1%.\n\nThe overnight moves followed a sharp sell-off during Thursday’s regular session, led once again by technology stocks. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) have now slipped into negative territory for 2026.\n\nAnd after the bell, Amazon (AMZN) added to the gloom. Shares plunged over 10% in after-hours trading after the company posted earnings per share that missed Wall Street estimates and projected capital expenditures of $200 billion for the year, raising concerns about the extent of AI spend.\n\nThe risk-off tone extended beyond equities. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued sliding, touching levels not seen since 2024, while silver (SI=F) resumed its decline after a recent surge fueled by retail investor interest. Strategy (MSTR) revealed a loss for the quarter that was precipitated by bitcoin's sell-off, sending shares down.\n\nEarnings also drove Reddit (RDDT) upward after reporting a quarterly earnings beat, issuing upbeat guidance, and announcing a stock buyback program. Roblox (RBLX) shares also surged. Looking ahead, investors will focus on earnings from Toyota (TM) and Philip Morris (PM), due before Friday’s opening bell.\n\nMeanwhile, the closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, originally scheduled for Friday, has been pushed to Wednesday next week following the resolution of the federal government shutdown. But other data this week has shown fresh signs of trouble for the labor market, as job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020 and layoff announcements surged.",

    "description": "An active-duty enlisted member of the US military said their unit was \"pressured\" into seeing Amazon's \"Melania\" documentary about the first lady.",
    "fullText": "It was the story of the weekend: \"Melania,\" Amazon's documentary on first lady Melania Trump, beat expectations at the box office, becoming one of the best-performing documentaries in recent years with an opening weekend gross of $7 million across 1,778 screens. (Whether it makes back its $75 million investment is another story.)\n\nDespite dismal critic reviews, the numbers suggest audiences turned out for \"Melania\" to support the first lady. One advocacy group suggests the reality may be more complicated.\n\nMikey Weinstein, the president and founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, said the nonprofit received reports from eight bases around the world that U.S. military members were being \"pressured\" to see \"Melania.\"\n\n\"People are scared,\" said Weinstein, a former Air Force officer and attorney who said his group is made up of nearly 100,000 current and former members of the U.S. military and represents those who feel pressured or coerced into unconstitutional religious observances. \"They were pressured to see the movie.\"\n\n\"Your military superior, that's not your shift manager at Taco Bell or Starbucks. They have complete and total control over you.\"\n\nIn an email Weinstein shared with Business Insider, an active-duty enlisted member of the US military said they were writing on behalf of a dozen of their unit members and their families who felt \"pressured\" by their unit commander to see the movie. The MRFF did not disclose the name of the person who sent the email.\n\nIn the email, this person said their commander suggested the unit and their family members join him, his wife, and their children at a showing of \"Melania\" at an off-base movie theater.\n\nThe screening was designated as one of the commander's \"Unit Activity Events,\" morale-boosting activities that can range from flag football and barbecues to movie nights, the email said. The military member who sent the email said the unit is required to attend at least three of the four UAEs that are scheduled each month or face a penalty.\n\nAsked if any of the MRFF members who contacted him skipped the movie, Weinstein said: \"Every one of our clients who came to us either went to see it or suddenly got sick.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Department of Defense official told Business Insider, \"There is no Department of War directive requiring service members to see this film, though the film is fantastic.\"",

    "description": "Wall Street is looking to Amazon with high hopes after a rough week in tech, as silver plunges again and bitcoin drops near $65,000.",
    "fullText": "US stocks took sizable hits again on Thursday in a fruitless search for a reprieve from a building tech sell-off as investors awaited Amazon earnings, assessed Alphabet's big AI spending plans, and digested jobs data that signaled fresh weakness in the labor market.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved roughly 1.2% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost over 1.1%, or more than 500 points.\n\nThe market is in the midst of a full-on tech wipeout, as investors weigh whether some software stocks took too big a beating. The losses have been spurred by worries about AI disruption to established software players — a risk that had been overlooked by investors focused on the fallout from massive AI spending until recently.\n\nWall Street is still digesting the latest batch of corporate earnings, with Big Tech's AI build-out and demand in high focus. Alphabet (GOOG) shares slid, but pared losses, after the Google parent outlined a significant ramp-up in AI investment — to as high as $185 billion — in its quarterly results late Wednesday.\n\nThe countdown is now on to Amazon's (AMZN) report, set for release after Thursday's market close. Eyes are on the all-important AWS cloud unit, expected to deliver a 21% jump in sales.\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market flashed fresh signals of weakness: Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected, and job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020, while a new report found that last month marked the worst January for layoff announcements since 2009. The government's monthly jobs report is due next Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere, silver (SI=F) plunged as much as 17%, erasing all of its two-day recovery as Chinese buyers dumped holdings. Wall Street is debating whether the recent record rally in silver and gold (GC=F) ran too high, too fast — and if a further slump awaits.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) also plunged to its lowest level since 2024, wiping out all of the gains accumulated during President Trump's second term. The token broke below $63,000 — amid a crisis of confidence.\n\nYahoo Finance's Francisco Velasquez reports:\n\nSilver (SI=F) prices tumbled 14% on Thursday to hover above $75 per ounce, erasing gains from the past two days. Gold (GC=F) futures also slipped to $4,900 per ounce after both metals had risen for a second consecutive day following last Friday’s sell-off.\n\nAnalysts warned that silver’s short-term rebound remains volatile, though they remain bullish on bullion prices over the medium term, despite last week’s dramatic pullback that interrupted a blistering rally over the past year.\n\n\"The widening divergence between gold and silver performance reinforces a recurring theme: silver behaves less like a monetary metal during periods of stress and more like a high-beta hybrid, amplifying both optimism and fear,\" Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank's commodity strategy head, wrote on Thursday.\n\n\"History suggests that silver tends to stabilise only once realised volatility falls and speculative positioning is reset — conditions that are not yet fully in place,\" he added.\n\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports:\n\nMortgage rates barely budged this week: The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage edged higher to 6.11% from 6.10%, while the 15-year fixed averaged 5.50% ticked up to 5.5% from 5.49% last week.\n\nYahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick and Laura Grace Tarpley note that the 10-year Treasury note, a pricing indicator for 30-year fixed mortgage rates, has hovered above 4.2% since mid-January. However, the spread between Treasurys and mortgage rates has narrowed recently, and the 30-year has resisted a substantial move higher.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nCheck out frequently asked questions about mortgage rates and our mortgage calculator here.\n\nYahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi writes:\n\nCheck out the top takeaways from Sozzi and Schwab's conversation here.\n\nIt hasn't been a great day for jobs data, with the delayed JOLTS report serving as the final piece in a trifecta of negative news about layoffs, hiring, and unemployment claims.\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled below $64,000 on Thursday, its lowest level since October 2024.\n\nThe token is down nearly 50% from its all-time high last year, erasing all the gains made during President Trump's second term. Investors had been optimistic that the administration's crypto-friendly policies would lift digital-asset prices.\n\n\"Bitcoin remains in a larger bear-market structure,\" read a 10X Research note on Thursday. \"In the absence of a strong catalyst and with positioning still stretched, downside risks remain elevated.\"\n\nNotably, the firm points to a significant overhang — overexposed bitcoin ETF holders who are underwater, with an estimated average acquisition price near $90,000.\n\nA similar dynamic is playing out with ether (ETH), which tumbled 13% on Thursday. Investors holding Ethereum ETFs are down approximately 31% from their average cost basis, according to 10X Research data.\n\n\"Under these conditions, attracting incremental allocations from Wall Street investors becomes increasingly difficult, particularly when many existing holders likely regret not reducing exposure at significantly higher levels,\" the note said.\n\nAbsent a significant catalyst, the firm doesn't see a bottom to crypto's bear market until possibly the summer.\n\n\"As we have previously outlined, a cycle low around the FIFA World Cup this summer could mark a more compelling long-term buying opportunity,\" 10X Research analysts said.\n\nPeloton (PTON) shares fell more than 20% after the company reported its fiscal second quarter earnings and announced its CFO will be exiting.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports:\n\nHims & Hers (HIMS) shares soared as much as 9% as the company said it will begin selling compounded copies of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy pill. The pill from Hims & Hers would cost about $100 less than Novo's, Reuters reported.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY) both saw shares tumble about 7% on the news.\n\nSoftware stocks have been hammered in the past few days, accelerating a months-long decline as investors become more fearful of disruption risks posed by new artificial intelligence tools — particularly those from Anthropic.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai was asked about the market belief that software stocks are losing ground during a call with analysts following the Google parent's earnings report Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe CEO said: \"Look, at least from my vantage point, I definitely see we have very, very good SaaS (software as a service) customers who are leaders in their respective categories.\"\n\nThose customers include Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW), and Salesforce (CRM), per Bloomberg data.\n\nPichai continued: \"And what I see the successful companies doing is they are definitely incorporating Gemini deeply in critical workflows, be it on improving their product experience and driving growth or using it to drive efficiency within their organizations.\"\n\n\"[J]ust like it has been an enabling tool for us across our products and services.. I think the [software] companies who are seizing the moment, I think, have the same opportunity ahead.\"\n\nHis comments echo those of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this week.\n\nRead more about what's driving fears over AI eating into the competitive moats of SaaS leaders here.\n\nThe performance of Amazon's (AMZN) cloud business, AWS, will be keenly examined when its earnings report lands later, after Microsoft (MSFT) stock plunged last week, in part due to a slowdown in cloud growth.\n\nThis was not an issue for Amazon’s October earnings, as its shares jumped almost 10% following better than expected revenue from Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS. Now, however, fear is rippling through the tech sector, and Amazon investors are increasingly concerned that the slowdown at Microsoft’s Azure indicates broader weakness for cloud providers.\n\n“It isn’t clear how much of Microsoft’s disappointment might be due to company-specific issues and how much might reflect an overall slowing in the cloud space,” said David Miller, chief investment officer at Catalyst Funds, which holds Amazon shares in several portfolios. “If it’s the latter, that could carry over.”\n\n... Amazon’s results come against a backdrop of anti-software sentiment that’s weighing on the entire tech sector as investors try to sort the winners and losers from the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent to develop artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft’s aggressive AI-related capital expenditures, alongside the slowing Azure growth, invited new questions about when these investments will pay off more substantially.\n\n“It’s really about what’s already priced into the stock, and I think what was starting to price in for [Microsoft] was a higher growth rate, which is always a little dangerous,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “We haven’t really seen Amazon moving up in the same way.”\n\nAt the market open, US stocks plunged for a third day as a broad sell-off in tech names continued.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, sinking 1.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, fell 0.5%.\n\nUS weekly applications for unemployment benefits increased by more than expected last week, as snowstorms across much of the country may have led more people to file for assistance.\n\nJobless claims for the week ending Jan. 31 increased by 22,000 to 231,000 claims, exceeding economists' forecasts, the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n\nContinuing claims, a proxy for the total number of people receiving state unemployment benefits, increased to 1.84 million.\n\nDistortions from winter weather notwithstanding, the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits suggests the labor market remains broadly stable if not cooling gradually.\n\nThough in a sign of cracks appearing in the \"low hire, low fire\" trend that has characterized the labor market for over a year, layoffs jumped in January to their highest level for that month in 17 years, according to Challenger data (scroll down for more on this).\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports:\n\nJeff Bezos came, he saw, he conquered.\n\nMaybe not in the way you'd expect from a onetime financial savior of an iconic newspaper. There are now two Bezos eras at the Washington Post: The first started when he rescued it in 2013. The second began when he saw it gutted, blessing mass layoffs the company executed on Wednesday.\n\n... On social media and in news coverage in the aftermath, Post employees, the labor union, and alumni (myself included) strongly criticized the decision.\n\nOthers have pointed to more recent moves by Bezos.\n\nLeading up to the Post's deep cuts, several media observers highlighted Amazon's enormous budget to produce and market the new documentary \"Melania,\" about first lady Melania Trump.\n\nAmazon's extraordinary spending prompted questions about the movie working as a kind of bribe from Bezos to the White House. (Amazon says they licensed the movie because they think people will love it. The film's Rotten Tomatoes scores and box office numbers have inspired a news cycle of their own.)\n\nBut the splashy Melania rollout provided an ugly contrast to the austerity Bezos was serving down to the Post's newsroom. In the worst light, critics said Bezos was willing to burn money to please the president but was now unwilling to do so for journalism in the public interest.\n\nRead more here in the takeaway from today's Morning Brief.\n\nChinese EV maker Nio (NIO) sent its shareholders a profit alert on Thursday morning, letting them know that the company expects to post its first-ever profit in the fourth quarter.\n\nNio said it will see an adjusted profit from operations of 200 million Chinese yuan (approximately $29 million) to 700 million yuan (approximately $100 million).\n\nThe company attributed the profit to sustained sales growth, improved margins from its product mix, and ongoing cost-cutting measures.\n\nNio stock popped 6% in premarket trading.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, as tariff woes sent the beauty group's shares tumbling.\n\nStrategy (MSTR) stock fell over 5% during premarket hours on Thursday after bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell below 70,000. Strategy is one of the largest corporate holders of cryptocurrency.\n\nTapestry (TPR) stock rose 5% before the bell. Coach's parent company beat analysts' estimates on revenue and raised its full-year guidance.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) US-listed shares rose 5% before the bell on Thursday after announcing plans to issue its first dividend to shareholders, along with a three-year stock buyback program worth $5 billion.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled, falling $71,000 per token on Thursday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the leading cryptocurrency was paring deeper overnight losses in the wake of Bessent's comments, after entering the key mid-$70,000 support region.\n\nYahoo Finance's Ines Ferré and Grace O'Donnell report:\n\nSnap (SNAP) stock galloped higher after a strong holiday quarter for advertising lifted earnings above Wall Street's estimates.\n\nSnap stock rose 6% before the bell on Thursday.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, the video messaging app reported revenue of $1.71 billion and earnings per share of $0.03. That beat Wall Street estimates of $1.7 billion in revenue and a $0.03 loss per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) demonstrated resilience in the fourth quarter following a difficult 2025, with a strong earnings beat and guidance raise.\n\nThe affordable cosmetics manufacturer lifted its full-year 2026 sales outlook to a range of $1.6 billion to $1.61 billion from its previous range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion. The company also sees greater earnings per share of $3.05-$3.10, an increase from the previous range of $2.80-$2.85.\n\nThe stock soared by as much as 8% in premarket trading on Thursdayas the company looks to regain its footing after higher tariffs and other challenges led the stock to lose 40% in 2025. However, the stock pared some of those gains, perhaps due to lower gross margins amid ongoing tariff costs.\n\nLast year, the company also acquired Hailey Bieber's Rhode brand.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, e.l.f. reported better-than-expected earnings per share of $0.65 versus $0.55 expected by Wall Street analysts. Net sales jumped 38% to $489.5 million, topping estimates of $461 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\n\"Our value proposition, powerhouse innovation and disruptive marketing engine continue to fuel our brands,\" CEO Tarang Amin said in a statement. \"We remain confident in our ability to grow market share and deliver best-in-class growth in beauty, as reflected by our raised fiscal 2026 outlook.\"\n\nRead more about e.l.f.'s quarter from Reuters.\n\nArm Holdings shares fall as licensing sales miss estimates.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) stock rose 5% before the bell on Thursday following Alphabet's (GOOG) capital expenditure plans, which surpassed analysts' expectations.\n\nGoogle's parent company forecast 2026 capital expenditures of $180 billion, news that is a potential boon to Broadcom, which partners with Alphabet on custom chips.\n\n“That is an incredible number. We are laughing because that number is so good for the Google cohort,” Ben Reitzes, Melius Research head of technology research, told CNBC.\n\nGoogle is not the only company increasing its capex spend to build AI data centers: Oracle (ORCL) is doing the same and raised its forecast to around $50 billion.\n\nGoogle's AI software doesn't just use Nvidia (NVDA) chips, but it also uses its own tensor processing units (TPUs). For Gemini 3, Google used TPUs, which Broadcom helped to make.\n\nSilver (SI=F) fell sharply, wiping out a two-day recovery, as the white metal struggled to find a floor following a historic market rout. Gold (GC=F) also declined.\n\nSpot silver plunged as much as 17% on Thursday, having flickered briefly above $90 an ounce in early Asian trading. After a record-breaking rally that appeared to run too far, too fast, the metal has retreated by more than a third from an all-time high hit on Jan. 29.\n\n“Sentiment seems to have turned soggy across most asset classes, including regional equities and metals,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. This has created “a feedback loop amid thin market liquidity,” he said.\n\nThe sudden and sharp decline in precious metals also weighed on sentiment in base metals markets, with copper falling more than 1% to slip below $13,000 a ton. Meanwhile, spot gold dropped as much as 3.5% in choppy trading.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) stock fell around 11% in premarket trading on Thursday after the chip designer's results beat on the top and bottom lines but its forecast was lighter than expected. A memory chip shortage stemming from data center developers scooping up chips and chipmakers shifting production to cater to AI demand added pressure to the company's outlook.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, the company said revenue increased 5% year over year to $12.3 billion, while earnings per share rose to $2.78. Qualcomm beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines, with consensus estimates forecasting $12.1 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $2.75, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nHowever, the outlook for the fiscal second quarter dimmed as a supply crunch in memory chips weighs on margins and the smartphone market.\n\nSecond quarter revenue is expected in the range of $10.2 billion to $11 billion (analysts were looking for $11 billion at the midpoint). Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 (the Street was hoping for $2.87).\n\n\"While our near-term handsets outlook is impacted by industry-wide memory supply constraints, we are encouraged by end-consumer demand for premium and high tier smartphones, and remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2029 revenue goals,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in the earnings release.",

    "fullText": "This January was marked by more layoffs than any January since 2009.\n\nData from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement company, shows that US employers announced 108,435 job cuts in the first month of the year, an increase of 118% from the year before.\n\nMajor companies have said they're trimming staff this year. In January, Amazon announced it would cut 16,000 corporate roles, after cutting 14,000 jobs in October last year.\n\nThe 30,000 layoffs announced by UPS in January helped make transportation the sector with the most job cuts, the Challenger report said.\n\nElsewhere, Citi said in January it plans to cut around 10% of its workforce, or 20,000 employees.\n\nChallenger said on Thursday that hiring also stalled in January, with employers announcing 5,306 new hiring plans — the weakest start to the year since it began tracking this data in 2009.\n\n\"Generally, we see a high number of job cuts in the first quarter, but this is a high total for January,\" Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement accompanying the report.\n\n\"It means most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026,\" he added.\n\nThe key reasons for the job cuts, per Challenger, were \"contract loss,\" \"market and economic conditions,\" and \"restructuring.\" AI was cited as the key reason for around 7% of the cuts.\n\n\"It's difficult to say how big an impact AI is having on layoffs specifically,\" Challenger said. \"We know leaders are talking about AI, many companies want to implement it in operations, and the market appears to be rewarding companies that mention it.\"\n\nFebruary 5, 2026 — This story has been updated to reflect that the layoffs are higher than they have been in any January since 2009, not a 17-year high.",

This was not an issue for Amazon’s October earnings, as its shares jumped almost 10% following better than expected revenue from Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS. Now, however, fear is rippling through the tech sector, and Amazon investors are increasingly concerned that the slowdown at Microsoft’s Azure indicates broader weakness for cloud providers.

    "fullText": "The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is conducting widespread layoffs.\n\nExecutive editor Matt Murray wrote in a Wednesday memo that the \"substantial newsroom reductions\" would impact \"nearly all news departments.\"\n\nThe layoffs impacted hundreds of workers, according to a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the newsroom's union.\n\nMurray told staff on a Wednesday morning call that the cuts were part of a strategic reset, according to an audio recording obtained by Business Insider.\n\nMurray said the changes included \"closing the sports department in its current form.\"\n\n\"We plan to retain several reporters to join features and cover sports as a cultural and societal phenomenon, as well as several folks to staff the print sports section,\" he added.\n\nMurray said impacted teams included audio and journalists who cover books, the DC metro area, and foreign affairs.\n\n\"A few products will be discontinued — among the most significant, we will be closing the book section and will be suspending the Post Reports podcast,\" Murray said.\n\nThe publication's San Francisco bureau was also heavily hit, one Post insider said.\n\nIn his memo, Murray wrote that for the immediate future, the paper would concentrate on \"areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact and that resonate with readers.\"\n\n\"These layoffs are not inevitable,\" the Washington Post Guild wrote in a statement posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday. \"A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach, and its future.\"\n\nFormer executive editor Martin Baron wrote in a LinkedIn post that \"there were acute business problems that had to be addressed\" during \"a period of head-spinning change in media consumption.\" Baron added that the \"Post's challenges, however, were made infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.\"\n\nDonald Graham, the Post's former publisher, wrote in a Facebook post that he was saddened by the loss of \"so many excellent reporters and editors\" and that he would \"have to learn a new way to read the paper,\" as he had \"started with the sports page since the late 1940's.\"\n\n\"The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,\" a Post spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. \"These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nThis new round of layoffs follows a series of recent shake-ups at the 148-year-old newspaper.\n\nEarly last year, the company told its opinions desk that columnists should refocus their coverage to two pillars: \"personal liberties\" and \"free markets.\"\n\nIn March, the Post reorganized its newsroom in a push to shift away from \"commodity news.\" It then offered buy-outs to staffers in May.\n\nLast year's personnel shifts arrived shortly after the Washington Post came under fire from some readers for its decision to skip endorsing a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, breaking from a 35-year tradition. Some critics argued that the decision could have been made to curry favor with Donald Trump.\n\nOver 400 staffers sent a letter to Bezos last January, writing that they were \"deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave.\"\n\nThe Post's staff reductions arrive at a challenging moment for the media industry.\n\nSome brands are seeing revenue fall off due to declines in social media and search traffic. The rise of AI is also squeezing the industry as more readers gather information from chatbots rather than visiting web pages.\n\nThe New York Times, long seen as the 800-pound gorilla in the newspaper business, saw its shares sink about 14% on Monday as investors fretted about increased costs.",

    "fullText": "The most popular mom content tends to be rightwing tradwife propaganda or not political at all – pushing progressive creators out of the algorithm\n\nFor someone who doesn’t have a marble island in their kitchen I spend a disproportionate amount of time staring at marble kitchen islands, slack-jawed, brain turned half off. That’s because I consume a lot of videos from mommy bloggers, mom influencers, and the like. In kitchen “closing shift” videos, they wipe down their islands and reset by lighting luxury candles, the glow accentuating their respectable cosmetic procedures. Other times I watch them waltz through their morning routines: getting kids out the door, sweating it out in boutique fitness classes, showing off Amazon hauls, or explaining their children’s matching holiday photoshoot outfits.\n\nFor better or worse, this is how I have chosen to spend my one wild and precious life: consuming blissfully low-stakes motherhood content on my phone. It is domestically competent ASMR that also satiates my desire to peek into everyone’s bathroom cabinets. I nod in unsolicited approval as a TikTok mom I follow shares her green juice order. Fascinating. I should drink something like that. Another posts timestamps of her baby’s night-time sleep schedule. I, who lives between walls that have never heard the wail of an infant, ingurgitate the entire video.\n\nBut occasionally, when my cerebrum is not completely smoothed over by a beautiful woman beckoning me to “get ready” with her, an anxiety starts to creep in. What, I wonder, are this woman’s politics? Has she ever given us a hint? Is she registered to vote? Is there any chance she, like me, is outraged by ICE raids, book bans, our government’s comparatively dismal maternal support system or slippery slide into fascism? Does she know there are midterms this year? Mama, blink twice!\n\nIn my ideal algorithm, I would get served posts to assuage my doubts. I would watch nursery hauls of a mother whose progressiveness I did not doubt. I would know that she dreads the realities of the climate crisis. I would listen to a parent describe her weekly meal prep for a family of four and not wonder if she was politically aligned with the men in government stripping food safety regulations. Maybe tips on how to get your daily steps in with a newborn would include showing up at protests or delivering mutual aid groceries. Because in real life, I was raised by and hope to be a mother who is both fluent in the chaotic and comforting mundanity of domesticity and enraged by the systems that diminish and destroy families and livelihoods. I just don’t see that much of it in my online spheres.\n\nInstead, the most popular motherhood and lifestyle content lands somewhere on the short spectrum between conservative tradwife propaganda and extraordinarily apolitical, considering the paralyzing polycrisis we find ourselves in. I’m increasingly suspicious: was that sourdough starter “how to” video actually funded by the Church of Latter-day Saints? Hannah Neeleman AKA Ballerina Farm, one of the most-followed motherhood lifestyle content creators across platforms, has not ever explicitly divulged her political views – but do followers know she graced the cover of Evie magazine, described by one of its founders as “conservative Cosmo”?\n\n“The right in the United States has really won the family,” said content creator Kate Glavan. This past summer, Glavan posted a TikTok saying she would “happily watch ‘stay-at-home mom’ content if it emphasized the reality of being a mom in America”. More than 1,200 commenters chimed in on her video, captioned “We need leftist mommy blogger content”, in agreement. Some politely promoted their own accounts, or offered reasons they felt leftist mommy blogger content doesn’t lend itself to virality. “Leftist moms are often working,” one commenter wrote. “Every time I even HINT at my true political beliefs on here I get absolutely destroyed in my comments section,” wrote another. A number of people also expressed their unwillingness to put their children on camera due to privacy concerns and big-tech mistrust, which undoubtedly does not please the algorithmic gods.\n\nI asked Glavan, who does not have children of her own, what led her to make the video. “I don’t see enough examples of how I could do [motherhood] as someone who is left of center and advocates for certain politics,” she said. She believes that “being a mom is so political”, with the realities of motherhood in the US overwhelming even the twentysomething child-free influencer. “You are navigating through the healthcare system, you are probably not getting paid leave. You’re probably not getting any sort of benefits, the cost of diapers …” she lamented before trailing off.\n\nGlavan is pretty much right about, well, the right. The Venn diagram of anti-feminist Trump administration officials and hangers-on, and pronatalist enthusiasts – a movement concerned with women having more babies – has a worryingly chunky midsection. In an NBC poll from this past summer, women aged 18-29 who voted for Donald Trump in 2024 prioritized “having children” as a six out of 13 in their definition of personal success. Women of the same age who voted for Kamala Harris ranked it 12 of 13, prioritizing instead certain financial goals, community building and emotional stability.\n\nThe left’s skepticism or outright rejection of the traditional nuclear family – you know, white picket fence, two-and-a-half kids, general suburban phantasma – is not unique to this presidency. Throughout history, women’s domesticity has been held in tension against their autonomy. Marxist feminists in the 1970s demanded “family abolition”, arguing that the bourgeois family structure upholds the patriarchy and exploits wives as “instruments of production”. Around the same time, the grassroots campaigns Wages For Housework and Black Women for Wages for Housework aimed to raise the visibility of the economic contribution of women’s domestic labor, the latter movement asserting that welfare is a wage, not a charity.\n\nNo need to dive into complex social theory though, just visit any gift shop and pick up a magnet, greetings card or wine glass satirizing the lobotomized housewife and you will get the gist. But with motherhood content sitting at the crux of domestic life, gender politics, and consumerism (many creators aim to monetize views via sponsorships and paid product placement), it simply is not an ideal breeding ground for left-leaning thought leaders. (Though, could one argue that current-day monetization of the performance of labor in momfluencing is an extension of these mid-century feminist crusades? Perhaps!)\n\nMust I reckon with the reality that good politics and pilates arms routines might be at odds with one another? Motherhood content can and is often aesthetically aspirational, but can it also be ideologically so?\n\nIf you buck the algorithm and go searching, you will find creators whose identities fall outside the cookie cutter content farms both in makeup – queer moms, solo moms by choice, blended families – and substance. Moms who focus on gender-imbalanced workloads, like She Is A Paige Turner, or how special needs parenting is impacted by politics, like Eres_rara, or the dissonance of parenting at a time when ICE is separating children from their families and communities, like Bri motherhood. YouTuber Tiffany Ferg has a vlog titled: Why Motherhood Should Radicalize You. It’s all informative, it’s engaging, and it doesn’t quite scratch the itch because it can feel more like a lecture (albeit one I fully endorse) than the habitual mom content I tend to seek out.\n\nEarly attempts to ideologically curate my feeds and rid them of conservative-coded creators also led me to following mothers who romanticize their humble, though devotedly aesthetic, homes and natural fiber-forward lifestyles in back-to-the-earth settings like Mendocino or mid-coast Maine. But I was hoodwinked by their Democratic zip codes and unkempt curtain bangs. Handsome walnut cutting boards might have replaced antiseptic marble islands, but I was also increasingly watching haul videos not of Costco-sized tubs of Tylenol but raw milk to treat preventable illness. What did I expect? It’s Maha-mania out there, and mom influencers are all in.\n\nAround the time I watched Glavan’s video, I also watched a TikTok in which fashion and trend analyst Mandy Lee felt the need to clarify to her followers that her preconception health journey, which she chose to discuss online, was not going to lead her down the Maha or “alt-right” pipeline. Later she clarified she planned to rely on “real science, not Facebook science” in her fertility journey. She did not want to risk that wanting “a child and to have a family would make people assume that [she is] conservative”, which “could not be further from the truth”.\n\nHer disclaimers reminded me of another motherhood movement turned toxic: the forum Mumsnet, which provided moms in the UK with community and support but quickly veered into anti-trans rhetoric and Terfiness.\n\nLast year, motherhood and lifestyle content creator Lisa Miller started incorporating her political beliefs into her videos, after making the move with her family of five from eastern Tennessee to Brooklyn. “With the climate of politics now and having this major platform that I do – really it’s not a major platform compared to some creators, but to me, it is – it’s so important for me to speak out on things that I’m passionate about and that matter,” she said. That wasn’t always the case. Miller was raised by a Mexican American mom with left-leaning views in Detroit before being put in foster care in conservative parts of Virginia. “I just learned very early on to keep my opinions to myself and I didn’t want conflict.”\n\nBut the idea of conflict became less daunting as she witnessed a handful of parenthood creators, such as New York dad Jose Rolon (whose bio pitches his content as “relatable parenting to all families”), seamlessly incorporate politics into their platforms. Between family vacation vlogs and his recaps of his kids’ sports games are videos endorsing Zohran Mamdani and calling on fellow Latino creators to speak up about ICE raids.\n\nNow Miller posts videos that begin with her saying: “Get ready with me to lose a bunch of followers,” in which she discusses her thoughts on gun violence, ICE raids and raising a child on the autism spectrum in RFK Jr’s America as she does her multistep makeup routine and fixes up her hair. I find the series to be an ingenious blend of comforting daily ritual – like your typical momfluencer video – and straightforward political candor. The itch – it’s scratched!\n\nMiller’s defiant stance is common among the minority of mom creators who are vocally left-leaning – an acknowledgment of the apolitical or conservative mommy content they’re competing against. Many will use meme formats to clarify that they are not a tradwife SAHM (stay at home mom) but a “household who believes in science and equal rights”-type SAHM. (Bread and crosses emojis indicate the former, microscopes and rainbow flags the latter.) I’ve also seen a number of videos along the lines of this one, which reads: “POV you’re a progressive mom trying to figure out someone’s [presumably a new mom friend’s] vibe.” (Another way to check a TikTok creator’s politics is to peek at who they’re digitally endorsing in the “reposts” tab.) I have scrolled past many that share a sentiment along the lines of “I might not get invited back to book club, but at least they know where I stand on Palestine.” Since federal agents shot and killed VA nurse Alex Pretti and mom of three, Renee Nicole Good, and detained five-year-old Liam Ramos in Minneapolis, my feed has seen an uptick in videos of moms, some self-proclaimed “wine moms”, posting about how they are engaging with their children or shielding them from the enormity of these indignities.\n\nIt’s corny, but there is some pride that comes with being a conscious content consumer. “When you find out that someone is not a Trump supporter, you’re like, ‘OK, now I trust you, and I want to support your paid brand deals and comment on them and say, get your bag,’” Glavan said. It goes two ways. For Miller, being clear where she stands politically has helped a new and appreciative audience find her. “I found it so freeing and really healing to find like-minded people,” she said. “It certainly was empowering to connect with a community that believes in things like human rights and equality and women’s rights and Black Lives Matter.”\n\nMiller, who has worked with a number of lifestyle brands popular among moms, hasn’t seen a dip in deals with them since sharing her political views. “I’m not using my platform in a negative way and I think that would be different if I were, you know, being negative or being ugly or being hateful,” she said.\n\nI know that watching “day in my life” routines, hoping they will reflect on ways to look out for your neighbors or speak out against the current administration, is sort of like hoping the NFL might pause the Super Bowl to meaningfully address violence against women. But occasionally, you stumble upon something close. And though it might not be aspirational the way a perfectly sliced toddler snack plate is, it is aspirational in the sense it showcases my reality: not only do motherhood and left-leaning outrage coexist, the former often informs the latter.\n\nTo loosely and lazily (my favorite way to scroll) bastardize Marxist theory, there might not be any ethical consumption under motherhood content, but there are certainly some creators I’m hoping “get their bag”.",

    "description": "After 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard, Andrew Miller landed a corporate role at Amazon — but with 6 kids, it didn't leave him enough time to be a dad.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew Miller, 50, in Mount Vernon, Washington, the owner of Tulip Valley Farms. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI remember the moment I looked around my office and saw only performative culture staring back at me.\n\nBetween 70-hour workweeks that started at 4 a.m. and growing disagreements with how the company was being run, I knew something had to give.\n\nIt wasn't hard work that scared me. Before corporate life, I spent 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard.\n\nBut as my family grew, I started questioning the path I was on. I'd never been deployed, but I knew it was likely. With two autistic children at home, my family needed me present. After leaving the military, I landed a corporate role at Amazon.\n\nIt went well for a while, but I was rarely seeing my family, and it wasn't the life I'd envisioned. I realized that while some people live for their role, my most important job was being a dad — I have six kids.\n\nSo, in 2015, I quit my job at Amazon. My wife, Holly, supported my decision, knowing that I was completely drained and losing my sense of purpose.\n\nWe also decided it was time to move back to Washington, where we both grew up.\n\nSkagit County is a place where your kids can run down the trail to a relative's house if they don't like what you're serving for dinner.\n\nIt's also home to an annual tulip festival that's been held for over 40 years.\n\nI took a strategy role with the county's economic development team, working on growth and equity.\n\nSkagit sits at the intersection of outdoor recreation, tourism, and agriculture — yet while the county once had about 4,000 acres of tulips, that number had dropped to roughly 500. I knew we needed a new model, or this county wouldn't be the home of tulips anymore.\n\nI came up with an idea and went for it. I decided to buy a tulip farm and reimagine what it could be — not just a working farm, but a place people wanted to hang out.\n\nIn 2018, I bought my first farm. In the months leading up to the purchase, I quickly learned that many agricultural problems are really business problems.\n\nThe questions weren't just about growing tulips; they were about the experience: How many tulips could we grow? What kind of customer experience could we create? And how should we design the layout of the fields for tourists?\n\nTo prepare, I raised capital with friends and spent six weeks shadowing an 85-year-old Dutch farmer who had been growing tulips since 1984. He and his wife told me they had turned down 16 other buyers before choosing me. He died shortly afterward, and after his death, I moved forward with taking over the farm.\n\nMy former business partner and I bought the 30-acre property for $1.6 million, including both the land and the business.\n\nIn those first months of farm life, my approach was pure curiosity.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, just 10 days before opening.\n\nWe pivoted to flower shipping, and eventually added you-pick experiences once restrictions eased. From what I could see, no one in Skagit County was doing that.\n\nI've learned that I tend to learn things the hard way. My daughter even bought me a pen that reads: \"Maybe I like doing it the hard way.\"\n\nThe fresh approach worked, but my business partnership didn't. After differences in vision, we split, and I went on to buy a second farm: Tulip Valley Farm, which I still run today. I bought it from a 70-year-old potato farmer with hazelnut trees.\n\nToday, my 23-year-old son can operate a forklift, which he learned when he was 15. My sister runs business management and communications.\n\nI still work from 5 a.m. until bedtime, but now I'm home. I'm serving my community.\n\nI'll walk into Costco, and my kids will scatter when someone recognizes me from the farm. My family is happy to know we can take three weeks off in the summer because of how hard we work the rest of the year.\n\nThey've seen the strain, the kitchen-table meetings, the risk of starting from scratch. I want them to see that.\n\nHealing in the soil — for us, and for guests\n\nToday, the farm is flourishing. Visitor numbers have doubled year over year for the past three years. We design the fields not just for farming, but for connection — proposals, photos, moments people want to share.\n\nIn a world where we are gagging for meaningful in-person experiences, people are drawn to farms. I get it. As someone with PTSD from my former career, I can also affirm that dirt therapy is the best therapy.\n\nBeing able to shape your own environment and build your own future is essential.",

It could also bolster SpaceX’s data-center ambitions as Musk competes with rivals like Alphabet's Google, Meta, Amazon-backed Anthropic and OpenAI in the AI sector.\n\nWhat regulatory challenges could this merger face?\n\nWhat makes SpaceX's xAI acquisition record-breaking?\n\nHow will combining SpaceX and xAI benefit both companies?\n\nHow does this fit into Musk's broader business strategy?\n\nThe transaction values SpaceX at $1 trillion, and xAI at $250 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n\"This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: ⁠scaling to make a sentient sun to ‌understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\" Musk said.\n\nThe purchase of xAI sets a new record for the world's largest M&A deal, a distinction held for ‍more than 25 years when Vodafone bought Germany’s Mannesmann in a hostile takeover valued at $203 billion in 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nThe combined company of SpaceX and xAI is expected to price shares at about $527 each, another person familiar with the matter said. ​SpaceX was already the world's most valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share ‌sale. XAI was last valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe merger comes as the space company plans a blockbuster public offering this year that could value it at over $1.5 trillion, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSpaceX, xAI and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe deal further consolidates Musk's far-flung business empire and fortunes into a tighter, mutually reinforcing ecosystem – what some investors and analysts informally call the \"Muskonomy\" – which already includes Tesla, ⁠brain-chip maker Neuralink and tunnel firm the Boring Company.\n\nThe world's richest man ​has a history of merging his ventures together. Musk folded social media ​platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla's stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.\n\nThe ‍agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and ⁠investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk's overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.",

    "description": "Hollywood has been waiting to see if a big YouTuber could bring their fans to theaters. It just happened.",
    "fullText": "Did you hear about the movie that surprised just about everyone at the box office this weekend?\n\nNope, not \"Melania\" — though the sort-of-documentary about the first lady did do better than industry folks had projected, bringing in $7 million in its first weekend.\n\nThe real hit of the weekend was made by someone you probably haven't heard of, unless you are a very specific kind of online person: \"Iron Lung,\" a horror/sci-fi movie, written, directed by, and starring Mark Fischbach, known to his fans as Markiplier on YouTube, where he has 38.2 million subscribers.\n\n\"Iron Lung\" brought in $22 million worldwide, with almost all of that coming from the US over the past few days. Which means Fischbach, who self-financed the movie and says he spent \"a few million dollars\" on it, has probably already turned a profit on the project. (Amazon, meanwhile, has spent a reported $75 million to make and promote \"Melania\", and will be very hard pressed to make that money back — not that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos likely cares about that.)\n\nAnd that means Fischbach has done what the entertainment industry has been waiting a very, very long time to see: He's turned a big online audience into movie ticket sales.\n\nAgain, for comparison: \"Melania\" got a huge promotional rollout from Amazon, aided by the likes of Fox News, which brought Melania Trump on air for multiple interviews, and the president of the United States himself, who pushed the film on his social media accounts. That effort helped generate an estimated 600,000 ticket sales.\n\nFischbach, meanwhile, just used his YouTube presence to push the movie and asked fans to call and email theater owners to convince them to show it. That eventually got the movie onto about 4,000 screens worldwide and led to an estimated 1.9 million in ticket sales.\n\nOf course, you could also argue that these movies are more alike than similar: Critics thought \"Melania\" was awful, and the few people who reviewed \"Iron Lung\" aren't in love with it either.\n\nAlso: Neither movie was made for cineastes, but for fans who wanted to show up to signal their allegiance to the creator/subject. For \"Melania,\" that meant an audience that looked a lot like grandmothers (70% of the audience was female, and 72% was 55 or older, per The Ankler), and for \"Iron Lung\", that meant an audience that could have been their grandsons (61% male, 62% 25 and under).\n\nThe other big difference is that we're unlikely to see many more Big Media companies make a movie designed (just about) explicitly to flatter the president of the United States and his wife.\n\nBut many people are interested in transforming YouTube success into other platforms. It just hasn't happened much. Prior to this weekend, we've only seen that happen with Mr. Beast and his Amazon show. Next question: Can anyone else make the leap?",

Development and operations teams have been struggling for years to bridge the gap between them, and I'm convinced that Nitric has what it takes. They are positioned to be a leader in what we see as what will be critical to transform cloud development.\"\n\n\"The @nitric_io folks are always a joy to talk to... they pour the same enthusiasm and empathy into their product as the developers who use it.\"\n\n\"@nitric_io is indeed an amazing service, our team spent a lot of time deploying and debugging multiple lambda's, especially on testing AWS with Pulumi, Nitric's out of the box and 0 configuration was a great fit for us.\"\n\n\"Building my multi-tenant solution with @nitric_io freed me up to focus on the application code instead of how to deploy infrastructure for scale and configure each of the cloud services to work correctly. Nitric saved me weeks of effort on infrastructure, and their hot-reloading let me rapidly iterate my code during local development.\"\n\n\"@nitric_io has completely transformed our developer productivity so that we can deliver business value quickly. Taking our lengthy deployment process to a fast, fully-automated pipeline has a real impact on the cost to our business and gives us a competitive edge in our speed to market. We're well positioned now to quickly release new features and go after big business opportunities, all while cutting our AWS hosting costs.\"\n\n\"@nitric_io's local development experience has been a game-changer for our team. Previously, working with SAM locally was cumbersome and inefficient. The time-consuming and costly process of debugging in the cloud had us constantly searching for a better solution. Nitric allowed us to build, test, and debug our app offline with ease, enabling us to deploy to the cloud only when we were confident in its readiness. This streamlined approach has significantly enhanced our productivity.\"\n\n\"It was a pleasure contributing to @nitric_io 🙌\"\n\n\"Working with the @nitric_io framework is fun and productive; API creation is seamless, and the overall developer experience is enjoyable. Our team has achieved much easier infrastructure management with Nitric, and our build and deploy times are magnitudes faster. As a result, we can create and release features in half the time, and we'll save even more time on future features that would have required a lot of DevOps work without Nitric.\"\n\n\"@nitric_io is a game changer. I can use it to deliver working API endpoints on day 1, and that's awesome for building trust with a client. Plus, because Nitric is cloud-agnostic, I can de-risk my choices and stay focused on moving fast. This is the best developer experience I've ever seen.\"\n\n\"Awesome cloud/app building experience, a game changer.\"\n\n\"As I've worked on passion projects and experimented with new technology, @nitric_io has been a great framework to help me build and deploy apps without having to be an expert in any particular cloud provider. By leaning on Nitric's abstraction, I can stay focused on domain logic and get a working project to market much faster. Nitric also makes it so I can defer my cloud vendor choice and have a low-cost, low-risk method for switching vendors at any point. For teams, Nitric makes it easy to fit into infrastructure guardrails established by previous projects and eliminates a lot of rework and glue code.\"\n\n\"A big shoutout to the @nitric_io team (@JyeCusch, @stevedemchuk, @timjholm, @raksiv_, and @davemooreuws) for the amazing tool and for the phenomenal support they provided for launching #Python v1 and for addressing the GitHub Issues 💯🙌✅\"\n\nship faster with next generation infrastructure automation using nitric.",

    "fullText": "The major indexes ended Friday in the red — but the week little-changed — as investors digested a tech sell-off, wild trading in silver and gold, and the long-awaited news that President Trump will nominate financial markets stalwart Kevin Warsh to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe tech-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way down on Friday with a loss of roughly 1% after a steep tech sell-off on Thursday. The index ended the week down roughly 0.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost around 0.4% on Friday but still finished the week up a cumulative 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed roughly 0.4% in the week's final session, logging a weekly decline of roughly the same magnitude.\n\nWarsh's nomination early Friday capped off months of market speculation, and the 55-year-old former Fed governor is widely seen as a conservative choice by the president. In response to Warsh's nomination, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) picked up about 0.8% on Friday.\n\nElsewhere in the market, gold (GC=F) sold off by more than 9% on Friday in a turnaround for precious metals. Friday's drop also saw silver (SI=F) and platinum (PL=F) lose more than 28% and 19%, respectively.\n\nOil prices (BZ=F, CL=F) rose roughly 7% over the past five days on tensions around potential US military action in Iran and possible disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nSome of the week's biggest stock market swings came from the biggest names in tech.\n\nWhile both Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) announced even higher spending targets in their fourth quarter earnings reports, Meta ended the week up 8.8%, while Microsoft went the other way, sliding to a loss of 7.6% on the week. The software sector also faced heavy selling pressure through the week after results from industry giant SAP (SAP), as well as other names like ServiceNow (NOW), failed to calm investor fears that software companies are quickly losing ground to AI.\n\nIn the week ahead, investors' attention will be focused on Friday's jobs report. Economists expect the US economy added 65,000 jobs last month, with the unemployment rate set to hold at 4.4%.\n\nReadings on the manufacturing and services sector, as well as consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, will also feature.\n\nIn the corporate world, another busy week of earnings awaits investors as two more \"Magnificent Seven\" companies — Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) — report earnings, alongside other tech heavyweights including Palantir (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).",

    "description": "Amazon's week included a White House screening of the \"Melania\" documentary and another massive round of layoffs.",
    "fullText": "It was a turbulent week for Amazon.\n\nFrom a bungled email prematurely announcing another massive round of layoffs to scrutiny around the company's $75 million investment in a documentary about the first lady, Amazon heads into its quarterly earnings report next week surrounded by a deafening level of outside noise.\n\nOn Saturday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and a top entertainment exec from the company joined a group of CEOs, politicians and celebrities at the White House for a private screening of \"Melania,\" which was produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Melania Trump.\n\nThe event was roundly criticized for appearing tone deaf as it occurred mere hours after federal immigration agents shot and killed urgent care nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, the second such deadly incident there in less than three weeks.\n\nWhile most of the biggest names in tech stayed mum on the matter, many people in the industry expressed outrage over the incidents, and urged other members of the tech community to publicly denounce the killing of Pretti and the prior shooting of Renee Good, as well as President Donald Trump's immigration policies.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who attended the screening, subsequently issued a statement calling for a \"deescalation\" after the recent violence but without mentioning the two fatal shootings. Amazon hasn't commented on the matter.\n\nAmazon's ties to the Melania film, which officially hit theatres on Friday, was awkward enough given the political tensions building in Minneapolis and elsewhere. The price tag has raised further questions about Amazon's agenda and whether the company is trying to curry favor with the president.\n\n\"I'm not involved in that. That was done with my wife,\" President Trump told reporters on Thursday at a premier for the movie in Washington, D.C.. \"I think it's a very important movie. I think it's really going to be very important. It shows life in the White House. It's a big deal, actually.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon MGM said in an email, \"We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.\"\n\nEarly ticket sales for the documentary have been weak, and the film is projected to bring in about $5 million during its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada, Puck News reported, citing National Research Group forecasting data.\n\nMaking the timing even worse for Amazon, which has also agreed to stream a three-part docuseries through Prime Video, the company on Wednesday initiated another round of mass layoffs impacting about 16,000 corporate workers. The company let go of 14,000 employees last October.\n\nThe announcement was preempted a day early by an inadvertent email sent to cloud employees, which alluded to \"organizational changes,\" and a post from Amazon's human resources boss Beth Galetti.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a broader effort by Jassy to cut costs and \"remove bureaucracy\" at the company, while it pushes to invest heavily in artificial intelligence. Some employees previously told CNBC that the cost cuts and rolling layoffs have damaged morale.\n\nIn a Reddit forum for Amazon employees, some users questioned the rationale of the company's money-saving efforts alongside its investment in \"Melania.\"\n\n\"With $75 million we could have given each laid off employee about $4,500,\" wrote one user. \"But instead we spent it on the ridiculous Melania movie. Ashamed to work at Amazon.\"\n\nAnalysts at Citizens said this week that they expect Amazon's 30,000 job cuts to generate up to $8 billion of cost savings in 2026.\n\nIn a segment for \"The Daily Show\" that aired Thursday, host Desi Lydic called it a \"cash grab,\" and criticized Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and former CEO.\n\n\"Why would Jeff Bezos, a billionaire who has tons of business with the government, run by a famously corrupt president known for loving bribes, overpay for a Melania documentary?,\" Lydic said. \"Hmm, let me think.\"\n\nAnd filmmaker Julie Cohen, who previously worked with Amazon on documentaries, told The New York Times that the Melania price tag was abnormal and suggests the company \"is buying something else for their money.\"\n\nAfter he was repeatedly attacked by Trump in his first term, Bezos has cozied up to the president this time around. He's dined with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence, and he attended the inauguration a year ago. Amazon, meanwhile, donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund and helped pay for Trump's $300 million ballroom renovation.\n\nThere was even more drama in the broader Bezos universe this week after multiple outlets reported that the Washington Post, which Bezos has owned since 2013, is preparing broad layoffs across the newsroom, with the sports, local and international sections expected to be impacted.\n\nThe newspaper's White House team wrote a letter to Bezos, describing the importance of the work of those teams and telling their boss that they need \"collaboration with all corners of the newsroom.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results, wrapping up earnings season for the tech giants (though Nvidia reports later in the month).\n\nAmazon is expected to report revenue growth of about 13% to $211.3 billion, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG. The expansion is being driven by Amazon Web Services and digital advertising, which are both projected to show growth of around 22%, based on data from FactSet.\n\nAnalysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets upped their price target on the stock this week and kept their buy recommendation, in part due to an acceleration at AWS, boosted by a recent deal with OpenAI. Amazon is now in talks to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI, CNBC confirmed this week.\n\nAs Amazon races to keep pace with rivals in AI, the company is boosting spending on data centers. In the earnings report, capital expenditures are likely to show an increase of 24% from a year earlier to almost $34.5 billion, according to LSEG.\n\nThe KeyBanc analysts said that while those rising costs will weigh on profitability, \"we believe Amazon will continue looking across the organization for further efficiencies to minimize the potential margin impact.\"\n\nWATCH: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on the 'unprecedented' demand for AI compute",

    "description": "Small businesses struggled to observe the national shutdown to protest ICE. Here's why a boycott of companies like OpenAI and Amazon could be easier and more effective.",
    "fullText": "Economic boycotts are a familiar tool of protest. The problem is they often place the greatest strain on the smallest businesses.\n\nThat was the case during Friday's nationwide general strike, which was designed to pressure the Trump administration to dial back its aggressive anti-immigration policies.\n\nFor many small business owners, the shutdown created a dilemma. Supporting the cause often means losing a day's revenue and risking their ability to keep staff employed. Across social media, owners voiced solidarity alongside an apology for staying open.\n\nThere may, however, be another way, according to Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University famous for his critiques of Big Tech.\n\nInstead of a blanket shutdown, Galloway is calling for Americans to focus on major tech companies by unsubscribing from — or opting out of — services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Amazon's Prime Video, and Microsoft Office.\n\nA targeted boycott starting on Sunday and lasting the entire month of February could move markets, he says, which would, in turn, affect the CEOs who have the ear of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We're proposing something quieter and less cinematic than a protest that will run all day on cable TV, but much more disturbing to the Trump administration. A one-day slowdown is irritating. A one-month slump is terrifying,\" he wrote in a blog post announcing the boycott.\n\nMajor tech CEOs have sought favor with the president during his second term. Many of them donated to his inauguration, for starters.\n\nAI executives, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also accepted an invitation to a White House dinner with Trump in September, where the leaders took turns lauding the president. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attended the White House premiere of the documentary about first lady Melania Trump at the height of January's anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis.\n\nSupporting the AI industry in its competition with China is a major pillar of Trump's economic agenda.\n\n\"These are the leaders who have his ear,\" Galloway writes. \"A modest reduction in their companies' growth could have a substantial impact on valuations priced to perfection. Small changes in consumer behavior — starting on the first day of February — could have an enormous ripple effect, one that extends all the way to the White House.\"\n\nRegular protests against the tactics of ICE and Border Patrol personnel have gripped the country for months. Thousands marched through Minneapolis again on Saturday. Tensions rose dramatically in January after the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, both at the hands of federal immigration agents.\n\nIn both instances, protesters recorded videos and posted them to social media for the world to see, leaving little room for the Trump administration to spin the events in its favor.\n\nWhile those videos and the subsequent protests — as well as the attempted nationwide shutdown — have spread awareness, they have so far done little to substantively shift the administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security demoted a key Border Patrol official last week and promised more changes.

    "description": "James Hwang was laid off by Amazon in October. He says the job market has felt like a \"brick wall\" he can't break through.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with James Hwang, a 28-year-old job seeker who lives in southern Michigan. He previously worked for Amazon as an IT support engineer until being laid off last October. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOne morning in October, I got an automated text message from Amazon telling me to check my personal email before clocking in. I saw an email from HR telling me I'd been laid off.\n\nI was very surprised because I believed I was a high performer who had contributed a lot to the organization over my four years there. IT support employees like myself had also generally been spared in previous layoffs, and I felt we were already short-staffed.\n\nSince I'm the breadwinner in my family, I started looking for work right away, focusing on cloud support and IT system engineering roles. The job market has been crazy hard, and I haven't found a new job yet.\n\nWhile my final paychecks from Amazon I received through this month have helped cushion the transition, the slow progress in my job search has left me increasingly worried about my finances.\n\nMy wife and I have a young son and a mortgage. Our priority now is covering essentials and staying on top of our credit card payments. We've started budgeting for a potentially longer period of unemployment and cutting back on eating out and spending on other non-essentials.\n\nGetting laid off has made me reflect on my journey at Amazon.\n\nI was born and raised in Michigan, but in 2021, I lived in Seoul, South Korea, and worked for a small tech company. I thought joining a larger corporation would be better for my career, and I landed an IT support engineering role at Amazon's Seoul office.\n\nAfter about three years, it seemed like the best way to keep progressing was to move back to the US. In 2024, I transferred to a similar role on a fully remote team, which allowed me to return home to Michigan.\n\nMy team has members spread across the globe to ensure round-the-clock support, but that setup didn't align well with Amazon's evolving return-to-office policy, which became a five-day-a-week mandate for many employees one year ago. My team wasn't based near any single location, and my closest office was about an hour's drive away.\n\nMy understanding was that even after the latest RTO mandate took effect, some teams were still allowed to remain remote — a decision their VPs had some influence over. By midway through last year, however, it seemed like there was more top-down pressure to return to the office — pressure even VPs couldn't push back on.\n\nWhile I was never required to work from an office, I believe being a remote employee may have made me more vulnerable to layoffs — I heard that a fair number of my remote colleagues, both abroad and in the US, were affected. Amazon said the layoffs were driven by culture, and I think prioritizing in-office employees may have been part of that.\n\nI'm not sure there was much opportunity for advancement for me as a remote employee anyway. I was interested in an engineering role on another team but was told I'd need to relocate to Seattle. Since my wife and I bought a home last year and have strong family roots in Michigan, we're not open to relocating.\n\nMy job hunt has been really challenging so far. I typically spend about five hours a day job hunting during the week and scale back a bit on weekends.\n\nMy goal has been to find an engineering role like the kind of position I would've struggled to get at Amazon without relocating. I've been using my network as much as possible to try to secure referrals, while also applying to jobs cold.\n\nI've been targeting remote roles. In Michigan, there are some tech opportunities at large auto companies, but they typically require at least a hybrid schedule, and the pay is often lower than what I earned at Amazon. I'd be open to an in-office role, as long as it meets my compensation expectations, which are roughly a six-figure base salary. I live about 40 minutes from Detroit and would consider roles there if the right opportunity came along.\n\nI received one job offer from a company with a five-day office mandate, but I turned it down. The commute would've been an hour each way, and the role came with a fairly strict non-compete agreement that could've limited my ability to switch jobs.\n\nIt's been tough to land interviews. The AI-powered applicant tracking systems have been frustratingly difficult to navigate. While my search has been discouraging, I know I can't afford to slow down, especially as more laid-off workers flood the market and competition increases.\n\nI'm super stressed about my job search and recently applied for unemployment benefits. Since I started job searching in October, I've applied to more than 200 roles and had about five interviews. But I haven't given up.\n\nMy best advice for people who have been laid off, including those recently laid off by Amazon, is to lean on your connections. In today's market, it's tough without a referral. While it's important to stay consistent in your job search, I'd also recommend taking some time to rest — apply steadily, not at full throttle.\n\nThis is a marathon, not a sprint.",

    "fullText": "Nicole Sperling and Brooks Barnes, reporting for The New York Times:\n\nAmazon paid Ms. Trump’s production company $40 million for the\nrights to “Melania,” about $26 million more than the next closest\nbidder, Disney. The fee includes a related docuseries that is\nscheduled to air later this year. The budget for “Melania” is\nunknown, but documentaries that follow a subject for a limited\namount of time usually cost less than $5 million to produce. The\n$35 million for marketing is 10 times what some other high-profile\ndocumentaries have received.\n\nAll of which has a lot of Hollywood questioning whether Amazon’s\npush is anything more than the company’s attempt to ingratiate\nitself with President Trump.\n\nThis is a good story, with multiple industry sources with experience making political documentaries, but the Times’s own subhead downplays Amazon’s spending on the film: “The tech giant is spending $35 million to promote its film about the first lady, far more than is typical for documentaries.” They’re spending $35 million now, to promote it, but they already paid $40 million for the rights to the film, $28 million of which is believed to have gone to Melania Trump herself. A $35 million total spend would be a lot compared to other high-profile documentaries, but it’s a $75 million total spend. This is not just a little fishy — it’s a veritable open air seafood market.\n\nTo grasp just how uncustomary Amazon’s marketing push for\n“Melania” is, consider how Magnolia Pictures handled “RBG,”\na portrait of Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her 25th year as a\nSupreme Court justice, in 2018.\n\nCNN Films produced “RBG” for around $1 million. The promotional\nbudget, including an awards campaign that helped it land two Oscar\nnominations, totaled about $3 million. The film debuted in 34\ntheaters and expanded into 432 locations over several weeks. It\nultimately collected $14 million, enough to rank as the year’s No.\n1 political documentary.\n\nOn Friday, “Melania” will also be released in 1,600 theaters\noverseas, where FilmNation, a New York company, is handling\ndistribution in more than 20 countries. International ticket sales\nare expected to be weak, according to box office analysts.\n\nDisplay Preferences",

    "description": "After being laid off by Amazon in October 2025, Iren Azra Zou landed a new job two weeks later. She shared her top advice for other laid-off workers.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Iren Azra Zou, a 27-year-old in New Jersey. She is a founding engineer at tech startup Double Nickel, and previously worked as a software engineer at Amazon until being laid off in October 2025. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe day before Amazon announced layoffs in October, there were rumors that something big was coming.\n\nI had a strange feeling in my gut that I might be affected, even though I felt I was performing well and had met my goals earlier than expected. I'd been laid off from my previous tech job the year prior, in 2024, and I knew how, in situations like these, people can quickly become just numbers on a spreadsheet.\n\nIt was hard to sleep that night, and the next morning, I woke up to a 6 a.m. automated text from Amazon telling me to check my email for a message about my role. At that moment, I was pretty sure I had been laid off, which the message soon confirmed.\n\nThe first person I told was my husband, who was next to me in bed. After that, I messaged a few close coworkers to figure out who else had been affected. When I found out that some rock stars on my team had also been laid off, I was shocked.\n\nI was mentally prepared for my layoff — due to the speculation that cuts were coming — but I was also financially prepared.\n\nMy husband and I had taken steps to save aggressively and ensure we had enough savings to last for a while if we were both laid off. That financial cushion helped me stay calm when I found out I'd lost my job.\n\nI made a point to stick to my daily routines: coffee, exercise, and sleep schedule. I didn't want everything to feel chaotic.\n\nI quickly started looking for new job opportunities, and two weeks later, I landed and accepted an offer to start a software engineering role in December.\n\nHere's my advice for anyone who's recently been laid off:\n\nWhen you get laid off, you can't help but ask yourself, \"Why me?\"\n\nEventually, you come to terms with the reality that you can do everything right and still be included in a layoff simply because you're a number on a budget sheet. I know I worked hard and brought a lot to the table; a layoff didn't erase that.\n\nI was prepared for interviewers to ask about my Amazon layoff, but it didn't really come up. I think other companies recognized the scale of the layoff and that it wasn't performance-based, in many cases. I also think that, despite the layoff, having a household name like Amazon on my résumé was probably helpful.\n\nReflect on what you want in your next role and create a targeted job search plan to maximize your chances of landing it. I wanted to make sure I found the right fit, so this was really helpful for me.\n\nUpon reflection, I decided that the best fit for me might be at a smaller company with less bureaucracy than Amazon — and where I could better see the impact of my work.\n\nThe pro of working at a big company was that you could do one thing and it could affect millions of people in less than 30 minutes, which was exciting. However, the downside was that it sometimes felt like you were a very tiny piece in a giant machine.\n\nI was also hoping to land a remote role. For the last few months of my time at Amazon, I'd been required to commute one hour each way from New Jersey to the New York City office five days a week, which was really draining. I figured I might have more leverage to ask for remote flexibility at a smaller company than at Amazon, where so many people are competing for job postings.\n\nMy team at Amazon also didn't have many women, so I wanted to be in a place with a bit more diversity.\n\nI narrowed down my target: a software engineering role at a small company that offered remote flexibility — and where I felt I could grow and thrive.\n\nThis is not the time to be shy — most people will be sympathetic and eager to support you.\n\nI believe my LinkedIn presence — where I'm very active, posting career advice tailored to young professionals — helped me boost my visibility.\n\nThe day after my layoff, the chief technology officer of Double Nickel — a tech startup focused on truck driver recruitment — reached out to me on LinkedIn about a software engineering role they were hiring for. She said she'd seen my post-layoff LinkedIn post and, as a former Amazon employee herself, decided to reach out.\n\nThe role seemed like a good fit, so I applied and quickly landed an interview.\n\nFollowing the interviews, I was given an offer, which I accepted. We agreed to an arrangement where I'd work in a hybrid setup for the first few months to help with onboarding, and then transition to remote work around the end of February. So far, I'm very happy with the role.\n\nLooking back, I see the layoff as a turning point because it helped me clarify what I wanted in my next role. It was still a difficult experience, but I felt more grounded and optimistic as time went on — and ultimately landed a role I feel great about.",

    "description": "How Amazon's decision translates to your own workplace.",
    "fullText": "16,000 jobs down. How many more to go?\n\nThe sequel to Amazon's mass layoffs last fall came yesterday with another round of deep job cuts. I'd love to tell you it's an isolated incident, but it feels representative of a broader shift across tech and corporate America.\n\nAI is ushering in a new era for workplaces, and companies are adjusting accordingly. As the ones closest to the tech (and spending the most on it), Big Tech would be the first to evolve. Make no mistake: Where Big Tech goes, the rest of the business world will likely follow.\n\nSo what can we glean from Amazon's layoffs? Fortunately, my colleagues Eugene Kim and Ashley Stewart are crushing it with scoops. Their stories provide context about Amazon's decision and how that translates to your own workplace.\n\nNo one is safe: Internal Slack messages Ashley viewed show how many teams were bitten by the layoff bug. That includes businesses within AWS (its AI cloud service and cloud data warehouse service) and Amazon's retail business.\n\nOne Amazon worker used an AI tool to flag roles on the chopping block. That list is even broader, although it may contain inaccuracies since it's AI-generated. Another noticeable trend is how software engineers got hit particularly hard, as has been the case in tech recently.\n\nOwn it: After a not-so-hot start, Amazon has coordinated its post-layoffs communications. And there's one word that keeps cropping up: ownership.\n\nPrasad Kalyanaraman, VP of AWS Infrastructure, and Colleen Aubrey, SVP of Applied AI Solutions, both described \"doubling down on a culture of ownership\" in memos Ashley viewed. That sentiment, coupled with the changes Eugene reported on in performance reviews, signals that the further away you are from doing the actual work, the more at risk you are.\n\nAI can be a friend as much as a foe: Artificial intelligence often takes a lot of blame for why jobs are getting swallowed up. A memo from AWS VP Greg Pearson that Eugene viewed paints a different picture.\n\nHe urged workers to \"keep finding ways to use technology to simplify our work.\" It's something I heard a lot of last week when chatting with execs: \"AI won't take your job, but the person willing to use it will.\"\n\nMake change, don't manage it: I'm not a tech career coach (I'll leave that advice to this guy), but the layoffs, coupled with CEO Andy Jassy's ongoing war against bureaucracy, indicate a desire to get more people rolling up their sleeves.\n\nIt's reminiscent of a recent convo I had with Cisco president and chief product officer Jeetu Patel. He stressed the importance of figuring out the change you want to make and working toward it, rather than focusing on a job title.\n\n\"If in the pursuit of that change, you have to go out and reluctantly manage some people, then go ahead and do that,\" Patel told me. \"But management, in and of itself, is not a full-time job.\"",

    "fullText": "Amazon cut 16,000 more corporate jobs on Wednesday, and leadership wants the remaining staff to become even more efficient through technology.\n\nIn an email addressing the layoffs on Wednesday, Greg Pearson, VP of global sales at Amazon Web Services, urged employees to keep using technology to streamline their work.\n\n\"Moving forward, I encourage you to keep finding ways to use technology to simplify our work, amplify our impact, and focus on the activities that directly drive value for our customers,\" Pearson wrote in the email obtained by Business Insider. \"And most importantly, take care of yourselves and each other.\"\n\nPearson's message mirrors Amazon's broader drive to run more efficiently as it reorganizes amid rapid advances in AI. Although the company initially linked the October layoffs to AI, CEO Andy Jassy later said they were driven more by cultural fit than by cost reductions or automation.\n\nJassy has previously said AI will ultimately reduce Amazon's workforce by driving efficiency gains. On Wednesday, Amazon's chief human resources officer, Beth Galetti, said in the layoff announcement that the company will continue hiring and investing in \"strategic areas.\"\n\nWednesday's layoff was Amazon's second round of mass job cuts since October, when it axed 14,000 roles.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Amazon announced it's cutting 16,000 jobs. The career coach Kyle Elliott said you should use these two critical tools to help you find a job after a layoff.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kyle Elliott, 33, a career coach who lives in California. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGetting laid off is very traumatic — and it's becoming more common.\n\nI've been a full-time career coach to tech employees at startups and in Big Tech since 2017, and I've seen how layoffs have become more visible in recent years.\n\nI help clients navigate life after a layoff, including what role they want next and how to apply for new jobs.\n\nAmazon has announced new plans to cut staff, and I want affected employees to remember that they are coming from one of the world's top companies.\n\nPeople will want them, and they will find something.\n\nWhen people reach out to me for coaching after a layoff, many have a scarcity mindset and feel like they have to apply for any job.\n\nFor some people who urgently need to pay rent or put food on the table, that's necessary. But in other cases, it makes sense to take a beat and evaluate what you're really looking for in your next role.\n\nThe very first thing I ask clients to do is create a list of \"must-haves\" and \"dealbreakers\" for their next job. What are their salary expectations? Will they only work remotely? Are they willing to relocate? If you write the list before you start interviewing, you can act from a place of logic rather than panic.\n\nThe second step is to update your résumé and LinkedIn profile, which are two of your most critical tools in today's market. You're going to submit a résumé with almost every application, and having an up-to-date LinkedIn account puts you in a good position if potential employers check it or recruiters go looking for talent on the platform.\n\nYou want to optimize for the roles you're looking for in 2026, which means that if you were an engineer when you joined Amazon but are now a director, you want to make sure that's reflected on your LinkedIn page.\n\nI've seen clients turn to quick hacks for their job search, like asking AI to tailor their résumé or using it to find and apply to roles for them. But if everyone does that, you don't stand out.\n\nI can usually tell quickly if someone's written their résumé with AI. For example, they'll be applying to a systems engineer role, and it won't even have the phrase \"systems engineer\" in it.\n\nEveryone thinks only AI is reading their résumé, but I have clients who work in talent acquisition and HR — the humans who are still involved in the recruitment process. Humans hire other humans, even at big companies.\n\nIn the age of AI, be more human. Take a step back and think, if you were a human looking at this résumé, what would you want to see? Then put those phrases near the top, rather than using AI to create generic slop.\n\nI'd suggest creating a master résumé that you can spend 20 minutes tailoring for different roles. If you're using AI, use it more like an extra tool, rather than the thing that's driving your job search.\n\nLayoffs are normal now, especially in the tech industry, and there's much less stigma around them.\n\nBut there's more competition in the job market, because it's easier to apply for jobs with AI, for example, so the challenges around layoffs are different nowadays.\n\nIn today's job market, it's important to figure out what's unique about you. Lots of people will meet the job requirements, so you need to communicate why the company should hire you over the thousands of other applicants.\n\nOne thing that can help you is to look back at performance reviews and identify things people repeatedly say about you. You can try asking three to five people to share what makes you fabulous and to give examples. I've found that clients are surprised by the feedback they receive.",

    "fullText": "Amazon is cutting 16,000 corporate roles, and an internal FAQ viewed by Business Insider spells out the details for affected employees.\n\nThis round of layoffs is the second mass job cut since October, when Amazon shed 14,000 roles. The moves are part of a broad effort by the company to operate more efficiently amid rapid advances in AI. Amazon didn't respond to requests for further comments on the job cuts.\n\nEmployees who received a layoff notification will receive full pay and benefits for 90 days plus an additional severance package, and are no longer expected to perform any work, according to the document.\n\nAmazon's public announcement stated that the company is offering most US-based employees 90 days to search for a new role internally. The FAQ states affected employees are \"welcome to apply for available roles through the internal process\" during the 90-day notification period.\n\nThe FAQ is below. Business Insider removed Amazon login guidance from this FAQ to avoid disclosing security-related details.\n\nBelow are answers to some of the most common questions related to your pay, benefits, support resources, and next steps. To review additional FAQs, log into A to Z via mobile app or browser > Go to 'Quick Links' section and click on 'My HR' > View All Help Categories > My Employment > Leaving Amazon > Reduction in Force\n\nQ. Am I expected to continue working from this point forward?\n\nA: No. You are no longer required to perform any work on Amazon's behalf, effective immediately, and will receive your full pay and benefits for the next 90 days plus an additional severance package.\n\nQ. I am currently on a leave of absence, or I need to take a leave of absence during the notification period. How does that impact me?\n\nA: You may request and take approved leaves of absence during the notification period. However, leaves of absence will end as of your separation date.\n\nQ: What is the severance package?\n\nA: If your role is eliminated, the formal announcement paperwork you receive within the next 24 hours will have the details of how your severance package is calculated. Generally, you will receive: Your full pay and benefits during the transition period, and you will be offered a severance package. To receive your severance payment, you will be required to sign and return the severance and release agreement. We will send this to your personal email address on file no less than ten days after your separation date.\n\nQ: When will my benefits coverage end?\n\nA: Medical, vision, dental and other benefits will generally continue through the last day of the month in which your employment ends, unless you are a part-time or seasonal employee, in which case your benefits will end in accordance with the applicable policy. You may also be eligible for transitional benefits coverage as outlined in your severance documentation. For specific questions about your benefit end dates and transitional coverage, please contact My HR (log into A to Z via the mobile app or browser > Go to 'Quick Links' section and click on 'MyHR').\n\nQ: I have personal belongings at the office. How do I retrieve them?\n\nA: We want to ensure your personal belongings are handled according to your preferences. To help us coordinate this process efficiently, please complete our brief Personal Belongings Survey by clicking the link. This survey will allow you to specify how you'd like your desk/locker items handled, provide shipping information, and note any special instructions for fragile or sensitive items. We will aim to return items to employees within two (2) weeks, but it may take up to 30 days.

    "description": "The layoffs mark the second round of mass cuts at Amazon since last October, when the company laid off roughly 14,000 employees across its corporate workforce.",
    "fullText": "Amazon said Wednesday it plans to eliminate about 16,000 corporate jobs, marking its second round of mass job cuts since last October.\n\nIn a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs were part of an ongoing effort to \"strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.\" That coincides with a push to invest heavily in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe cuts come just a few months after October's layoffs, when 14,000 employees were let go across Amazon's corporate workforce. At the time, the company indicated the cuts would continue in 2026 as it found \"additional places we can remove layers.\"\n\nBeth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, didn't rule out more job cuts in the future, but said the company isn't trying to create \"a new rhythm\" of broad layoffs every few months.\n\n\"That's not our plan,\" Galetti wrote. \"But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, some employees in Amazon's cloud unit received an email sent in an apparent error acknowledging \"organizational changes\" at the company. The note referenced a post from Galetti and said Amazon notified \"impacted colleagues in our organization.\"\n\nAmazon had about 1.58 million employees as of the end of its third quarter. That figure is primarily made up of warehouse and logistics workers.\n\nThe 30,000 job cuts since October represent about 10% of its corporate and tech workforce, which comprises about 350,000 people.\n\nAmazon has been in the midst of a significant downsizing for the past several years. The company laid off more than 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and it conducted smaller cuts across various organizations in 2024.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy has looked to slim down Amazon's workforce after the company went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services.\n\nJassy has also looked to reset Amazon's corporate culture so that it can operate like the \"world's largest startup.\" He set internal targets to slash management layers and established a \"no bureaucracy email alias\" to identify ways the company can innovate faster.\n\nAmazon has also been cutting costs across its business so that it can invest \n\nLast October, Amazon said it expects capital expenditures to reach $125 billion for 2026, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies.\n\nJassy said last June that efficiency gains from AI would likely cause Amazon's corporate headcount to fall in the coming years.\n\n\"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" Jassy said at the time.",

    "description": "Message erroneously said affected employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been...",
    "fullText": "Workers informed after message had erroneously said affected employees in US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been told\n\nAmazon has told workers it is cutting 16,000 jobs globally to streamline its operations, hours after sending out a message to staff about the layoffs apparently in error.\n\nIt is the second major wave of job cuts at the US online retail giant, and comes just three months after the company said it was slashing 14,000 roles.\n\nThe majority of jobs affected are expected to be in the US, although some roles in the UK may also be affected.\n\nThe company said the “additional organisational changes” were designed to “strengthen our organisation by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy”, according to a blogpost to staff from Beth Galetti, the senior vice president of people experience and technology.\n\nGaletti said some teams had not been affected by the job cuts announced in October, but this was not the beginning of regular waves of layoffs. “Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months. That’s not our plan,” she wrote.\n\nUS-based employees who are affected will be offered 90 days to find a new role internally, with the timing for applying for new roles varying in other countries.\n\nGaletti said Amazon would continue to hire new staff and invest in “strategic areas and functions that are critical to our future”.\n\nThe official announcement came just hours after workers at Amazon Web Services (AWS) received an online meeting invitation from a top executive on Tuesday for the following day – subsequently cancelled – that also contained a draft email revealing the cuts.\n\nThe message erroneously said that affected employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been told they had lost their jobs.\n\nIt was signed by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice-president of applied AI solutions at the company’s cloud computing arm AWS, while the layoffs were referred to in the email as “Project Dawn”.\n\n“Changes like this are hard on everyone,” Aubrey wrote in the email, which was seen by multiple news outlets including Reuters and Bloomberg. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organisation and AWS for future success.”\n\nThe email referred to a separate message from Amazon’s human resources boss, which did not appear to have been sent.\n\nAmazon has been trying to reverse a pandemic hiring spree in an effort to cut costs and slim down its huge operation, which employs about 1.5 million people worldwide.\n\nAmazon’s chief executive, Andy Jassy, has previously warned white-collar workers at the company that their jobs could be taken by AI in the next few years.\n\nThe news of fresh Amazon layoffs came as the US delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS) said it would cut up to 30,000 jobs this year, adding to last year’s job reductions, as it focuses on higher-margin shipments.\n\nUPS has been working to cut millions of low-value deliveries it carries out for Amazon, which is its largest customer but increasingly also a delivery rival. UPS has called its business with Amazon “extraordinarily dilutive” to margins.",

    "title": "Amazon slashes 16,000 roles in latest phase of a broader reset",
    "description": "Amazon announces another mass layoff as CEO Andy Jassy takes aim at bureaucracy and seeks a cultural reset.",
    "fullText": "Amazon said it is eliminating around 16,000 corporate roles globally, marking its second round of mass job cuts since October, when it shed 14,000 roles.\n\nThe latest layoffs were announced on Wednesday by Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, who described the move as part of broader efforts to cut back on bureaucracy inside the company.\n\n\"As I shared in October, we've been working to strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy,\" wrote Galetti in a memo that was shared on Amazon's blog. \"While many teams finalized their organizational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now.\"\n\nGaletti added that Amazon would offer \"most\" US-based employees 90 days to search for a new role internally. Those who are unable to find a role or choose not to will be given support, including severance pay and health insurance benefits, she added.\n\nThe cuts underscore Amazon's push to operate more efficiently as it reshapes the organization amid rapid advances in AI. While the company initially linked the October layoffs to AI-driven changes, CEO Andy Jassy later said those reductions were more about cultural fit than cost savings or automation.\n\nOn Tuesday, some Amazon employees received a calendar invitation regarding job cuts that had apparently been sent early.\n\nEarlier this week, Amazon also announced it would shutter its Amazon Go and Fresh stores, citing its failure to create a \"truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model.\"\n\nAmazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce represents a relatively small share of that total, at roughly 350,000 employees.\n\nIn recent years, Amazon has trimmed management layers, tightened spending, overhauled performance systems, and ordered most corporate employees to return to the office five days a week.\n\nGaletti acknowledged the numerous cuts in the memo, but didn't rule out further changes ahead. \"Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm — where we announce broad reductions every few months,\" she wrote.\n\n\"That's not our plan. But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate.\"\n\nThat cultural reset accelerated after the pandemic, when Amazon's explosive growth slowed. The company moved to rein in costs by shutting down unprofitable initiatives and shrinking what executives described as a bloated workforce. Last year, Jassy said efficiency gains from AI would eventually reduce Amazon's head count.\n\nAmazon's moves mirror a broader trend across Big Tech, where companies have cut thousands of jobs while ramping up AI investment.\n\nMicrosoft said last year it would eliminate about 15,000 positions, with CEO Satya Nadella telling employees the company needed to stay focused on its AI transformation. Meta has also made AI-driven cuts, telling employees in its risk organization last year that their roles were being replaced by automation.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Some Amazon employees got a worrying calendar invitation on Tuesday, stoking more concern about job cuts that are expected in coming days.\n\nThe invitation addressed impending job cuts and mentioned \"Project Dawn,\" an initiative to improve efficiency at Amazon, according to a copy obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe invitation had the subject line \"Send Project Dawn email\" and was written by Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of AWS Solutions, although it appears to have been sent by an assistant.\n\nThe invitation was for a calendar event at 5 a.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, but it was canceled shortly after it was sent. Some employees noticed it and shared the information with Business Insider.\n\n\"This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers,\" the accompanying message read. \"The notifications to impacted colleagues in our organization who are based in the US, Canada, and Costa Rica have now been completed.\"\n\n\"Changes like this are hard on everyone,\" Aubrey's message continued. \"These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success.\"\n\nAmazon plans to cut thousands of corporate roles in coming days, Business Insider previously reported. The reductions would mark the company's second round of mass layoffs since October, when it eliminated roughly 14,000 jobs. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter the calendar invitation landed, confusion spread across an internal Slack channel with more than 36,000 Amazon employees, according to messages viewed by Business Insider. Staff questioned whether the message had been intended for Aubrey's entire organization or only for those whose roles were being eliminated.\n\n\"Am I impacted or sent by mistake to all?\" one employee wrote.\n\nOthers saw the email as confirmation that the expected layoffs were imminent.\n\n\"Well, if you needed solid proof that tomorrow is legit, the project dawn email is it,\" one person wrote. \"Looks like they wanted to use AI to send an email tomorrow and instead it sent a calendar invite today.\"\n\nIt remains unclear which teams will be affected by the cuts. Some Amazon employees who spoke to Business Insider theorized that staff who received the accidental invitation may not be among those getting cut.\n\n\"People are speculating you're safe if invited,\" one employee said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Rebecca Yarros' \"Fourth Wing\" is being turned into an Amazon series. Producer Michael B. Jordan recently assured fans that the show is on its way.",
    "fullText": "At this point, it's hard not to be familiar with Rebecca Yarros' \"Empyrean\" series about dragon rider Violet Sorrengail.\n\nWhen \"Onyx Storm,\" the third book in the romantasy series, was released in January 2025, it became the fastest-selling adult novel in 20 years.\n\nYarros is taking a break from the \"Empyrean\" series before writing the fourth installment, but in the meantime, we're getting closer to a series adaptation of \"Fourth Wing.\"\n\nIn October 2023, Deadline announced that Amazon MGM Studios and Oscar nominee Michael B. Jordan's Outlier Society were developing \"Fourth Wing\" into a Prime Video series. Yarros is an executive producer for the show.\n\nOutlier Society produced Jordan's \"Creed III\" and is developing a slate of other series and films in addition to \"Fourth Wing.\"\n\nDeadline also reported in October 2023 that Amazon MGM Studios had acquired the rights to the entire \"Empyrean\" series. In her January 2025 Variety interview, Yarros said she had shared the \"five-book arc\" for the \"Empyrean\" series with Amazon.\n\n\"They have the five-book arc, which went a little awry in Book 3 just because the positioning, but they already know that,\" she told Variety. \"But they have the five-book arc and the general big points of what happens in between each book, but they don't have the specifics between Book 4 and Book 5, because I'm getting ready to go to my crazy plotting board and and plot out every single event that happens in each book, so that I make sure that I'm within my two books there.\"\n\nIn July 2024, Outlier Society announced it had hired Moira Walley-Beckett, who worked on shows like \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Anne with an E,\" as the showrunner for the series. In a January 2025 interview with Variety, Yarros said Walley-Beckett was \"great\" and \"phenomenal,\" but in July 2025, Walley-Beckett exited the project.\n\nJac Schaeffer, best known for her work on Disney's \"WandaVision\" and \"Agatha All Along,\" was rumored to be in talks to step into the showrunner role. However, in September 2025, Variety and Deadline reported that Amazon was hiring Meredith Averill.\n\nAverill was previously the showrunner of the Netflix series \"Locke & Key\" and a producer on shows like \"The Good Wife\" and \"The Haunting of Hill House.\"\n\nAmazon declined to comment on this piece when contacted by Business Insider, but Yarros shared a screenshot of Deadline's article on her Instagram when the showrunner announcement dropped.\n\n\"Welcome to the team, Meredith Averill! Guys, I love everything this wonderful woman has worked on and I'm so excited to have her joining us,\" Yarros said in her caption.\n\nNeither Amazon nor Outlier Society has announced any casting or release dates for the series. Still, in January 2026, Jordan assured fans it was on its way in an interview with Deadline.\n\n\"We are making sure that this is going to be an exciting show that delivers on all of the things the fans want and some of the things that they won't be expecting either,\" Jordan said.\n\nHe also told the outlet he's aware of how much fans of \"Fourth Wing\" care about the series.\n\n\"But trust me, I know how beloved this franchise IP is,\" he said. \"It's early stages, but I feel how much people care about this one. It's not lost on us.\"\n\nAlthough details about the series are limited, Yarros made a few comments about the show while promoting \"Onyx Storm.\"\n\nSpeaking at an engagement on January 24, 2025, in New York, Yarros told fans she had read the pilot for the \"Fourth Wing\" show — and loved it.\n\n\"I read the latest version of the pilot last week,\" she said. \"It's really nerve-racking when you read something like that because you're really — you're trusting someone else with your baby, right? And you're trusting someone else to say, like, 'Hey, this is important in your work, and this isn't,' and you kinda get your guard up.\"\n\n\"But guys, I, like, kicked my feet the whole time,\" she said. \"You're gonna love it.\"\n\nYarros also praised Walley-Beckett at the event, calling her a \"brilliant writer\" and saying she maintained the integrity of the book in the pilot. It's unclear how the pilot may have changed since Walley-Beckett's exit from the project.\n\nSpeaking at an event in London on August 30, 2024, Yarros said casting will ultimately fall on the show's staff, not her. She also said she intentionally hasn't shared any specific actors she hopes will be cast in the series.\n\n\"I will never say who my perfect fan cast is because the cast is so diverse, and I want to open that up to more diversity,\" she said. \"And I feel like the second I say who I think this character is, that's who everyone will accept. That's only who they will accept.\"\n\n\"I kinda hope they find, like, an up-and-coming generation,\" she added. \"But I would never put my fan cast in your heads.\"\n\nAlthough she won't be involved in casting the series, Yarros said at the same event that she has one hard-line casting request she has communicated to Amazon and Outlier Society.\n\n\"They know how staunch I am against whitewashing Xaden,\" she said. \"I think that's the biggest thing.\"\n\nXaden Riorson, Violet's love interest in the series, is described as having \"warm tawny skin\" in \"Fourth Wing\" and \"tawny-brown\" skin in both \"Iron Flame\" and \"Onyx Storm.\"",

    "description": "The year just started, and Amazon's already paying over $3 billion in legal settlements.",
    "fullText": "January isn't over yet, and Amazon's already set to pay more than $3 billion to U.S. customers across various settlements. If you've bought anything from Amazon recently, keep an eye out: Bezos' baby could owe you some money.\n\nIf you've had difficulty returning an Amazon package recently, you could have a paycheck coming your way soon. As reported by Reuters, the company has agreed to a $309 million cash settlement (in addition to \"other benefits\") with affected customers, alongside more than $600 million in individual refunds. According to lawyers for the plaintiffs, the settlement as a whole provides more than $1 billion in relief.\n\nThe lawsuit accused the e-commerce giant of causing \"substantial unjustified monetary losses\" with its return policies, which the plaintiffs say resulted in many customers returning items only to be charged for them anyway. Amazon denied any wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but did say it will spend more than $363 million improving its return and refund practices.\n\nThe company claims that, after an internal review last year, it \"identified a small subset of returns where we issued a refund without the payment completing, or where we could not verify that the correct item had been sent to us, so no refund had been issued.\" However, Amazon said it had taken steps to resolve the issue, as seen in the refunds on years-old returns the company started issuing last year.\n\nThe settlement is still awaiting approval from U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead in Seattle, but as both parties support it, it'll likely come soon. The class would cover \"U.S. purchasers of goods on Amazon from Sept 2017 who allegedly did not receive timely or correct refunds, or who were later charged despite returning items,\" writes Reuters.\n\nIt's currently unclear how class members would file a claim, or how the $309 million cash settlement and $600 million individual refunds will be divvied up. However, the plaintiffs told the court that class members should expect to recover the full amount of lost funds, plus interest.\n\nEligible class members are often contacted by email, so keep an eye out. In the meantime, you can also search for legal updates using the case name, \"In re: Amazon Return Policy Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, No. 2:23-CV-1372-JNW.\"\n\nWhile Amazon's returns settlement is still in its early phases, it's not the biggest payout the company's had to make this year. Earlier this January, Amazon reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the FTC over accusations that it had essentially tricked people into either signing up for or staying subscribed to Prime. Claims are going out in two ways, one of which is automatic, and the other you have to \n\nAccording to the settlement website, as well as the FTC, automatic payments should have gone out already, and applied to people who meet the following requirements:\n\nYou are a U.S. consumer who signed up for Prime between June 23, 2019 and June 23, 2025, and\n\nYou enrolled through a Challenged Enrollment Flow, and\n\nYou used no more than three Prime benefits in a 12-month period from June 23, 2019 and June 23, 2025.\n\nIf that doesn't sound like you, or you didn't receive a payment, you'll need to file a claim using the \"File Claim\" button on the settlement website. You're eligible to do this if you meet the follow requirements:\n\nYou are a U.S. consumer who signed up for Prime, and\n\nYou unintentionally enrolled in a Prime membership through a challenged enrollment method at issue in the FTC’s lawsuit from June 23, 2019 to June 23, 2025; or you tried to cancel your Prime membership through the online cancellation process from June 23, 2019 to June 23, 2025, but were unable to do so; and\n\nYou used less than ten Prime benefits (e.g., delivery, shopping, streaming, reading, and other benefits provided to Prime members) during any 12-month period of enrollment in Prime, and\n\nYou did not receive an automatic payment as part of this Settlement already.\n\nNeither website is entirely clear about what constitutes \"challenged enrollment,\" aside from saying that Amazon enrolled customers in Prime without their knowledge or consent. Luckily, you probably won't need to do any legwork to see if you're eligible.\n\nAccording to the FTC, Amazon has begun sending claim notices by mail or email to eligible Prime customers who didn't already get an automatic refund. This will be your cue to If you believe you're eligible for a share of the settlement but Amazon did not contact you, you can reach out to [email protected] for help.\n\nOnce you file your claim, you can choose to be paid either through check, PayPal, or Venmo. Expected payments will differ from person to person, but will cap out at $51. And there's no need to rush. The deadline to file a claim is July 27, 2026, so you've got some time to ensure you get what you're owed.",

    "description": "We’re simplifying and improving the LocalStack for AWS experience by unifying Community and Pro into one image, offering a free account-based experience for individuals and open source users, and introducing a new CLI (CLI v2) to power the next generation of local cloud development.",
    "fullText": "We’re simplifying and improving the LocalStack for AWS experience by unifying Community and Pro into one image, offering a free account-based experience for individuals and open source users, and introducing a new CLI (CLI v2) to power the next generation of local cloud development.\n\nWaldemar Hummer and Gerta Sheganaku\n\nAt LocalStack, we’re very fortunate to fundamentally shape how local cloud development is done. By providing high-fidelity cloud service emulators, we enable developers to run a digital twin of their cloud environment locally–a true local cloud sandbox. What began as a seemingly crazy idea among a handful of individuals and community members (“why would you build a cloud on your laptop?”) has since evolved into a major driver of cloud development productivity for enterprises and teams around the globe.\n\nOver time, LocalStack for AWS has also evolved well beyond a local AWS emulator running in a container. We’ve invested heavily in expanding our cloud offering and Web Console, introducing powerful new capabilities such as a visual resource browser, collaboration features, chaos engineering workflows, IAM policy debugging, and much more.\n\nAs LocalStack’s sophistication has increased–and as our active user base has grown rapidly –we’ve encountered a growing divide between two distinct groups: (1) users who \n\nGoing forward, we will focus our efforts primarily on the former group. By working more closely with engaged users, we believe we can have a deeper impact–delivering advanced capabilities that meaningfully transform developer workflows and significantly improve productivity for cloud development teams.\n\nLocalStack started as a scrappy open-source experiment, and the community made it what it is today. Over time, however, the scope, security requirements, and operational complexity of maintaining high-fidelity AWS emulation have grown significantly.\n\nTo continue delivering accurate, secure, and production-grade cloud emulation - while still offering a free entry point - we need a distribution model that lets us engage directly with users, understand how LocalStack is used, and sustainably invest in the platform.\n\nFor the last several years, we’ve maintained two separate versions of LocalStack for AWS: our Community edition, which is open-source and freely available to the community; and our Pro edition, which is only accessible with a paid license.\n\nBeginning in March 2026, LocalStack for AWS will be delivered as a single, unified version. Users will need to create an account to run LocalStack for AWS, which allows us to provide a secure, up-to-date, and feature-rich experience for everyone—from those on our free and student plans to those at enterprise accounts.\n\nAs a result of this shift, we cannot commit to releasing regular updates to the Community edition of LocalStack for AWS. Regular product enhancements and security patches will only be applied to the new version of LocalStack for AWS available via our website.\n\nMeanwhile, the source code for prior versions of the LocalStack for AWS Community edition will remain openly available on GitHub. While the LocalStack team will scale back active maintenance, the repository will continue to serve as a reference point for the community. Ongoing feature development and regular updates will no longer be part of our focus for this repository, which will be clearly marked as inactive, with its current status reflected in the README.\n\nFor those using the Community edition of LocalStack for AWS today (i.e., the localstack/localstack Docker image), any project that automatically pulls the latest image of LocalStack for AWS from Docker Hub will need to be updated before the change goes live in March 2026.\n\nThose who would like to take advantage of the latest LocalStack for AWS features once this change is implemented will have several options to choose from:\n\nLocalStack is committed to supporting our community, from individual innovators to large enterprise software organizations. Our free plan will continue to provide a dynamic environment for experimental development and exploration. Our Student plan, available to those who participate in GitHub’s Student Developer Pack, will not be affected by this change. And our enterprise solutions are optimized for environments that demand high availability, scalable automation, governance, and stability.\n\nHobbyists looking to continue leveraging the Community edition of LocalStack for AWS are advised to pin to a fixed version of the Community image (e.g., version 4.12) in any automation, rather than using the latest image tag.\n\nWhile pinning to a previous version of the Community edition of LocalStack for AWS will prevent any disruption to your automation, please note that previous versions will not receive backport support.\n\nWe spend a lot of time and effort creating an experience that makes cloud development easier and faster for our users. These changes ensure that all LocalStack for AWS users can benefit from this work.\n\nIn the coming months, we will share documentation and resources to help our community prepare for this change. Stay tuned \n\nLocalStack would not exist without our community - from the early skeptics to power users who pushed us to be better and helped us get to where we are today. These changes are about ensuring that LocalStack can continue to exist, evolve, and serve developers for the long term.\n\nWe’re committed to making this transition transparent, gradual, and respectful - and we welcome your feedback as we move forward. Below are answers to some frequently asked questions relating to this change.\n\nOur current distribution for our AWS emulator, which was packaged both as a free Community image (localstack/localstack) and a commercial Pro image (localstack/localstack-pro) on Docker Hub, will be consolidated into a single image beginning in March 2026. Going forward, LocalStack for AWS will be available via a single image distribution on Docker Hub at localstack/localstack.\n\nThe new unified distribution will require authentication via an auth token for use. This means that, once the change is published in March, pulling and running localstack/localstack:latest will prompt you for an auth token if you have not already provided one.\n\nFor Existing Customers on a Paid Tier\n\nNothing will change. We will continue to publish updates to localstack/localstack-pro. Ensure that you have your auth token set on LocalStack on your machine. For details on how to find and set your auth token, check our auth token documentation. If you are using LocalStack in CI, please also ensure that you have set a CI auth token in your CI environment.\n\nFor Existing Users on a Free Tier\n\nYour existing configuration will still work using localstack/localstack-pro provided you have set your auth token. For details on how to find and set your auth token, check our auth token documentation. Our free plan does not include CI credits. If you wish to use LocalStack within a CI environment, we encourage you to explore our pricing tier options to see what best suits your requirements.\n\nFor Existing Users of the Community Image\n\nTo prevent any disruption after the consolidated image is launched, you can use one of the following options:\n\nThis change is currently planned to go live in March 2026. The exact date will be shared as we approach the transition. We will communicate this change via all available channels, including in-product, email, blog, social and our Slack community.\n\nNothing needs to be done today.\n\nWe are issuing this announcement now to provide details proactively so our users have time to prepare. For details on how this might impact you once the change is implemented and options for addressing that, please see the details listed under “What is changing?”\n\nThe community image will no longer be available on Docker Hub when using localstack/localstack:latest once the image consolidation is complete. Past releases of the community image will still be available, and you can choose to pin your setup to a prior version tag. It’s important to note that pinning to a prior version will opt you out of any future updates or security patches. The open source code for the community image will remain on GitHub, but the repository will be less actively maintained, as we cannot commit to making active ongoing contributions.\n\nThe localstack/localstack-pro image will remain available. We do not currently plan to change this in order to facilitate the transition for our customers. After the change goes into effect, localstack/localstack and localstack/localstack-pro will both have the same image.\n\nWe will continue to make a free tier available to all LocalStack users, and, for many use cases, transitioning to the free tier from the community image will offer equivalent capabilities, including emulation of the AWS services currently supported by the community image. However, our free plan does not include CI credits. If you wish to use LocalStack for AWS within a CI environment, we encourage you to explore our pricing tier options to see what best suits your requirements.\n\nNo. You can continue to use the pro image at localstack/localstack-pro. Your current configuration will continue to work, unchanged, provided you have already set your auth token and CI auth tokens as required. For details on how to find and set your auth token, check our auth token documentation. If you are using LocalStack in CI, please also ensure that you have set a CI auth token in your CI environment.\n\nOnce the image consolidation is completed in March 2026, using the most recent version of LocalStack for AWS via the localstack/localstack:latest image tag will require authentication. For CI environments, this requires that you set a CI auth token. CI runs using LocalStack consume CI credits across your workspace. The number of CI credits allotted to your workspace depends on your pricing tier. Free tier accounts do not include CI credits.\n\nIf you are a current open source user using LocalStack for AWS in a CI environment, you’ll need to either:\n\nPlease note that pinning to a prior version tag of LocalStack on Docker Hub will opt you out of any future updates or security patches.\n\nIf you are a current paid tier customer relying on the localstack/localstack-pro image on Docker Hub, no changes need to be made. Your CI deployments will run the same after the image consolidation provided that you have set a CI auth token in your CI environment.\n\nIf you are a current open source or free tier user, you can join our LocalStack Community Slack to ask questions. The LocalStack team is active there and can help address your questions.\n\nFor questions relating to the use of LocalStack for AWS for business purposes, please contact our team via this form.\n\nIf you are a current paid tier customer, you can email support@localstack.cloud or utilize the support chat option from the LocalStack dashboard to contact a support engineer.",

    "fullText": "Amazon is closing the supermarket chain that it spent nearly six years building from scratch.\n\nThe tech and retail giant said it plans to close its Amazon Fresh stores \"to prioritize investment in growth areas,\" in a company blog post on Tuesday. Amazon has around 60 Fresh stores in the US listed on its website.\n\nThe company is also shuttering about 15 Amazon Go convenience stores, it said.\n\n\"While we've seen encouraging signals in our Amazon-branded physical grocery stores, we haven't yet created a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion,\" Amazon said in the post.\n\nSome of the locations are set to become Whole Foods stores, Amazon said.\n\nThe closures are the latest pivot for Amazon's grocery business. Despite creating Amazon Fresh, buying Whole Foods, and building its grocery delivery muscle, Amazon's market share is still a fraction of several rivals.\n\nWalmart has emerged as a particular source of inspiration for Amazon's grocery business lately, Business Insider has reported. The company has plans to build a Walmart Supercenter-like megastore near Chicago, for example.\n\nAmazon has spent the better part of a decade trying to build a grocery store model using its own name that meets its expectations. It opened the first Amazon Go location to the public in 2018 and the first Amazon Fresh store in 2020.\n\nThe Fresh stores offered more mass-market groceries, such as some sodas and snacks, than Whole Foods stores did. Amazon also touted the stores for their use of technology, such as the company's Just Walk Out system.\n\nAmazon said Tuesday that Whole Foods and delivery will be the focus of its grocery business in 2026.\n\nThe company plans to open over 100 Whole Foods supermarkets \"over the next few years,\" it said in the blog post. Amazon is also opening five new Whole Foods Market Daily Shop stores in 2026, offering a pared-down selection of groceries in smaller stores.\n\nAmazon is also working on expanding its grocery delivery capabilities this year, it said. The company offers delivery in 5,000 cities and towns in the US, including many where customers can get same-day delivery on perishable goods like fresh produce and ice cream.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A laid-off Amazon employee used his severance package to launch his comedy career, while working part-time in retail. He says it was worth the risk.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ricci Armani, a 33-year-old comedian based in Seattle. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn late 2022, I remember randomly telling my boyfriend, \"There might be a time when I make less money because I'm going to choose comedy over corporate.\" The next day, I got laid off from my job at Amazon, and I had to be like, \"Well, that time might be sooner than we even talked about.\"\n\nIt was terrifying, but it felt like a huge sign that I was meant to take this path to become a comedian.\n\nI had to take on a part-time retail job to pay the bills, and there are still moments where self-doubt creeps in, but if I ever have to go back to corporate America, or if I don't achieve my dream of being a nationally selling stand-up comic, I can look back and know I gave it my all.\n\nThis journey has been worth the risk.\n\nI first got hired as a contractor at Amazon in 2020 and was then brought on for a full-time role. I later started going to open mics as just a fun thing I loved doing, and gained some popularity in the Seattle area, but it was just a side hustle.\n\nAmazon gave me the opportunity to search for another internal role, but I took the layoff package. I decided I was going to throw myself fully into comedy, using my severance package to propel my career.\n\nI was absolutely terrified, and I didn't know if it was a smart move, especially since everyone had been talking about how bad the job market was. I had been working in a nearly full-time capacity since I was 16, and here I was at 30, not knowing what was next for me.\n\nIt was scary, but it also felt like a burden lifted off my shoulders when I realized I didn't need to return to the corporate rat race. I felt very empowered that I was using this moment to choose my own path.\n\nAt the time of the layoff, I think I had 2,000 followers on Instagram and none on TikTok. For stand-up comics these days, followers are the path to making money, so if I'm being honest, I felt a bit foolish for thinking, \"I'm a full-time comic now.\"\n\nHowever, I felt like if I kept at it and worked hard, something good would come of it. I believed in this path so much, and I was ready to risk everything to make it happen.\n\nI created a posting regimen for social media content, started performing locally as much as possible, and spoke with established comedians to learn from their advice. I'm very lucky that I have some amazing mentors in the comedy world who taught me that it's going to be hard, but encouraged me that I get to be my own boss and experiment.\n\nI quickly found out that performing locally wasn't going to pay the bills, so I got a retail job to supplement my income. My advice would be for other people to get a part-time job that doesn't require them to take work home.\n\nAbout six months after I was laid off, I created my live show, \"My Straight Friends,\" where a straight comedian does standup and then I quiz them on gay culture.\n\nI did a test run at a local venue, and it was so bad. I barely sold any tickets, but there was something about it that just felt right. I kept running with it, and it's what has propelled me to tour across several states.\n\nI don't think I truly started experiencing self-doubt until last year, when I realized there's some scarcity to this career path. I'm at a level where it feels so much harder to break through to the next. My income can be inconsistent, and there have been times when I've lost money putting on a show.\n\nI'm at a point where I've been going back to my roots and seeking mentorship from people who are at the place I want to be. It's so easy to be delusional in the beginning, but there are moments of creeping doubt.\n\nI'm still working on my stand-up show and working my hardest to get into some new national and international comedy festivals this year.\n\nTalk to people and seek mentorship from those who are doing what you want to do. One of the most valuable things I did after my layoff was learn from other people, rather than just fumbling in the dark, trying to figure it out myself.\n\nThe words of encouragement I would've wanted to hear at that time of my layoff are to trust myself and trust the process. I know it's so corny, but there's truth to it. Trust the process and look at what the data from the outside world is telling you. Is it showing you that this is working? If not, pivot and figure out how to make it work. Keep going and don't give up.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being laid off from Amazon? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nMicrosoft has revealed its new Maia 200 accelerator chip for artificial intelligence (AI) that is three times more powerful than hardware from rivals like Google and Amazon, company representatives say.\n\nThis newest chip will be used in AI inference rather than training, powering systems and agents used to make predictions, provide answers to queries and generate outputs based on new data that's fed to them.\n\nMaia 200 is already being deployed in Microsoft's U.S. central data center region, with the company set to use the chips to generate synthetic data and in reinforcement training to improve next-generation large language models (LLMs). The AI accelerator will also be used to power Microsoft Foundry and 365 Copilot AI, and be part of the infrastructure that the company can provide through its Azure cloud platform.\n\nThe new chip delivers performance of more than 10 petaflops (1015 floating point operations per second), Scott Guthrie, cloud and AI executive vice president at Microsoft, said in a blog post. This is a measure of performance in supercomputing, where the most powerful supercomputers in the world can reach more than 1,000 petaflops of power.\n\nThe new chip achieved this performance level in a data representation category known as \"4-bit precision (FP4)\" — a highly compressed model designed to accelerate AI performance. Maia 200 also delivers 5 PFLOPS of performance in 8-bit precision (FP8). The difference between the two is that FP4 is far more energy efficient but less accurate.\n\n\"In practical terms, one Maia 200 node can effortlessly run today’s largest models, with plenty of headroom for even bigger models in the future,\" Guthrie said in the blog post. \"This means Maia 200 delivers 3 times the FP4 performance of the third generation Amazon Trainium, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU.\"\n\nMaia 200 could potentially be used for specialist AI workloads, such as running larger LLMs in the future. So far, Microsoft's Maia chips have only been used in the Azure cloud infrastructure to run large-scale workloads for Microsoft’s own AI services, notably Copilot. However, Guthrie noted there would be \"wider customer availability in the future,\" signaling other organizations could tap into Maia 200 via the Azure cloud, or the chips could potentially one day be deployed in standalone data centers or server stacks.\n\nGuthrie said that Microsoft boasts 30% better performance per dollar over existing systems thanks to the use of the 3-nanometer process made by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the most important fabricator in the world, allowing for 100 billion transistors per chip. This essentially means that Maia 200 could be more cost-effective and efficient for the most demanding AI workloads than existing chips.\n\nMaia 200 has a few other features alongside better performance and efficiency. It includes a memory system, for instance, which can help keep an AI model’s weights and data local, meaning you would need less hardware to run a model. It's also designed to be quickly integrated into existing data centers.\n\nMaia 200 should enable AI models to run faster and more efficiently. This means Azure OpenAI users, such as scientists, developers and corporations, could see better throughput and speeds when developing AI applications and using the likes of GPT-4 in their operations.\n\n—'It won’t be so much a ghost town as a zombie apocalypse': How AI might forever change how we use the internet\n\n— GPT-4 has passed the Turing test, researchers claim\n\n—The more advanced AI models get, the better they are at deceiving us — they even know when they're being tested\n\nThis next-generation AI hardware is unlikely to disrupt everyday AI and chatbot use for most people in the short term, as Maia 200 is designed for data centers rather than consumer-grade hardware. However, end users could see the impact of Maia 200 in the form of faster response times and potentially more advanced features from Copilot and other AI tools built into Windows and Microsoft products.\n\nMaia 200 could also provide a performance boost to developers and scientists who use AI inference via Microsoft’s platforms. This, in turn, could lead to improvements in AI deployment on large-scale research projects and elements like advanced weather modeling, biological or chemical systems and compositions.",

    "description": "Microsoft announced its new Maia 200 AI chip, taking aim at Amazon, Google, and Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft (MSFT) is taking aim at cloud rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) with the debut of its next-generation custom AI chip.\n\nCalled Maia 200, the chip will run in Microsoft’s own data centers before the company eventually makes it available to its wider customer base.\n\nLike Google’s TPUs and Amazon’s Trainium processors, Microsoft’s second AI chip is meant to give the Windows maker more flexibility when it comes to how it powers its AI services. By using its own internally developed chips, the company ensures it doesn’t have to rely solely on processors developed by Nvidia (NVDA) or AMD (AMD).\n\nGoogle and Amazon have been using their own custom chips for years, while Microsoft has been slower to adopt in-house AI silicon.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the Maia 200 will be built using TSMC’s 3-nanometer process and is designed to run large-scale AI workloads, while “delivering efficient performance per dollar.”\n\nThe Maia 200 will be built into large server racks with trays housing four chips each. Microsoft is also touting how quickly it can deploy the new chips into data centers, saying chips are installed and running AI models within days of parts arriving.\n\nGetting AI servers up and running quickly is an important aspect of the broader data center business. It’s not just a matter of keeping construction costs down, either. The longer a chip goes unused, the less cash it can generate for the company by running AI apps.\n\nThe Maia 200 adds to the growing competition Nvidia is facing from both AMD and its own customers. Microsoft’s Maia 100 already powers both the company’s and OpenAI’s (OPAI.PVT) AI models, while Google and Amazon both power their respective models and Anthropic’s (ANTH.PVT) models.\n\nAnd in November, The Information reported that Meta was talking to Google about using the search giant’s TPUs in its own data centers to power its AI services. That sent Nvidia stock down at the time, as Wall Street raised fears that the company was in danger of losing market share.\n\nNvidia’s stock price is up less than 1% since the start of the year.\n\nDespite the incursions into Nvidia’s lane, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are unlikely to pose a serious threat to the AI leader. Experts say that while the cloud company’s AI chips may function well for their own services, that’s not likely to translate to smaller third-party customers as easily.\n\nNvidia’s chips are also highly coveted because they are designed to be multipurpose, allowing companies to use them for a litany of applications and services.\n\nAs for performance, the Maia 200 won’t unseat Nvidia, but Microsoft claims it outpaces both Google’s latest TPU and Amazon’s newest Trainium chip in a number of categories. The Maia 200 also packs more high-bandwidth memory than Google’s or Amazon’s offerings, which is key to running high-powered AI applications.",

    "description": "William Tunstall-Pedoe co-founded Evi, which became Amazon Alexa. Here's why he decided to leave the tech giant and launch a startup.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with William Tunstall-Pedoe, 56, a founder and CEO. Amazon's acquisition of his startup and his role at Unlikely AI have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI helped create Alexa, a product that everyone has heard of and most people have used. I'm proud of what we built.\n\nBut by 2016, it was clear that leaving Amazon, which I joined after the company acquired my startup, was the right decision. Continuing to work on Alexa would have been a very different job from building and launching startups, which I love to do.\n\nWhen I was 13, I would go to a college next to my school to use their mainframe, and since then I've been excited by computers and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with software.\n\nI studied computer science at the University of Cambridge and taught there after graduating in 1991, but I felt better suited to entrepreneurship than to academia. If you create something genuinely new in software, it can be on a billion smartphones in six months and truly change the world. That's impact.\n\nI set out to solve what I saw as a big problem. Internet search relied on users guessing keywords to get results, rather than asking natural questions like we learn to do as children. I imagined a world where you could have that same kind of conversation with computers, which led me to found True Knowledge in 2006.\n\nInitially, we tried to build a search engine that would compete with Google, which didn't work. Then, we enabled other companies to integrate our search engine into their own products — but the larger companies didn't. For a time, we focused on SEO.\n\nThe final pivot was building a voice assistant. We created an application called Evi, which launched in the UK in 2012, a year after Apple introduced Siri. We renamed the company from True Knowledge to Evi to match our product.\n\nAs a 30-person startup, we suddenly found ourselves competing with the world's most valuable company. We spent much of that year talking to major players in tech about being acquired. Later in 2012, Amazon bought our company.\n\nJoining Amazon was the right decision. The company invested heavily in the city of Cambridge, where Evi was based, and turned our startup into a major Amazon office. Our voice assistant became one of the company's biggest and most exciting secrets.\n\nMoving from running a small startup to working inside a business with hundreds of thousands of employees, with Jeff Bezos at the top, was a big change, but I loved working there. I split my time between Amazon's offices in Seattle and Cambridge, and enjoyed going back and forth, making things happen.\n\nWhen we launched Alexa, we were taken aback by the response. It was instantly successful. Today, Alexa is a household name. I'm immensely proud of the Evi team.\n\nAmazon is known for using six-page memos instead of PowerPoint presentations to promote clarity of thought. In 2016, I wrote one to help me decide if I should leave Amazon. In the memo, I laid out these facts: I'd delivered everything I could, the acquisition had been an unambiguous success, and so too had the product. At the time, thousands of people were working on Alexa.\n\nAfter about three and a half years at Amazon, in 2016, it was time to go. I wanted to re-enter the startup world.\n\nIt's certainly possible to launch something new within a big organization, and there are real advantages to doing so. When we launched Alexa, it immediately appeared on the front page of Amazon.com, a level of exposure that most startups could only dream of. I expect I'll work at a big company again at some point in my career.\n\nBut if you're trying to do something novel or contrarian, a startup is often better suited. Within a large company, all it takes is one manager deciding that resources are better spent elsewhere for a project to die. At a startup, it's the opposite. Even if 99 venture capitalists say no, you only need one investor to say yes to keep the project alive.\n\nAfter Amazon, I spent time mentoring at startup incubators such as Creative Destruction Lab. Through that, I became an active angel investor, which gave me a broad perspective of the many ways startups succeed and fail.\n\nIn 2019, I launched Unlikely AI, a deeptech startup focused on building neurosymbolic AI. The goal is to combine the powerful but sometimes incorrect machine-learning models with the world of algorithms, where computers are almost always right. The mission of the business is about making AI trustworthy and reliable.\n\nAs CEO, I'm constantly swamped. Running a startup can be stressful, but working on something truly big and ambitious is incredibly exciting.\n\nI sometimes feel nostalgic about working inside a big organization, but I love being in the startup world. For me, leaving Amazon was the right decision. I don't regret it.",

    "description": "Amazon employees respond to expected layoffs and corporate job cuts by posting memes referencing  founder Jeff Bezos' two-pizza rule.",
    "fullText": "Amazon employees are doing what Big Tech workers often do when they're anxious about layoffs: making memes.\n\nThe company is expected to cut thousands more corporate roles as soon as next week, Business Insider reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. This coming round would mark another wave of mass layoffs at Amazon in just a few months, following the roughly 14,000 jobs eliminated in October.\n\nIn the absence of official companywide communication, workers have been trying to ease tension in an internal Slack channel with more than 26,000 employees who joined by posting memes and jokes, which Business Insider viewed.\n\nThe focus of their snark? Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos' famous \"two-pizza rule,\" originally designed to keep meetings lean and productive. The rule was simple: never have a meeting so large that two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group.\n\nAs the company continues to thin its ranks, employees are using the same logic to point out just how much leaner their teams are about to become.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOne meme showed a single, thin sliver of pizza with the caption \"how we feed two pizza teams.\"\n\nAnother image featured two Amazon Web Services-branded pizza boxes, with the caption \"did someone say 2 pizza team?\" The meme is a nod to the company's cloud division, where many of the cuts are expected to land.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever been on a team that could be completely fed with just two reasonably sized pizzas until you were still hungry very frugal,\" one employee wrote in the Slack channel. \"Increasing 'span-of-control' for managers seems to be the new rage.\"\n\nOthers wondered if two Costco pizzas would be considered \"reasonably sized.\"\n\n\"I was thinking more like Domino's Large pizzas,\" another employee wrote.\n\nThe pizza jokes weren't the only coping mechanism. Employees also shared non-pizza memes.\n\nOne riffed on the rumored timing, splashing \"JANUARY 27TH\" over the scene from \"The Shining\" showing Jack Nicholson's character smashing through a door with an ax and \"AWS\" over his face.\n\nAnother meme used the \"panik/kalm\" template to mock corporate buzzwords. It shows an error message about email not working, presumably because the employee was laid off, with the words \"Mail not working (have I become Nimble?!)\", referring to CEO Andy Jassy's 2025 remarks about cutting jobs to stay nimble.\n\nOther posts leaned into the dread of the unknown: one meme laid out a checklist for employees for January 27: \"able to login,\" \"mail and Slack works,\" and \"no random HR meeting in calendar.\"\n\nAnother simply captured the vibe in all caps: \"I don't know what will happen on 27 Jan and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.\"\n\nAmazon isn't the first tech giant to see a nervous workforce poke fun at its internal culture. In 2023, Google employees flooded the company's internal message boards with memes mocking its lavish developer conference, which came months after it laid off 12,000 employees.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "For only so long can economic reality be denied in uncertain times until it becomes too obvious to continue postponing, especially when the consequences affect millions of consumers. If it feels like something fundamental has shifted at Amazon, that's because it has.\n\nFor more than three decades, Amazon has been a dependable source of fast delivery and affordable prices. But recently, a key aspect of its business has come under pressure from forces beyond its control.\n\nIn July 2025, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy downplayed concerns about tariffs during an earnings call, calling media reports about their impact on retail prices and consumption \"wrong and misreported,\" stating that it was too early to draw conclusions.\n\n\"We haven't yet seen diminishing demand, nor price is meaningfully appreciating,\" said Jassy. \"We also have such diversity of sellers in our marketplace, over 2 million sellers in total, with different strategies of whether to pass on higher cost to consumers, the customers are advantaged shopping at Amazon because they're more likely to find lower prices on the items they care about.\"\n\nHowever, six months later, Jassy's tone has shifted. Now, he is warning consumers of an unfortunate reality.\n\nIn a recent interview with CNBC, Jassy acknowledged that while consumers remain resilient and continue spending, their behavior has changed. Shoppers are actively seeking bargains, leading to slower sales of higher-priced discretionary items.\n\nAt the same time, consumers are buying more everyday essentials thanks to Amazon's continued investments in faster delivery. However, these products are necessary goods that people will keep buying even if prices rise.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of tariffs, Amazon did extensive pre-buying in early 2025, allowing it to hold prices steady longer than many competitors. With its global network of warehouses and distribution centers, the company was able to import and store goods in bulk ahead of anticipated cost increases.\n\nBut that extra supply ran out in the fall.\n\nWhile some of its third-party sellers have chosen to absorb the higher costs to maintain market share, others are passing them on to consumers, resulting in some price hikes.\n\n\"So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items,\" he said. \"Some sellers are deciding that they’re passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they'll absorb it to drive demand and some are doing something in between.\"\n\nJassy blamed U.S. tariffs as a primary driver of the price increases, as these have raised the cost of imported goods.",

The Polymarket account on X frequently posts aggregated news from around the world, often without citing an original source.\n\nPolymarket did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBezos did recently speak about about the importance of real-world experience in general.\n\nIn an appearance at Italian Tech Week in November, Bezos advised young entrepreneurs to work at a company before starting their own, rather than dropping out of college like other famous founders.\n\n\"It is possible to, you know, be 18, 19, 20 years old, drop out of college, and be a great entrepreneur,\" Bezos said. \"We have famous examples of that working: Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, etcetera. But these people are the exception.\"\n\n\"I always advise to young people, you know, go work at a best practices company somewhere, where you can learn a lot of basic fundamental things,\" Bezos continued. \"There's still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it. It increases your odds, in my opinion.\"\n\nBezos also worked his first job at McDonald's while in high school, and he spoke favorably about the experience in comments that appeared in the 2012 book \"Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers That Began at McDonald's.\"\n\n\"You can learn responsibility in any job, if you take it seriously,\" Bezos said. \"You learn a lot as a teenager working at McDonald's. It's different from what you learn in school. Don't underestimate the value of that!\"\n\nElon Musk even weighed in, replying to Bezos with a reference toward President Donald Trump's famous appearance at a McDonald's during the 2024 presidential campaign, where he worked the fryer and appeared at the drive-thru window.\n\n\"Well, the President worked at McDonald's and now he's the President,\" Musk wrote.",

    "fullText": "Tariff price hikes are starting to show up in your Amazon shopping cart.\n\nThe CEO of Amazon, Andy Jassy, told CNBC in an interview with reporter Becky Quick at the World Economic Forum in Davos that vendors are running out of stockpiled goods imported ahead of Trump's tariffs, and that consumers will be \"starting to see more of that impact.\"\n\n\"So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items,\" said Jassy, \"And you see some sellers are deciding that they're passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they'll absorb it to drive demand, and some are doing something in between.\"\n\nJassy also said that though the company is striving to \"keep prices as low as possible,\" price hikes may sometimes be inevitable.\n\n\"At a certain point, because retail is, as you know, a mid-single digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it,\" Jassy added. \"You don't have endless options.\"\n\nWhile Amazon's shopping business has its own products, it mainly serves as an ecommerce platform for other independent sellers, so it cannot control price hikes. Earlier in Trump's tariff push, a rumour that Amazon would start displaying exactly how much tariffs contributed to the cost of an item drew the president's ire. Amazon said it never made such plans.\n\nIn June 2025, Jassy told CNBC in an interview that many of Amazon's third-party selling partners \"forward deployed a lot of inventory\" to avoid \"issues with the uncertainty around where tariffs are going to settle,\" adding that at that point, he did not see \"prices appreciably go up.\"\n\nThe bulk of Trump's tariffs have been enacted under presidential emergency powers, including the 10% baseline levy on almost all imports. His right to impose such duties is being reviewed by the US Supreme Court after multiple small businesses filed lawsuits.\n\nIf SCOTUS rules these tariffs unconstitutional, Scott Bessent, the Secretary of the Treasury, said in a court document that the government could be on the hook to refund $1 trillion to businesses that paid. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank, 96% of the new revenue collected by the US Customs is being paid by American consumers, while foreign exporters only shouldered 4% of the burden.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "Internal documents show Amazon is reshaping its retail infrastructure to compete head-on with Walmart's Supercenter model.",
    "fullText": "For years, Amazon was cast as Walmart's great disruptor. Now, it's borrowing from the retail giant it once sought to upend.\n\nThe company is rolling out Walmart-inspired ideas, including \"Supercenter\" warehouses, a new distribution layer known internally as the \"1DC\" network, and microfulfillment centers within Whole Foods stores, according to internal documents obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe shift reflects a hard lesson: mastery of e-commerce does not translate into dominance in groceries, particularly perishable items that drive frequent shopping. Walmart's dense network of stores and distribution centers, designed to move everyday goods quickly and cheaply, has proved difficult to replicate.\n\nNearly a decade after paying $13.7 billion for Whole Foods, Amazon still trails Walmart in everyday grocery shopping, and is now reshaping its retail infrastructure to compete head-on with Walmart's Supercenter model.\n\nEarlier this month, plans emerged for a roughly 225,000-square-foot Amazon megastore near Chicago. Bigger than a typical Walmart Supercenter, the new concept is designed to let customers buy \"fresh groceries, household essentials, and general merchandise — all in one trip,\" according to Amazon.\n\nMichael Levin and Josh Lowitz, cofounders of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, called the move \"mind-blowing\" and said \"it reveals a degree of Walmart jealousy that we didn't expect.\"\n\nThere's a lot to be jealous about. With roughly 90% of the US population estimated to live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, the company's 5,000-plus locations give it a powerful edge in selling fresh food and other perishables, along with many other everyday staples.\n\nAccording to research firm Numerator, Walmart accounted for about 21% of the US grocery market, both online and in-store, as of September. Amazon and Whole Foods, meanwhile, each held roughly 1.6% of the market.\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart is leveraging its Supercenters to deliver online orders faster, challenging Amazon at its own game.\n\nThat's fueled a surge in Walmart shares, valuing the company close to $1 trillion. The stock is up almost 150% over 5 years, far outpacing Amazon's roughly 53% gain (although Amazon is still worth more).\n\nAmazon does well with non-perishable goods and everyday essentials such as toothpaste and paper towels. Overall, it offers millions of products for same-day delivery.\n\nBut when it comes to more delicate food items, such as pears, meat, and cheese, the company knows it has more work to do.\n\nA company spokesperson said Amazon serves more than 150 million US grocery customers, offers nearly 3 million grocery and household items, and provides same-day delivery in more than 9,000 cities and towns.\n\nGrocery is an \"ever-growing\" part of its fast-delivery business, the spokesperson added, while noting that in 2025, Amazon added perishable groceries to its Same-Day Delivery service, now available in 2,300 locations, allowing customers to shop without trade-offs between speed, selection, and savings.\n\nOne element of this fresh Amazon effort is a new type of same-day delivery warehouse internally called an \"SSD Supercenter.\" SSD refers to sub-same-day deliveries, typically within four hours. Unlike traditional SSD warehouses that tend to be smaller, these facilities are designed to be larger to close the selection gap, specifically with \"Walmart\" in groceries, the document said.\n\nInternal planning documents show Amazon intended to launch at least five such sites last year. Amazon wanted to test whether customers would \"step-change their shopping habituation and engagement\" once the Supercenter warehouses went live, one of the documents stated. Amazon planned to add products not currently sold on its site to the new warehouse and take a more hands-on approach to inventory sourcing, with in-stock targets above 95%, according to the document.\n\nSub-same-day grocery delivery is still a tiny part of Amazon's business. At the end of September, it had 30 million eligible customers for this service, according to one of the internal documents obtained by Business Insider. Only 1.6 million of them, or roughly 5%, shopped through the service.\n\nAmazon's Supercenter warehouses are part of a broader push to expand same-day grocery delivery. Internal forecasts called for at least 34 US same-day grocery sites in 2025. Amazon already operates over 80 same-day facilities nationwide, though not all handle groceries, according to Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consultancy MWPVL.\n\nAmazon is also planning to take the model overseas. Under an initiative known as Project Taylor, the company plans to expand sub-same-day grocery delivery across Europe. It also plans to pilot sub-two-hour \"ultrafast\" deliveries in London in 2026, one of the documents showed.\n\nLess visible, but just as important, is a new upstream distribution layer called \"1DC.\"\n\nThese facilities store the most frequently purchased products and replenish fulfillment centers as demand emerges. That can shift weeks' worth of inventory out of space-constrained fulfillment centers and into distribution sites optimized for palletized storage and rapid transfer.\n\nOne internal document described the change as a move from a \"push\" system, in which inventory is positioned based on forecasts, to a \"pull\" system that allows fulfillment centers to draw inventory from distribution centers as needed.\n\nAmazon began rolling out the 1DC concept last year through new buildings and retrofits. By the end of 2025, the company planned to operate a dozen of these centers, capable of moving at least 20 million units a week, according to one of the documents. As of October 2025, the facilities only handled non-perishables, including shelf-stable food items, but not frozen or chilled products, the document stated.\n\nThe 1DC idea emerged after Amazon introduced one-day delivery in 2018, one of the documents stated. Longer delivery windows once allowed the company to rely on a single layer of warehouses that could ship inventory from any fulfillment center to any customer. But faster delivery promises made that model \"untenable,\" forcing Amazon toward a structure long used by traditional retailers, the document added.\n\nMWPVL's Wulfraat said Walmart pioneered the distribution-center model that stores inventory for replenishing retail locations, while Amazon built its business around fulfillment centers that ship directly to consumers. Amazon also operates a cross-dock network to resupply its fulfillment centers, he said, and the 1DC sites represent a newer, more targeted layer of that system focused on high-velocity items.\n\nAmazon's spokesperson told Business Insider that 1DC is part of a broader initiative the company previously announced to regionalize its delivery operations and reduce shipping costs.\n\nPerhaps the clearest signal of Amazon's shift is its rethinking of Whole Foods. Once positioned mainly as a premium grocer, the chain is increasingly treated as logistics infrastructure.\n\nAmazon has begun installing micro-fulfillment centers in the back of select stores, effectively turning them into local hubs for online orders.\n\nOne upgraded Whole Foods site in suburban Philadelphia, announced last year, now fulfills Amazon orders from the back of the store. The model lets shoppers buy Whole Foods-specific items while also ordering products available only on Amazon, reducing the need to shop at other retailers.\n\nAmazon expects this store to serve roughly 100,000 e-commerce units a week by consolidating deliveries from nearby stores, and forecasts online order adoption to grow to 10% by the end of 2026, according to one of the documents.\n\nThis approach also mirrors Walmart's strategy of using its stores to fulfill online orders. Walmart said last year that it can offer same-day delivery to 93% of US households through its store-fulfilled network, with about 35% of those orders arriving within three hours.\n\nThe success of Amazon's new approach depends on one of the hardest problems in logistics: perishables.\n\nInternal plans show Amazon aiming to expand its perishables distribution capacity from 2.6 billion units in 2025 to 3.3 billion units by the end of 2026. The increase would come from new distribution centers and tighter operational standards across the existing network.\n\nThe push is central to Amazon's same-day delivery strategy and its broader grocery ambitions. Company documents stress that delivering high-quality perishables quickly and reliably is essential to scaling the business.\n\nThe goal is expansive. One document calls for making perishables available to \"100% of Prime customers\" as quickly as possible.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Two successfull hedge fund managers sold Amazon and bought a spot Bitcoin ETF in the third quarter.",
    "fullText": "In the third quarter, hedge fund billionaires Philippe Laffont and Steven Schonfeld sold Amazon stock and added to their positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nWall Street expects Amazon’s earnings to grow at 19% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings look fair.\n\nMore companies and institutional investors are buying Bitcoin (or spot Bitcoin ETFs), and that is likely to continue because it is the more popular and most liquid cryptocurrency.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nIn the third quarter, two hedge fund billionaires sold Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and added to positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) managed by BlackRock that tracks the spot price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 1.4 million shares of Amazon, trimming the position 14%. He also purchased 76,100 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, more than doubling his stake.\n\nSteven Schonfeld of Schonfeld Strategic Advisors sold 253,700 shares of Amazon, reducing the position 72%. He also added 1.1 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, increasing his stake 20%.\n\nThe trades are noteworthy because Laffont and Schonfeld outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 94 percentage points and 22 percentage points, respectively, in the last three years. That makes both hedge fund managers good sources of inspiration.\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts expect Bitcoin to be far more valuable in the future. Tom Lee at Fundstrat Global Advisors says its price could hit $3 trillion in the long run, which implies more than 3,000% upside from where it currently trades at $95,000. Michael Saylor of Strategy says its price could hit $13 million by 2045, implying more than 13,500% upside.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Building on that advantage, the company has integrated artificial intelligence (AI) products and features across all three business segments to drive revenue growth and improve profit margins.\n\nIn e-commerce, Amazon has developed hundreds of generative AI applications to improve operational efficiency. They automate customer service, optimize demand forecasting, improve inventory placement, and expedite last-mile delivery. Amazon has also developed an AI model called DeepFleet that helps robots navigate warehouses more quickly.\n\nIn cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has launched new foundational models and services, such as Bedrock for generative AI application development. AWS has also introduced AI agents for coding, security, and incident monitoring, and a business intelligence platform called Quick Suite, which leans on generative AI to analyze data, surface insights, and automate workflows.",

    "description": "Tech News News: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, recently cut down her stake at the company by nearly 50% to donate to charities. A report claims .",
    "fullText": "MacKenzie Scott's ex-wife, Jeff Bezos, has donated millions to the Solidaire Network, which funds groups facing FBI and congressional investigations for alleged Hamas ties. While Scott's donations are unrestricted, the network supports organizations like Students for Justice in Palestine. Scott has given billions to various causes, impacting diversity programs and higher education. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, recently cut down her stake at the company by nearly 50% to donate to charities. A report claims that the billionaire philanthropist donated millions of dollars to a funding network that supports organisations now facing FBI and congressional investigations over alleged ties to Hamas. In 2025, Scott reportedly donated $5 million, and in 2021, $10 million, to the Solidaire Network through her charity, Yield Giving. The network describes itself as connecting social movements with donors to build systems based on love and justice.However, Solidaire Network has funded groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), according to tax records and press releases reviewed by Fortune. Both organisations are under investigation by the House and Senate for allegedly working with the terror group Hamas to organise anti-Israel protests in the United States.The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability sent a letter to AMP's executive director in May 2024 expressing concern that groups spreading pro-Hamas messages and breaking laws on college campuses may be receiving money from sources supporting Hamas or other terrorist organisations.US Senator Tom Cotton also asked the FBI in September 2025 to investigate the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), calling it hateful toward Jewish people after its leader, Aisha Nizar, urged supporters to disrupt the US F-35 fighter jet supply chain, the report noted.In a statement (shared by Fortune), Cotton said, “Nizar’s statements constitute direct incitement of violence against U.S. national security interests by advocating for actions against the men and women who build the F-35 and seeking to imperil the delivery of one of the nation’s most strategic assets.”Scott donated more than $7 billion in 2025 alone, bringing her total giving since 2020 to $26 billion across over 2,700 donations. With a net worth of about $40 billion, mostly from her divorce settlement, she ranks among the world's biggest donors alongside Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett. Most of her 2025 donations supported diversity programmes, disaster relief, and colleges.What the Solidaire Network said about MacKenzie Scott’s donationsIt's important to note that the Solidaire Network also funds other progressive groups working on racial and gender equality, climate change, and economic fairness. Scott was also just one of more than 280 people who donated to Solidaire Network in 2021.\"Funding social movements while transforming our own relationship to wealth is clearly the way to go for philanthropy. MacKenzie's generous, no-strings-attached gift honours our bold ambitions for our collective work,” the Solidaire Network noted.Around that time, Solidaire Network had just given out multimillion-dollar grants through its Black Liberation Pooled Fund, Movement Protection Fund, and Movement Infrastructure Fund.As Scott's donations have no restrictions, which means the receiving organisation can spend the money however it chooses, there's no proof that her 2021 or 2025 gifts went directly to SJP or AMP.On January 30, 2024, Solidaire Network also announced it started a Unity & Power Fund to support the “movement for a permanent ceasefire and against Islamophobia and antisemitism.” SJP and AMP mainly focus on \"Palestinian freedom\" and firm opposition to Israel.“We need more philanthropic partners to show up during these flashpoints, and we also need their longer-term support to grow and sustain our work beyond this crisis moment. We are only able to do this work because of the multi-year funding we have received through committed partners like Solidaire Network,” Stacey Krueger of Palestine Legal said in a statement.While some people have criticised Scott's donation to Solidaire Network, she's widely recognised as one of the most impactful charitable donors in recent years. She's made a real difference for diversity-focused organisations and groups working on higher education, veterans' issues, social justice, disaster relief, and climate change. For example, Scott gave $80 million to Howard University last fall, and the school said the gift came at an “opportune time” as the US government shutdown delayed annual federal money the university receives to support students, academic programs, research, and hospital operations.Scott has also said her giving was inspired by her college roommate, who lent her $1,000 so she wouldn't have to quit school, and her dentist, who gave her free dental work after seeing her use denture glue to fix a broken tooth in college.In a blog post from December 2025, Scott wrote, “Generosity and kindness engage the same pleasure centres in the brain as sex, food, and receiving gifts, and they improve our health and long-term happiness as well. The peace-fostering byproducts of one unexpected act of kindness toward a stranger of a different background or beliefs might inspire a beneficial chain reaction that goes on for years.”Sotheby's International Realty said Scott has donated an estimated $14 billion to causes, including racial equality, LGBTQ+ equality, strengthening functional democracy, and climate action. She now ranks sixth on the list of the world's top 10 philanthropists, behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. The Sotheby's list adds that Scott's gifts support nonprofit groups working against racial injustice, advancing gender equality, and backing public health programs.",

    "description": "Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a senior software engineer, explains how AI integration and prompt engineering are changing hiring in Big Tech software roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a 29-year-old senior software engineer based in Seattle. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a Big Tech employee for the past eight years, working at Google, Amazon, Splunk, and now Salesforce. I've had a front-row seat to witness the changes in the tech landscape.\n\nI've learned which skill sets software engineers need to land a job offer in the AI era. Tech companies agree that AI makes engineers more productive, so engineers are expected to use it to build things more quickly and reliably.\n\nI personally make heavy use of AI to help me with boilerplate stuff so that I can concentrate on the hard stuff, like system design and complex business logic.\n\nWhen I was interviewing for software engineering jobs in 2020, LeetCode and system design were the de facto standards for cracking a job interview. Job seekers who had an advanced understanding of data structures and algorithms would come out on top.\n\nToday, this is just the baseline expectation. AI is now widely used for coding, review, and design, so tech companies, especially startups, expect more from candidates.\n\nSome skills remain the same: Software engineers still need a problem-solving mindset and should know how to scale systems and leverage cloud services. New hires must now also understand prompt engineering — how to leverage AI to code a solution more efficiently.\n\nYou need to be able to use AI for error handling and bug fixing. AI systems integration is another important new skill that involves incorporating AI into existing workflows, scaling AI systems, and determining when to use traditional versus AI solutions for business decisions.\n\nYou're still expected to have fundamental knowledge of core system design, data structures, and algorithms. You can still expect interviewers to test your problem-solving approaches, and if you know how to make the correct tradeoffs in time and space. Interviewers still care about debugging skills, since AI makes a lot of fundamental logic errors.\n\nYou also need to be prepared for some new things. I've seen firsthand that working with AI assistants in live screen-sharing mode is now allowed in some interviews. Interviewers are looking to see if you can help them achieve their business outcomes by combining software engineering skills with AI prompting.\n\nIn an interview I had with a Silicon Valley startup in 2024, I expected the hiring team to give traditional coding challenges. I was taken aback when I was given a huge code file and asked to debug a buggy behavior, and the interviewers explicitly said I could use AI assistance.\n\nI ignored the invitation to use AI, thinking I was supposed to do it myself, and ended up spending a lot of time on the problem to no avail. I failed that interview. That was an eye-opener for me about AI's new role in this field.\n\nYou may also be asked system design questions about where AI should be integrated into the current business workflow, or to discuss the trade-offs of using AI and traditional approaches in various problem contexts.\n\nDuring my own system design interviews, I noticed companies starting to ask questions about how to integrate AI to enhance existing systems and support a particular model lifecycle in terms of infrastructure. What I've seen is that companies give access to a small codebase and expect you to deliver a small feature in about one hour, which is impossible without AI. With AI, you can roll it out easily.\n\nI've also been asked behavioral questions, like \"How do you plan to evaluate the use of AI in order to make the workflow better?\" and \"How do you plan to balance automation and manual oversight?\"\n\nFor new graduates, here's how to show hiring teams that you're equipped for the emerging needs of the software engineering role.\n\nStart by contributing to open-source projects on AI or any other GitHub project. This demonstrates that you can navigate a production codebase and work on it independently to build a new feature or fix a bug. For solo repositories, include a README that explains the rationale for your decision.\n\nIncorporate the use of AI in traditional repositories to demonstrate hands-on experience with AI integration. Don't just deploy and run it locally — try to deploy it to the cloud. Many cloud providers provide free student credits.\n\nFocus on prompting AI to drive intended outcomes more effectively by providing structured input and output. Skills like AWS or GCP cloud certifications demonstrate your ability to be a keen learner.\n\nLearn different problem-solving patterns and practice these skills regularly. Muscle memory and pattern recognition go a long way.\n\nFor experienced software engineers, your biggest asset is your deep engineering experience — here are three tips that will help you in 2026 and beyond.\n\nPairing years of engineering expertise with impressive AI skills will get the attention of hiring managers. Consider boning up on these complementary skills:\n\nSenior software engineers don't just build; they also need to strategize and innovate. Try to understand the trade-offs of relying on a third-party API versus using an open-source one and fine-tuning it for your business purposes. Questions on cost, reliability, and maintainability should always be top of mind as you develop an AI product mindset.\n\nIdentify workflows that have a great deal of manual involvement in your current job, and use AI to see if you can improve them. You can leverage AI to help you brainstorm on how to make it more efficient.\n\nBoth veteran and newbie engineers should stay curious: find out the cool technologies and AI agents available in today's market, but don't abandon fundamental engineering approaches. The hybrid understanding of these technologies is what makes you valuable.\n\nIf I were interviewing, I'd position myself as a 'hybrid engineer.' Don't just be a pure coder or just a prompt engineer. Be the bridge.",

    "title": "You Need More AWS Accounts Than You Think",
    "description": "Your lead engineer thinks 10 AWS accounts is overkill. Here's why starting clean is weeks of work, while untangling later is 6-12 months of migration pain.",
    "fullText": "\"We don't need 10+ AWS accounts. It's overkill for us—we can do this later after we launch. This will slow down product development and add unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nI've heard this pushback dozens of times. And here's the thing: the instincts behind it aren't wrong.\n\nIt can feel like over-investing in infrastructure too early. It is more accounts than most people new to AWS start with. And if you've used multi-account setups before without good tooling, they absolutely can feel cumbersome and slow.\n\nOn top of that, understanding someone else's infrastructure code is always harder than code you wrote yourself, and you don't even know the final product architecture yet—shipping the product has to be the priority.\n\nThe counterproposal usually sounds reasonable:\n\n\"We just need dev, staging, and production accounts. Anything more is unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nHere's the thing: this is correct. To operate any product on AWS, you need a minimum of one account per SDLC stage—dev, staging, production. That's the baseline.\n\nThe misunderstanding comes when you look at this holistically: what does the organization need to operate securely? There's more than your software at stake.\n\nThe \"three accounts\" view only considers the application. It ignores everything else the organization needs to function—and that's where it breaks down the moment you start asking concrete questions.\n\nIf they're centralized—and they should be for security, compliance, and tamper resistance—they can't live in dev/staging/prod. Hence an audit account.\n\nWhere does your container registry live?\n\nIf you rebuild container images per account, you're triplicating images and not running what you tested. If you promote artifacts—which you should—a shared account is the logical solution. Hence an artifacts account.\n\nIn every account? That's 3× the cost and operational overhead. If centralized, how do they securely talk to services across accounts? Hence an automation account and a transit gateway. Don't think you need self-hosted runners? Make sure you have other ways to manage Kubernetes and RDS databases on private subnets.\n\nNone of these are future-state problems—they show up fast.\n\nWhen you put it all together—answering each of those concrete questions—you end up with:\n\nThat's 9–10 accounts for a minimal level of isolation.\n\nNot because someone decided \"9–10 is the right number.\" Because each account answers a specific question that you'll have to answer anyway. The accounts aren't arbitrary—they're the natural result of thinking through where things actually need to live.\n\nDoes this seem like a lot? Consider what happens without these boundaries:\n\nThe accounts aren't bureaucracy. They're guardrails that let you move faster, not slower.\n\nHere's the thing: you can add accounts later. That's not the myth.\n\nThe myth is believing it's easy or cheap to do later. It's not.\n\nAdding accounts later requires complex migrations, scheduling and coordination across teams, and untangling months or years of decisions built on faulty assumptions—like CIDR allocations that don't support peering or future growth.\n\nSome accounts are genuinely optional. If you're never going to have self-hosted runners, skip the automation account. If you're never using AWS as a DNS registrar, skip the DNS account. No big deal.\n\nBut some decisions are foundational—and brutal to change later:\n\nThe accounts themselves might sit empty for a while. But the architectural decisions you make on day one—CIDR allocation strategy, naming conventions, network topology—those get baked in immediately.\n\nHere's the real message: unless you operate today like you'll have multiple accounts, adding more accounts later won't make a difference.\n\nYou need to instill multi-account practices now in how you architect your applications and base your assumptions. It affects everything: network CIDR allocations, naming conventions, S3 bucket naming, Terraform state storage, DNS architecture, IAM trust relationships.\n\nCreate the boundaries now. Use them as the problems present themselves. If you wait until you need them, you're not just creating accounts—you're untangling everything you built assuming they didn't exist.\n\nThere's another reason account boundaries matter that's easy to underestimate:\n\nVPCs only give you network isolation. Accounts are the only hard IAM boundary AWS gives you.\n\nIf your goal is developer autonomy—letting engineers move fast without stepping on each other—fewer accounts actually makes that harder, not easier.\n\nYou end up either doing fragile IAM gymnastics, or giving everyone administrative access—which is very hard to walk back. Clean account boundaries let devs have broad access in some places and almost none in others—especially around production and security.\n\nAnd here's the uncomfortable truth: nothing is harder to craft than IAM policies.\n\nGetting IAM right in a single-account setup where you need to simulate multi-account boundaries is exponentially more complex than just having the boundaries in the first place.\n\nThis might look like over-engineering. It's not—it's choosing where to pay the cost.\n\nHere's the key: it's only complicated if you don't have the right tooling, conventions, and a framework that ties it together.\n\nWith the right tooling (like Atmos), managing 10 accounts isn't harder than managing 3. The complexity objection assumes you're doing this manually or piecing it together yourself. A proper framework handles the multi-account orchestration for you.\n\nSimple account setups optimize for getting started. Multi-account setups optimize for not having to unlearn assumptions later.\n\nYou're not adding complexity. You're preventing it.\n\nThe complexity of multi-team access, centralized logging, artifact promotion, and network segmentation is coming whether you plan for it or not. The only question is whether you have clean boundaries when it arrives, or whether you're retrofitting them into a single-account monolith.\n\nI genuinely understand the pushback. The instinct to ship fast and avoid premature complexity is exactly right in most contexts.\n\nBut AWS account boundaries aren't premature complexity—they're deferred simplicity. The complexity exists regardless. The only question is whether you've given it clean places to live.\n\nStarting clean is weeks. Untangling later is months.\n\nIf you're navigating this conversation internally and want help making the case—or just want to talk through the tradeoffs with someone who's been there—talk to an engineer. No sales theater. Just engineers who understand both the technical reality and the organizational dynamics at play.",

The most prized employees today are \"player-coaches,\" people who ship work themselves while also guiding projects, mentoring peers, and shaping strategy. AI makes that hybrid role even more potent, allowing a single strong contributor to amplify their output, and their influence, without managing a large team, Musa wrote this week.\n\nThe result is a revival of the individual contributor track. You no longer have to become a full-time people manager to earn top-tier pay. At companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, senior ICs can now match (or beat) the compensation of managers simply by delivering outsized results, he noted.\n\nFor ambitious employees, the takeaway is simple: in the AI era, execution compounds.

    "description": "Zoox's robotaxis do not have a steering wheel and are bi-directional. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee described the experience as like a theme park ride.",
    "fullText": "Of all the robotaxis I've tried, Amazon's Zoox feels different.\n\nZoox — founded in 2014 and acquired by Amazon four years later — is a robotaxi company that has limited operations in Las Vegas and San Francisco with about 50 vehicles between the two major cities. The company has said Austin and Miami are next on the map.\n\nThe service is considerably smaller than its competitor, Waymo, and that limitation was acutely felt in my experience hailing a Zoox on a Thursday night in Las Vegas during the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nHowever, the rider experience itself felt more akin to an amusement-park-ride-slash-party-bus than an average ride-hail service in an everyday car, which makes Zoox a true differentiator against the emerging players in the robotaxi race.\n\nThe company doesn't bulk order vehicles from automakers to retrofit them with sensors the same way Waymo or Uber does. Instead, Zoox designed a vehicle solely for robotaxi operations and builds the cars out of a factory in Hayward, California.\n\nThe robotaxi doesn't have a steering wheel or brake pedal — only seats inside the vehicle. The car is also bi-directional, meaning the Zoox's \"front\" goes both ways.\n\nThis helps the vehicle navigate tight spaces and avoid the need to execute U-turns or three-point turns.\n\nHowever, riders will mainly feel the difference once they step inside the Zoox.\n\nA chime plays as the robotaxi's doors slide open — almost like a grand entrance to the Zoox experience.\n\nThe interior reminded me of one of those immersive Disneyland rides or even a party-themed Gondola lift.\n\nInside, there are four seats — two on each side of the car, facing each other. I found that it encourages a social experience if you're bringing along multiple riders.\n\nThe headliner — or the roof — of the robotaxi has starlights which reminded me of the inside a Rolls-Royce or limousine. That touch felt especially appropriate for the Vegas scene, but it also seemed to add to the overall social experience Zoox is going for. It feels like a party inside the car.\n\nSurprisingly, the seats were comfortable. The photos and videos I've seen of the Zoox made me think the seats would feel like a bus or subway seat, but they have a plush touch to them.\n\nI don't see myself falling asleep inside the vehicle, simply because you're forced to sit upright and can't lie back in the seats, but they're comfortable enough for a 30- to 45-minute ride.\n\nAnother surprise: There's plenty of leg room that provides enough space between you and another rider in front of you. I went on a Zoox ride with a company spokesperson facing me, and space was not an issue.\n\nI tried a Zoox facing forward and backward inside the car.\n\nThere have been some reports of riders feeling nauseous when they face backward. I didn't experience that, but that could just be unique to me.\n\nThe Zoox app tells riders which way to face if they are prone to motion sickness.\n\nOutside the flashy headliner, there's little else inside the car. There are four wireless phone chargers, two small armrests, and four touchscreens by each of the seats, which allow riders to control the cabin temperature, change the music, and call for rider support.\n\nZoox is in a pilot stage of its operation in Las Vegas, working with fewer than 50 robotaxis inside the city. The service is free for now and limited to a handful of preset destinations.\n\nI hailed a Zoox from one of the stops, the Luxor Hotel, and was given a 25-minute wait time. The real wait-time was 37 minutes.\n\nThose two factors alone — limited destinations and long wait times — make Zoox less of a serious choice for day-to-day travel and more like a novelty experience to try once.\n\nThe rider experience also has room for improvement.\n\nFor all the effort Zoox put into creating a social in-car experience, the company has yet to provide riders with the option to connect to their Spotify or Apple Music. For now, passengers hear a curated music service from Stingray Music — similar to an iHeartRadio program.\n\nThe ride itself was mostly smooth. There was one moment that stuck out while the Zoox was going down the Strip.\n\nTraffic was heavy at night, and the Zoox attempted to make a lane change while it was stopped behind a line of cars waiting at a red light.\n\nThe robotaxi began to move into the right lane, possibly to navigate around the traffic and transition to a less-congested lane. As it began to enter the right lane, with the body of the car now at a diagonal, the Zoox suddenly stopped. The car hesitated, lurched a little bit forward, and paused again. About 10 seconds later, the car straightened out and remained in the current lane.\n\nZoox did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter a nearly 35-minute ride, I was dropped off at AREA15, a Vegas entertainment hub that was one of the closest stops to my hotel.\n\nA couple who had just taken a ride before me was trying to hail another Zoox to get back to their hotel at Excalibur.\n\nThe outside temperature was around 40 degrees.\n\nWe both resorted to calling an Uber.",

In court filings, Amazon said the financing would \"saddle\" Saks with \"billions of dollars of obligation for no material benefit\" and improperly use the value of Saks Global's flagship entities to prop up other debtors at the expense of their creditors, including Amazon.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal judge overseeing Saks' bankruptcy case granted the company approval at a court hearing on Wednesday to tap an initial round of its financing.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider on Thursday, and representatives for Saks declined to comment.",

    "description": "\"Who's going to watch an NFL game on the internet?\" More than 31 million people, it turns out.",
    "fullText": "On Saturday, the Chicago Bears beat the Green Bay Packers in an NFL playoff game that had everything: a bitter rivalry, an old-school outdoors atmosphere, and a historic comeback (or choke-job, depending on your POV).\n\nIt also happened to be a (mostly) streaming-only game. Did you notice? Or care?\n\nI didn't. Except for about 30 seconds, when I was trying to find out what network was showing the game, and it took me a beat to realize it was on Amazon's Prime Video. Then I booted up my app and watched the game without any issue. Just like any other NFL game.\n\nIn 2026, \"Guy doesn't have a problem watching the Bears/Packers\" is a true dog-bites-man story. But that's why I'm writing about it here: Not very long ago, the idea of streaming a super-high-profile NFL game — and requiring NFL fans to \n\nNow it's a yawner: I was one of 31.6 million people who watched the game, the vast majority of whom streamed it (fans in local markets could use broadcast TV). That's a streaming record for an NFL game, and it's more than some other games got last weekend on conventional TV.\n\nAnd that tells you just how far sports and streaming have come.\n\nFlash back to 2013, for instance, and the idea of whether the \"internet\" — a catch-all term that included everything needed to get streaming video onto your screen, from web servers to fiber-optic lines to the router in your house — could support a big NFL game watched by many millions of people was an open question. \"Why Web TV Skeptic Mark Cuban Thinks Google Can Make the NFL Work on the Web,\" was an ungainly headline I tapped out at the time.\n\nBack then, the NFL and other sports giants were routinely streaming big events like the Super Bowl and World Cup — but only as a sort of secondary outlet for weirdos who didn't have traditional TV. And anyone who did stream sports had to expect to run into problems, like ESPN did when it streamed a World Cup game in 2014.\n\nA year later, the NFL put on a streaming-only game for the first time — but made sure it was a relatively niche one, and made sure that people knew it was an experiment.\n\nCut to today, and streaming is just a way we watch some football games now. Amazon pays a gazillion dollars a year to show one game a week during the regular season; Netflix has paid up to show a couple games on Christmas Day. A new deal the NFL struck with Disney last year will give the league the opportunity to sell even more games to digital players.\n\nAnd two years ago, the league passed another new threshold by moving one of its most valuable assets — a playoff game — to Comcast's Peacock streamer, where it was only available to paid subscribers. That one generated a ton of complaints from people who said they didn't want to pay another service to watch an NFL game — along with millions of sign-ups for Peacock, which showed they would.\n\nThe NFL is not ditching TV for streaming anytime soon. For many people, watching NFL games is the main reason to watch TV, and that gives the league a ton of leverage to extract ever-increasing fees from the likes of NBC and CBS. So they will almost certainly keep the majority of their games on old-time TV for the foreseeable future. But they're going to sell them to streaming platforms too — because they'll pay up to get them, and you'll pay, too.",

    "fullText": "Several months after Amazon bought artificial intelligence hardware startup Bee, the company said it’s working to make its $50 always-listening wearable more proactive, and indicated a larger revamp is in store.\n\nBee’s device, which can be worn on the wrist or clipped to a shirt, records and transcribes its owner’s activities, using that information to recap conversations and automatically create to-do lists in a companion app throughout the day.\n\nIt doesn’t have a display or built-in camera, and is designed to be “ambient AI” hardware that fades into the background without the user needing to constantly interact with it. The small gadget’s battery can last as long as a week before needing a recharge, according to the company.\n\nEarly AI-powered devices such as the Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1 have landed with a thud, owing to issues such as bugs, poor battery life and the lack of any standout features that would make them preferable to smartphones.\n\nAmazon has a spotty history with wearables and has shown less dedication to the category compared with its tentpole Fire TV, Kindle and Echo hardware. The company discontinued its Halo health tracker wristband in 2023 and has not released a new pair of wireless earbuds in almost three years. The Halo device offered some features that have carried forward with Bee, like the ability to detect a speaker’s mood.\n\nBee is trying to chart a different path from those gadgets by acting as a comprehensive daily journal that requires no prompting or manual input. Startups like Plaud have released competing gadgets with a similar purpose.\n\nThe notion of Amazon taking ownership of an always-listening accessory has made some people wary, but the startup said it maintains stringent privacy practices.",

    "fullText": "Amazon is beefing up its physical retail game with a new big-box store concept that goes well beyond groceries.\n\nVillage officials in Orland Park, Illinois, voted on Tuesday to approve Amazon's plan to build a 228,000-square-foot mega store near Chicago. That's roughly the size of a newer, larger Walmart Supercenter.\n\nPlanning documents said the facility would offer both groceries and general merchandise, as well as other services and prepared food options. Customers would also be able to place and receive online orders on-site.\n\nKatie Jahnke Dale, an attorney for Amazon, told the planning commission that the plan is \"a more purpose-built and thoughtful\" approach to traditional big-box stores, according to the Orland Park Patch.\n\n\"This is a retail concept, a retail store, albeit with perhaps a larger storeroom in the back, which will allow us to enhance the customer experience,\" she said.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider the store was one way the company is experimenting with making customers' lives easier.\n\n\"The site in question is our planned location for a new concept that we think customers will be excited about,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nIf all this sounds familiar, it's probably because hypermarkets like this one have been a staple of American retail since 1988, when Walmart opened its first Supercenter outside St. Louis. Walmart now has about 4,600 US stores.\n\nOf course, Amazon is no stranger to physical retail — at least in comparatively smaller formats.\n\nThe company operates 58 Amazon Fresh grocery stores, 14 Go convenience locations, and more than 500 Whole Foods Markets.\n\nAmazon said that more than 150 million US shoppers get groceries from the company, generating over $100 billion in sales in 2024.\n\nWhere those stores primarily focus on food, the new plan calls for a much broader range of merchandise, such as housewares or apparel, that can complement grocery shoppers' carts.\n\nAs traditional retailers like Walmart and Target ramp up their e-commerce efforts, Amazon is taking a few pages from the brick-and-mortar playbook as well.\n\nThis expansion comes a month after Business Insider reported that Amazon has been developing a \"rush\" pickup service, which would allow shoppers to collect their orders at Amazon-owned stores within an hour.\n\nThe company is also testing a fulfillment-only store concept that it expects to bring 30-minute delivery to customers in Seattle and Philadelphia.",

    "description": "Amazon rolls out an updated dashboard for managers to track office attendance and hours, expanding strict RTO policies.",
    "fullText": "What kind of badger are you? Amazon managers are about to find out.\n\nAmazon is equipping its managers with powerful new metrics to monitor their reports with a dashboard that tracks not only whether employees show up to the office, but also how many hours they spend there, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe move marks an escalation in the surveillance of white-collar workers at the e-commerce and cloud computing giant. Last year, Amazon implemented one of the industry's most stringent RTO mandates, requiring most employees to work from an office for five days a week. Now, managers have a way to spot — and potentially confront — employees who fall short of these expectations.\n\nThe updated dashboard, which began rolling out in December, allows managers and HR to view how often employees come into an office, how long they stay, and the locations where they work. It refreshes at 5 p.m. PT daily and tracks these metrics over a rolling eight-week period.\n\nThe system flags three kinds of employees: \"Low-Time Badgers,\" defined as employees whose weekly median time in the office is less than four hours per day, averaged over a rolling eight-week period; \"Zero Badgers,\" who don't badge into any Amazon building during that span; and \"Unassigned Building Badgers,\" who badge into a building other than the one they're assigned to over half the time.\n\n\"These metrics are intended to surface employees operating significantly outside documented in-office expectations,\" the document says.\n\n\"For more than a year now, we've provided tools like this for managers to help identify who on their team may need support in working from the office each day,\" an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. \"We recently updated the dashboard to make it more consistent for all managers, but most of the data and functionality was previously available. We continue to see the benefits of having our teams working together, and we haven't changed our expectations for employees to be in the office.\"\n\nAmazon notes in the document that managers are expected to \"apply judgment\" when determining whether to initiate formal disciplinary follow-ups.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon began tracking and sharing individual office attendance records, reversing a previous policy that only tracked anonymized, aggregated attendance data.\n\nA year later, the company began cracking down on \"coffee badging\" by informing some teams that they needed to be in the office for a minimum of two to six hours to have their attendance count. The crackdown received criticism from some employees, including one who compared the move to being treated \"like high school students,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThe updated dashboard standardizes these metrics across Amazon's entire corporate workforce, excluding workers such as warehouse staff and contractors. It grants managers direct, on-demand access to data that they would have previously had to request from HR, according to an Amazon employee familiar with the company's policies.\n\nAmazon is positioning the dashboard as a means to encourage in-person collaboration.\n\n\"Working In-office is important to our culture and is also about more than just being physically present during the week,\" the document said. \"Managers are expected to promote meaningful team collaboration through direct interactions with their team rather than just remotely monitoring badge swipes each week.\"\n\nAmazon is hardly alone in using badge data to police return-to-office rules.\n\nSamsung rolled out a manager-facing tool that shows \"days and time in building\" metrics, aimed at discouraging \"lunch/coffee badging.\" Dell informed hybrid staff that it will track on-site presence via badge swipes and could factor attendance into performance and compensation.\n\nBank of America issued warning notices to employees, informing some that continued noncompliance with its RTO policy could result in further disciplinary action. At JPMorgan, employees have described an internal dashboard that calculates the share of eligible days spent in the office and is visible to senior managers.\n\nIn the UK, PwC has said it would track employees' work locations to enforce its RTO policy.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "I'm a senior software engineer at Microsoft. My AI skills have helped me climb the ladder in my career — here's my advice.",
    "description": "Nandita Giri is a senior software engineer with experience at Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. She recommends job seekers spend an hour a day learning AI.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nandita Giri, a 32-year-old software engineer at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy journey began with problem-solving and math long before I knew I'd end up in Big Tech.\n\nI studied at the National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, in India. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google often scout talent from this school.\n\nAmazon hired me straight out of college, and I moved to Seattle in 2018. To get the job, there was a logical analysis test, and only a handful of us passed. Then came multiple interviews based on problem-solving. That's how my journey in tech began.\n\nI'm now a senior software engineer at Microsoft, and my AI skills are in high demand.\n\nWhen applying for roles at Amazon, it's not about solving problems as quickly as possible, but solving them optimally. You must carefully consider the issue so that the solution can scale and be easily maintained. Amazon has a set of leadership principles that play a key role in hiring decisions, and understanding these principles is just as important as your coding skills.\n\nOn my own time, I practiced on LeetCode, a platform for coding challenges, because I liked it, not because I was preparing for interviews. Over time, I developed a strong interest in AI.\n\nOnce I arrived at Amazon, I identified tasks and patterns that could be automated and suggested AI-based solutions to management, primarily focusing on internal workflow automation and data-driven decision support systems. That experience shaped my interest in building intelligent tools for enterprise use. Leadership gave me the green light to implement them, and I successfully integrated AI into our team's workflow.\n\nAfter working at Amazon for about four years, a recruiter from Meta contacted me on LinkedIn. I never aimed to work at Meta, but my skills opened up new opportunities. I wanted to work more deeply in applied AI, and Meta offered an opportunity to focus on building intelligent systems with large-scale data and infrastructure. It was a natural next step to grow in the AI space.\n\nI went through the interview process, secured the job, and began working at Meta in 2022.\n\nI was referred internally to Microsoft based on my work at Meta. I decided to move because I wanted to work on enterprise-focused AI products, such as Copilot, which aligns more closely with my long-term interests in building impactful tools for productivity and business transformation. I've been at Microsoft since 2023.\n\nThroughout my career, I've had multiple competitive opportunities. With each role change, my scope of responsibility, impact, and overall compensation increased.\n\nMost of what I know about AI, I taught myself. I spent hours outside work watching YouTube tutorials, reading blogs, and practicing. I started small, creating AI agents for personal tasks, like sending outreach emails. Tasks that used to take me a day or two can now be completed in under an hour.\n\nSeeing those results motivated me to keep learning. What started as a personal side project has now become a central part of my career.\n\nAmazon and Meta both incorporate fast-paced learning, but Meta's codebase is more straightforward. Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all built from a single repository, allowing you to understand the system more quickly.\n\nAmazon's codebase is huge, which makes the first year challenging, but the learning curve is worth it. Microsoft feels different altogether. It's more enterprise-focused, operating at a massive scale.\n\nAI excels at repetitive or static tasks, and our job is to monitor and guide it. Managing AI, I believe, is the future of software engineering.\n\nDemand for AI roles is skyrocketing, while traditional software engineering roles have shrunk over the last five years. Many of my friends who don't work in AI have struggled to land new offers.\n\nI recommend dedicating just one hour a day to learning AI. Within six months, you'll see real progress, and these skills will be critical for the next decade. For beginners, I recommend the following:\n\nIf I were to advise my younger self, I would tell her to focus less on perfection and more on making an impact, to take ownership early, speak up with confidence, and prioritize learning and growth over titles.\n\nLong-term growth comes from solving meaningful problems and maintaining resilience.",

    "description": "Amazon updates its performance review system to require corporate employees share specific work achievements.",
    "fullText": "Amazon has a new question for its corporate workforce: What did you get done last year?\n\nAs part of this year's performance review process, known internally as Forte, Amazon is asking corporate employees to submit three to five \"accomplishments\" that best reflect their work, according to people familiar with the matter and an internal guideline obtained by Business Insider.\n\nEmployees are required to provide \"specific examples\" of what they delivered, along with actions they plan to take to continue growing at the company, the guideline added.\n\n\"Accomplishments are specific projects, goals, initiatives, or process improvements that show the impact of your work,\" the internal guideline states. \"Consider situations where you took risks or innovated, even if it didn't lead to the results you hoped for.\"\n\nThis marks the first time Amazon has explicitly formalized Forte around individual accomplishments, according to the people. They asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.\n\nWhile the company has long included a self-assessment component, past reviews asked employees broader questions about their \"super powers,\" areas of interest, and questions like, \"When you're at your best, how do you contribute?\" An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nForte is a key driver of employee compensation. Managers also consider peer feedback, adherence to Amazon's Leadership Principles, and job-specific skills to assign an \"Overall Value\" rating, which determines annual pay.\n\nThe move reflects Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's continued push to build a more disciplined workforce and a more unified corporate culture. Last year, he enforced a full return-to-office policy, cut management layers, and overhauled Amazon's pay model and performance review process to more clearly reward top performers.\n\nThis is part of a broader change in how tech companies treat employees. After years of mollycoddling talent, the industry has become tougher. Elon Musk started this in 2022, by demanding to know what Twitter employees accomplished each week. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg followed suit with his year of intensity. Even Google has toughened up.\n\nSome teams at Amazon, including the advertising and the IMDb video units, began pilot-testing a similar Forte question a few years ago. At the time, advertising chief Paul Kotas told employees that sharing specific accomplishments \"helps facilitate a more productive\" conversation with managers.\n\nHave a tip?

Make sure to check out all the details for Season 1 Reloaded in Black Ops 7 and Warzone, including more weapons, multiplayer maps, and new Zombies content.\n\nBelow, we highlight all the new Fallout-themed game modes players can enjoy. This includes modes for multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone, and even the campaign's Endgame.\n\nIn the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Mayhem playlist, Black Ops 7's multiplayer maps are irradiated with toxic particles. These are 6v6 matches of Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint, and they feature \"S.P.E.C.I.A.L. buffs\" to help players keep their radiation at safe levels. The HUD features a Geiger counter to display exposure levels, and players will want to collect the buffs to avoid taking too much radiation damage.\n\nThe S.P.E.C.I.A.L. buffs include:\n\nThe Ghouls is a spin on Call of Duty's Infected mode. In this mode, players spawn into the match as Vault Dwellers on irritated multiplayer maps. They must scavenge for perks and RadAway to help them survive, and each eliminated Vault Dweller returns to the match as a ghoul fighting against the dwellers. Players must survive as Vault Dweller or infect everyone as a ghoul to win.\n\nThe Feral Ghouls and Deathclaws of Fallout invade both the Ashes of the Damned and Astra Malorum maps in this themed limited-time mode. In Project RADs, players are also exposed to increased levels of radiation with each passing round.\n\nThis changes the mode's usual means of healing and earning Essence. Instead, these are replaced with a system of drops given by fallen enemies that assist the crew in keeping rad levels at bay and gaining vital resources.\n\nWhile it's not exactly an LTM, players can hunt down Fallout's infamous Deathclaws in Endgame. Deathclaws can be found in matches as a limited-time world event. For this event, a bomb blast reduces a portion of Avalon into a Fallout-inspired wasteland with toxic air. Players can fight through hordes of feral ghouls to take on a Deathclaw hunt for rewards.\n\nPower Armor Royale is a Fallout-themed spin on battle royale. This features 66 players in trios on Verdansk, where power armor can be obtained from air drops. Players will need to charge up Fusion Cores in order to use any power armor, but the suit will grant the user a health boost, jetpack thrusters, upgraded weaponry, and the ability to eject and detonate the suit.",

    "fullText": "MrBeast is blurring the lines between YouTube and TV in a new way with the release of season two of his reality TV hit, \"Beast Games,\" on Amazon's Prime Video.\n\nThe superstar YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, announced that the first episode will be copyright-free. That'll enable people to share reaction clips to their heart's content without fear of repercussions on platforms like Google's YouTube and Amazon's Twitch. The show kicks off on Wednesday.\n\nIt's only for one episode, but it gives MrBeast a way to have his TV cake and eat it, too — and for Amazon to juice exposure for the show.\n\nThe Amazon deal exposed MrBeast to a new audience and enabled him to create a big-budget spectacle that would have been difficult to make economically viable if it ran on YouTube. However, a potential risk was that MrBeast's fans might not follow him to Prime Video, which is behind a paywall requiring a Prime membership.\n\nLast year, MrBeast uploaded part of the first season to YouTube to ensure his fans on that platform were aware of it. MrBeast is YouTube's top creator, with over 450 million subscribers, and regularly receives more than 100 million views and numerous comments on his YouTube videos.\n\nTraditional media companies, such as Netflix and Fox, have been trying to stay relevant with younger viewers by striking deals with YouTube creators. The loss of fan interaction and decreased reach are concerns for some creators, though. In negotiating deals with podcasters, Netflix has told talent agents that it's exploring how to replicate community features for podcast hosts that it brings onto its platform.\n\nSeason 2 of \"Beast Games,\" which features 100 \"strong\" and 100 \"smart\" contestants competing for more than $10 million in prizes, blends elements of TV and digital platforms in other ways.\n\nIt'll include a crossover episode with \"Survivor,\" the famous reality TV show that \"Beast Games\" took inspiration from. And Twitch is promoting the season kickoff with a VIP screening on Tuesday featuring streamers alongside MrBeast.",
