    "description": "Your lead engineer thinks 10 AWS accounts is overkill. Here's why starting clean is weeks of work, while untangling later is 6-12 months of migration pain.",
    "fullText": "\"We don't need 10+ AWS accounts. It's overkill for us—we can do this later after we launch. This will slow down product development and add unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nI've heard this pushback dozens of times. And here's the thing: the instincts behind it aren't wrong.\n\nIt can feel like over-investing in infrastructure too early. It is more accounts than most people new to AWS start with. And if you've used multi-account setups before without good tooling, they absolutely can feel cumbersome and slow.\n\nOn top of that, understanding someone else's infrastructure code is always harder than code you wrote yourself, and you don't even know the final product architecture yet—shipping the product has to be the priority.\n\nThe counterproposal usually sounds reasonable:\n\n\"We just need dev, staging, and production accounts. Anything more is unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nHere's the thing: this is correct. To operate any product on AWS, you need a minimum of one account per SDLC stage—dev, staging, production. That's the baseline.\n\nThe misunderstanding comes when you look at this holistically: what does the organization need to operate securely? There's more than your software at stake.\n\nThe \"three accounts\" view only considers the application. It ignores everything else the organization needs to function—and that's where it breaks down the moment you start asking concrete questions.\n\nIf they're centralized—and they should be for security, compliance, and tamper resistance—they can't live in dev/staging/prod. Hence an audit account.\n\nWhere does your container registry live?\n\nIf you rebuild container images per account, you're triplicating images and not running what you tested. If you promote artifacts—which you should—a shared account is the logical solution. Hence an artifacts account.\n\nIn every account? That's 3× the cost and operational overhead. If centralized, how do they securely talk to services across accounts? Hence an automation account and a transit gateway. Don't think you need self-hosted runners? Make sure you have other ways to manage Kubernetes and RDS databases on private subnets.\n\nNone of these are future-state problems—they show up fast.\n\nWhen you put it all together—answering each of those concrete questions—you end up with:\n\nThat's 9–10 accounts for a minimal level of isolation.\n\nNot because someone decided \"9–10 is the right number.\" Because each account answers a specific question that you'll have to answer anyway. The accounts aren't arbitrary—they're the natural result of thinking through where things actually need to live.\n\nDoes this seem like a lot? Consider what happens without these boundaries:\n\nThe accounts aren't bureaucracy. They're guardrails that let you move faster, not slower.\n\nHere's the thing: you can add accounts later. That's not the myth.\n\nThe myth is believing it's easy or cheap to do later. It's not.\n\nAdding accounts later requires complex migrations, scheduling and coordination across teams, and untangling months or years of decisions built on faulty assumptions—like CIDR allocations that don't support peering or future growth.\n\nSome accounts are genuinely optional. If you're never going to have self-hosted runners, skip the automation account. If you're never using AWS as a DNS registrar, skip the DNS account. No big deal.\n\nBut some decisions are foundational—and brutal to change later:\n\nThe accounts themselves might sit empty for a while. But the architectural decisions you make on day one—CIDR allocation strategy, naming conventions, network topology—those get baked in immediately.\n\nHere's the real message: unless you operate today like you'll have multiple accounts, adding more accounts later won't make a difference.\n\nYou need to instill multi-account practices now in how you architect your applications and base your assumptions. It affects everything: network CIDR allocations, naming conventions, S3 bucket naming, Terraform state storage, DNS architecture, IAM trust relationships.\n\nCreate the boundaries now. Use them as the problems present themselves. If you wait until you need them, you're not just creating accounts—you're untangling everything you built assuming they didn't exist.\n\nThere's another reason account boundaries matter that's easy to underestimate:\n\nVPCs only give you network isolation. Accounts are the only hard IAM boundary AWS gives you.\n\nIf your goal is developer autonomy—letting engineers move fast without stepping on each other—fewer accounts actually makes that harder, not easier.\n\nYou end up either doing fragile IAM gymnastics, or giving everyone administrative access—which is very hard to walk back. Clean account boundaries let devs have broad access in some places and almost none in others—especially around production and security.\n\nAnd here's the uncomfortable truth: nothing is harder to craft than IAM policies.\n\nGetting IAM right in a single-account setup where you need to simulate multi-account boundaries is exponentially more complex than just having the boundaries in the first place.\n\nThis might look like over-engineering. It's not—it's choosing where to pay the cost.\n\nHere's the key: it's only complicated if you don't have the right tooling, conventions, and a framework that ties it together.\n\nWith the right tooling (like Atmos), managing 10 accounts isn't harder than managing 3. The complexity objection assumes you're doing this manually or piecing it together yourself. A proper framework handles the multi-account orchestration for you.\n\nSimple account setups optimize for getting started. Multi-account setups optimize for not having to unlearn assumptions later.\n\nYou're not adding complexity. You're preventing it.\n\nThe complexity of multi-team access, centralized logging, artifact promotion, and network segmentation is coming whether you plan for it or not. The only question is whether you have clean boundaries when it arrives, or whether you're retrofitting them into a single-account monolith.\n\nI genuinely understand the pushback. The instinct to ship fast and avoid premature complexity is exactly right in most contexts.\n\nBut AWS account boundaries aren't premature complexity—they're deferred simplicity. The complexity exists regardless. The only question is whether you've given it clean places to live.\n\nStarting clean is weeks. Untangling later is months.\n\nIf you're navigating this conversation internally and want help making the case—or just want to talk through the tradeoffs with someone who's been there—talk to an engineer. No sales theater. Just engineers who understand both the technical reality and the organizational dynamics at play.",

The most prized employees today are \"player-coaches,\" people who ship work themselves while also guiding projects, mentoring peers, and shaping strategy. AI makes that hybrid role even more potent, allowing a single strong contributor to amplify their output, and their influence, without managing a large team, Musa wrote this week.\n\nThe result is a revival of the individual contributor track. You no longer have to become a full-time people manager to earn top-tier pay. At companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, senior ICs can now match (or beat) the compensation of managers simply by delivering outsized results, he noted.\n\nFor ambitious employees, the takeaway is simple: in the AI era, execution compounds.

    "description": "Zoox's robotaxis do not have a steering wheel and are bi-directional. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee described the experience as like a theme park ride.",
    "fullText": "Of all the robotaxis I've tried, Amazon's Zoox feels different.\n\nZoox — founded in 2014 and acquired by Amazon four years later — is a robotaxi company that has limited operations in Las Vegas and San Francisco with about 50 vehicles between the two major cities. The company has said Austin and Miami are next on the map.\n\nThe service is considerably smaller than its competitor, Waymo, and that limitation was acutely felt in my experience hailing a Zoox on a Thursday night in Las Vegas during the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nHowever, the rider experience itself felt more akin to an amusement-park-ride-slash-party-bus than an average ride-hail service in an everyday car, which makes Zoox a true differentiator against the emerging players in the robotaxi race.\n\nThe company doesn't bulk order vehicles from automakers to retrofit them with sensors the same way Waymo or Uber does. Instead, Zoox designed a vehicle solely for robotaxi operations and builds the cars out of a factory in Hayward, California.\n\nThe robotaxi doesn't have a steering wheel or brake pedal — only seats inside the vehicle. The car is also bi-directional, meaning the Zoox's \"front\" goes both ways.\n\nThis helps the vehicle navigate tight spaces and avoid the need to execute U-turns or three-point turns.\n\nHowever, riders will mainly feel the difference once they step inside the Zoox.\n\nA chime plays as the robotaxi's doors slide open — almost like a grand entrance to the Zoox experience.\n\nThe interior reminded me of one of those immersive Disneyland rides or even a party-themed Gondola lift.\n\nInside, there are four seats — two on each side of the car, facing each other. I found that it encourages a social experience if you're bringing along multiple riders.\n\nThe headliner — or the roof — of the robotaxi has starlights which reminded me of the inside a Rolls-Royce or limousine. That touch felt especially appropriate for the Vegas scene, but it also seemed to add to the overall social experience Zoox is going for. It feels like a party inside the car.\n\nSurprisingly, the seats were comfortable. The photos and videos I've seen of the Zoox made me think the seats would feel like a bus or subway seat, but they have a plush touch to them.\n\nI don't see myself falling asleep inside the vehicle, simply because you're forced to sit upright and can't lie back in the seats, but they're comfortable enough for a 30- to 45-minute ride.\n\nAnother surprise: There's plenty of leg room that provides enough space between you and another rider in front of you. I went on a Zoox ride with a company spokesperson facing me, and space was not an issue.\n\nI tried a Zoox facing forward and backward inside the car.\n\nThere have been some reports of riders feeling nauseous when they face backward. I didn't experience that, but that could just be unique to me.\n\nThe Zoox app tells riders which way to face if they are prone to motion sickness.\n\nOutside the flashy headliner, there's little else inside the car. There are four wireless phone chargers, two small armrests, and four touchscreens by each of the seats, which allow riders to control the cabin temperature, change the music, and call for rider support.\n\nZoox is in a pilot stage of its operation in Las Vegas, working with fewer than 50 robotaxis inside the city. The service is free for now and limited to a handful of preset destinations.\n\nI hailed a Zoox from one of the stops, the Luxor Hotel, and was given a 25-minute wait time. The real wait-time was 37 minutes.\n\nThose two factors alone — limited destinations and long wait times — make Zoox less of a serious choice for day-to-day travel and more like a novelty experience to try once.\n\nThe rider experience also has room for improvement.\n\nFor all the effort Zoox put into creating a social in-car experience, the company has yet to provide riders with the option to connect to their Spotify or Apple Music. For now, passengers hear a curated music service from Stingray Music — similar to an iHeartRadio program.\n\nThe ride itself was mostly smooth. There was one moment that stuck out while the Zoox was going down the Strip.\n\nTraffic was heavy at night, and the Zoox attempted to make a lane change while it was stopped behind a line of cars waiting at a red light.\n\nThe robotaxi began to move into the right lane, possibly to navigate around the traffic and transition to a less-congested lane. As it began to enter the right lane, with the body of the car now at a diagonal, the Zoox suddenly stopped. The car hesitated, lurched a little bit forward, and paused again. About 10 seconds later, the car straightened out and remained in the current lane.\n\nZoox did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter a nearly 35-minute ride, I was dropped off at AREA15, a Vegas entertainment hub that was one of the closest stops to my hotel.\n\nA couple who had just taken a ride before me was trying to hail another Zoox to get back to their hotel at Excalibur.\n\nThe outside temperature was around 40 degrees.\n\nWe both resorted to calling an Uber.",

In court filings, Amazon said the financing would \"saddle\" Saks with \"billions of dollars of obligation for no material benefit\" and improperly use the value of Saks Global's flagship entities to prop up other debtors at the expense of their creditors, including Amazon.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal judge overseeing Saks' bankruptcy case granted the company approval at a court hearing on Wednesday to tap an initial round of its financing.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider on Thursday, and representatives for Saks declined to comment.",

    "description": "\"Who's going to watch an NFL game on the internet?\" More than 31 million people, it turns out.",
    "fullText": "On Saturday, the Chicago Bears beat the Green Bay Packers in an NFL playoff game that had everything: a bitter rivalry, an old-school outdoors atmosphere, and a historic comeback (or choke-job, depending on your POV).\n\nIt also happened to be a (mostly) streaming-only game. Did you notice? Or care?\n\nI didn't. Except for about 30 seconds, when I was trying to find out what network was showing the game, and it took me a beat to realize it was on Amazon's Prime Video. Then I booted up my app and watched the game without any issue. Just like any other NFL game.\n\nIn 2026, \"Guy doesn't have a problem watching the Bears/Packers\" is a true dog-bites-man story. But that's why I'm writing about it here: Not very long ago, the idea of streaming a super-high-profile NFL game — and requiring NFL fans to \n\nNow it's a yawner: I was one of 31.6 million people who watched the game, the vast majority of whom streamed it (fans in local markets could use broadcast TV). That's a streaming record for an NFL game, and it's more than some other games got last weekend on conventional TV.\n\nAnd that tells you just how far sports and streaming have come.\n\nFlash back to 2013, for instance, and the idea of whether the \"internet\" — a catch-all term that included everything needed to get streaming video onto your screen, from web servers to fiber-optic lines to the router in your house — could support a big NFL game watched by many millions of people was an open question. \"Why Web TV Skeptic Mark Cuban Thinks Google Can Make the NFL Work on the Web,\" was an ungainly headline I tapped out at the time.\n\nBack then, the NFL and other sports giants were routinely streaming big events like the Super Bowl and World Cup — but only as a sort of secondary outlet for weirdos who didn't have traditional TV. And anyone who did stream sports had to expect to run into problems, like ESPN did when it streamed a World Cup game in 2014.\n\nA year later, the NFL put on a streaming-only game for the first time — but made sure it was a relatively niche one, and made sure that people knew it was an experiment.\n\nCut to today, and streaming is just a way we watch some football games now. Amazon pays a gazillion dollars a year to show one game a week during the regular season; Netflix has paid up to show a couple games on Christmas Day. A new deal the NFL struck with Disney last year will give the league the opportunity to sell even more games to digital players.\n\nAnd two years ago, the league passed another new threshold by moving one of its most valuable assets — a playoff game — to Comcast's Peacock streamer, where it was only available to paid subscribers. That one generated a ton of complaints from people who said they didn't want to pay another service to watch an NFL game — along with millions of sign-ups for Peacock, which showed they would.\n\nThe NFL is not ditching TV for streaming anytime soon. For many people, watching NFL games is the main reason to watch TV, and that gives the league a ton of leverage to extract ever-increasing fees from the likes of NBC and CBS. So they will almost certainly keep the majority of their games on old-time TV for the foreseeable future. But they're going to sell them to streaming platforms too — because they'll pay up to get them, and you'll pay, too.",

A tracking update later informed me that it “may be lost” and I could request a refund. I pressed the refund option and was directed to customer service, which insisted I wait a week to claim.\n\nA week later I was told I needed to file an incident report from the email address associated with my account. When I complied, the report was rejected as coming from an address that “didn’t meet certain security standards”.\n\nI am now in the paradoxical situation that if I use the address associated with my account, it doesn’t meet their standards, but if I use a different address, it is not the one associated with my account.\n\nNow, when I check the order page, it says I requested to return the item (I didn’t), and that it will issue a refund once I do so (I can’t, as I never received it).\n\nAmazon has taken the first two monthly instalments of £108, while I remain phone-less.\n\nThe company’s apparent contortions to avoid a pricey payout are, in my opinion, shameless, and it is by no means to its credit that it stumped up instantly when exposure loomed.\n\nIt issued a refund within four hours of my getting in touch, and gave you a £50 voucher as “an additional gesture of goodwill”.\n\nIt says: “We are sorry for the inconvenience our mistake has caused.” .\n\nOthers left empty-handed and hundreds of pounds out of pocket can, when all else fails, make a chargeback claim for the sum from their debit card issuer or, if they paid by credit card, ask for reimbursement under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.\n\nWe welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

    "fullText": "Several months after Amazon bought artificial intelligence hardware startup Bee, the company said it’s working to make its $50 always-listening wearable more proactive, and indicated a larger revamp is in store.\n\nBee’s device, which can be worn on the wrist or clipped to a shirt, records and transcribes its owner’s activities, using that information to recap conversations and automatically create to-do lists in a companion app throughout the day.\n\nIt doesn’t have a display or built-in camera, and is designed to be “ambient AI” hardware that fades into the background without the user needing to constantly interact with it. The small gadget’s battery can last as long as a week before needing a recharge, according to the company.\n\nEarly AI-powered devices such as the Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1 have landed with a thud, owing to issues such as bugs, poor battery life and the lack of any standout features that would make them preferable to smartphones.\n\nAmazon has a spotty history with wearables and has shown less dedication to the category compared with its tentpole Fire TV, Kindle and Echo hardware. The company discontinued its Halo health tracker wristband in 2023 and has not released a new pair of wireless earbuds in almost three years. The Halo device offered some features that have carried forward with Bee, like the ability to detect a speaker’s mood.\n\nBee is trying to chart a different path from those gadgets by acting as a comprehensive daily journal that requires no prompting or manual input. Startups like Plaud have released competing gadgets with a similar purpose.\n\nThe notion of Amazon taking ownership of an always-listening accessory has made some people wary, but the startup said it maintains stringent privacy practices.",

    "fullText": "Amazon is beefing up its physical retail game with a new big-box store concept that goes well beyond groceries.\n\nVillage officials in Orland Park, Illinois, voted on Tuesday to approve Amazon's plan to build a 228,000-square-foot mega store near Chicago. That's roughly the size of a newer, larger Walmart Supercenter.\n\nPlanning documents said the facility would offer both groceries and general merchandise, as well as other services and prepared food options. Customers would also be able to place and receive online orders on-site.\n\nKatie Jahnke Dale, an attorney for Amazon, told the planning commission that the plan is \"a more purpose-built and thoughtful\" approach to traditional big-box stores, according to the Orland Park Patch.\n\n\"This is a retail concept, a retail store, albeit with perhaps a larger storeroom in the back, which will allow us to enhance the customer experience,\" she said.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider the store was one way the company is experimenting with making customers' lives easier.\n\n\"The site in question is our planned location for a new concept that we think customers will be excited about,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nIf all this sounds familiar, it's probably because hypermarkets like this one have been a staple of American retail since 1988, when Walmart opened its first Supercenter outside St. Louis. Walmart now has about 4,600 US stores.\n\nOf course, Amazon is no stranger to physical retail — at least in comparatively smaller formats.\n\nThe company operates 58 Amazon Fresh grocery stores, 14 Go convenience locations, and more than 500 Whole Foods Markets.\n\nAmazon said that more than 150 million US shoppers get groceries from the company, generating over $100 billion in sales in 2024.\n\nWhere those stores primarily focus on food, the new plan calls for a much broader range of merchandise, such as housewares or apparel, that can complement grocery shoppers' carts.\n\nAs traditional retailers like Walmart and Target ramp up their e-commerce efforts, Amazon is taking a few pages from the brick-and-mortar playbook as well.\n\nThis expansion comes a month after Business Insider reported that Amazon has been developing a \"rush\" pickup service, which would allow shoppers to collect their orders at Amazon-owned stores within an hour.\n\nThe company is also testing a fulfillment-only store concept that it expects to bring 30-minute delivery to customers in Seattle and Philadelphia.",

    "description": "Amazon rolls out an updated dashboard for managers to track office attendance and hours, expanding strict RTO policies.",
    "fullText": "What kind of badger are you? Amazon managers are about to find out.\n\nAmazon is equipping its managers with powerful new metrics to monitor their reports with a dashboard that tracks not only whether employees show up to the office, but also how many hours they spend there, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe move marks an escalation in the surveillance of white-collar workers at the e-commerce and cloud computing giant. Last year, Amazon implemented one of the industry's most stringent RTO mandates, requiring most employees to work from an office for five days a week. Now, managers have a way to spot — and potentially confront — employees who fall short of these expectations.\n\nThe updated dashboard, which began rolling out in December, allows managers and HR to view how often employees come into an office, how long they stay, and the locations where they work. It refreshes at 5 p.m. PT daily and tracks these metrics over a rolling eight-week period.\n\nThe system flags three kinds of employees: \"Low-Time Badgers,\" defined as employees whose weekly median time in the office is less than four hours per day, averaged over a rolling eight-week period; \"Zero Badgers,\" who don't badge into any Amazon building during that span; and \"Unassigned Building Badgers,\" who badge into a building other than the one they're assigned to over half the time.\n\n\"These metrics are intended to surface employees operating significantly outside documented in-office expectations,\" the document says.\n\n\"For more than a year now, we've provided tools like this for managers to help identify who on their team may need support in working from the office each day,\" an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. \"We recently updated the dashboard to make it more consistent for all managers, but most of the data and functionality was previously available. We continue to see the benefits of having our teams working together, and we haven't changed our expectations for employees to be in the office.\"\n\nAmazon notes in the document that managers are expected to \"apply judgment\" when determining whether to initiate formal disciplinary follow-ups.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon began tracking and sharing individual office attendance records, reversing a previous policy that only tracked anonymized, aggregated attendance data.\n\nA year later, the company began cracking down on \"coffee badging\" by informing some teams that they needed to be in the office for a minimum of two to six hours to have their attendance count. The crackdown received criticism from some employees, including one who compared the move to being treated \"like high school students,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThe updated dashboard standardizes these metrics across Amazon's entire corporate workforce, excluding workers such as warehouse staff and contractors. It grants managers direct, on-demand access to data that they would have previously had to request from HR, according to an Amazon employee familiar with the company's policies.\n\nAmazon is positioning the dashboard as a means to encourage in-person collaboration.\n\n\"Working In-office is important to our culture and is also about more than just being physically present during the week,\" the document said. \"Managers are expected to promote meaningful team collaboration through direct interactions with their team rather than just remotely monitoring badge swipes each week.\"\n\nAmazon is hardly alone in using badge data to police return-to-office rules.\n\nSamsung rolled out a manager-facing tool that shows \"days and time in building\" metrics, aimed at discouraging \"lunch/coffee badging.\" Dell informed hybrid staff that it will track on-site presence via badge swipes and could factor attendance into performance and compensation.\n\nBank of America issued warning notices to employees, informing some that continued noncompliance with its RTO policy could result in further disciplinary action. At JPMorgan, employees have described an internal dashboard that calculates the share of eligible days spent in the office and is visible to senior managers.\n\nIn the UK, PwC has said it would track employees' work locations to enforce its RTO policy.\n\nHave a tip?

For a limited time, players can earn Fallout operator skins and other themed rewards by unlocking them in free and paid event passes. Here's a look at all Fallout rewards in Call of Duty and how you unlock them during the event.\n\nCall of Duty's Fallout event runs from now until January 29. This adds operator skins and cosmetics themed around Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show. While there are plenty of free rewards to earn, you'll need to purchase the paid \"premium\" pass for 1,100 CoD Points ($10) if you want to unlock all items for the event.\n\nThere are 20 rewards in total for the Fallout event. There are 10 rewards in the free pass, and 10 more optional rewards can be unlocked with the paid pass. The highlights of the free pass include two vault dweller operator skins and the season's new Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun. The paid pass is required to unlock Maximus and The Ghoul characters from the show.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the character, Lucy MacLean, will arrive as a shop bundle at a later date. Call of Duty's operator bundles are typically around $20 each.\n\nAll Fallout event rewards can be seen below. This is an XP-based event, so you'll simply need to grind XP across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. For multiplayer, objective modes like Kill Confirmed and Domination work best, while Plunder and Casual battle royale modes will yield more XP for Warzone. This is also a good time to use double XP tokens if you have them.\n\nIt's worth noting that this crossover features Fallout-themed game modes and events across multiplayer, Zombies, Endgame, and Warzone. Make sure to check out all the details about Season 1 Reloaded's new content, and the full patch notes can be found here.\n\nThis is an operator skin for David Mason, putting him in Fallout's iconic blue vault suit. This is a free instant reward you'll get automatically at the start of the event.\n\nThis is the Power Armor skin for Maximus with his helmet on. The skin is a paid reward that you unlock automatically if you purchase the paid event pass.\n\nThis reward is a loading screen with iconic Fallout-themed artwork, and it is unlocked in the free pass.\n\nThis is a cosmetic blueprint for the Flatline MK II melee weapon, which makes it look like the Torch Blade used by the Brotherhood of Steel. This is unlocked in the paid pass.\n\nThis reward is a one-hour double weapon XP token, and it is unlocked in the free pass.\n\nThis is a finishing move that lets your character wield a minigun to takedown opponents. This is available to unlock in the paid pass.\n\nThis is an animated emblem of Fallout's Vault Boy. The reward is unlocked in the free pass.\n\nThis is a weapon blueprint for the AK-27 assault rifle, and it's themed around the Brotherhood of Steel. The reward is unlocked in the paid pass.\n\nThis reward is a one-hour double XP token, and it is unlocked in the free pass.\n\nThis Maximus skin features the character from the show in his power armor, but the helmet is off to make the character's face visible. The skin is unlocked in the paid pass.\n\nThis is an operator skin for Zaveri, putting her in Fallout's iconic blue vault suit. The reward is unlocked in the free pass.\n\nThis is an animated calling card featuring Maximus launching upwards in a power armor suit.

The reward is available to earn in the free pass.\n\nThis is a Fallout-themed shotgun blueprint for the M10 Breacher. The reward is available to unlock in the paid pass.\n\nThe final reward in the free pass is the season's new Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun.\n\nThe Sturmwolf 45 is basically a renamed variant of Call of Duty's popular UMP45. This is a full-auto submachine gun, and Activision describes it as being \"highly accurate and easy to use.\"\n\nThe final reward of the paid pass is The Ghoul operator from the Fallout TV show.",

    "description": "Nandita Giri is a senior software engineer with experience at Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. She recommends job seekers spend an hour a day learning AI.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nandita Giri, a 32-year-old software engineer at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy journey began with problem-solving and math long before I knew I'd end up in Big Tech.\n\nI studied at the National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, in India. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google often scout talent from this school.\n\nAmazon hired me straight out of college, and I moved to Seattle in 2018. To get the job, there was a logical analysis test, and only a handful of us passed. Then came multiple interviews based on problem-solving. That's how my journey in tech began.\n\nI'm now a senior software engineer at Microsoft, and my AI skills are in high demand.\n\nWhen applying for roles at Amazon, it's not about solving problems as quickly as possible, but solving them optimally. You must carefully consider the issue so that the solution can scale and be easily maintained. Amazon has a set of leadership principles that play a key role in hiring decisions, and understanding these principles is just as important as your coding skills.\n\nOn my own time, I practiced on LeetCode, a platform for coding challenges, because I liked it, not because I was preparing for interviews. Over time, I developed a strong interest in AI.\n\nOnce I arrived at Amazon, I identified tasks and patterns that could be automated and suggested AI-based solutions to management, primarily focusing on internal workflow automation and data-driven decision support systems. That experience shaped my interest in building intelligent tools for enterprise use. Leadership gave me the green light to implement them, and I successfully integrated AI into our team's workflow.\n\nAfter working at Amazon for about four years, a recruiter from Meta contacted me on LinkedIn. I never aimed to work at Meta, but my skills opened up new opportunities. I wanted to work more deeply in applied AI, and Meta offered an opportunity to focus on building intelligent systems with large-scale data and infrastructure. It was a natural next step to grow in the AI space.\n\nI went through the interview process, secured the job, and began working at Meta in 2022.\n\nI was referred internally to Microsoft based on my work at Meta. I decided to move because I wanted to work on enterprise-focused AI products, such as Copilot, which aligns more closely with my long-term interests in building impactful tools for productivity and business transformation. I've been at Microsoft since 2023.\n\nThroughout my career, I've had multiple competitive opportunities. With each role change, my scope of responsibility, impact, and overall compensation increased.\n\nMost of what I know about AI, I taught myself. I spent hours outside work watching YouTube tutorials, reading blogs, and practicing. I started small, creating AI agents for personal tasks, like sending outreach emails. Tasks that used to take me a day or two can now be completed in under an hour.\n\nSeeing those results motivated me to keep learning. What started as a personal side project has now become a central part of my career.\n\nAmazon and Meta both incorporate fast-paced learning, but Meta's codebase is more straightforward. Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all built from a single repository, allowing you to understand the system more quickly.\n\nAmazon's codebase is huge, which makes the first year challenging, but the learning curve is worth it. Microsoft feels different altogether. It's more enterprise-focused, operating at a massive scale.\n\nAI excels at repetitive or static tasks, and our job is to monitor and guide it. Managing AI, I believe, is the future of software engineering.\n\nDemand for AI roles is skyrocketing, while traditional software engineering roles have shrunk over the last five years. Many of my friends who don't work in AI have struggled to land new offers.\n\nI recommend dedicating just one hour a day to learning AI. Within six months, you'll see real progress, and these skills will be critical for the next decade. For beginners, I recommend the following:\n\nIf I were to advise my younger self, I would tell her to focus less on perfection and more on making an impact, to take ownership early, speak up with confidence, and prioritize learning and growth over titles.\n\nLong-term growth comes from solving meaningful problems and maintaining resilience.",

    "description": "Amazon updates its performance review system to require corporate employees share specific work achievements.",
    "fullText": "Amazon has a new question for its corporate workforce: What did you get done last year?\n\nAs part of this year's performance review process, known internally as Forte, Amazon is asking corporate employees to submit three to five \"accomplishments\" that best reflect their work, according to people familiar with the matter and an internal guideline obtained by Business Insider.\n\nEmployees are required to provide \"specific examples\" of what they delivered, along with actions they plan to take to continue growing at the company, the guideline added.\n\n\"Accomplishments are specific projects, goals, initiatives, or process improvements that show the impact of your work,\" the internal guideline states. \"Consider situations where you took risks or innovated, even if it didn't lead to the results you hoped for.\"\n\nThis marks the first time Amazon has explicitly formalized Forte around individual accomplishments, according to the people. They asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.\n\nWhile the company has long included a self-assessment component, past reviews asked employees broader questions about their \"super powers,\" areas of interest, and questions like, \"When you're at your best, how do you contribute?\" An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nForte is a key driver of employee compensation. Managers also consider peer feedback, adherence to Amazon's Leadership Principles, and job-specific skills to assign an \"Overall Value\" rating, which determines annual pay.\n\nThe move reflects Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's continued push to build a more disciplined workforce and a more unified corporate culture. Last year, he enforced a full return-to-office policy, cut management layers, and overhauled Amazon's pay model and performance review process to more clearly reward top performers.\n\nThis is part of a broader change in how tech companies treat employees. After years of mollycoddling talent, the industry has become tougher. Elon Musk started this in 2022, by demanding to know what Twitter employees accomplished each week. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg followed suit with his year of intensity. Even Google has toughened up.\n\nSome teams at Amazon, including the advertising and the IMDb video units, began pilot-testing a similar Forte question a few years ago. At the time, advertising chief Paul Kotas told employees that sharing specific accomplishments \"helps facilitate a more productive\" conversation with managers.\n\nHave a tip?

The update adds operator skins for characters from Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show, and there are plenty of limited-time game modes and events themed around the series.\n\nThis Fallout event includes free and paid event passes filled with rewards, and you can see all the skins and more details here.

Make sure to check out all the details for Season 1 Reloaded in Black Ops 7 and Warzone, including more weapons, multiplayer maps, and new Zombies content.\n\nBelow, we highlight all the new Fallout-themed game modes players can enjoy. This includes modes for multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone, and even the campaign's Endgame.\n\nIn the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Mayhem playlist, Black Ops 7's multiplayer maps are irradiated with toxic particles. These are 6v6 matches of Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint, and they feature \"S.P.E.C.I.A.L. buffs\" to help players keep their radiation at safe levels. The HUD features a Geiger counter to display exposure levels, and players will want to collect the buffs to avoid taking too much radiation damage.\n\nThe S.P.E.C.I.A.L. buffs include:\n\nThe Ghouls is a spin on Call of Duty's Infected mode. In this mode, players spawn into the match as Vault Dwellers on irritated multiplayer maps. They must scavenge for perks and RadAway to help them survive, and each eliminated Vault Dweller returns to the match as a ghoul fighting against the dwellers. Players must survive as Vault Dweller or infect everyone as a ghoul to win.\n\nThe Feral Ghouls and Deathclaws of Fallout invade both the Ashes of the Damned and Astra Malorum maps in this themed limited-time mode. In Project RADs, players are also exposed to increased levels of radiation with each passing round.\n\nThis changes the mode's usual means of healing and earning Essence. Instead, these are replaced with a system of drops given by fallen enemies that assist the crew in keeping rad levels at bay and gaining vital resources.\n\nWhile it's not exactly an LTM, players can hunt down Fallout's infamous Deathclaws in Endgame. Deathclaws can be found in matches as a limited-time world event. For this event, a bomb blast reduces a portion of Avalon into a Fallout-inspired wasteland with toxic air. Players can fight through hordes of feral ghouls to take on a Deathclaw hunt for rewards.\n\nPower Armor Royale is a Fallout-themed spin on battle royale. This features 66 players in trios on Verdansk, where power armor can be obtained from air drops. Players will need to charge up Fusion Cores in order to use any power armor, but the suit will grant the user a health boost, jetpack thrusters, upgraded weaponry, and the ability to eject and detonate the suit.",

    "fullText": "MrBeast is blurring the lines between YouTube and TV in a new way with the release of season two of his reality TV hit, \"Beast Games,\" on Amazon's Prime Video.\n\nThe superstar YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, announced that the first episode will be copyright-free. That'll enable people to share reaction clips to their heart's content without fear of repercussions on platforms like Google's YouTube and Amazon's Twitch. The show kicks off on Wednesday.\n\nIt's only for one episode, but it gives MrBeast a way to have his TV cake and eat it, too — and for Amazon to juice exposure for the show.\n\nThe Amazon deal exposed MrBeast to a new audience and enabled him to create a big-budget spectacle that would have been difficult to make economically viable if it ran on YouTube. However, a potential risk was that MrBeast's fans might not follow him to Prime Video, which is behind a paywall requiring a Prime membership.\n\nLast year, MrBeast uploaded part of the first season to YouTube to ensure his fans on that platform were aware of it. MrBeast is YouTube's top creator, with over 450 million subscribers, and regularly receives more than 100 million views and numerous comments on his YouTube videos.\n\nTraditional media companies, such as Netflix and Fox, have been trying to stay relevant with younger viewers by striking deals with YouTube creators. The loss of fan interaction and decreased reach are concerns for some creators, though. In negotiating deals with podcasters, Netflix has told talent agents that it's exploring how to replicate community features for podcast hosts that it brings onto its platform.\n\nSeason 2 of \"Beast Games,\" which features 100 \"strong\" and 100 \"smart\" contestants competing for more than $10 million in prizes, blends elements of TV and digital platforms in other ways.\n\nIt'll include a crossover episode with \"Survivor,\" the famous reality TV show that \"Beast Games\" took inspiration from. And Twitch is promoting the season kickoff with a VIP screening on Tuesday featuring streamers alongside MrBeast.",

    "description": "Amazon tests Shop Direct, pulling product listings from other retailers without consent, highlighting data scraping issues.",
    "fullText": "Amazon has aggressively fought outside companies' efforts to scrape its data. Now, the e-commerce giant is being criticized for adopting the same tactic itself, pulling product listings from other retailers without their consent.\n\nAmazon has been testing a feature that lists products it doesn't sell, showing items from other retailers and brands without their permission. Shoppers who click on these new listings on Amazon.com are redirected to the external sites where the products are sold. Sellers who don't want their products featured can request to have their items be removed, but Amazon doesn't ask retailers to opt in ahead of time.\n\nThe new feature, called \"Shop Direct,\" is currently in beta and only available for certain product categories.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider the new tool is \"designed to expand discovery for customers and help businesses reach more customers.\" The product details, like prices and names, are pulled from \"public information on a brand's website,\" the spokesperson added.\n\n\"Amazon is a longstanding supporter of small and independent businesses, and today more than 60% of sales in our store are from independent sellers who leverage our innovative tools and services to run their businesses and serve customers,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe test reflects a markedly different position on data scraping for Amazon. The company has previously blocked AI tools from OpenAI and Google from collecting its product listing data, and filed a lawsuit against Perplexity over the AI startup's use of Amazon's shopping platform.\n\nJuozas Kaziukenas, founder of Marketplace Pulse, told Business Insider that it's unclear how Amazon manages product details and pricing for the new Shop Direct feature, which he described as \"full of oddness.\"\n\nIn a separate LinkedIn post, Kaziukenas said it was ironic that Amazon was engaging in the very behavior it prohibits others from doing.\n\n\"All of this is bizarre because Amazon blocked all AI scrapers and sued Perplexity for building automated buying on top of Amazon, while at the same time doing the same thing with others' ecommerce websites,\" he wrote.\n\nThe feature appears to be a part of Amazon's broader push to turn its marketplace into the definitive source of information for \"all products worldwide,\" an initiative internally codenamed Project Starfish, as Business Insider previously reported. An internal document said the AI tool was expected to collect product data from 200,000 external brand websites last year by \"crawling, scraping, and mapping external items to Amazon's catalog.\"\n\nThe move turns Amazon into more of a search engine, akin to Google, which scrapes retail site listings and sends commercial queries out to the web.\n\nAmazon also rolled out a \"Buy for Me\" feature last year that surfaces products from other brands' websites and lets shoppers complete purchases without leaving the Amazon app.\n\nThe new feature has caught some online sellers off guard.\n\nAngie Chua, CEO of stationery accessory maker Bobo Design Studio, said she was puzzled when her products began appearing on Amazon late last month. She later posted a video saying she had never been informed of the program and had not opted in. Amazon pulled her products after she requested their removal.\n\nChua told Business Insider that the listings frequently contained incorrect product names and information. She described Amazon's actions as \"insulting,\" stating that they had damaged her brand and customer relationships. She added that she's aware of more than 100 brands that have had similar experiences.\n\n\"It completely undermines the trust that small businesses are working so hard to create,\" Chua said.\n\nData scraping has become a flashpoint in the AI industry, as companies seek vast amounts of information to train models and provide chat-style direct answers for users. For Amazon, which operates the largest online shopping site in the US, preventing rivals from crawling its marketplace for valuable training data is especially critical.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Jeff Bezos led the way, cashing in nearly $6 billion of Amazon stock throughout the year.",
    "fullText": "2025 was — on the whole — a good time to cash in profits on stock positions, considering the S&P 500 finished 16% higher.\n\nThe gains were even bigger in tech, particularly for companies with their wagons hitched to the red-hot AI trade, which lifted the likes of Alphabet and Nvidia to market-beating performance.\n\nData from Washington Service shows that insider stock sales totaled $16 billion last year. The biggest seller of all was Jeff Bezos, who liquidated $5.7 billion.\n\nListed below are the details around Bezos, as well as the four other biggest sellers across the market. Note that nearly all of the sales tallied for this exercise were part of established plans, with purchases happening at pre-signaled intervals.\n\nThe Amazon founder turned chairman turned many heads in 2025 with his high-profile wedding to media personality Lauren Sanchez, which pumped roughly $1.1 billion into Venice Italy's local economy.\n\nDuring the year, though, Bezos also offloaded 25,000,000 shares of Amazon stock, taking home $5.7 billion. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index reveals that his most recent stock sale netted $3.5 billion. While the billionaire's net worth increased by $15 billion in 2025, he still slipped one notch on the list of the world's wealthiest people.\n\nTotal value sold: $2,531,343,305\n\nOracle enjoyed an overall strong year, despite a lackluster third-quarter earnings report that pulled the stock down in December. Former CEO Safra Katz exercised some stock options in the first half of the year, freeing up $1.8 billion.\n\nShe ended the year as the company's top insider seller, and still holds a position of 1.1 million shares.\n\nDell Technologies CEO Michael Dell sold more than sixteen million shares, totaling $2.2 billion. His most recent sale netted $1.9 billion.\n\nDell and his wife Susan were in the news recently, investing $6.25 billion into \"Trump Accounts,\" a move that inspired fellow billionaire Ray Dalio to do the same.\n\nTotal value sold: $1,048,586,165\n\nHuang offloaded a total of 6,000,000 shares of Nvidia stock in 2025, resulting in $1 billion of proceeds. His highly profitable year helped him rise four places on the world's wealthiest list, rising from 12th place to 9th.\n\nJayshree may not be as high-profile as the other tech CEOs on this list, but her insider sales of Arista Networks stock landed her in the top five. She sold 7,560,143 for proceeds of $976 million.",

    "description": "Companies including Amazon, JPMorgan, and AT&T have faced obstacles trying to get employees to return to office.",
    "fullText": "Return-to-office mandates continue to feel like high-level math equations that even the business world’s brightest can’t solve.\n\nAmazon, JPMorgan, and AT&T are among the most recent companies to require a full-time RTOs. But some of these mandates have faced obstacles, including a lack of office space and dissatisfied employees.\n\nAmazon, for example, said in September, it wanted its 350,000-person workforce in the office by early January. As of February, many of their offices didn’t have enough desks to accommodate the return, leaving many employees continuing working from home. AT&T had a similar issue. In response to JPMorgan’s RTO mandate, employees expressed their outrage on an internal platform. The company then disabled comments. Some JPMorgan and Amazon workers have also signed petitions protesting their employers’ requirements.\n\nWhat’s missing from some of these RTO plans is the recognition of a cultural change, said Jennifer Moss, workplace strategist and author of Why Are We Here?: Creating a Work Culture Everyone Wants. The post-pandemic workplace should combine lessons from the pre-pandemic and pandemic-era models, she said.\n\n“When we’re trying to get people back into the office, we still are executing the office in the same way that it used to be,” Moss told HR Brew. “We just can’t jam the toothpaste back in the tube.”\n\nRecognize the new environment. Improved collaboration, culture, and productivity are often cited as reasons for an RTO, Moss said, but being in the office won’t necessarily help employees achieve these goals.\n\n“People are going into the office, unfortunately, it feels very much like what it feels like to be at home,” she said. “You’re still on Zoom, and you’re still spending your day doing the exact same things you could be doing at home. It feels very arbitrary.”\n\nTo facilitate this new era of work, employers should embrace a model Moss called “the third office.” Instead of “pushing” for employees to go back to pre-pandemic norms, she said, employers should consider how they can incorporate the benefits of remote work, like autonomy and flexibility. To that end, a hybrid approach, she said, typically works best.\n\nMoss also urged mindfulness around how the physical office space can affect employees. If a company doesn’t have enough desks, for example, she said HR leaders should rethink how employees work in the office, and create quiet or collaborative spaces outside of the open floor plan.\n\n“The [third office] is a place where you have challenging discussions, where you learn to network, develop soft skills, be able to have team building, build up that social energy and that cohesion,” she said, adding that these activities were undervalued pre-pandemic and lost during the pandemic, and should be part of this new era.\n\nEventually, however, companies that require five days in the office should offer employees their own dedicated workspace, Moss said. It may seem simple, but being able to personalize a desk is something that, she said, may help employees feel more connected to their workplace.\n\nIdentify and communicate the play-by-play. Some executives want RTO to alleviate their own “trust issues,” without considering how it might affect employees, according to John Frehse, the global head of labor strategy at consulting firm Ankura.\n\n“You only trust me when I’m in the office. You don’t trust me when I’m at home. What kind of a worker and employer relationship are we dealing with?” Frehse told HR Brew.\n\nSujay Saha, an employee experience strategist and founder of consulting firm Cortico-X, emphasized the need for a plan. “Don’t make the decision and then try to figure it out, how do I make that decision happen for people…that is the biggest problem in a lot of this,” Saha said. He suggested HR start by identifying employees’ “personas,” like whether they’re working parents or belong to the sandwich generation. This can give HR a sense of employees’ needs and schedules, which can help inform what kind of RTO might make sense.\n\n“There are pros and cons in all of this, so the most important thing that we can tackle is how we do it,” Saha said. “Maybe there is a pace at which you could do it…Reduce the pace and give people that mental adjustment time that is needed genuinely, to take care of their lives before you change [their lives].”\n\nFrehse also advised against focusing an RTO announcement on the enforcement and repercussions of not following the mandate. Instead, communicate the steps and value-add for professional growth.\n\n“It’s both culturally and intellectually lazy to announce a certain number of days of return to office each week, without listing in heavy detail the reasons why—not just benefits for the business, but the benefits for the employee,” he said.\n\nSaha agreed. “Don’t do it, just for the heck of doing it…Be clear about why you’re doing it.”\n\nThis report was originally published by HR Brew.\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on February 28, 2025.",

    "description": "Amazon employees beta-testing Alexa+ vented frustrations on an internal Slack, highlight the continuing headaches behind Amazon's rollout of Alexa+.",
    "fullText": "The Slack message from an Amazon employee beta-testing the company's long-delayed Alexa+ was the stuff of nightmares.\n\n\"When I ask Alexa to turn off the light, it should turn off the light, not everything on the strip,\" the software engineer wrote in October in a channel for workers to share feedback on unreleased Alexa+ features. \"It turned off the power strip that my aquarium filter is on and killed my fish.\"\n\nOther testers complained that the assistant talked non-stop, ignoring repeated commands to be quiet. Or that it played a device at full volume when no one was home.\n\n\"The behavior has become unbearably erratic,\" one employee wrote. \"I just wanted to test the new experiences, but I wasn't expecting to get everything messed up.\"\n\nThe messages highlight the continuing headaches behind Amazon's rollout of Alexa+, a revamped version of its voice assistant that has been marred by years of delays and technical problems. It was released to the public earlier this year, but remains available only to users who request access or use newer devices.\n\nAmazon's Alexa+ beta-tester channel, which in October included more than 6,400 Amazon employees, has served as a candid forum for early testers to share feedback on unreleased Alexa+ features. Those include a more conversational speech mode and a new browser-based version of the AI-powered assistant, which Amazon introduced to the public in December.\n\nDozens of testers wrote that once they linked the unreleased features to their existing Alexa setups, routine tasks began to break down, turning what was meant to be a smarter assistant into a recurring source of frustration, according to messages that were posted to the Slack channel in October.\n\nAmazon has long promoted a culture that encourages employees to use and critique products internally. Early testing is designed to surface and correct bugs. Business Insider didn't see any comments posted to the channel after October, so it's not clear if some of the issues have been resolved.\n\nThe employee feedback in this Slack channel referred to a version of Alexa+ that differs from what's currently available to the public and doesn't reflect the typical customer experience, an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. Tens of millions of users now have access, the spokesperson said, and the \"overwhelming majority\" of feedback has been positive.\n\n\"As with any other consumer technology company, it's a standard part of the development process to beta-test products and features internally, well before they're distributed to customers,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy remains bullish on Alexa+. On a call with analysts in October, he said Alexa+ users tend to have longer interactions with the voice assistant and engage across a wider range of topics than with the older version. Amazon has made Alexa+ free for Prime subscribers, but non-Prime users must pay $19.99 a month.\n\n\"We continue to be energized by the response to Alexa+ compared to what we call the classic Alexa experience,\" Jassy said during the call.\n\nSome employees wondered aloud in the Alexa+ Slack channel whether consumers would pay for it.\n\n\"All my experiences thus far with Alexa+, inclusive of this one, haven't convinced me that, other than the improved conversation flow, anything would justify paying a subscription fee,\" one staffer wrote.\n\nBeta testers reported on Slack that Alexa+ sometimes failed to respond to voice commands, lost its Wi-Fi connection, or became unresponsive even when it appeared to be online. Some employees said it took up to five minutes to get a response; others reported that their Alexa devices stopped working entirely.\n\nSeveral employees asked how to opt out of beta testing.\n\n\"None of my devices, including the Alexa app, are responsive anymore,\" an employee wrote.\n\nMusic playback emerged as a recurring pain point.\n\n\"It's so discouraging that we're in Q4 2025 and Alexa+ still can't play a song I ask for,\" one employee wrote.\n\nAnother reported that a device began playing music at 3 a.m. He eventually unplugged it.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Amazon is allowing employees who are stranded in India because of visa delays to work remotely there until early March, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe catch: They're not allowed to code, make strategic decisions, or interact with customers.\n\nAmazon is one of many American companies scrambling to adapt to the Trump administration's rapid-fire changes to the H-1B visa program, including a mandate that consular officers must review visa applicants' social media posts before issuing visas. The additional screening has delayed processing, and some embassies and consulates have rescheduled visa appointments by several months, leaving some employees stranded outside the country.\n\nThe delays have prompted Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other companies to issue travel advisories in recent weeks, warning US employees with visas to avoid international travel to prevent extended stays outside the US.\n\nAmazon allows employees traveling abroad for visa renewals to work remotely for up to 20 business days, an exemption from the normal requirement that they work in their office five days a week. Now, any Amazon employee in India as of December 13 and who awaits a rescheduled visa appointment may work remotely until March 2, according to the memo, which was posted to Amazon's internal HR portal on December 17.\n\nThe permission to work remotely comes with a long list of constraints. Employees working remotely from India are barred from coding of any kind, including troubleshooting and testing. They cannot work from or visit Amazon buildings. And they cannot negotiate or sign contracts.\n\n\"All reviews, final decision making, and sign offs should be undertaken outside India,\" the memo says.\n\nThe memo also said that \"in compliance with local laws, there are no exceptions to these restrictions.\"\n\nThe memo does not provide guidance for employees whose visa appointments have been rescheduled beyond March 2, 2026, or for those stranded in a different country. Some US embassies and consulates have rescheduled appointments as far out as 2027.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nFor employees in technical roles, the restrictions raised questions about what work they can actually perform.\n\n\"Seventy to eighty percent of my job is coding, testing, deploying, and documenting,\" one Amazon software engineer told Business Insider.\n\nA State Department spokesperson in December told Business Insider that the purpose of the social media reviews is to use \"all available tools\" to flag visa applicants who are inadmissible, including those who pose a risk to national interests.\n\nThe delays pose a particular challenge for Amazon, which is among the largest users of the H-1B program. During the 2024 government fiscal year, Amazon filed 14,783 certified H-1B applications, including 23 for Whole Foods, according to Business Insider's analysis of publicly available data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Our reporting revealed a symbiotic relationship between the IDF and Silicon Valley – with implications for the future of warfare\n\nIn January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms. Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.\n\nOne investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.\n\nI asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.\n\nHow did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?\n\nYuval Abraham: The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.\n\nHarry Davies: There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.\n\nWhat has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?\n\nYuval Abraham: As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.\n\nIf you remember the [Edward] Snowden revelations, many of them had to do with metadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.\n\nSo data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nTo send a message to Harry and Yuval please choose the ‘UK Investigations’ team.\n\nYou can message Harry using the Signal Messenger app. Use the ‘find by username’ option and type hfd.90\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email harry.davies@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nHarry Davies: Yossi Sariel, the former head of [Israel’s elite spy agency] Unit 8200, wrote a book under a pseudonym that we revealed to have been published by him. In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.\n\nSome of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nWe know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as you revealed, Yuval, and has also purchased AI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?\n\nYuval Abraham: What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] called Lavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.\n\nThese AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.\n\nAI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.\n\nHarry Davies: Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.\n\nMicrosoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?\n\nHarry Davies: I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have been protest groups which have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.\n\nYuval Abraham: And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.\n\nIt sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.\n\nYuval Abraham: Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for its Nimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.\n\nThese are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.\n\nMicrosoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhat’s your focus going to be in 2026?\n\nYuval Abraham: I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHarry Davies: We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.\n\nThere’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.\n\nAnd there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services. Post-Gaza, we have to look at these relationships and ask: what is the involvement of these companies and their technology in military decisions, in military operations and in warfare more broadly?\n\nYuval Abraham: Much of our reporting is based on whistleblowers, on individuals who are in proximity to power or hold positions of power.\n\nHarry Davies: Our confidential sources have remained confidential and we are always interested in hearing from new people.

    "description": "Amazon, YouTube TV, and Netflix dominate US sports streaming, accounting for 65% of the $6.5 billion spent by streamers on sports rights.",
    "fullText": "The NFL is giving sports fans a triple header for Christmas this year, starting with the Dallas Cowboys vs. the Washington Commanders at 1 p.m. ET, plus a Snoop Dogg halftime performance. But you have to \n\nThe tech giants have eaten the entertainment world, and now they're coming for sports.\n\nTogether, Amazon and YouTube TV account for 65% of the $6.5 billion that streamers will spend on sports rights for US audiences in 2025 (34.4% and 30.6%, respectively), according to Ampere Analysis. The third biggest share went to Netflix, with 11.3%. Disney's ESPN+ and Comcast's Peacock held a distant fourth and fifth place.\n\nAmazon and YouTube have actively pursued significant deals for sports rights in recent years, with Amazon paying $11 billion for the NFL's Thursday Night Football and $19.8 billion for NBA rights, and YouTube paying $14 billion to secure NFL \"Sunday Ticket\" rights.\n\nNetflix has also been active, scooping up NFL Christmas Day games and the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, although it prefers to treat sports as part of a broader live events strategy that includes comedy specials and awards shows rather than \"renting\" full seasons of sports rights. A person familiar with Netflix's spending said they pegged it at about $600 million versus Ampere's calculation of $738 million.\n\nAmpere's data comes with a few caveats. Its measurements of eight platforms exclude spending for rights distributed internationally — such as Amazon's spending on NFL rights outside the US, or on the UEFA Men's Champions League within the UK — and for DAZN's acquisition of the global FIFA Club World Cup 2025 rights for $1 billion.\n\nBroadcasters remain the largest buyers of sports rights in the US, although streamers are making inroads.\n\nNearly half (47%) of US broadcasters' content spending — $24 billion — went to sports rights in 2025, per Ampere. Most of US streamers' content budgets still go to TV shows and films. This year, 10% of their content budgets overall went to sports in 2025, up from 6% in 2024. Even for Amazon, sports were about 19% of its spending on content, approaching the amount it spends on movies.\n\nSports can help streamers grow engagement and keep audiences subscribed. However, the rising cost of sports means less money for an already stagnating entertainment TV ecosystem that has been producing fewer shows since the end of Peak TV in 2022.\n\nDisney said in its fourth quarter earnings call that it would spend $24 billion in the next fiscal year, driven in large part by sports rights. CFO Hugh Johnston justified paying a more than 73% step up for NBA rights in its 2024 deal by pointing to their value to audiences and advertisers, despite the cost creating \"a little bit of bumpiness during the course of the year.\"\n\nNetflix compared its recent NFL deal to the cost of its movies, which it's been making fewer of. Asked about the cost of the deal at an investor conference last year, Netflix exec Spencer Wang said he would characterize each game as \"roughly the size of one of our medium-sized original films.\"\n\nThe shift of sports to streaming platforms looks likely to continue.\n\nAmpere forecasts global spending on sports rights to increase by 20% to $78 billion worldwide by 2030. Spending will be driven by the US, where new NBA and MLB rights will be up for grabs in the coming years. Talks for the next round of NFL negotiations could start as early as 2026, as the league seeks to maximize the value of its media rights.\n\nYouTube TV is also expanding its play for sports fans, announcing a new sports bundle along with other niche packages that cost less than its regular $83-per-month service.",

    "description": "Former Amazon employees detail their journey launching an AI startup, and explain how they adapted to startup life.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Shalini Aggarwal, a 50-year-old CEO in San Jose, California, and Andy Ratsirason, a 37-year-old CTO. The two left Amazon at different times and reconnected as cofounders of Tenfali, an AI startup.\n\nThey share the main processes they had to unlearn in order to successfully grow their startup. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nShalini Aggarwal: Andy and I began working together in 2015, after I relocated to the US from India. He was a dev engineer, and I worked on the product and program execution side.\n\nAndy Ratsirason: I joined Amazon for the first time in 2014 because I wanted to be part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem. I always wanted to be an entrepreneur, so I tried to tailor my career to suit that goal. I left Amazon, came back in 2020, and left again in 2023.\n\nAfter I left for the last time, I made multiple pivots in founding a startup. I realized I needed someone else to join my team. Shalini started showing up regularly on my LinkedIn feed, liking and commenting on posts about startups and taking risks, so I reached out to her. She had just left Amazon, and we reunited to cofound Tenafli.\n\nAggarwal: We quickly realized that we took a lot of systems and tools for granted when we were in an enterprise company. The startup world is completely different; here, we have to build from scratch, and there was a lot about our mindset we had to unlearn.\n\nAggarwal: I stayed at Amazon until 2024, and my last nine months were spent working on AI projects, specifically on music recommendations.\n\nRatsirason: In 2023, I was almost three years into my return to Amazon, and I had a choice: either stay comfortable with those Big Tech paychecks or take a leap and launch my own startup. I submitted my resignation in February and then began to think about what was next.\n\nAggarwal: My decision to leave Amazon was more of a gradual process. During the COVID pandemic, my father retired, and we lost my mom. I could see how lonely my father was, and the biggest challenge was how to fill his days. That planted the seed.\n\nThrough working on personalized AI recommendations, I thought of a product that could serve as an AI companion for older adults, providing personalized recommendations and scheduling activities based on their typical daily routines.\n\nMy 50th birthday was coming up, and the AI boom was happening; if I didn't take the leap then, I knew I would never. In September 2024, I put in my two weeks' notice and left Amazon.\n\nRatsirason: At Amazon, I didn't really think about why we were building a product or if people would use it. The 'build-first' mindset meant focusing solely on building a good product, knowing the customer was already there.\n\nA clear moment that this mindset wouldn't work at an early-stage startup came after we spent months building, and launch day arrived, almost nobody showed up organically for a few weeks. That was the wake-up call: shipping isn't the finish line when we didn't have demand.\n\nAfter that, we shifted to doing customer conversations earlier and running small distribution tests, including waitlists, partnerships, and community posts, before over-investing in product.\n\nAggarwal: We applied and were accepted into several startup resource programs, including AWS Activate, Nvidia Inception, and Google's Cloud Credits program.\n\nRatsirason: We received a few thousand in AWS credits, but before we realized it, we lost almost all of the credits in the first two months. We over-provisioned capacity, and during AI testing, we left a few resources running longer than intended, which quietly accumulated costs over time.\n\nOnce we noticed the issue, we set up AWS budget alerts, added cost monitoring, made shutdowns part of our testing checklist, and simplified certain aspects of the architecture to match our stage.\n\nTo reduce costs further, we also bought a small local machine to run some of our AI experiments on, so we only use the cloud when we truly need it for scale, managed services, or production.\n\nAggarwal: The time we save with AI enables us to allocate our energy to attending summits, forums, and programs, where we can learn about the work of others in the field. We also spend more time with prospective customers doing interviews.\n\nRatsirason: We used to spend hours reading long articles and research, and trying to keep up with the latest news in the field. The cycle felt heavy and slow, pulling us away from customer conversations and shipping.\n\nWe now use AI to scan a large set of content, surface the most relevant ideas for us, and summarize the few pieces worth reading. Having to be frugal, we've learned to spend only where learning happens. Talk to users first, then build the smallest thing that can prove value.\n\nRatsirason: AI acts as a junior engineer, handling a lot of the coding for us with the requirements we set up.\n\nAggarwal: It's also taught us where we won't need to scale. I know I don't need to hire a user interface designer. If I understand the requirements of something, I can quickly draft it with the help of AI and receive feedback on it myself.\n\nRatsirason: A few years ago, launching a usable version of our product, Agefully, would have required significantly more capital and head count. We just need two engineers and subscriptions. I'm grateful to be part of this AI era.\n\nAggarwal: We've seen at scale how things work and what processes we can implement to avoid chaos later on. At the same time, the biggest disadvantage has been overcoming the mindset that tools and infrastructure are readily available. Until we learned how to work through that, we weren't allocating our energy properly.\n\nRatsirason: Coming from Amazon, the name itself has some positive weight, but it can also work against us. People might assume that since we worked at a big company, we don't know how to run a small startup because we don't have a lot of resources.\n\nThe hardest part was overcoming the fear of shipping something imperfect. Coming from Big Tech, we were accustomed to high-polish expectations and assumed anything less would turn users away. We learned that in early-stage startups, the real risk isn't rough edges, it's building something people don't need.\n\nDo you have a founder story to share?

    "fullText": "Amazon has stopped more than 1,800 suspected North Korean agents from applying for jobs over the last 20 months, a top executive at the firm has said.\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn, Stephen Schmidt, Amazon's chief security officer, said North Korean nationals had in recent years been attempting to land remote tech roles with companies across the globe.\n\n\"Their objective is typically straightforward: get hired, get paid, and funnel wages back to fund the regime's weapons programs,\" Schmidt wrote.\n\nAmazon has used a combination of AI-powered screening and human verification to detect and block such applications, Schmidt continued.\n\nThe company's AI model searches for connections to around 200 \"high-risk institutions\" and analyzes \"anomalies across applications\" and \"geographic inconsistencies.\"\n\nHuman reviewers then conduct background checks, verify credentials, and carry out interviews, he added.\n\nSchmidt said fraudsters were becoming more \"calculated,\" with many targeting real software engineers in an effort to gain credibility.\n\nOthers attempt to take over dormant LinkedIn accounts or pay for access to existing profiles, he continued.\n\nAI and machine-learning roles have been increasingly targeted due to high demand, he added.\n\n\"Small details give them away,\" Schmidt went on. \"For example, these applicants often format U.S. phone numbers with \"+1\" rather than \"1.\" Alone, this means nothing. Combined with other indicators, it paints a picture.\"\n\nThe operatives often work with \"laptop farms,\" Schmidt said, which are US-based locations that maintain a domestic presence while workers operate remotely from abroad.\n\n\"This isn't Amazon-specific,\" Schmidt added. \"This is likely happening at scale across the industry.\"\n\nIn July, an Arizona woman was sentenced to 102 months in prison for her role in assisting North Korean IT workers in securing remote IT jobs at more than 300 US companies.\n\nThe Justice Department said the laptop farming scheme generated over $17 million in illicit revenue for the woman and Pyongyang.\n\nCrowdStrike's 2025 Threat Hunting Report found that the North Korean remote-worker scheme is a growing threat.\n\nAmazon had detected 27% more North Korea-linked applications quarter over quarter this year, Schmidt said.\n\nIn June, the DOJ said authorities had carried out searches of 29 known or suspected \"laptop farms\" across 16 US states. It said North Korean actors had managed to obtain employment with more than 100 US companies.\n\nThe DOJ did not name the companies but said they included Fortune 500 firms.\n\nThe FBI recommends that businesses scrutinize identity verification documents, verify prior employment and education, and require in-person meetings.",

    "title": "'Fragmented' Microsoft tools undercut efficiency at Amazon and Whole Foods, internal Deloitte review found",
    "description": "Whole Foods' use of Microsoft 365 apps remained disconnected from Amazon, leading to inefficiencies and security concerns, a Deloitte review found.",
    "fullText": "It's been more than eight years since Amazon bought Whole Foods, but the two companies still haven't aligned their setup for the Microsoft software their employees use.\n\nThat disconnect was flagged in an 8-week Deloitte review of Whole Foods' use of Microsoft 365 apps earlier this year, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nDeloitte found that Whole Foods relies on \"fragmented\" Microsoft toolsets, has loose security and data-retention practices, and employs a complex user-management setup — all of which contribute to inefficiencies and lower productivity when working with Amazon employees.\n\nThe consulting firm recommended a 24-month integration plan that would first move Whole Foods' corporate employees onto Amazon's backend system, followed by its frontline workers. The phased approach would ensure a \"smooth transition for users and minimal disruption to business processes,\" while generating cost savings, the document said.\n\nThe review, completed in May, highlights Amazon's ongoing challenges in integrating Whole Foods. Since acquiring the chain in 2017, the company has struggled to scale the business and integrate operations, resulting in frequent reorganizations and shifting strategic priorities.\n\nNow, under new grocery chief Jason Buechel, Amazon is making a renewed push to knit Whole Foods more closely with its Amazon Fresh division. Buechel, who is both Whole Foods' CEO and Amazon's VP of grocery, has been championing a unified \"One Grocery\" strategy and a \"flying formation\" model aimed at bringing the two organizations into tighter alignment.\n\nIt also underscores Amazon's dependence on cloud rival Microsoft for core productivity software such as word processing and spreadsheets. In 2023, Amazon committed to spending at least $1 billion over five years on Microsoft 365, Business Insider previously reported. The company has long struggled to develop its own business applications and, earlier this year, formally adopted Zoom in place of its Chime meeting app.\n\nAmazon's spokesperson, Jamie Forrest, told Business Insider that Amazon has a \"successful and growing\" grocery business with more than 150 million customers. Over the years, the company has made changes to \"simplify ways of working and better collaborate across teams,\" Forrest added.\n\n\"We're bringing our corporate grocery teams closer together with a consistent employee experience, including aligning to the same technology systems and tools, to make it easier to collaborate and innovate on behalf of our customers,\" Forrest said in a statement.\n\nThe Deloitte team collaborated with Whole Foods employees to evaluate the current landscape and develop a future roadmap for the company's use of Microsoft 365.\n\nUltimately, Deloitte identified six \"key themes\" that must be addressed to streamline the business, including:\n\nDeloitte recommended a phased integration plan that first migrates Whole Foods' corporate staff to Amazon's backend technology, followed by frontline workers.\n\nUnder the plan, corporate workers would transition early to Amazon's tenant for email and OneDrive, while more complex systems, such as SharePoint and Teams, would shift gradually to allow for testing and re-permissioning involving both Whole Foods and Amazon identities. All workloads would eventually be consolidated under Amazon, enabling Whole Foods to cut duplicative licensing costs and align with Amazon's security standards.\n\n\"As applications and services transition, they will seamlessly integrate under a unified tenant, fostering streamlined interactions between WFM and Amazon employees,\" the document stated. \"Aligning with Amazon's security protocols and guidelines will significantly enhance WFM's organizational security posture, ensuring adherence to superior industry standards.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether Amazon and Whole Foods adopted the full set of recommendations. But the gradual shift that Deloitte recommended mirrors Amazon's broader workforce consolidation effort with Whole Foods.\n\nAs Business Insider previously reported, Amazon began moving Whole Foods' corporate employees onto its own systems earlier this year. Now, under an internal project codenamed \"Cremini,\" Amazon plans to absorb the entire 100,000-plus workforce of Whole Foods, including frontline employees.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Tasha Huo and I don't make it a minute into our conversation before we start gushing about wizards — and that's how I know I'm talking to a true Critical Role fan.\n\nHuo is the showrunner of \"The Mighty Nein,\" Critical Role's second animated series with Prime Video. \"The Mighty Nein\" follows the success of \"The Legend of Vox Machina,\" the series for which Critical Role raised over $11.3 million in Kickstarter seed funding in 2019. Now, Huo, a longtime viewer of the show, is the series' creative writing powerhouse.\n\nHuo, who's based in Los Angeles, said she first started playing \"Dungeons & Dragons\" as a kid, but hadn't touched the game for years. In her adult life, a friend wanted her to join his \"D&D\" campaign and recommended a Twitch stream that he said would help her understand how the game worked.\n\nThat turned out to be Critical Role. At the time, the company's eight cofounders were in the midst of their second long-running campaign. And the stream that Huo watched, so many years ago now, has taken on an animated series form in \"The Mighty Nein.\"\n\n\"I was absolutely hooked. I was like, this is all I can watch now, and it's all I can listen to in the car. And I binged it, which took years,\" Huo said of the 141-episode campaign.\n\nSeveral industry contacts recommended Huo to Critical Role in 2021 when they were looking for a showrunner.\n\nHuo started work on the show in November 2022 as part of the Prime Video team and oversaw its writing until its release this fall, working 9-to-5 daily with three other writers and a writer's assistant. She has an MFA in screenwriting from Boston University and has written for other shows, including \"The Witcher: Blood Origin,\" released in 2022, and \"Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft,\" released in 2024.\n\n\"It started with me having a lot of conversations with Critical Role. I met with Sam Riegel first, and then Travis Willingham and Matt Mercer, and we all just nerded out,\" Huo said. Riegel, a cofounder, oversees much of Critical Role's animation business alongside the team's CEO, Willingham. Mercer is the crew's chief creative officer.\n\n\"It was kind of like coming home. It was just all these pieces coming together that started over a love of 'D&D,'\" Huo added\n\nHuo said conversations in the Critical Role writer's room involved many talks with the eight cofounders about their campaign characters. She wanted to find the best way to condense the hundreds of hours of campaign stream time into eight, 44-minute episodes.\n\n\"The conversations always started with all of us in a room talking about the characters, talking about why they felt the way they did or why they did the thing they did,\" Huo said.\n\nHuo says these character conversations helped her figure out what the first season's arc would be.\n\n\"Every day we would come into the Critical Role offices. And we had a giant whiteboard up with magnets, and we'd come up with ideas of like, 'Okay, if we know what the season arc is, now let's start thinking about some turning points within the episode,'\" Huo said.\n\nHaving so many hours of source material also meant that Huo and the writing team had to make tough decisions about what to focus on in the first season. Huo said it quickly became clear to them that the plotline for cofounder Liam O'Brien's character, the wizard Caleb Widogast, needed to be covered first for the rest of the show to make sense.\n\n\"A lot of his backstory is really linked to a larger story that we were telling,\" Huo said.\n\nThe season's final cut also included several tidbits of information that were not in the original Twitch stream.\n\nHuo also got to live the Critical Role fan dream and suss out all the juicy details from Mercer that had never aired on stream — including the ins and outs of how the season's key antagonists, the Volstrucker wizards, worked.\n\n\"We get to tell a side spy show within 'The Mighty Nein,' and that's really gratifying because you sit Matt down and he has all the answers already, so you just mine from all of the great stuff that he has and fill the story up with all of those things,\" Huo said.\n\nI asked Huo how one might go about landing a dream writing job, and she had two tips.\n\n\"I would say the first thing is to dedicate yourself to the craft. Always be writing, even when there's negativity and there's rejection, just keep going. I think the number one reason people don't make it is because they give up before someone else,\" Huo said.\n\nAs for her second piece of advice for writers: \"Don't be afraid of what you love.\"\n\n\"I remember when I met with Sam Riegel, I was so embarrassed. I thought, 'Oh no, I fangirled too much when I talked to him,'\" Huo said. \"And it turns out that's exactly what they wanted to hear, from someone who really, really loved the show.\"\n\nDo you work on the Critical Role franchise and have a story to share?

    "title": "Nvidia memo says Capital One discussed alternatives to AWS as AI costs could 'get out of hand'",
    "description": "Several AWS customers have complained about rising cloud costs in the AI era. Capital One is the latest, and one of the biggest.",
    "fullText": "Capital One is concerned about AI costs rising via its cloud-computing relationship with Amazon and may be looking for alternatives, according to an internal Nvidia document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nIn the document, an Nvidia employee wrote that the chip giant talked with Capital One about AI infrastructure alternatives to Amazon Web Services, as the bank was \"looking to control costs.\"\n\nThe Nvidia staffer was recapping discussions with Capital One in an internal email after meeting representatives from the bank at a recent tech conference.\n\n\"They see their need for GPUs and reasoning models growing and the costs in AWS will soon get out of hand,\" the Nvidia employee wrote, referring to Capital One.\n\nNvidia and Capital One discussed \"AI factory and neo-clouds,\" according to the email. An AI factory is an in-house data center that a company can build to train and run AI models as an alternative to renting compute from a third party. Financial institutions can use this infrastructure for tasks such as fraud detection, customer support, and algorithmic trading, according to Nvidia.\n\nNeoclouds are upstart cloud providers, often powered by Nvidia hardware, that focus on AI workloads, whereas AWS supports a much broader range of computing needs. Top neocloud players include CoreWeave, Lambda, Crusoe, and Nebius. Nvidia has been working closely with several of these players, in part to reduce its reliance on established cloud giants as customers.\n\nThe Capital One situation underscores a key dynamic in the AI boom. Companies are racing to adopt generative AI but also trying to mitigate rising cloud costs. This new technology has great promise, but developing and running AI models and AI applications can be expensive.\n\nLarge companies also regularly assess their cloud spending, including varying setups that increasingly incorporate multiple providers. Forty-three percent of companies use more than two public cloud providers, according to a recent RBC Capital report.\n\n\"We continue to be committed to AWS as our predominant strategic cloud partner,\" a Capital One spokesperson wrote in a statement. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\n\"Our pricing philosophy is to work relentlessly to take cost out of our own cost structure and to pass those savings back to our AWS customers in the form of lower prices,\" an AWS spokesperson said. \"It's easy to lower prices, it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices, and at AWS we work really hard at that.\"\n\nCapital One isn't the only company taking issue with AWS costs. Business Insider's Eugene Kim reported in October that AI startups are increasingly delaying traditional AWS spend in favor of AI model and developer tools, according to internal Amazon documents from March and July.\n\nThe documents said that 90% of startups in Radical Ventures' portfolio were building primarily on rival clouds due to AWS costs. Amazon also noted internally that there was increasing demand from customers for neocloud providers, which let them rent GPU power in small chunks and only pay for what they use.\n\nWhen that story published in October, an AWS spokesperson said Business Insider was \"using old data to reach outdated conclusions,\" noting that \"AWS remains the top choice for startups to build because we offer the best core services as well as the most innovative and powerful generative AI offerings.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "AI Security Institute report finds most common type of AI tech used was general purpose assistants such as ChatGPT and Amazon Alexa\n\nA third of UK citizens have used artificial intelligence for emotional support, companionship or social interaction, according to the government’s AI security body.\n\nThe AI Security Institute (AISI) said nearly one in 10 people used systems like chatbots for emotional purposes on a weekly basis, and 4% daily.\n\nAISI called for further research, citing the death this year of the US teenager Adam Raine, who killed himself after discussing suicide with ChatGPT.\n\n“People are increasingly turning to AI systems for emotional support or social interaction,” AISI said in its first Frontier AI Trends report. “While many users report positive experiences, recent high-profile cases of harm underline the need for research into this area, including the conditions under which harm could occur, and the safeguards that could enable beneficial use.”\n\nAISI based its research on a representative survey of 2,028 UK participants. It found the most common type of AI used for emotional purposes was “general purpose assistants” such as ChatGPT, accounting for nearly six out of 10 uses, followed by voice assistants including Amazon Alexa.\n\nIt also highlighted a Reddit forum dedicated to discussing AI companions on the CharacterAI platform. It showed that, whenever there were outages on the site, there were large numbers of posts showing symptoms of withdrawal such as anxiety, depression and restlessness.\n\nThe report included AISI research suggesting chatbots can sway people’s political opinions, with the most persuasive AI models delivering “substantial” amounts of inaccurate information in the process.\n\nAISI examined more than 30 unnamed cutting-edge models, thought to include those developed by ChatGPT startup OpenAI, Google and Meta. It found AI models were doubling their performance in some areas every eight months.\n\nLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.\n\nAISI added that AI systems are now up to 90% better than PhD-level experts at providing troubleshooting advice for laboratory experiments. It said improvements in knowledge on chemistry and biology were “well beyond PhD-level expertise”.\n\nIt also highlighted the models’ ability to browse online and autonomously find sequences necessary for designing DNA molecules called plasmids that are useful in areas such as genetic engineering.\n\nTests for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control, showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.\n\nHowever, no models have shown a spontaneous attempt to replicate or hide their capabilities, and AISI said any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.\n\nAnother safety concern known as “sandbagging”, where models hide their strengths in evaluations, was also covered by AISI. It said some systems can sandbag when prompted to do so, but this has not happened spontaneously during tests.\n\nIt found significant progress in AI safeguards, particularly in hampering attempts to create biological weapons. In two tests conducted six months apart, the first test took 10 minutes to “jailbreak” an AI system – or force it to give an unsafe answer related to biological misuse – but the second test took more than seven hours, indicating models had become much safer in a short space of time.\n\nResearch also showed autonomous AI agents being used for high-stakes activities such as asset transfers.\n\nIt said AI systems are competing with or even surpassing human experts already in a number of domains, making it “plausible” in the coming years that artificial general intelligence can be achieved, which is the term for systems that can perform most intellectual tasks at the same level as a human. AISI described the pace of development as “extraordinary”.\n\nRegarding agents, or systems that can carry out multi-step tasks without intervention, AISI said its evaluations showed a “steep rise in the length and complexity of tasks AI can complete without human guidance”.",

    "fullText": "The executive who led Amazon's efforts to build top AI models is out.\n\nRohit Prasad, SVP and head scientist, is leaving two years after launching a new Artificial General Intelligence group.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy said Prasad plans to depart at the end of the year. Prasad was elevated to report directly to Jassy in 2023 to lead the AGI team, which was tasked with developing Amazon's \"most ambitious\" AI models, Business Insider reported at the time.\n\nSince then, Prasad helped launch Amazon's Nova family of AI models. Although Nova models earned some praise for their efficiency, they still trail frontier models such as OpenAI's GPT offerings, Anthropic's Claude Opus, and Google's Gemini.\n\nAs part of the shake-up, Amazon is creating a new organization under Peter DeSantis, AWS's SVP of Utility Computing, Jassy said. The group will oversee Amazon's AGI and AI model initiatives as well as its silicon chip and quantum computing efforts.\n\nJassy also said that Pieter Abbeel, the co-founder of robotics startup Covariant, who joined Amazon last year, will now lead the company's frontier AI model research team.\n\nPrasad's departure is the latest in a series of leadership changes at AWS. Over the past year, the company has seen several executives depart, including VP of AI Matt Wood and VP of generative AI Vasi Philomin, while bringing in new talent such as former Microsoft executive Julia White as chief marketing officer.\n\nAWS also recently hired David Richardson as VP of AgentCore and Joe Hellerstein as Vice President and Distinguished Scientist, and added Chet Kapoor as VP of security services and observability.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer told Business Insider. The deal would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, he said.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is the prospective tenant that withdrew funding from Fermi America's massive data-center project, sending the developer's stock plummeting earlier this month, Business Insider has learned.\n\nIn September, Fermi, which is developing an 11-gigawatt data-center campus in the Texas Panhandle, said it had agreed to a nonbinding letter of intent with an investment-grade tenant to anchor the project. The tenant would take the first gigawatt of power across 12 facilities.\n\nOn Friday, December 12, Fermi's stock plunged by nearly half after a securities filing said an unnamed prospective partner had canceled a $150 million advance to begin construction, known as an Advance in Aid of Construction Agreement, or AICA. The cancellation followed the end of an exclusivity period.\n\nAmazon is that tenant, Toby Neugebauer, Fermi's billionaire CEO, confirmed in a December 15 phone call with Business Insider, discussing the talks that led to the cancellation. The tech giant has been negotiating the deal, which would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, Neugebauer said.\n\n\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Neugebauer said.\n\nNeugebauer said the talks between Fermi and the tenant remain constructive, and that the ending of the AICA didn't indicate any breakdown in conversation.\n\n\"It's just a normal negotiation,\" he said. \"Their issue was spending money after the exclusive period had ended.\"\n\nNeugebauer said he wasn't worried about the talks taking too long. \"It's a big deal,\" he said. \"Big deals take longer.\"\n\nLisa Levandowski, a spokesperson for Amazon, declined to comment.\n\nFermi America's Panhandle project ranks among the most ambitious attempts yet to meet the surging energy demands of the data centers fueling the AI boom. The company intends to bring 11 gigawatts of new power online over the next decade-plus with a mix of power from the grid, natural gas, and nuclear sources.\n\nThe company went public in September, pricing its shares at $21 to raise more than $680 million.\n\nDubbed Project Matador, the development relies on a 99-year ground lease with the Texas Tech University System. That agreement is dependent on a signed letter of intent between Fermi America and a tenant.\n\nThe December 12 filing said that none of the $150 million construction advance had been used and that the negotiations were ongoing. The letter of intent remains in force.\n\nAnalysts at Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note published December 12 that they had spoken to Fermi America's management and learned that, per the company, the anchor tenant \"tried to make last-minute changes to the agreement pricing that were unacceptable to\" Fermi.\n\nAmazon is the second company to be linked to the project. In October, Neugebauer told the Amarillo City Council that Palantir, the software company known for its police and government contracts, had taken an interest in the site.\n\n\"I just finished with Palantir, which is our nation's tip of the spear in the AI war,\" Neugebauer said during the October 28 meeting. \"They'll be here Thursday.\"\n\nThe Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said in their note that management indicated that they were \"active\" with two additional tenants, and in dialogue with another four.\n\nFermi America was founded less than a year ago by Neugebauer, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Perry's son Griffin. The IPO valued the company at nearly $14 billion.\n\nA recent slump in the company's shares has brought its valuation to below $6 billion.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "OpenAI seeking to strike latest deal in its efforts to pay for huge spending on datacentres\n\nAmazon is in talks to invest more than $10bn (£7.5bn) in OpenAI, in the latest funding deal being struck by the startup behind ChatGPT.\n\nIf it goes ahead, the market valuation of OpenAI could rise above $500bn, according to The Information, a tech news site that revealed the negotiations.\n\nAmazon, which is best known as an online retailer, is also the world’s largest datacentre provider and its investment would help OpenAI pay for its commitments to rent capacity from cloud computing companies – including Amazon.\n\nOpenAI said last month it would spend $38bn on capacity from Amazon Web Services – the company’s datacentre arm – over seven years. The Information said that OpenAI planned to use Amazon’s Trainium chips, which compete with Nvidia and Google’s chips. It also reported that Amazon’s financing could lead to a broader fundraising round with other investors.\n\nOpenAI’s spending commitment on compute – the chips and servers that power its chatbot – is $1.4tn over the next eight years, a figure far in excess of its reported $13bn in annual revenues.\n\nAs a result, the lossmaking company has been seeking further funding and has converted its main business into a for-profit corporation. Its main longtime backer, Microsoft, has taken a stake of roughly 27% in a deal that valued OpenAI at $500bn.\n\nOpenAI is also considering an initial public offering – selling its shares to the general public – in a move that could value the company at up to $1tn, according to Reuters.\n\nOther deals struck by OpenAI this year include Oracle spending $300bn on building datacentres in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI is expected to pay back roughly the same amount to use the sites.\n\nIn another transaction with Nvidia, OpenAI will pay in cash for chips and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares.\n\nOpenAI announced on Tuesday that it had hired the former UK chancellor George Osborne to develop relationships with governments around the world and broker national-level AI projects.\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, has declared a “code red” staff alert to lead a fightback against competitors led by Google, whose update of its Gemini AI tool gave it an edge over rivals including ChatGPT.\n\nThe Amazon talks reportedly include discussing commercial opportunities and selling a corporate version of ChatGPT to the online retailer.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment. Amazon has been approached for comment.",

    "fullText": "It's human nature to reach for the shiny object in front of you — but Monday.com's CMO says it's worth pausing before you accept the first job offer that comes along.\n\nHarris Beber has acted as the CMO of Vimeo, Global CMO of Google Workspace, and also held marketing executive positions at other companies including Amazon. He's no stranger to changing jobs — and he believes switching roles can be the right move when the work no longer feels fulfilling.\n\nIn the past, Beber told Business Insider that he's explored new roles in times when he was doing really well at work but feeling unfulfilled. That feeling can't last forever, he said.\n\n\"Eventually your work will suffer, your performance will suffer, and it doesn't end well for anyone,\" Beber said.\n\nTo avoid acting out of desperation or necessity, Beber said he tries to map out his next role before he gets to the point of needing a new job. The CMO said it's important to know your criteria for success when thinking about what's next.\n\n\"What is really important to you? What are your non-starters? And if you can look at those objectively, then when you have opportunities, you can measure it against something objective,\" Beber said.\n\nHe said he's used 3 P's to determine if his last few roles were the right fit: people, product, and position.\n\nIn regards to the first P, Beber said he tries to evaluate whether the people he's going to work with are right for him. He said it's \"not easy to get up every day\" and work with people you don't like or who don't treat others well.\n\nIn one job, Beber said he worked for a difficult leader who yelled, \"put intense pressure\" on the team, and treated him and others poorly. He said he would never work in that kind of environment again.\n\nBeyond working with respectful coworkers, Beber said it's also important to make sure that the people you work alongside have complementary skills that will help you work well together.\n\nIf you're a marketer, when it comes to evaluating the product you're selling, Beber said, it's important to understand the user base and product offerings.\n\n\"Do you care about it? Does it excite you? It's really hard to sell something to other people if you don't understand it or aren't excited by it,\" the CMO said.\n\nBeber said he made the mistake of once taking the wrong role at a sports tech startup. He said he really liked the people, but he's \"not a sports person,\" and didn't understand the product. Beber said he ultimately didn't find happiness in that job.\n\nWhen it comes to evaluating the position, Beber said he wants to find a role where he feels aligned and can add value to the company.\n\n\"Is what I'm great at? What the company needs?\" Beber said.\n\nBeber said he's felt the most fulfilled in his career when those three criteria line up. People are \"really good at selling themselves\" on why an opportunity seems perfect in the moment, he said, which is why measuring the offer against something objective is critical.\n\nWhen someone makes you a job offer, \"they're going to tell you every reason why you're perfect for the role and why it's going to be great,\" Beber said. \"But as anyone goes into a new role, very rarely is it exactly what you thought it would be.\"",

Users can choose a channel and start watching, with the Reels playing automatically.\n\nInstagram for TV is part of the platform's ongoing effort to adapt to the ways users are connecting via the app. The company said in a press release that it has heard from its community that \"watching Reels together is more fun,\" so the product was designed with that social aspect in mind.\n\nTessa Lyons, VP of product at Instagram, told Business Insider that the team heard from users who were finding ways to cast their Reels to the TV so they could watch them with friends.\n\n\"People already want to get together and connect with each other over Reels on the TV,\" she said, adding that this allows them to actually share with friends. \"Not just DMing them, but actually be together enjoying them.\"\n\nLyons said she personally felt the need for this feature when she realized, while on the couch watching TV with her husband, she was often actually watching Reels on her phone instead.\n\nInstagram for TV is in a testing phase, with plans to eventually expand to more devices and countries. Instagram said this early test is designed to learn which features are best for shared viewing on a TV screen.\n\nFuture features could include using your phone as a remote, more intuitive ways to surf channels, and channels that combine your and your friends' interests into one shared feed, like Instagram's Blend feature.\n\nUp to five Instagram accounts can be connected to the Amazon Fire TV device. Once you click into your account, Instagram will automatically group Reels into a channel based on your interests.\n\nLyons said Instagram's North Star has always been \"helping people connect with their friends over creativity,\" adding that the goal has remained even as the platform and the way people use it have changed.\n\n\"The way in which people share evolves,\" she said. \"I think that's natural.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "iRobot, the maker of the Roomba robot vacuum cleaner, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this week after years of mounting financial struggles and a failed $1.4 billion acquisition deal with Amazon.\n\nThe 35-year-old company once reigned supreme in the world of robotic vacuums, but its dominance waned amid rising competition from lower-cost rivals and weakening consumer demand.\n\nHere's a look back at how this once mighty, pioneering robotics company arrived at this moment.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by three roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — Colin Angle, Helen Greiner, and Rodney Brooks — who had a \"vision of making practical robots a reality,\" the company says on its website.\n\niRobot focused on designing robots for space-related research and military use in its early years.\n\nIn 1998, the Massachusetts-based company won a contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA, to build a tactical mobile robot. This led to the development of iRobot's PackBot, which was later used in search operations at Manhattan's Ground Zero following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nIn 2002, iRobot had its consumer breakthrough with its debut of the Roomba, its iconic self-cleaning disc-shaped vacuum.\n\nOver the next two decades, the company went on to release dozens of Roomba models. It has sold over 50 million models globally since.\n\niRobot went public in November 2005 with its IPO priced at $24 per share. It began trading its shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol IRBT.\n\niRobot saw its annual revenue peak in 2021 at $1.56 billion, but sales have been falling ever since.\n\nSales dropped, in part, thanks to stiffer competition from Chinese rivals like Dreame, Roborock, and Ecovacs, as well as other brands such as Shark and Samsung.\n\nAmazon agreed to buy iRobot in 2022 for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction, but the deal collapsed two years later with the companies saying there was \"no path to regulatory approval in the European Union.\"\n\nThe same day the companies announced that the proposed merger was scrapped in January 2024, iRobot cut 31% of its staff, and Angle, iRobot's cofounder and longtime CEO, also stepped down.\n\nIn a March 2025 earnings report, iRobot said there was \"substantial doubt\" about the company's ability to continue.\n\niRobot attempted to find a new buyer after its deal with Amazon collapsed. In an October 2025 regulatory filing, it said the last remaining potential acquirer pulled out \"following a lengthy period of exclusive negotiations.\"\n\nThe company warned that without fresh funding, it \"may be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations and would likely seek bankruptcy protection.\"\n\niRobot filed for Chapter 11 on December 14 and said the company would be acquired by its China-based primary contract manufacturer and lender, Picea Robotics, through a court-supervised process. Under the deal, iRobot would be taken private.\n\nThe company said it expects to continue to operate as normal and does not anticipate any disruption to its core operations, including its app and ongoing product support.\n\n\"The transaction will strengthen our financial position and will help deliver continuity for our consumers, customers, and partners,\" said iRobot CEO Gary Cohen.",

He was the original creative director on Rainbow Six Siege and comes back to Ubisoft alongside Alex Parizeau, the former managing director of Ubisoft Toronto.\nMarch of Giants is a 4v4 tactical multiplayer free-to-play MOBA inspired by technology from the early 1900s. The game combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat. It's called March of Giants because players take on the role of a giant who is controlling troops on the battlefield.",

    "description": "Meta is testing an Instagram TV app, starting with Amazon devices.",
    "fullText": "As I write this, I'm coming off a lunch break that lasted a little too long because I couldn't stop watching YouTube Shorts on my TV. And if Instagram Reels are your own vertical video poison—and you own an Amazon Fire TV device—you can now do the same. Starting today, you can download the new Instagram for TV app to watch Reels on your big screen via a dedicated interface that should be way more natural than simply casting the mobile app from your phone.\n\nCurrently exclusive to Amazon devices, the Instagram for TV app supports up to five accounts and comes with full functionality for searching for Reels and profiles, as well as liking Reels and browsing comments or reactions (although text posts and photo posts are not included). Unlike on the standard mobile feed, Amazon says \"Reels are organized into channels tuned to your interests,\" which you can see from a horizontal home screen.\n\nThese channels are somewhat similar to the YouTube Shorts interface that's baked into the standard YouTube TV app, showing you a small selection of shorts you can choose from based on a thumbnail. Examples include \"For you\" and \"Popular with Friends,\" but you're also still able to swipe past any Reel to your heart's content, and let the algorithm take you for a ride. A post from Meta also says channels could include Reels tailored to a specific topics that match your interests, like \"sports highlights\" or \"hidden travel gems,\" although the company hasn't provided any screenshots or videos showing this off quite yet.\n\nAccording to Meta, the new app is currently \"an early test.\" It's starting with U.S.-based Amazon devices, and the company says it will \"expand to more devices and countries\" as it learns more (Amazon also says it's the \"first\" company to get the app, implying others will get their own versions in the future).\n\nCurrently, the Instagram for TV app is available in the Amazon Appstore for the following devices:\n\nFire TV Stick 4K Max (1st and 2nd Gen)\n\nIn addition to adding channels to the Reels experience, Meta says that future updates may also add ways to use your phone as a remote, share feeds with friends, and explore \"a more intuitive way to channel surf.\"\n\nInstagram for TV leaves TikTok as the last major short form video platform without a dedicated TV app, although The Information reported earlier this Summer that TikTok is looking to catch up soon.\n\nWhile official Instagram for TV support is currently limited to Amazon devices, that doesn't mean you're out of luck if you don't have a Fire TV stick or display. To watch Instagram Reels on your TV without using the Instagram for TV app, open Instagram Reels on your phone and start browsing. Next, pull up your phone's quick settings menu by swiping down from the top-right corner.\n\nOn iOS, search for the screen mirroring button (which looks like two overlapping screens), and on Android, search for a button that says something like \"Cast\" (it will vary depending on your device). Tap it to see any compatible wireless screen mirroring devices nearby, which will let you view the mobile Instagram app on a TV screen, and even send audio over with it. It's not foolproof—my LG OLED TV works with iOS Screen Mirroring but not Pixel casting—but it's worth a shot.",

    "title": "RTO mandates are running into a space problem",
    "description": "Companies like AT&T, Amazon, JPMorgan, and Instagram have a RTO problem: there's not enough places for workers to sit.",
    "fullText": "Your mileage may vary on Instagram's recent corporate culture updates (to the extent you care at all). Fewer meetings: excellent. Faster decisions: great. Return-to-office five days a week: woof, but such is life. Return-to-office five days a week when there aren't enough places for people to sit: What??? At least Instagram chief Adam Mosseri is aware of the issue — in a memo to staff, he said New York employees get a pass on the butts-in-seats mandate until the company figures out where all those butts will go. The timeline is TBD.\n\nAfter the pandemic-driven wave of remote work, many employees are being dragged, kicking and screaming, back into the office. For workers at companies such as Amazon, JPMorgan, and Starbucks, the perpetual workday-in-your-pajamas party is over. The odd wrinkle is that in some cases, it's not just employees who aren't ready to be back at work every day. Their employers aren't ready for it, either, at least logistically. They're telling people to come to the office without having the actual space for them to be there. So, workers are competing for desks, setting up shop in common areas, or refusing to show up altogether until their employers have a more well-thought-out plan. It's emblematic of the broader issues surrounding RTO mandates: Many companies are implementing them without a solid logic as to how or why and alienating their employees — intentionally or not — in the process.\n\nMultiple big-name companies have had some small-time whoopsie daisies on back-to-office space constraints.\n\nIn late 2024, AT&T acknowledged in a memo to employees that they would not offer \"one-for-one seating per employee\" as they were called back in. At the time, employees told Business Insider that workers were filling up hallways or hanging out in the cafeteria in order to check the attendance box. Around the same time, Amazon wound up delaying its RTO ask for some employees because their spots weren't ready. Not only were there not enough desks, but workers also complained that offices and meeting rooms were lacking in chairs.\n\nEarlier this year, JPMorgan employees required to come back found themselves in a sort of Hunger Games situation for spots, showing up extra early and leaving behind possessions to mark their spots and signing on from vacation to try to book scarce desk space. On Reddit, some employees described the situation as \"pure chaos,\" and complained of being unable to accomplish work because \"half the morning is spent on desk f***ery.\" One JPMorgan employee told me that they often find themselves seated far away from the rest of their team because someone else reserved their regular spot, and there are often lines for the women's bathroom at the New York office where they work.\n\nHow much office space is needed and what to do with it is a perpetual conundrum. Just look at all the hate for open-office floor plans. But the pandemic added more complications to an already complicated situation. As the RTO wave has picked up momentum, space has become a significant issue at many companies, both large and small, including giant federal agencies. So what gives?\n\nSome of it is simply a result of poor planning, explains Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work. Decisions are made at the executive level without proper consultation with facilities personnel, who have detailed information on desks and seating. \"It's not as easy as adding up people and comparing to desks, as it matters which cities and offices they are in,\" he says in an email. \"Kind of like airlines that some flights may be overbooked and others half-empty.\"\n\nSome of the shortages may be on purpose. Strict RTO mandates are often viewed, at least in part, as a soft layoff — companies expect some level of attrition when they force people back, even if they won't openly admit it. \"Having insufficient seating is all part of the plan,\" Bloom says. \"If you want a 10% head count reduction, you only need seating for 90% of the folks.\"\n\nBrian Elliott, the CEO of Work Forward, a future of work think tank and consultancy, says that when executives started to think about bringing people back to the office in about 2021, many were surprised to learn how low the percentage of their workforce actually showing up on a given day had been pre-2020, because of sick time, vacations, workers visiting customers, etc. \"So your average CFO looks at this and goes, 'It's a 60% utilized asset on average. Why am I doing assigned seating? Why not go to hoteling and hot desking?'\" Elliott says. Add in the belief that at least some sort of remote work would stick around (especially as companies offered it as a perk to attract workers in a tight labor market), and many companies decided to downsize their overall office footprint to save some cash. Now, as businesses decide they want everyone back in full-time, they're realizing they axed too many desks.\n\nSome companies are moving in the other direction, and are on the hunt for more spacious offices. But that process takes time, and economic uncertainty has leaders nervous to go too big. Commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE says economic jitters, high interest rates, and slow growth in in-person jobs has been somewhat of a drag on office leasing activity this year, but the overall trend is up: A growing majority of its office occupants expect to maintain or expand their space over the next three years, while the share anticipating downsizing is steadily decreasing.\n\n\"Companies are taking more spaces, so clearly, they are very comfortable in expansionary mode,\" says Henry Chin, global head of research at CBRE.\n\nThat doesn't mean employees should expect to be drowning in spacious offices anytime soon — businesses are driving toward higher people-to-desk ratios, not lower. So instead of a single assigned desk for every person, there are multiple people sharing. Per CBRE, the most common ratio today is 1-1.49 employees per seat, and the plan is to up it. \"Ultimately, they want to have the higher ratio, that two or three people share a desk,\" Chin says.\n\nIn other words, however you feel about hotel desking, you might want to get used to it.\n\nThe RTO battle in America is proving to be quite the push-and-pull. Remote work is falling, but it hasn't gone away: According to Bloom's tracker, about 25% of work is being done from home in the US, compared to 62% in the spring of 2020, the height of the pandemic, and well under 10% prior to the lockdowns. And just because companies ask workers to come back doesn't mean they're all complying — there's a delta between what employers are asking, and employees are giving, RTO-wise. As the job market weakens, employees may be inclined to give in and commute more. You want your boss to see you enough that they at least feel a little guilty when they fire you.\n\nThese space-related headaches are reflective of broader questions about where and how it's best for people to work, and what sort of planning needs to be put into it. Some executives seem to be knee-jerk demanding people come back in without considering whether that's how their teams work best, or whether the infrastructure can handle it. A five-day-a-week office mandate isn't super helpful if teams are located all over the country and everyone's just sitting on video calls all day. Some companies are discovering they need more small meeting rooms, not just a few large ones, so people can gather if they are in the same place. And some are falling short on basic blocking and tackling — having working WiFi, or supplying sufficient monitors and equipment. In the internet age, it's a little tough to get work done when you don't have the internet itself, or a keyboard or a mouse.\n\nEmployers may be \"conflating productivity and effectiveness with proximity\" in insisting people show up full-time, explains Melissa Daimler, a corporate culture consultant. \"If I can see you and I know that you're working, then I feel good about how productive we are as a company.\" Much of the issue comes down to trust — businesses feeling confident that their people will get the work done when they're in the office collaborating and when they're at home for the day. \"It takes an extra kind of set of planning skills and a system that you put in place as a company and a team,\" she says.\n\nThe space problem is one that companies should fix, whether they actually will is another question. Your employees aren't going to love the return of long commutes and sad salad desk lunches, whatever you do, but they're probably going to be even more annoyed if, at the end of that commute, they find themselves eating that sad salad on the floor in the hallway, seated next to their laptop.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "\"Mighty Nein\" is the Critical Role crew's second animated series project with Amazon.",
    "fullText": "The eight cofounders of the nerdworld business Critical Role came roaring back to Prime Video with the November debut of \"The Mighty Nein.\"\n\nThe business's eight cofounders first started out streaming their home \"Dungeons & Dragons\" game on Twitch. Then, in 2019, CR raised seed funding of over $11.3 million to create the animated series \"The Legend of Vox Machina.\"\n\n\"The Mighty Nein,\" based on their second Twitch-streamed \"D&D\" campaign, is their second animated series on Prime Video.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider in November, the cofounders outlined some of the biggest challenges they faced — and the lessons they learned — making the show.\n\n\"The largest challenge was trying to figure out how we were going to reorganize, and how we introduced the world,\" Critical Role CEO Travis Willingham said.\n\nConverting a 141-episode campaign into a show for Prime Video meant covering lots of on-stream ground, Willingham said. The team had to make a \"massive shift\" in how characters and plot points were introduced.\n\n\"For us, the livestream campaign was so good at sort of feeding one little nugget at a time, and the world got bigger and bigger and bigger. We thought it was far more effective to just hit you with the larger pieces at play and let those things sort of inform the characters and the storylines as you go along,\" Willingham added.\n\nWillingham said these hints set the stage for more developments down the road.\n\n\"We are going to sort of peel back the layers of that onion as we go along,\" Willingham said. \"But we are certainly taking our time and saving things for season two as well. So we're not in a rush.\"\n\nCofounder Sam Riegel told Business Insider that the crew's longtime game master, Matthew Mercer, had created an \"incredible continent filled with politics and socioeconomic strife and war, and ruin, and religious exploration.\"\n\n\"To show all of the antagonists, the villains, the political intrigue that's going on around our characters, we needed a whole other plot line to show what was going on in the background,\" Riegel said.\n\nRiegel added that another key challenge with the \"Mighty Nein\" was the complexity of some of the main characters' backstories.\n\n\"We don't want to throw all those backstories in the audience's face right at the top, but we do want to tease out that they come with baggage and trauma and issues that they have to work through,\" Riegel said.\n\n\"Luckily, we were afforded hourlong episodes in which to do so, and I think it paints a rich tapestry,\" Riegel said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mercer wove in information and plot points from the campaign that even Twitch viewers back in the day weren't aware of. That included more information on the series' key antagonists, the wizard Volstruckers, and the mysterious and enigmatic academic, Essek Thelyss, whom Mercer voices.\n\n\"We had the opportunity to dig in with the writer's rooms and the rest of the creative team to collaborate on how best to see that now fleshed out and shown and explored with the audience through this animated series,\" Mercer said. \"So there weren't too many changes. A lot of it was mainly just taking what was there or things that were sitting in my head and going, 'Alright, now we get to actually show this. That's really cool and exciting. Let's do it.'\"\n\nOne of the big challenges the team had to overcome was articulating the intricate aspects of an in-game world through animation. And that spanned character costumes and memorable campaign locations.\n\n\"When I sent Matt (Mercer) my idea of where Jester grew up and what the Lavish Chateau was, I had this strong visual in my mind,\" cofounder and cast member Laura Bailey said, referring to her character, the trickster cleric Jester.\n\n\"And then to see it in the animated series, it's so strange that they can capture exactly what it was that we've visualized for so long, and now everybody else gets to see these stunning set pieces that have existed only in this little world,\" Bailey added.\n\nCofounder Taliesin Jaffe said that he'd been \"very, very specific\" as well about how the carnival his character, Mollymauk Tealeaf, traveled with — should be animated.\n\n\"I'm famous for making very easy-to-animate character designs — I say deeply sarcastically,\" Jaffe joked.\n\nThe Critical Role team also had to look into how each character's magic was represented on-screen. For Liam O'Brien, it was crucial that his wizard, Caleb Widogast, cast magic in a manner that resembled a \"learned science,\" complete with alchemy and specific components.\n\nThe crew, O'Brien said, was also just happy to have the \"luxury of time\" to go back and revisit moments from their old \"D&D\" campaign.\n\n\"I am in love with the complicated world that this show has created — and that Sam and Travis have helmed — as we've all, in an all-hands effort, just created everything with love,\" O'Brien said.",

    "fullText": "The parent company of Roomba, which has sold millions of cleaning robots, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday after 35 years of operation.\n\nIn a Sunday press release, Massachusetts-based robotics company iRobot said it had filed for bankruptcy protection in the District of Delaware court.\n\nThe company said that it would be wholly acquired by its main manufacturer and lender, vacuum cleaner maker Shenzhen PICEA. Picea has R&D and manufacturing facilities in China and Vietnam, per the release.\n\nThe Picea deal would allow iRobot to continue operating, developing new products, make \"timely payments to vendors and creditors,\" and meet its commitments to employees, the release said.\n\nUnder the deal, iRobot will be a private company owned by Picea, and its common stock will be wiped from stock exchanges.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by three roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company introduced the Roomba, its iconic disc-shaped vacuuming robot, in 2002.\n\nThe bankruptcy deal follows several quarters of weak sales and a cash crunch. The company wrote in its third-quarter earnings report that, as of September 27, its cash totaled $24.8 million, compared to $40.6 million as of June 28.\n\niRobot said it had withdrawn $5 million in restricted cash on September 27, after which it had \"no sources upon which it can draw for additional capital.\"\n\nIts third-quarter revenue, $145.8 million, was about a 25% drop compared to the same period the year before, with sales dropping 33% in the US.\n\nLast month, the company warned that the last possible iRobot buyer had backed out of a deal, which left it likely to pursue bankruptcy.\n\niRobot went through a failed acquisition attempt by Amazon. In 2022, Amazon announced that it would buy iRobot for $1.7 billion, but pulled the deal in January 2024, citing regulatory hurdles in the US and Europe.\n\nThe collapse of the Amazon deal hit iRobot hard. On the same day as Amazon's announcement, iRobot said it would lay off 31% of its staff, and its CEO, Colin Angle, would step down.\n\niRobot's stock price has dropped more than 50% in the past year and more than 90% in the past five years.",

Fans quickly spotted factual errors, and Amazon Prime Video took down the recap.\n\nOne Redditor said the AI feature told viewers that a flashback featuring the Ghoul (one of the main characters, played by Walton Goggins) took place in the 1950s instead of 2077.\n\nAn X user posted that the recap also mischaracterized the agreement the Ghoul and Lucy MacLean (played by Ella Purnell) made in the \"Fallout\" finale.\n\nInstead of saying the pair is teaming up to find Lucy's father, the recap said the Ghoul gave Lucy an ultimatum: \"die or join him.\"\n\nAmazon first launched its Video Recap, a feature that allows users to catch up on Prime Original TV shows between seasons, for beta testing in November.\n\n\"Video Recaps use AI to identify a show's most important plot points, combining them with synchronized voice narration, dialogue snippets, and music to create a visual summary that prepares viewers for the new season,\" the company said in a press release at the time.\n\nThe TV shows that Amazon said were undergoing Video Recaps testing — \"Jack Ryan,\" \"Upload,\" \"Bosch,\" and \"The Rig\" — did not include the feature at the time of writing.\n\nRepresentatives for Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLike so many companies, Amazon is investing heavily in AI.\n\nDuring the company's February earnings call, Chief Finance Officer Brian Olsavsky said that 2025 capital expenditures could reach over $100 billion, with the majority of it going toward AI and Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing platform.\n\nMany of Amazon's consumer services have integrated AI to enhance user engagement and experience, such as product suggestions and helping shoppers on its online platform find clothes that fit. In February, Amazon unveiled Alexa+, the next generation of Alexa, which is powered by generative AI to make it more conversational and personalized for users.\n\nEmbracing AI at Amazon, though, hasn't been without growing pains. In October, the company cited AI as it announced it would lay off 14,000 staff members.\n\n\"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),\" Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, wrote in a blog post at the time.\n\nIn an internal message to the remaining staff, Amazon Vice President of Device Software and Services Tapas Roy asked them to \"lean in on AI.\"\n\n\"Moving forward, we remain focused on our mission to help product teams launch delightful products,\" Roy wrote. \"In support of this mission, I encourage you all to: Focus on the work that most directly impacts our customers, lean in on Al to enhance your effectiveness, [and] raise your hand when you see opportunities to simplify or eliminate unnecessary processes.\"",

They will be the first new games in the series since 2018, and both will be published by Amazon.\n\nAnnounced at the Game Awards in LA, Tomb Raider Catalyst stars the “charismatic, self-assured, formidable Lara Croft” from the original 1990s games, says game director Will Kerslake. It’s set in the markets, mountains, and naturally the ancient buildings of northern India, where Lara is racing with other treasure hunters to track down potentially cataclysmic artefacts. It will be out in 2027.\n\nCatalyst is in development at Crystal Dynamics, the Canadian developer that has looked after Tomb Raider since 2003. Crystal Dynamics previously developed Tomb Raiders Legend, Anniversary and Underworld, as well as the reboot trilogy that featured a younger, more vulnerable Lara. Its most recent game in the series was 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider.\n\nTomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, meanwhile, is being developed in collaboration with Flying Wild Hog in Poland. Featuring modernised combat and redesigned tomb-delving puzzles, the game is an “expanded” ground-up reimagining of Lara Croft’s very first 1996 adventure, which established her as one of gaming’s most recognisable characters. “Our goal was to respect the spirit of Core Design’s original game, while updating the experience for today’s gamers including building it with Unreal Engine 5,” Kerslake says. “We see this is a reimagining of the original game with a gameplay experience that wasn’t possible on the technology at the time.” Legacy of Atlantis will be out in 2026.\n\nIn both games, Croft will be played by the British actor Alix Wilton Regan, who previously had significant roles in Dragon Age: Inquisition and Cyberpunk 2077. She was also due to star as Joanna Dark in the cancelled remake of 2000’s spy-shooter Perfect Dark.\n\nDespite the series’ recent hiatus, Tomb Raider still has immense brand recognition, built on its 1990s heyday. Amazon also has a TV series in the works with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, which is to star Sophie Turner as Croft. Over 30 years, Croft has been everything from Playboy pin-up to rugged wilderness adventurer to gentlewoman action hero.\n\n“Across the series, our goal is to show that Lara is always evolving,” Kerslake says. “Her core DNA will remain, but we believe it’s important to show how each adventure shapes her character over time.”",

    "fullText": "Most people don't get told their genius might destroy the company they built. But Jeff Bezos isn't most people. At Italian Tech Week in October, the Amazon founder looked back on an early piece of feedback that changed the way he approached invention—and may have helped save Amazon from becoming its own worst enemy.\n\n\"I am an inventor,\" Bezos told the audience. \"This is my fundamental nature.\" His favorite place? In a room with a whiteboard, surrounded by a small group, spitballing ideas. \"You can literally put me in front of a whiteboard and I can come up with a hundred ideas in half an hour,\" he said with a grin.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\n\nBut that endless flow of innovation—once considered a superpower—nearly became a liability. In the early years of Amazon, one longtime executive pulled Bezos aside with a blunt warning. \"Jeff, you have enough ideas to destroy Amazon,\" Jeff Wilke told him.\n\nIt stunned him. \"This was such a shocking idea for me,\" Bezos admitted. Wilke, a manufacturing expert, saw the problem clearly: every new idea was essentially a task dropped into a queue. If the company couldn't absorb it fast enough, it wasn't just useless—it was destructive.\n\n\"You have to release the work at the right rate that the organization can accept it,\" Bezo said, quoting Wilke. \"You're creating a backlog, a queue, work in process. It's adding no value and in fact, it's creating distraction.\"\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nThat was the moment Bezos shifted. Instead of flooding Amazon with nonstop initiatives, he started filtering. \"I started prioritizing the ideas better, keeping lists of them, keeping them to myself until the organization was ready,\" he said.\n\nEven more important, Bezos began thinking like a builder—not just of ideas, but of infrastructure. \"How can I build an organization that can be ready for more ideas?\" he said. The answer was scaling leadership, growing bandwidth, and creating systems that could handle multiple innovations at once.\n\nAmazon didn't slow down after that—it got smarter. \"We built a company that's very good at inventing and doing more than one thing at a time,\" Bezos said. But none of it worked until he accepted a hard truth: ideas are powerful, but only if they're released at the right moment. Without discipline, even genius becomes a liability.",

    "description": "Amazon plans a new rush pickup service for one-hour in-store orders, strengthening rapid delivery and click-and-collect offering.",
    "fullText": "Amazon wants more shoppers to get orders within an hour. A new kind of in-store pickup could be its next move to make that happen.\n\nAmazon is developing a \"rush\" pickup service that will let shoppers collect their orders at Amazon-owned stores within an hour, according to an internal document and a person familiar with the matter.\n\nShoppers will be able to place a \"unified\" order from both Amazon's online marketplace and items stocked in Amazon-owned stores, the document explained. The company operates several physical retail formats, including Whole Foods, Fresh grocery stores, and Go convenience stores.\n\nThe tech giant plans to pilot-launch the new program in at least one metro area by the first quarter of 2026, according to this document. The initiative is tracked by Amazon's SVPs, the most senior group of leaders at the company, it noted. However, it's uncertain whether that timeline is still in effect, said the person familiar, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe new pickup service would be Amazon's latest attempt to enable ultrafast, sub-one-hour deliveries.\n\nJust last week, the company launched Amazon Now, a new 30-minute delivery service in parts of Seattle and Philadelphia. It has also been testing similarly quick delivery offerings in countries such as the UK, India, and Mexico.\n\nFor those who want to pick up in-store, Amazon currently offers next-day pickup on some US online orders. Grocery subscribers can also collect select items in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIn-store pickup, often referred to as \"click-and-collect,\" is surging in e-commerce. Total US sales from click-and-collect services are expected to hit $112.96 billion this year, up 17% from 2023, and grow to $129.33 billion by 2027, according to eMarketer. The research firm projects roughly 152.9 million Americans, or 68% of digital buyers, will use click-and-collect in 2025.\n\nAmazon leads e-commerce by total sales, but Walmart may have an advantage when it comes to delivery speed. Thanks to its network of more than 4,600 US stores, Walmart can reach roughly 95% of American households within three hours. Walmart is the leader in click-and-collect services with a projected $38.50 billion in sales this year, eMarketer data shows.\n\nAccording to the internal document, Amazon expects the new \"rush\" pickup service to meet \"a key customer need for faster, more convenient access\" to its full product selection, while making better use of its physical store network and logistics infrastructure.\n\n\"By piloting this capability, we can validate customer demand for rapid pickup while learning how to effectively combine our physical and digital offerings,\" the document stated.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Buying the Zombies, Run! studio wasn’t part of ​my plan, but a post-apocalypse ​game with stories that make people feel seen pulled me in\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nA few days ago, I clicked a button on my phone to send funds to a company in Singapore and so took ownership of the video game I co-created and am lead writer for: Zombies, Run! I am a novelist, I wrote the bestselling, award-winning The Power, which was turned into an Amazon Prime TV series starring Toni Collette. What on earth am I doing buying a games company?\n\nWell. First of all. Zombies, Run! is special. It’s special to me – the game started as a Kickstarter and the community that grew up around it has always been incredibly supportive of what we’re doing. And it’s special in what it does. It’s a game to exercise with. You play it on your smartphone – iPhone or Android – and we tell stories from the zombie apocalypse in your headphones to encourage you to go further, faster, or just make exercise less boring. Games are so often portrayed as the bad entertainment form, but I made a game that fundamentally helps people to be healthier.\n\nThe experience of playing Zombies, Run! is also completely focused on storytelling. My co-creator Adrian Hon and I were talking about doing a project together. He said: “Let’s do something to make running more fun.” I said: “How about if we do a story where you’re being chased by zombies?” And here we are.\n\nWhen you play the game, you’re immersed in a world where every run makes you a hero – you’re collecting supplies, saving a child from no man’s land, investigating the mystery of how the apocalypse started. I’ve always focused on the storytelling being good. And it works. Players of the game become so attached to the characters that many of them report laughing out loud or even “crying while running”.\n\nOne of my jokes about storytelling in video games is that the way we tend to talk about it – in the games industry, in games journalism, even in marketing copy – is very much “never mind the quality, feel the width”. We say things like “this game has 100-plus hours of story” or “this game contains more than a million words”. Imagine marketing a movie saying that the script contains 29,000 words. Or selling a novel on the basis that it’ll take a long time to read.\n\nThat’s not how you do it. You tell the story. You give a hook. You say: “A single woman comes home one evening to find a man claiming to be her husband living in her house. And when he goes up to the attic, a different husband comes down in his place.” Now you can’t wait to find out what happens next. (That, incidentally, is the brilliant comic novel The Husbands by Holly Gramazio – who I think is the only other bestselling novelist to be also making her own video games.)\n\nSo, now I own a games company, what am I going to do? My feeling is that I must focus on the fundamentals. There’s a world of games out there that thinks it can replace writers with AI large language models. I think that’s going to make writing worse and worse. AI writing is fine for boilerplate text that is always roughly the same. It’s fine for non-writers to get their expertise into the world. But storytelling is different. It is human minds finding companionship with other human minds – we need stories, fundamentally, to feel less alone. To know that other people have been through things a bit like what we have. Things that make us laugh, and cry, even while running. You get that from work that is not the same as everything else, you get it from the unique work of other individual human minds.\n\nAnd actually, Zombies, Run! has always been a universe with strong values. We’re not a rightwing, rugged-individualism apocalypse, where one lone person can get through with just their guns. In our world – as in the real world – humans survive by working together.\n\nWhile we’re still going to have many exciting fleeing zombies, battling-the-undead storytelling, I think there’s probably also room in the ZR! universe for a 10-mission arc where you have to find all the figurines and paints you need to complete an expansion set in “Demons and Darkness”; or one where you’re working on bringing an overgrown garden back to blooming, beautiful life; or setting up and running the first post-apocalyptic travelling library while also trying to work out what happened to the first librarian who’s mysteriously disappeared, leaving only a series of cryptic notes in an old manuscript.\n\nAfter all, I do think this is quite a good time in the world to be thinking about how to rebuild after a series of catastrophic events.\n\nSelling story by the yard and not by a story hook is a marker, I think, of a lack of confidence in the form. We don’t need to lack confidence. Games are the biggest entertainment industry in the world. If we want to be taken seriously, we need to take ourselves seriously. Stop talking about the width, start talking about the quality.\n\nIt was the 20th anniversary of Xbox 360 recently, and one name that’s cropped up in every list of the console’s best games is the compulsive retro twin-stick shooter Geometry Wars. If you’re yearning for something similar, you must immediately download Evil Egg, a frenzied twin-stick blaster with gorgeous Commodore 64-style visuals and sound effects. Shoot everything that moves, hit the left trigger to boost and collect hearts to stay alive.\n\nAt first it’s a bewildering mass of rainbow pixels but as you detonate wave after wave of glitchy space pests, you begin to understand the patterns of different enemies and earn upgrades such as the executioner’s sword, which takes out foes in an orbital slash of laser particles. Evil Egg is polished, exciting, wild to look at, and has such a brilliant understanding of the genre and its unique dynamics. It’s free on Steam but I implore you to download it on Itch.io and name your own price. Keith Stuart\n\nAvailable on: PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 10-plus hours\n\nThere has been a lot of writing about Horses, the art game recently banned by digital platforms Steam and Epic Games Store. I particularly enjoyed this post by writer Harper Jay MacIntyre, which considers Horses, formalism and the trans experience. The article manages to bring in so many elements of modern games criticism and academia while providing a highly personal response to the game.\n\nThe most interesting retro game articles are the ones that reassess lost or derided titles rather than merely celebrate the classics. Was the Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man the worst game ever? Not according to this compelling analysis from Garrett Martin at AV Club who sees it as a misunderstood brutalist gem. I find myself in agreement.\n\nIt is also nice to see a legendary game justly praised in an interesting way. The BFI’s look at the legacy of Time Crisis considers the gun game in relation to cinema, referencing Beverly Hills Cop and Run Lola Run rather than just comparing it to Sega’s similar Virtua Cop.\n\nSkate Story – hellish premise aside, this is skateboarding paradise | ★★★★☆\n\nHorror game Horses has been banned from sale – but is it as controversial as you’d think?\n\nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 – inept game-based horror is one of the year’s worst | ★☆☆☆☆\n\nThis one comes from reader, Rebecca:\n\n“My elderly grandad is coming to stay with us for Christmas and wants to see what’s happening with video game graphics these days. Are there any titles you recommend that will let him explore beautiful locations without getting shot at?! We have a PlayStation 5 and a slightly out-of-date PC.”\n\nYour best option here is to go with one of the big open-world adventures and just find an area with no enemies around. If you You could bypass the threat of imminent violence completely by going for a driving game, such as Forza Horizon 4 on PC (which is set in Britain so he may even spot some familiar scenery). Alternatively, if visual realism isn’t as important as beauty, a cosier indie title such as Tchia, Journey or Firewatch may fit the bill. Really hope he enjoys them!\n\nWe’re still looking for your game of the year nominations for an end of year special – let us know yours by hitting reply or emailing us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "description": "AWS executive Sarah Cooper has invented her own roles at the giant using Amazon's 6-page proposal and PR/FAQ frameworks.",
    "fullText": "AWS executive Sarah Cooper has launched several companies and held roles at NASA and AWS, but she's only ever formally interviewed for three jobs.\n\nInstead, Cooper told Business Insider that her career moves often begin with writing a proposal about the work she wants to pursue, either to a VC, a cofounder, or an executive leader, and that becomes the role she steps into.\n\n\"I have a million ideas,\" Cooper said. \"It's a blessing and a curse.\"\n\nCooper has seen a high rate of success with her proposals. She used them to invent both her previous and current roles at AWS.\n\nCooper was previously the head of AWS Industry Products, where she worked closely with customers to develop industry solutions in the cloud. Now she leads the \"AWS AI-Native\" team, an AWS product organization that works with customers to understand how companies will evolve with AI.\n\nCooper said she wrote a proposal to pitch her last two roles, and she's a fan of the six-page memo, a favorite of Jeff Bezos. Instead of PowerPoint decks, Bezos often opted to start meetings by having attendees read a 6-page \"narratively structured\" memo silently at the start of the meeting. The founder has said he prefers memos to avoid \"hiding a lot of sloppy thinking in bullet points.\"\n\nThese six-page memos typically describe detailed plans for a new initiative and are written using 10-point font. Bezos wrote years ago in an annual shareholder letter that \"great memos are written and re-written,\" and can't be done in a couple of days, though the exact criteria remains more flexible.\n\nCooper also referenced using Amazon's classic PR/FAQ framework. The executive said she finds the format \"effective at helping people quickly understand what your idea is and why it matters.\"\n\nAmazon describes the framework as a means to develop ideas and initiatives that enable teams to quickly integrate feedback and promote fact-based decision-making. The press-release portion spans a few paragraphs and provides the reader with highlights of the customer experience. The FAQ section, typically five pages or less, dives into the details and also outlines the challenges of building the product or service.\n\nOnce a draft is written, the creator typically schedules a one-hour meeting with stakeholders to review the document and get feedback, the company said in a blog post about the framework.\n\nCooper said she's written over 14 PR/FAQs and investment narratives that have been funded, as well as many other ideas that the company didn't move forward with.\n\nCooper, who has been at Amazon for over nine years, says she also tries to reflect the organization's values when writing proposals. Amazon's PR/FAQ format originated from a process the company calls \"Working Backwards,\" a method for evaluating new ideas by first defining the ideal customer experience and then reverse-engineering what the team needs to build to achieve it.\n\nCooper said Amazon is \"customer-obsessed,\" so she tries to focus on that value when drafting a memo. She said she thinks less about the needs of a specific team and more broadly about customers and the best way to serve them, regardless of what's been done previously.\n\nWhile Cooper has spent her career writing proposals, many never see the light of day — and those that do don't always go smoothly, she said. In her late 20s, while serving as the CTO of a company, she wrote a proposal suggesting that the business should focus limited resources on scaling the supply chain, specifically with the supply chain involved in on-mine extraction to meet demand for contracts. The company disagreed on where to invest.\n\n\"I got pushed out of one of my companies, basically, for a proposal I wrote,\" Cooper said.",
