    "description": "Companies including Amazon, JPMorgan, and AT&T have faced obstacles trying to get employees to return to office.",
    "fullText": "Return-to-office mandates continue to feel like high-level math equations that even the business world’s brightest can’t solve.\n\nAmazon, JPMorgan, and AT&T are among the most recent companies to require a full-time RTOs. But some of these mandates have faced obstacles, including a lack of office space and dissatisfied employees.\n\nAmazon, for example, said in September, it wanted its 350,000-person workforce in the office by early January. As of February, many of their offices didn’t have enough desks to accommodate the return, leaving many employees continuing working from home. AT&T had a similar issue. In response to JPMorgan’s RTO mandate, employees expressed their outrage on an internal platform. The company then disabled comments. Some JPMorgan and Amazon workers have also signed petitions protesting their employers’ requirements.\n\nWhat’s missing from some of these RTO plans is the recognition of a cultural change, said Jennifer Moss, workplace strategist and author of Why Are We Here?: Creating a Work Culture Everyone Wants. The post-pandemic workplace should combine lessons from the pre-pandemic and pandemic-era models, she said.\n\n“When we’re trying to get people back into the office, we still are executing the office in the same way that it used to be,” Moss told HR Brew. “We just can’t jam the toothpaste back in the tube.”\n\nRecognize the new environment. Improved collaboration, culture, and productivity are often cited as reasons for an RTO, Moss said, but being in the office won’t necessarily help employees achieve these goals.\n\n“People are going into the office, unfortunately, it feels very much like what it feels like to be at home,” she said. “You’re still on Zoom, and you’re still spending your day doing the exact same things you could be doing at home. It feels very arbitrary.”\n\nTo facilitate this new era of work, employers should embrace a model Moss called “the third office.” Instead of “pushing” for employees to go back to pre-pandemic norms, she said, employers should consider how they can incorporate the benefits of remote work, like autonomy and flexibility. To that end, a hybrid approach, she said, typically works best.\n\nMoss also urged mindfulness around how the physical office space can affect employees. If a company doesn’t have enough desks, for example, she said HR leaders should rethink how employees work in the office, and create quiet or collaborative spaces outside of the open floor plan.\n\n“The [third office] is a place where you have challenging discussions, where you learn to network, develop soft skills, be able to have team building, build up that social energy and that cohesion,” she said, adding that these activities were undervalued pre-pandemic and lost during the pandemic, and should be part of this new era.\n\nEventually, however, companies that require five days in the office should offer employees their own dedicated workspace, Moss said. It may seem simple, but being able to personalize a desk is something that, she said, may help employees feel more connected to their workplace.\n\nIdentify and communicate the play-by-play. Some executives want RTO to alleviate their own “trust issues,” without considering how it might affect employees, according to John Frehse, the global head of labor strategy at consulting firm Ankura.\n\n“You only trust me when I’m in the office. You don’t trust me when I’m at home. What kind of a worker and employer relationship are we dealing with?” Frehse told HR Brew.\n\nSujay Saha, an employee experience strategist and founder of consulting firm Cortico-X, emphasized the need for a plan. “Don’t make the decision and then try to figure it out, how do I make that decision happen for people…that is the biggest problem in a lot of this,” Saha said. He suggested HR start by identifying employees’ “personas,” like whether they’re working parents or belong to the sandwich generation. This can give HR a sense of employees’ needs and schedules, which can help inform what kind of RTO might make sense.\n\n“There are pros and cons in all of this, so the most important thing that we can tackle is how we do it,” Saha said. “Maybe there is a pace at which you could do it…Reduce the pace and give people that mental adjustment time that is needed genuinely, to take care of their lives before you change [their lives].”\n\nFrehse also advised against focusing an RTO announcement on the enforcement and repercussions of not following the mandate. Instead, communicate the steps and value-add for professional growth.\n\n“It’s both culturally and intellectually lazy to announce a certain number of days of return to office each week, without listing in heavy detail the reasons why—not just benefits for the business, but the benefits for the employee,” he said.\n\nSaha agreed. “Don’t do it, just for the heck of doing it…Be clear about why you’re doing it.”\n\nThis report was originally published by HR Brew.\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on February 28, 2025.",

    "description": "Amazon employees beta-testing Alexa+ vented frustrations on an internal Slack, highlight the continuing headaches behind Amazon's rollout of Alexa+.",
    "fullText": "The Slack message from an Amazon employee beta-testing the company's long-delayed Alexa+ was the stuff of nightmares.\n\n\"When I ask Alexa to turn off the light, it should turn off the light, not everything on the strip,\" the software engineer wrote in October in a channel for workers to share feedback on unreleased Alexa+ features. \"It turned off the power strip that my aquarium filter is on and killed my fish.\"\n\nOther testers complained that the assistant talked non-stop, ignoring repeated commands to be quiet. Or that it played a device at full volume when no one was home.\n\n\"The behavior has become unbearably erratic,\" one employee wrote. \"I just wanted to test the new experiences, but I wasn't expecting to get everything messed up.\"\n\nThe messages highlight the continuing headaches behind Amazon's rollout of Alexa+, a revamped version of its voice assistant that has been marred by years of delays and technical problems. It was released to the public earlier this year, but remains available only to users who request access or use newer devices.\n\nAmazon's Alexa+ beta-tester channel, which in October included more than 6,400 Amazon employees, has served as a candid forum for early testers to share feedback on unreleased Alexa+ features. Those include a more conversational speech mode and a new browser-based version of the AI-powered assistant, which Amazon introduced to the public in December.\n\nDozens of testers wrote that once they linked the unreleased features to their existing Alexa setups, routine tasks began to break down, turning what was meant to be a smarter assistant into a recurring source of frustration, according to messages that were posted to the Slack channel in October.\n\nAmazon has long promoted a culture that encourages employees to use and critique products internally. Early testing is designed to surface and correct bugs. Business Insider didn't see any comments posted to the channel after October, so it's not clear if some of the issues have been resolved.\n\nThe employee feedback in this Slack channel referred to a version of Alexa+ that differs from what's currently available to the public and doesn't reflect the typical customer experience, an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. Tens of millions of users now have access, the spokesperson said, and the \"overwhelming majority\" of feedback has been positive.\n\n\"As with any other consumer technology company, it's a standard part of the development process to beta-test products and features internally, well before they're distributed to customers,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy remains bullish on Alexa+. On a call with analysts in October, he said Alexa+ users tend to have longer interactions with the voice assistant and engage across a wider range of topics than with the older version. Amazon has made Alexa+ free for Prime subscribers, but non-Prime users must pay $19.99 a month.\n\n\"We continue to be energized by the response to Alexa+ compared to what we call the classic Alexa experience,\" Jassy said during the call.\n\nSome employees wondered aloud in the Alexa+ Slack channel whether consumers would pay for it.\n\n\"All my experiences thus far with Alexa+, inclusive of this one, haven't convinced me that, other than the improved conversation flow, anything would justify paying a subscription fee,\" one staffer wrote.\n\nBeta testers reported on Slack that Alexa+ sometimes failed to respond to voice commands, lost its Wi-Fi connection, or became unresponsive even when it appeared to be online. Some employees said it took up to five minutes to get a response; others reported that their Alexa devices stopped working entirely.\n\nSeveral employees asked how to opt out of beta testing.\n\n\"None of my devices, including the Alexa app, are responsive anymore,\" an employee wrote.\n\nMusic playback emerged as a recurring pain point.\n\n\"It's so discouraging that we're in Q4 2025 and Alexa+ still can't play a song I ask for,\" one employee wrote.\n\nAnother reported that a device began playing music at 3 a.m. He eventually unplugged it.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Amazon allows India-based employees affected by H-1B visa delays to work remotely until March, with strict restrictions on coding.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is allowing employees who are stranded in India because of visa delays to work remotely there until early March, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe catch: They're not allowed to code, make strategic decisions, or interact with customers.\n\nAmazon is one of many American companies scrambling to adapt to the Trump administration's rapid-fire changes to the H-1B visa program, including a mandate that consular officers must review visa applicants' social media posts before issuing visas. The additional screening has delayed processing, and some embassies and consulates have rescheduled visa appointments by several months, leaving some employees stranded outside the country.\n\nThe delays have prompted Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other companies to issue travel advisories in recent weeks, warning US employees with visas to avoid international travel to prevent extended stays outside the US.\n\nAmazon allows employees traveling abroad for visa renewals to work remotely for up to 20 business days, an exemption from the normal requirement that they work in their office five days a week. Now, any Amazon employee in India as of December 13 and who awaits a rescheduled visa appointment may work remotely until March 2, according to the memo, which was posted to Amazon's internal HR portal on December 17.\n\nThe permission to work remotely comes with a long list of constraints. Employees working remotely from India are barred from coding of any kind, including troubleshooting and testing. They cannot work from or visit Amazon buildings. And they cannot negotiate or sign contracts.\n\n\"All reviews, final decision making, and sign offs should be undertaken outside India,\" the memo says.\n\nThe memo also said that \"in compliance with local laws, there are no exceptions to these restrictions.\"\n\nThe memo does not provide guidance for employees whose visa appointments have been rescheduled beyond March 2, 2026, or for those stranded in a different country. Some US embassies and consulates have rescheduled appointments as far out as 2027.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nFor employees in technical roles, the restrictions raised questions about what work they can actually perform.\n\n\"Seventy to eighty percent of my job is coding, testing, deploying, and documenting,\" one Amazon software engineer told Business Insider.\n\nA State Department spokesperson in December told Business Insider that the purpose of the social media reviews is to use \"all available tools\" to flag visa applicants who are inadmissible, including those who pose a risk to national interests.\n\nThe delays pose a particular challenge for Amazon, which is among the largest users of the H-1B program. During the 2024 government fiscal year, Amazon filed 14,783 certified H-1B applications, including 23 for Whole Foods, according to Business Insider's analysis of publicly available data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Our reporting revealed a symbiotic relationship between the IDF and Silicon Valley – with implications for the future of warfare\n\nIn January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms. Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.\n\nOne investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.\n\nI asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.\n\nHow did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?\n\nYuval Abraham: The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.\n\nHarry Davies: There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.\n\nWhat has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?\n\nYuval Abraham: As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.\n\nIf you remember the [Edward] Snowden revelations, many of them had to do with metadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.\n\nSo data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nTo send a message to Harry and Yuval please choose the ‘UK Investigations’ team.\n\nYou can message Harry using the Signal Messenger app. Use the ‘find by username’ option and type hfd.90\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email harry.davies@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nHarry Davies: Yossi Sariel, the former head of [Israel’s elite spy agency] Unit 8200, wrote a book under a pseudonym that we revealed to have been published by him. In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.\n\nSome of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nWe know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as you revealed, Yuval, and has also purchased AI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?\n\nYuval Abraham: What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] called Lavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.\n\nThese AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.\n\nAI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.\n\nHarry Davies: Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.\n\nMicrosoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?\n\nHarry Davies: I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have been protest groups which have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.\n\nYuval Abraham: And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.\n\nIt sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.\n\nYuval Abraham: Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for its Nimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.\n\nThese are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.\n\nMicrosoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhat’s your focus going to be in 2026?\n\nYuval Abraham: I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHarry Davies: We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.\n\nThere’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.\n\nAnd there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services. Post-Gaza, we have to look at these relationships and ask: what is the involvement of these companies and their technology in military decisions, in military operations and in warfare more broadly?\n\nYuval Abraham: Much of our reporting is based on whistleblowers, on individuals who are in proximity to power or hold positions of power.\n\nHarry Davies: Our confidential sources have remained confidential and we are always interested in hearing from new people. Our door is always open.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "Amazon, YouTube TV, and Netflix dominate US sports streaming, accounting for 65% of the $6.5 billion spent by streamers on sports rights.",
    "fullText": "The NFL is giving sports fans a triple header for Christmas this year, starting with the Dallas Cowboys vs. the Washington Commanders at 1 p.m. ET, plus a Snoop Dogg halftime performance. But you have to \n\nThe tech giants have eaten the entertainment world, and now they're coming for sports.\n\nTogether, Amazon and YouTube TV account for 65% of the $6.5 billion that streamers will spend on sports rights for US audiences in 2025 (34.4% and 30.6%, respectively), according to Ampere Analysis. The third biggest share went to Netflix, with 11.3%. Disney's ESPN+ and Comcast's Peacock held a distant fourth and fifth place.\n\nAmazon and YouTube have actively pursued significant deals for sports rights in recent years, with Amazon paying $11 billion for the NFL's Thursday Night Football and $19.8 billion for NBA rights, and YouTube paying $14 billion to secure NFL \"Sunday Ticket\" rights.\n\nNetflix has also been active, scooping up NFL Christmas Day games and the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, although it prefers to treat sports as part of a broader live events strategy that includes comedy specials and awards shows rather than \"renting\" full seasons of sports rights. A person familiar with Netflix's spending said they pegged it at about $600 million versus Ampere's calculation of $738 million.\n\nAmpere's data comes with a few caveats. Its measurements of eight platforms exclude spending for rights distributed internationally — such as Amazon's spending on NFL rights outside the US, or on the UEFA Men's Champions League within the UK — and for DAZN's acquisition of the global FIFA Club World Cup 2025 rights for $1 billion.\n\nBroadcasters remain the largest buyers of sports rights in the US, although streamers are making inroads.\n\nNearly half (47%) of US broadcasters' content spending — $24 billion — went to sports rights in 2025, per Ampere. Most of US streamers' content budgets still go to TV shows and films. This year, 10% of their content budgets overall went to sports in 2025, up from 6% in 2024. Even for Amazon, sports were about 19% of its spending on content, approaching the amount it spends on movies.\n\nSports can help streamers grow engagement and keep audiences subscribed. However, the rising cost of sports means less money for an already stagnating entertainment TV ecosystem that has been producing fewer shows since the end of Peak TV in 2022.\n\nDisney said in its fourth quarter earnings call that it would spend $24 billion in the next fiscal year, driven in large part by sports rights. CFO Hugh Johnston justified paying a more than 73% step up for NBA rights in its 2024 deal by pointing to their value to audiences and advertisers, despite the cost creating \"a little bit of bumpiness during the course of the year.\"\n\nNetflix compared its recent NFL deal to the cost of its movies, which it's been making fewer of. Asked about the cost of the deal at an investor conference last year, Netflix exec Spencer Wang said he would characterize each game as \"roughly the size of one of our medium-sized original films.\"\n\nThe shift of sports to streaming platforms looks likely to continue.\n\nAmpere forecasts global spending on sports rights to increase by 20% to $78 billion worldwide by 2030. Spending will be driven by the US, where new NBA and MLB rights will be up for grabs in the coming years. Talks for the next round of NFL negotiations could start as early as 2026, as the league seeks to maximize the value of its media rights.\n\nYouTube TV is also expanding its play for sports fans, announcing a new sports bundle along with other niche packages that cost less than its regular $83-per-month service.",

    "title": "We're cofounders who left Amazon to build our own startup. We learned the hard way why Big Tech habits don't always translate.",
    "description": "Former Amazon employees detail their journey launching an AI startup, and explain how they adapted to startup life.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Shalini Aggarwal, a 50-year-old CEO in San Jose, California, and Andy Ratsirason, a 37-year-old CTO. The two left Amazon at different times and reconnected as cofounders of Tenfali, an AI startup.\n\nThey share the main processes they had to unlearn in order to successfully grow their startup. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nShalini Aggarwal: Andy and I began working together in 2015, after I relocated to the US from India. He was a dev engineer, and I worked on the product and program execution side.\n\nAndy Ratsirason: I joined Amazon for the first time in 2014 because I wanted to be part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem. I always wanted to be an entrepreneur, so I tried to tailor my career to suit that goal. I left Amazon, came back in 2020, and left again in 2023.\n\nAfter I left for the last time, I made multiple pivots in founding a startup. I realized I needed someone else to join my team. Shalini started showing up regularly on my LinkedIn feed, liking and commenting on posts about startups and taking risks, so I reached out to her. She had just left Amazon, and we reunited to cofound Tenafli.\n\nAggarwal: We quickly realized that we took a lot of systems and tools for granted when we were in an enterprise company. The startup world is completely different; here, we have to build from scratch, and there was a lot about our mindset we had to unlearn.\n\nAggarwal: I stayed at Amazon until 2024, and my last nine months were spent working on AI projects, specifically on music recommendations.\n\nRatsirason: In 2023, I was almost three years into my return to Amazon, and I had a choice: either stay comfortable with those Big Tech paychecks or take a leap and launch my own startup. I submitted my resignation in February and then began to think about what was next.\n\nAggarwal: My decision to leave Amazon was more of a gradual process. During the COVID pandemic, my father retired, and we lost my mom. I could see how lonely my father was, and the biggest challenge was how to fill his days. That planted the seed.\n\nThrough working on personalized AI recommendations, I thought of a product that could serve as an AI companion for older adults, providing personalized recommendations and scheduling activities based on their typical daily routines.\n\nMy 50th birthday was coming up, and the AI boom was happening; if I didn't take the leap then, I knew I would never. In September 2024, I put in my two weeks' notice and left Amazon.\n\nRatsirason: At Amazon, I didn't really think about why we were building a product or if people would use it. The 'build-first' mindset meant focusing solely on building a good product, knowing the customer was already there.\n\nA clear moment that this mindset wouldn't work at an early-stage startup came after we spent months building, and launch day arrived, almost nobody showed up organically for a few weeks. That was the wake-up call: shipping isn't the finish line when we didn't have demand.\n\nAfter that, we shifted to doing customer conversations earlier and running small distribution tests, including waitlists, partnerships, and community posts, before over-investing in product.\n\nAggarwal: We applied and were accepted into several startup resource programs, including AWS Activate, Nvidia Inception, and Google's Cloud Credits program.\n\nRatsirason: We received a few thousand in AWS credits, but before we realized it, we lost almost all of the credits in the first two months. We over-provisioned capacity, and during AI testing, we left a few resources running longer than intended, which quietly accumulated costs over time.\n\nOnce we noticed the issue, we set up AWS budget alerts, added cost monitoring, made shutdowns part of our testing checklist, and simplified certain aspects of the architecture to match our stage.\n\nTo reduce costs further, we also bought a small local machine to run some of our AI experiments on, so we only use the cloud when we truly need it for scale, managed services, or production.\n\nAggarwal: The time we save with AI enables us to allocate our energy to attending summits, forums, and programs, where we can learn about the work of others in the field. We also spend more time with prospective customers doing interviews.\n\nRatsirason: We used to spend hours reading long articles and research, and trying to keep up with the latest news in the field. The cycle felt heavy and slow, pulling us away from customer conversations and shipping.\n\nWe now use AI to scan a large set of content, surface the most relevant ideas for us, and summarize the few pieces worth reading. Having to be frugal, we've learned to spend only where learning happens. Talk to users first, then build the smallest thing that can prove value.\n\nRatsirason: AI acts as a junior engineer, handling a lot of the coding for us with the requirements we set up.\n\nAggarwal: It's also taught us where we won't need to scale. I know I don't need to hire a user interface designer. If I understand the requirements of something, I can quickly draft it with the help of AI and receive feedback on it myself.\n\nRatsirason: A few years ago, launching a usable version of our product, Agefully, would have required significantly more capital and head count. We just need two engineers and subscriptions. I'm grateful to be part of this AI era.\n\nAggarwal: We've seen at scale how things work and what processes we can implement to avoid chaos later on. At the same time, the biggest disadvantage has been overcoming the mindset that tools and infrastructure are readily available. Until we learned how to work through that, we weren't allocating our energy properly.\n\nRatsirason: Coming from Amazon, the name itself has some positive weight, but it can also work against us. People might assume that since we worked at a big company, we don't know how to run a small startup because we don't have a lot of resources.\n\nThe hardest part was overcoming the fear of shipping something imperfect. Coming from Big Tech, we were accustomed to high-polish expectations and assumed anything less would turn users away. We learned that in early-stage startups, the real risk isn't rough edges, it's building something people don't need.\n\nDo you have a founder story to share?

    "fullText": "Amazon has stopped more than 1,800 suspected North Korean agents from applying for jobs over the last 20 months, a top executive at the firm has said.\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn, Stephen Schmidt, Amazon's chief security officer, said North Korean nationals had in recent years been attempting to land remote tech roles with companies across the globe.\n\n\"Their objective is typically straightforward: get hired, get paid, and funnel wages back to fund the regime's weapons programs,\" Schmidt wrote.\n\nAmazon has used a combination of AI-powered screening and human verification to detect and block such applications, Schmidt continued.\n\nThe company's AI model searches for connections to around 200 \"high-risk institutions\" and analyzes \"anomalies across applications\" and \"geographic inconsistencies.\"\n\nHuman reviewers then conduct background checks, verify credentials, and carry out interviews, he added.\n\nSchmidt said fraudsters were becoming more \"calculated,\" with many targeting real software engineers in an effort to gain credibility.\n\nOthers attempt to take over dormant LinkedIn accounts or pay for access to existing profiles, he continued.\n\nAI and machine-learning roles have been increasingly targeted due to high demand, he added.\n\n\"Small details give them away,\" Schmidt went on. \"For example, these applicants often format U.S. phone numbers with \"+1\" rather than \"1.\" Alone, this means nothing. Combined with other indicators, it paints a picture.\"\n\nThe operatives often work with \"laptop farms,\" Schmidt said, which are US-based locations that maintain a domestic presence while workers operate remotely from abroad.\n\n\"This isn't Amazon-specific,\" Schmidt added. \"This is likely happening at scale across the industry.\"\n\nIn July, an Arizona woman was sentenced to 102 months in prison for her role in assisting North Korean IT workers in securing remote IT jobs at more than 300 US companies.\n\nThe Justice Department said the laptop farming scheme generated over $17 million in illicit revenue for the woman and Pyongyang.\n\nCrowdStrike's 2025 Threat Hunting Report found that the North Korean remote-worker scheme is a growing threat.\n\nAmazon had detected 27% more North Korea-linked applications quarter over quarter this year, Schmidt said.\n\nIn June, the DOJ said authorities had carried out searches of 29 known or suspected \"laptop farms\" across 16 US states. It said North Korean actors had managed to obtain employment with more than 100 US companies.\n\nThe DOJ did not name the companies but said they included Fortune 500 firms.\n\nThe FBI recommends that businesses scrutinize identity verification documents, verify prior employment and education, and require in-person meetings.",

    "title": "'Fragmented' Microsoft tools undercut efficiency at Amazon and Whole Foods, internal Deloitte review found",
    "description": "Whole Foods' use of Microsoft 365 apps remained disconnected from Amazon, leading to inefficiencies and security concerns, a Deloitte review found.",
    "fullText": "It's been more than eight years since Amazon bought Whole Foods, but the two companies still haven't aligned their setup for the Microsoft software their employees use.\n\nThat disconnect was flagged in an 8-week Deloitte review of Whole Foods' use of Microsoft 365 apps earlier this year, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nDeloitte found that Whole Foods relies on \"fragmented\" Microsoft toolsets, has loose security and data-retention practices, and employs a complex user-management setup — all of which contribute to inefficiencies and lower productivity when working with Amazon employees.\n\nThe consulting firm recommended a 24-month integration plan that would first move Whole Foods' corporate employees onto Amazon's backend system, followed by its frontline workers. The phased approach would ensure a \"smooth transition for users and minimal disruption to business processes,\" while generating cost savings, the document said.\n\nThe review, completed in May, highlights Amazon's ongoing challenges in integrating Whole Foods. Since acquiring the chain in 2017, the company has struggled to scale the business and integrate operations, resulting in frequent reorganizations and shifting strategic priorities.\n\nNow, under new grocery chief Jason Buechel, Amazon is making a renewed push to knit Whole Foods more closely with its Amazon Fresh division. Buechel, who is both Whole Foods' CEO and Amazon's VP of grocery, has been championing a unified \"One Grocery\" strategy and a \"flying formation\" model aimed at bringing the two organizations into tighter alignment.\n\nIt also underscores Amazon's dependence on cloud rival Microsoft for core productivity software such as word processing and spreadsheets. In 2023, Amazon committed to spending at least $1 billion over five years on Microsoft 365, Business Insider previously reported. The company has long struggled to develop its own business applications and, earlier this year, formally adopted Zoom in place of its Chime meeting app.\n\nAmazon's spokesperson, Jamie Forrest, told Business Insider that Amazon has a \"successful and growing\" grocery business with more than 150 million customers. Over the years, the company has made changes to \"simplify ways of working and better collaborate across teams,\" Forrest added.\n\n\"We're bringing our corporate grocery teams closer together with a consistent employee experience, including aligning to the same technology systems and tools, to make it easier to collaborate and innovate on behalf of our customers,\" Forrest said in a statement.\n\nThe Deloitte team collaborated with Whole Foods employees to evaluate the current landscape and develop a future roadmap for the company's use of Microsoft 365.\n\nUltimately, Deloitte identified six \"key themes\" that must be addressed to streamline the business, including:\n\nDeloitte recommended a phased integration plan that first migrates Whole Foods' corporate staff to Amazon's backend technology, followed by frontline workers.\n\nUnder the plan, corporate workers would transition early to Amazon's tenant for email and OneDrive, while more complex systems, such as SharePoint and Teams, would shift gradually to allow for testing and re-permissioning involving both Whole Foods and Amazon identities. All workloads would eventually be consolidated under Amazon, enabling Whole Foods to cut duplicative licensing costs and align with Amazon's security standards.\n\n\"As applications and services transition, they will seamlessly integrate under a unified tenant, fostering streamlined interactions between WFM and Amazon employees,\" the document stated. \"Aligning with Amazon's security protocols and guidelines will significantly enhance WFM's organizational security posture, ensuring adherence to superior industry standards.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether Amazon and Whole Foods adopted the full set of recommendations. But the gradual shift that Deloitte recommended mirrors Amazon's broader workforce consolidation effort with Whole Foods.\n\nAs Business Insider previously reported, Amazon began moving Whole Foods' corporate employees onto its own systems earlier this year. Now, under an internal project codenamed \"Cremini,\" Amazon plans to absorb the entire 100,000-plus workforce of Whole Foods, including frontline employees.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Tasha Huo and I don't make it a minute into our conversation before we start gushing about wizards — and that's how I know I'm talking to a true Critical Role fan.\n\nHuo is the showrunner of \"The Mighty Nein,\" Critical Role's second animated series with Prime Video. \"The Mighty Nein\" follows the success of \"The Legend of Vox Machina,\" the series for which Critical Role raised over $11.3 million in Kickstarter seed funding in 2019. Now, Huo, a longtime viewer of the show, is the series' creative writing powerhouse.\n\nHuo, who's based in Los Angeles, said she first started playing \"Dungeons & Dragons\" as a kid, but hadn't touched the game for years. In her adult life, a friend wanted her to join his \"D&D\" campaign and recommended a Twitch stream that he said would help her understand how the game worked.\n\nThat turned out to be Critical Role. At the time, the company's eight cofounders were in the midst of their second long-running campaign. And the stream that Huo watched, so many years ago now, has taken on an animated series form in \"The Mighty Nein.\"\n\n\"I was absolutely hooked. I was like, this is all I can watch now, and it's all I can listen to in the car. And I binged it, which took years,\" Huo said of the 141-episode campaign.\n\nSeveral industry contacts recommended Huo to Critical Role in 2021 when they were looking for a showrunner.\n\nHuo started work on the show in November 2022 as part of the Prime Video team and oversaw its writing until its release this fall, working 9-to-5 daily with three other writers and a writer's assistant. She has an MFA in screenwriting from Boston University and has written for other shows, including \"The Witcher: Blood Origin,\" released in 2022, and \"Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft,\" released in 2024.\n\n\"It started with me having a lot of conversations with Critical Role. I met with Sam Riegel first, and then Travis Willingham and Matt Mercer, and we all just nerded out,\" Huo said. Riegel, a cofounder, oversees much of Critical Role's animation business alongside the team's CEO, Willingham. Mercer is the crew's chief creative officer.\n\n\"It was kind of like coming home. It was just all these pieces coming together that started over a love of 'D&D,'\" Huo added\n\nHuo said conversations in the Critical Role writer's room involved many talks with the eight cofounders about their campaign characters. She wanted to find the best way to condense the hundreds of hours of campaign stream time into eight, 44-minute episodes.\n\n\"The conversations always started with all of us in a room talking about the characters, talking about why they felt the way they did or why they did the thing they did,\" Huo said.\n\nHuo says these character conversations helped her figure out what the first season's arc would be.\n\n\"Every day we would come into the Critical Role offices. And we had a giant whiteboard up with magnets, and we'd come up with ideas of like, 'Okay, if we know what the season arc is, now let's start thinking about some turning points within the episode,'\" Huo said.\n\nHaving so many hours of source material also meant that Huo and the writing team had to make tough decisions about what to focus on in the first season. Huo said it quickly became clear to them that the plotline for cofounder Liam O'Brien's character, the wizard Caleb Widogast, needed to be covered first for the rest of the show to make sense.\n\n\"A lot of his backstory is really linked to a larger story that we were telling,\" Huo said.\n\nThe season's final cut also included several tidbits of information that were not in the original Twitch stream.\n\nHuo also got to live the Critical Role fan dream and suss out all the juicy details from Mercer that had never aired on stream — including the ins and outs of how the season's key antagonists, the Volstrucker wizards, worked.\n\n\"We get to tell a side spy show within 'The Mighty Nein,' and that's really gratifying because you sit Matt down and he has all the answers already, so you just mine from all of the great stuff that he has and fill the story up with all of those things,\" Huo said.\n\nI asked Huo how one might go about landing a dream writing job, and she had two tips.\n\n\"I would say the first thing is to dedicate yourself to the craft. Always be writing, even when there's negativity and there's rejection, just keep going. I think the number one reason people don't make it is because they give up before someone else,\" Huo said.\n\nAs for her second piece of advice for writers: \"Don't be afraid of what you love.\"\n\n\"I remember when I met with Sam Riegel, I was so embarrassed. I thought, 'Oh no, I fangirled too much when I talked to him,'\" Huo said. \"And it turns out that's exactly what they wanted to hear, from someone who really, really loved the show.\"\n\nDo you work on the Critical Role franchise and have a story to share?

    "title": "Nvidia memo says Capital One discussed alternatives to AWS as AI costs could 'get out of hand'",
    "description": "Several AWS customers have complained about rising cloud costs in the AI era. Capital One is the latest, and one of the biggest.",
    "fullText": "Capital One is concerned about AI costs rising via its cloud-computing relationship with Amazon and may be looking for alternatives, according to an internal Nvidia document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nIn the document, an Nvidia employee wrote that the chip giant talked with Capital One about AI infrastructure alternatives to Amazon Web Services, as the bank was \"looking to control costs.\"\n\nThe Nvidia staffer was recapping discussions with Capital One in an internal email after meeting representatives from the bank at a recent tech conference.\n\n\"They see their need for GPUs and reasoning models growing and the costs in AWS will soon get out of hand,\" the Nvidia employee wrote, referring to Capital One.\n\nNvidia and Capital One discussed \"AI factory and neo-clouds,\" according to the email. An AI factory is an in-house data center that a company can build to train and run AI models as an alternative to renting compute from a third party. Financial institutions can use this infrastructure for tasks such as fraud detection, customer support, and algorithmic trading, according to Nvidia.\n\nNeoclouds are upstart cloud providers, often powered by Nvidia hardware, that focus on AI workloads, whereas AWS supports a much broader range of computing needs. Top neocloud players include CoreWeave, Lambda, Crusoe, and Nebius. Nvidia has been working closely with several of these players, in part to reduce its reliance on established cloud giants as customers.\n\nThe Capital One situation underscores a key dynamic in the AI boom. Companies are racing to adopt generative AI but also trying to mitigate rising cloud costs. This new technology has great promise, but developing and running AI models and AI applications can be expensive.\n\nLarge companies also regularly assess their cloud spending, including varying setups that increasingly incorporate multiple providers. Forty-three percent of companies use more than two public cloud providers, according to a recent RBC Capital report.\n\n\"We continue to be committed to AWS as our predominant strategic cloud partner,\" a Capital One spokesperson wrote in a statement. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\n\"Our pricing philosophy is to work relentlessly to take cost out of our own cost structure and to pass those savings back to our AWS customers in the form of lower prices,\" an AWS spokesperson said. \"It's easy to lower prices, it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices, and at AWS we work really hard at that.\"\n\nCapital One isn't the only company taking issue with AWS costs. Business Insider's Eugene Kim reported in October that AI startups are increasingly delaying traditional AWS spend in favor of AI model and developer tools, according to internal Amazon documents from March and July.\n\nThe documents said that 90% of startups in Radical Ventures' portfolio were building primarily on rival clouds due to AWS costs. Amazon also noted internally that there was increasing demand from customers for neocloud providers, which let them rent GPU power in small chunks and only pay for what they use.\n\nWhen that story published in October, an AWS spokesperson said Business Insider was \"using old data to reach outdated conclusions,\" noting that \"AWS remains the top choice for startups to build because we offer the best core services as well as the most innovative and powerful generative AI offerings.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "AI Security Institute report finds most common type of AI tech used was general purpose assistants such as ChatGPT and Amazon Alexa\n\nA third of UK citizens have used artificial intelligence for emotional support, companionship or social interaction, according to the government’s AI security body.\n\nThe AI Security Institute (AISI) said nearly one in 10 people used systems like chatbots for emotional purposes on a weekly basis, and 4% daily.\n\nAISI called for further research, citing the death this year of the US teenager Adam Raine, who killed himself after discussing suicide with ChatGPT.\n\n“People are increasingly turning to AI systems for emotional support or social interaction,” AISI said in its first Frontier AI Trends report. “While many users report positive experiences, recent high-profile cases of harm underline the need for research into this area, including the conditions under which harm could occur, and the safeguards that could enable beneficial use.”\n\nAISI based its research on a representative survey of 2,028 UK participants. It found the most common type of AI used for emotional purposes was “general purpose assistants” such as ChatGPT, accounting for nearly six out of 10 uses, followed by voice assistants including Amazon Alexa.\n\nIt also highlighted a Reddit forum dedicated to discussing AI companions on the CharacterAI platform. It showed that, whenever there were outages on the site, there were large numbers of posts showing symptoms of withdrawal such as anxiety, depression and restlessness.\n\nThe report included AISI research suggesting chatbots can sway people’s political opinions, with the most persuasive AI models delivering “substantial” amounts of inaccurate information in the process.\n\nAISI examined more than 30 unnamed cutting-edge models, thought to include those developed by ChatGPT startup OpenAI, Google and Meta. It found AI models were doubling their performance in some areas every eight months.\n\nLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.\n\nAISI added that AI systems are now up to 90% better than PhD-level experts at providing troubleshooting advice for laboratory experiments. It said improvements in knowledge on chemistry and biology were “well beyond PhD-level expertise”.\n\nIt also highlighted the models’ ability to browse online and autonomously find sequences necessary for designing DNA molecules called plasmids that are useful in areas such as genetic engineering.\n\nTests for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control, showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.\n\nHowever, no models have shown a spontaneous attempt to replicate or hide their capabilities, and AISI said any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.\n\nAnother safety concern known as “sandbagging”, where models hide their strengths in evaluations, was also covered by AISI. It said some systems can sandbag when prompted to do so, but this has not happened spontaneously during tests.\n\nIt found significant progress in AI safeguards, particularly in hampering attempts to create biological weapons. In two tests conducted six months apart, the first test took 10 minutes to “jailbreak” an AI system – or force it to give an unsafe answer related to biological misuse – but the second test took more than seven hours, indicating models had become much safer in a short space of time.\n\nResearch also showed autonomous AI agents being used for high-stakes activities such as asset transfers.\n\nIt said AI systems are competing with or even surpassing human experts already in a number of domains, making it “plausible” in the coming years that artificial general intelligence can be achieved, which is the term for systems that can perform most intellectual tasks at the same level as a human. AISI described the pace of development as “extraordinary”.\n\nRegarding agents, or systems that can carry out multi-step tasks without intervention, AISI said its evaluations showed a “steep rise in the length and complexity of tasks AI can complete without human guidance”.",

Although Nova models earned some praise for their efficiency, they still trail frontier models such as OpenAI's GPT offerings, Anthropic's Claude Opus, and Google's Gemini.\n\nAs part of the shake-up, Amazon is creating a new organization under Peter DeSantis, AWS's SVP of Utility Computing, Jassy said. The group will oversee Amazon's AGI and AI model initiatives as well as its silicon chip and quantum computing efforts.\n\nJassy also said that Pieter Abbeel, the co-founder of robotics startup Covariant, who joined Amazon last year, will now lead the company's frontier AI model research team.\n\nPrasad's departure is the latest in a series of leadership changes at AWS. Over the past year, the company has seen several executives depart, including VP of AI Matt Wood and VP of generative AI Vasi Philomin, while bringing in new talent such as former Microsoft executive Julia White as chief marketing officer.\n\nAWS also recently hired David Richardson as VP of AgentCore and Joe Hellerstein as Vice President and Distinguished Scientist, and added Chet Kapoor as VP of security services and observability.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Mystery solved: Amazon is the prospective tenant in talks with data center developer rocked by stock plunge",
    "description": "\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer told Business Insider. The deal would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, he said.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is the prospective tenant that withdrew funding from Fermi America's massive data-center project, sending the developer's stock plummeting earlier this month, Business Insider has learned.\n\nIn September, Fermi, which is developing an 11-gigawatt data-center campus in the Texas Panhandle, said it had agreed to a nonbinding letter of intent with an investment-grade tenant to anchor the project. The tenant would take the first gigawatt of power across 12 facilities.\n\nOn Friday, December 12, Fermi's stock plunged by nearly half after a securities filing said an unnamed prospective partner had canceled a $150 million advance to begin construction, known as an Advance in Aid of Construction Agreement, or AICA. The cancellation followed the end of an exclusivity period.\n\nAmazon is that tenant, Toby Neugebauer, Fermi's billionaire CEO, confirmed in a December 15 phone call with Business Insider, discussing the talks that led to the cancellation. The tech giant has been negotiating the deal, which would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, Neugebauer said.\n\n\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Neugebauer said.\n\nNeugebauer said the talks between Fermi and the tenant remain constructive, and that the ending of the AICA didn't indicate any breakdown in conversation.\n\n\"It's just a normal negotiation,\" he said. \"Their issue was spending money after the exclusive period had ended.\"\n\nNeugebauer said he wasn't worried about the talks taking too long. \"It's a big deal,\" he said. \"Big deals take longer.\"\n\nLisa Levandowski, a spokesperson for Amazon, declined to comment.\n\nFermi America's Panhandle project ranks among the most ambitious attempts yet to meet the surging energy demands of the data centers fueling the AI boom. The company intends to bring 11 gigawatts of new power online over the next decade-plus with a mix of power from the grid, natural gas, and nuclear sources.\n\nThe company went public in September, pricing its shares at $21 to raise more than $680 million.\n\nDubbed Project Matador, the development relies on a 99-year ground lease with the Texas Tech University System. That agreement is dependent on a signed letter of intent between Fermi America and a tenant.\n\nThe December 12 filing said that none of the $150 million construction advance had been used and that the negotiations were ongoing. The letter of intent remains in force.\n\nAnalysts at Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note published December 12 that they had spoken to Fermi America's management and learned that, per the company, the anchor tenant \"tried to make last-minute changes to the agreement pricing that were unacceptable to\" Fermi.\n\nAmazon is the second company to be linked to the project. In October, Neugebauer told the Amarillo City Council that Palantir, the software company known for its police and government contracts, had taken an interest in the site.\n\n\"I just finished with Palantir, which is our nation's tip of the spear in the AI war,\" Neugebauer said during the October 28 meeting. \"They'll be here Thursday.\"\n\nThe Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said in their note that management indicated that they were \"active\" with two additional tenants, and in dialogue with another four.\n\nFermi America was founded less than a year ago by Neugebauer, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Perry's son Griffin. The IPO valued the company at nearly $14 billion.\n\nA recent slump in the company's shares has brought its valuation to below $6 billion.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "OpenAI seeking to strike latest deal in its efforts to pay for huge spending on datacentres\n\nAmazon is in talks to invest more than $10bn (£7.5bn) in OpenAI, in the latest funding deal being struck by the startup behind ChatGPT.\n\nIf it goes ahead, the market valuation of OpenAI could rise above $500bn, according to The Information, a tech news site that revealed the negotiations.\n\nAmazon, which is best known as an online retailer, is also the world’s largest datacentre provider and its investment would help OpenAI pay for its commitments to rent capacity from cloud computing companies – including Amazon.\n\nOpenAI said last month it would spend $38bn on capacity from Amazon Web Services – the company’s datacentre arm – over seven years. The Information said that OpenAI planned to use Amazon’s Trainium chips, which compete with Nvidia and Google’s chips. It also reported that Amazon’s financing could lead to a broader fundraising round with other investors.\n\nOpenAI’s spending commitment on compute – the chips and servers that power its chatbot – is $1.4tn over the next eight years, a figure far in excess of its reported $13bn in annual revenues.\n\nAs a result, the lossmaking company has been seeking further funding and has converted its main business into a for-profit corporation. Its main longtime backer, Microsoft, has taken a stake of roughly 27% in a deal that valued OpenAI at $500bn.\n\nOpenAI is also considering an initial public offering – selling its shares to the general public – in a move that could value the company at up to $1tn, according to Reuters.\n\nOther deals struck by OpenAI this year include Oracle spending $300bn on building datacentres in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI is expected to pay back roughly the same amount to use the sites.\n\nIn another transaction with Nvidia, OpenAI will pay in cash for chips and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares.\n\nOpenAI announced on Tuesday that it had hired the former UK chancellor George Osborne to develop relationships with governments around the world and broker national-level AI projects.\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, has declared a “code red” staff alert to lead a fightback against competitors led by Google, whose update of its Gemini AI tool gave it an edge over rivals including ChatGPT.\n\nThe Amazon talks reportedly include discussing commercial opportunities and selling a corporate version of ChatGPT to the online retailer.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment. Amazon has been approached for comment.",

    "description": "Harris Beber says that when he finds a role that aligns with these 3 things, he's able to find the most fulfillment in his career.",
    "fullText": "It's human nature to reach for the shiny object in front of you — but Monday.com's CMO says it's worth pausing before you accept the first job offer that comes along.\n\nHarris Beber has acted as the CMO of Vimeo, Global CMO of Google Workspace, and also held marketing executive positions at other companies including Amazon. He's no stranger to changing jobs — and he believes switching roles can be the right move when the work no longer feels fulfilling.\n\nIn the past, Beber told Business Insider that he's explored new roles in times when he was doing really well at work but feeling unfulfilled. That feeling can't last forever, he said.\n\n\"Eventually your work will suffer, your performance will suffer, and it doesn't end well for anyone,\" Beber said.\n\nTo avoid acting out of desperation or necessity, Beber said he tries to map out his next role before he gets to the point of needing a new job. The CMO said it's important to know your criteria for success when thinking about what's next.\n\n\"What is really important to you? What are your non-starters? And if you can look at those objectively, then when you have opportunities, you can measure it against something objective,\" Beber said.\n\nHe said he's used 3 P's to determine if his last few roles were the right fit: people, product, and position.\n\nIn regards to the first P, Beber said he tries to evaluate whether the people he's going to work with are right for him. He said it's \"not easy to get up every day\" and work with people you don't like or who don't treat others well.\n\nIn one job, Beber said he worked for a difficult leader who yelled, \"put intense pressure\" on the team, and treated him and others poorly. He said he would never work in that kind of environment again.\n\nBeyond working with respectful coworkers, Beber said it's also important to make sure that the people you work alongside have complementary skills that will help you work well together.\n\nIf you're a marketer, when it comes to evaluating the product you're selling, Beber said, it's important to understand the user base and product offerings.\n\n\"Do you care about it? Does it excite you? It's really hard to sell something to other people if you don't understand it or aren't excited by it,\" the CMO said.\n\nBeber said he made the mistake of once taking the wrong role at a sports tech startup. He said he really liked the people, but he's \"not a sports person,\" and didn't understand the product. Beber said he ultimately didn't find happiness in that job.\n\nWhen it comes to evaluating the position, Beber said he wants to find a role where he feels aligned and can add value to the company.\n\n\"Is what I'm great at? What the company needs?\" Beber said.\n\nBeber said he's felt the most fulfilled in his career when those three criteria line up. People are \"really good at selling themselves\" on why an opportunity seems perfect in the moment, he said, which is why measuring the offer against something objective is critical.\n\nWhen someone makes you a job offer, \"they're going to tell you every reason why you're perfect for the role and why it's going to be great,\" Beber said. \"But as anyone goes into a new role, very rarely is it exactly what you thought it would be.\"",

Users can choose a channel and start watching, with the Reels playing automatically.\n\nInstagram for TV is part of the platform's ongoing effort to adapt to the ways users are connecting via the app. The company said in a press release that it has heard from its community that \"watching Reels together is more fun,\" so the product was designed with that social aspect in mind.\n\nTessa Lyons, VP of product at Instagram, told Business Insider that the team heard from users who were finding ways to cast their Reels to the TV so they could watch them with friends.\n\n\"People already want to get together and connect with each other over Reels on the TV,\" she said, adding that this allows them to actually share with friends. \"Not just DMing them, but actually be together enjoying them.\"\n\nLyons said she personally felt the need for this feature when she realized, while on the couch watching TV with her husband, she was often actually watching Reels on her phone instead.\n\nInstagram for TV is in a testing phase, with plans to eventually expand to more devices and countries. Instagram said this early test is designed to learn which features are best for shared viewing on a TV screen.\n\nFuture features could include using your phone as a remote, more intuitive ways to surf channels, and channels that combine your and your friends' interests into one shared feed, like Instagram's Blend feature.\n\nUp to five Instagram accounts can be connected to the Amazon Fire TV device. Once you click into your account, Instagram will automatically group Reels into a channel based on your interests.\n\nLyons said Instagram's North Star has always been \"helping people connect with their friends over creativity,\" adding that the goal has remained even as the platform and the way people use it have changed.\n\n\"The way in which people share evolves,\" she said. \"I think that's natural.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "iRobot, the maker of the Roomba robot vacuum cleaner, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this week after years of mounting financial struggles and a failed $1.4 billion acquisition deal with Amazon.\n\nThe 35-year-old company once reigned supreme in the world of robotic vacuums, but its dominance waned amid rising competition from lower-cost rivals and weakening consumer demand.\n\nHere's a look back at how this once mighty, pioneering robotics company arrived at this moment.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by three roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — Colin Angle, Helen Greiner, and Rodney Brooks — who had a \"vision of making practical robots a reality,\" the company says on its website.\n\niRobot focused on designing robots for space-related research and military use in its early years.\n\nIn 1998, the Massachusetts-based company won a contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA, to build a tactical mobile robot. This led to the development of iRobot's PackBot, which was later used in search operations at Manhattan's Ground Zero following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nIn 2002, iRobot had its consumer breakthrough with its debut of the Roomba, its iconic self-cleaning disc-shaped vacuum.\n\nOver the next two decades, the company went on to release dozens of Roomba models. It has sold over 50 million models globally since.\n\niRobot went public in November 2005 with its IPO priced at $24 per share. It began trading its shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol IRBT.\n\niRobot saw its annual revenue peak in 2021 at $1.56 billion, but sales have been falling ever since.\n\nSales dropped, in part, thanks to stiffer competition from Chinese rivals like Dreame, Roborock, and Ecovacs, as well as other brands such as Shark and Samsung.\n\nAmazon agreed to buy iRobot in 2022 for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction, but the deal collapsed two years later with the companies saying there was \"no path to regulatory approval in the European Union.\"\n\nThe same day the companies announced that the proposed merger was scrapped in January 2024, iRobot cut 31% of its staff, and Angle, iRobot's cofounder and longtime CEO, also stepped down.\n\nIn a March 2025 earnings report, iRobot said there was \"substantial doubt\" about the company's ability to continue.\n\niRobot attempted to find a new buyer after its deal with Amazon collapsed. In an October 2025 regulatory filing, it said the last remaining potential acquirer pulled out \"following a lengthy period of exclusive negotiations.\"\n\nThe company warned that without fresh funding, it \"may be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations and would likely seek bankruptcy protection.\"\n\niRobot filed for Chapter 11 on December 14 and said the company would be acquired by its China-based primary contract manufacturer and lender, Picea Robotics, through a court-supervised process. Under the deal, iRobot would be taken private.\n\nThe company said it expects to continue to operate as normal and does not anticipate any disruption to its core operations, including its app and ongoing product support.\n\n\"The transaction will strengthen our financial position and will help deliver continuity for our consumers, customers, and partners,\" said iRobot CEO Gary Cohen.",

Starting today, you can download the new Instagram for TV app to watch Reels on your big screen via a dedicated interface that should be way more natural than simply casting the mobile app from your phone.\n\nCurrently exclusive to Amazon devices, the Instagram for TV app supports up to five accounts and comes with full functionality for searching for Reels and profiles, as well as liking Reels and browsing comments or reactions (although text posts and photo posts are not included). Unlike on the standard mobile feed, Amazon says \"Reels are organized into channels tuned to your interests,\" which you can see from a horizontal home screen.\n\nThese channels are somewhat similar to the YouTube Shorts interface that's baked into the standard YouTube TV app, showing you a small selection of shorts you can choose from based on a thumbnail. Examples include \"For you\" and \"Popular with Friends,\" but you're also still able to swipe past any Reel to your heart's content, and let the algorithm take you for a ride. A post from Meta also says channels could include Reels tailored to a specific topics that match your interests, like \"sports highlights\" or \"hidden travel gems,\" although the company hasn't provided any screenshots or videos showing this off quite yet.\n\nAccording to Meta, the new app is currently \"an early test.\" It's starting with U.S.-based Amazon devices, and the company says it will \"expand to more devices and countries\" as it learns more (Amazon also says it's the \"first\" company to get the app, implying others will get their own versions in the future).\n\nCurrently, the Instagram for TV app is available in the Amazon Appstore for the following devices:\n\nFire TV Stick 4K Max (1st and 2nd Gen)\n\nIn addition to adding channels to the Reels experience, Meta says that future updates may also add ways to use your phone as a remote, share feeds with friends, and explore \"a more intuitive way to channel surf.\"\n\nInstagram for TV leaves TikTok as the last major short form video platform without a dedicated TV app, although The Information reported earlier this Summer that TikTok is looking to catch up soon.\n\nWhile official Instagram for TV support is currently limited to Amazon devices, that doesn't mean you're out of luck if you don't have a Fire TV stick or display. To watch Instagram Reels on your TV without using the Instagram for TV app, open Instagram Reels on your phone and start browsing. Next, pull up your phone's quick settings menu by swiping down from the top-right corner.\n\nOn iOS, search for the screen mirroring button (which looks like two overlapping screens), and on Android, search for a button that says something like \"Cast\" (it will vary depending on your device). Tap it to see any compatible wireless screen mirroring devices nearby, which will let you view the mobile Instagram app on a TV screen, and even send audio over with it. It's not foolproof—my LG OLED TV works with iOS Screen Mirroring but not Pixel casting—but it's worth a shot.",

    "title": "RTO mandates are running into a space problem",
    "description": "Companies like AT&T, Amazon, JPMorgan, and Instagram have a RTO problem: there's not enough places for workers to sit.",
    "fullText": "Your mileage may vary on Instagram's recent corporate culture updates (to the extent you care at all). Fewer meetings: excellent. Faster decisions: great. Return-to-office five days a week: woof, but such is life. Return-to-office five days a week when there aren't enough places for people to sit: What??? At least Instagram chief Adam Mosseri is aware of the issue — in a memo to staff, he said New York employees get a pass on the butts-in-seats mandate until the company figures out where all those butts will go. The timeline is TBD.\n\nAfter the pandemic-driven wave of remote work, many employees are being dragged, kicking and screaming, back into the office. For workers at companies such as Amazon, JPMorgan, and Starbucks, the perpetual workday-in-your-pajamas party is over. The odd wrinkle is that in some cases, it's not just employees who aren't ready to be back at work every day. Their employers aren't ready for it, either, at least logistically. They're telling people to come to the office without having the actual space for them to be there. So, workers are competing for desks, setting up shop in common areas, or refusing to show up altogether until their employers have a more well-thought-out plan. It's emblematic of the broader issues surrounding RTO mandates: Many companies are implementing them without a solid logic as to how or why and alienating their employees — intentionally or not — in the process.\n\nMultiple big-name companies have had some small-time whoopsie daisies on back-to-office space constraints.\n\nIn late 2024, AT&T acknowledged in a memo to employees that they would not offer \"one-for-one seating per employee\" as they were called back in. At the time, employees told Business Insider that workers were filling up hallways or hanging out in the cafeteria in order to check the attendance box. Around the same time, Amazon wound up delaying its RTO ask for some employees because their spots weren't ready. Not only were there not enough desks, but workers also complained that offices and meeting rooms were lacking in chairs.\n\nEarlier this year, JPMorgan employees required to come back found themselves in a sort of Hunger Games situation for spots, showing up extra early and leaving behind possessions to mark their spots and signing on from vacation to try to book scarce desk space. On Reddit, some employees described the situation as \"pure chaos,\" and complained of being unable to accomplish work because \"half the morning is spent on desk f***ery.\" One JPMorgan employee told me that they often find themselves seated far away from the rest of their team because someone else reserved their regular spot, and there are often lines for the women's bathroom at the New York office where they work.\n\nHow much office space is needed and what to do with it is a perpetual conundrum. Just look at all the hate for open-office floor plans. But the pandemic added more complications to an already complicated situation. As the RTO wave has picked up momentum, space has become a significant issue at many companies, both large and small, including giant federal agencies. So what gives?\n\nSome of it is simply a result of poor planning, explains Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work. Decisions are made at the executive level without proper consultation with facilities personnel, who have detailed information on desks and seating. \"It's not as easy as adding up people and comparing to desks, as it matters which cities and offices they are in,\" he says in an email. \"Kind of like airlines that some flights may be overbooked and others half-empty.\"\n\nSome of the shortages may be on purpose. Strict RTO mandates are often viewed, at least in part, as a soft layoff — companies expect some level of attrition when they force people back, even if they won't openly admit it. \"Having insufficient seating is all part of the plan,\" Bloom says. \"If you want a 10% head count reduction, you only need seating for 90% of the folks.\"\n\nBrian Elliott, the CEO of Work Forward, a future of work think tank and consultancy, says that when executives started to think about bringing people back to the office in about 2021, many were surprised to learn how low the percentage of their workforce actually showing up on a given day had been pre-2020, because of sick time, vacations, workers visiting customers, etc. \"So your average CFO looks at this and goes, 'It's a 60% utilized asset on average. Why am I doing assigned seating? Why not go to hoteling and hot desking?'\" Elliott says. Add in the belief that at least some sort of remote work would stick around (especially as companies offered it as a perk to attract workers in a tight labor market), and many companies decided to downsize their overall office footprint to save some cash. Now, as businesses decide they want everyone back in full-time, they're realizing they axed too many desks.\n\nSome companies are moving in the other direction, and are on the hunt for more spacious offices. But that process takes time, and economic uncertainty has leaders nervous to go too big. Commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE says economic jitters, high interest rates, and slow growth in in-person jobs has been somewhat of a drag on office leasing activity this year, but the overall trend is up: A growing majority of its office occupants expect to maintain or expand their space over the next three years, while the share anticipating downsizing is steadily decreasing.\n\n\"Companies are taking more spaces, so clearly, they are very comfortable in expansionary mode,\" says Henry Chin, global head of research at CBRE.\n\nThat doesn't mean employees should expect to be drowning in spacious offices anytime soon — businesses are driving toward higher people-to-desk ratios, not lower. So instead of a single assigned desk for every person, there are multiple people sharing. Per CBRE, the most common ratio today is 1-1.49 employees per seat, and the plan is to up it. \"Ultimately, they want to have the higher ratio, that two or three people share a desk,\" Chin says.\n\nIn other words, however you feel about hotel desking, you might want to get used to it.\n\nThe RTO battle in America is proving to be quite the push-and-pull. Remote work is falling, but it hasn't gone away: According to Bloom's tracker, about 25% of work is being done from home in the US, compared to 62% in the spring of 2020, the height of the pandemic, and well under 10% prior to the lockdowns. And just because companies ask workers to come back doesn't mean they're all complying — there's a delta between what employers are asking, and employees are giving, RTO-wise. As the job market weakens, employees may be inclined to give in and commute more. You want your boss to see you enough that they at least feel a little guilty when they fire you.\n\nThese space-related headaches are reflective of broader questions about where and how it's best for people to work, and what sort of planning needs to be put into it. Some executives seem to be knee-jerk demanding people come back in without considering whether that's how their teams work best, or whether the infrastructure can handle it. A five-day-a-week office mandate isn't super helpful if teams are located all over the country and everyone's just sitting on video calls all day. Some companies are discovering they need more small meeting rooms, not just a few large ones, so people can gather if they are in the same place. And some are falling short on basic blocking and tackling — having working WiFi, or supplying sufficient monitors and equipment. In the internet age, it's a little tough to get work done when you don't have the internet itself, or a keyboard or a mouse.\n\nEmployers may be \"conflating productivity and effectiveness with proximity\" in insisting people show up full-time, explains Melissa Daimler, a corporate culture consultant. \"If I can see you and I know that you're working, then I feel good about how productive we are as a company.\" Much of the issue comes down to trust — businesses feeling confident that their people will get the work done when they're in the office collaborating and when they're at home for the day. \"It takes an extra kind of set of planning skills and a system that you put in place as a company and a team,\" she says.\n\nThe space problem is one that companies should fix, whether they actually will is another question. Your employees aren't going to love the return of long commutes and sad salad desk lunches, whatever you do, but they're probably going to be even more annoyed if, at the end of that commute, they find themselves eating that sad salad on the floor in the hallway, seated next to their laptop.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "\"Mighty Nein\" is the Critical Role crew's second animated series project with Amazon.",
    "fullText": "The eight cofounders of the nerdworld business Critical Role came roaring back to Prime Video with the November debut of \"The Mighty Nein.\"\n\nThe business's eight cofounders first started out streaming their home \"Dungeons & Dragons\" game on Twitch. Then, in 2019, CR raised seed funding of over $11.3 million to create the animated series \"The Legend of Vox Machina.\"\n\n\"The Mighty Nein,\" based on their second Twitch-streamed \"D&D\" campaign, is their second animated series on Prime Video.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider in November, the cofounders outlined some of the biggest challenges they faced — and the lessons they learned — making the show.\n\n\"The largest challenge was trying to figure out how we were going to reorganize, and how we introduced the world,\" Critical Role CEO Travis Willingham said.\n\nConverting a 141-episode campaign into a show for Prime Video meant covering lots of on-stream ground, Willingham said. The team had to make a \"massive shift\" in how characters and plot points were introduced.\n\n\"For us, the livestream campaign was so good at sort of feeding one little nugget at a time, and the world got bigger and bigger and bigger. We thought it was far more effective to just hit you with the larger pieces at play and let those things sort of inform the characters and the storylines as you go along,\" Willingham added.\n\nWillingham said these hints set the stage for more developments down the road.\n\n\"We are going to sort of peel back the layers of that onion as we go along,\" Willingham said. \"But we are certainly taking our time and saving things for season two as well. So we're not in a rush.\"\n\nCofounder Sam Riegel told Business Insider that the crew's longtime game master, Matthew Mercer, had created an \"incredible continent filled with politics and socioeconomic strife and war, and ruin, and religious exploration.\"\n\n\"To show all of the antagonists, the villains, the political intrigue that's going on around our characters, we needed a whole other plot line to show what was going on in the background,\" Riegel said.\n\nRiegel added that another key challenge with the \"Mighty Nein\" was the complexity of some of the main characters' backstories.\n\n\"We don't want to throw all those backstories in the audience's face right at the top, but we do want to tease out that they come with baggage and trauma and issues that they have to work through,\" Riegel said.\n\n\"Luckily, we were afforded hourlong episodes in which to do so, and I think it paints a rich tapestry,\" Riegel said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mercer wove in information and plot points from the campaign that even Twitch viewers back in the day weren't aware of. That included more information on the series' key antagonists, the wizard Volstruckers, and the mysterious and enigmatic academic, Essek Thelyss, whom Mercer voices.\n\n\"We had the opportunity to dig in with the writer's rooms and the rest of the creative team to collaborate on how best to see that now fleshed out and shown and explored with the audience through this animated series,\" Mercer said. \"So there weren't too many changes. A lot of it was mainly just taking what was there or things that were sitting in my head and going, 'Alright, now we get to actually show this. That's really cool and exciting. Let's do it.'\"\n\nOne of the big challenges the team had to overcome was articulating the intricate aspects of an in-game world through animation. And that spanned character costumes and memorable campaign locations.\n\n\"When I sent Matt (Mercer) my idea of where Jester grew up and what the Lavish Chateau was, I had this strong visual in my mind,\" cofounder and cast member Laura Bailey said, referring to her character, the trickster cleric Jester.\n\n\"And then to see it in the animated series, it's so strange that they can capture exactly what it was that we've visualized for so long, and now everybody else gets to see these stunning set pieces that have existed only in this little world,\" Bailey added.\n\nCofounder Taliesin Jaffe said that he'd been \"very, very specific\" as well about how the carnival his character, Mollymauk Tealeaf, traveled with — should be animated.\n\n\"I'm famous for making very easy-to-animate character designs — I say deeply sarcastically,\" Jaffe joked.\n\nThe Critical Role team also had to look into how each character's magic was represented on-screen. For Liam O'Brien, it was crucial that his wizard, Caleb Widogast, cast magic in a manner that resembled a \"learned science,\" complete with alchemy and specific components.\n\nThe crew, O'Brien said, was also just happy to have the \"luxury of time\" to go back and revisit moments from their old \"D&D\" campaign.\n\n\"I am in love with the complicated world that this show has created — and that Sam and Travis have helmed — as we've all, in an all-hands effort, just created everything with love,\" O'Brien said.",

    "fullText": "The parent company of Roomba, which has sold millions of cleaning robots, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday after 35 years of operation.\n\nIn a Sunday press release, Massachusetts-based robotics company iRobot said it had filed for bankruptcy protection in the District of Delaware court.\n\nThe company said that it would be wholly acquired by its main manufacturer and lender, vacuum cleaner maker Shenzhen PICEA. Picea has R&D and manufacturing facilities in China and Vietnam, per the release.\n\nThe Picea deal would allow iRobot to continue operating, developing new products, make \"timely payments to vendors and creditors,\" and meet its commitments to employees, the release said.\n\nUnder the deal, iRobot will be a private company owned by Picea, and its common stock will be wiped from stock exchanges.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by three roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company introduced the Roomba, its iconic disc-shaped vacuuming robot, in 2002.\n\nThe bankruptcy deal follows several quarters of weak sales and a cash crunch. The company wrote in its third-quarter earnings report that, as of September 27, its cash totaled $24.8 million, compared to $40.6 million as of June 28.\n\niRobot said it had withdrawn $5 million in restricted cash on September 27, after which it had \"no sources upon which it can draw for additional capital.\"\n\nIts third-quarter revenue, $145.8 million, was about a 25% drop compared to the same period the year before, with sales dropping 33% in the US.\n\nLast month, the company warned that the last possible iRobot buyer had backed out of a deal, which left it likely to pursue bankruptcy.\n\niRobot went through a failed acquisition attempt by Amazon. In 2022, Amazon announced that it would buy iRobot for $1.7 billion, but pulled the deal in January 2024, citing regulatory hurdles in the US and Europe.\n\nThe collapse of the Amazon deal hit iRobot hard. On the same day as Amazon's announcement, iRobot said it would lay off 31% of its staff, and its CEO, Colin Angle, would step down.\n\niRobot's stock price has dropped more than 50% in the past year and more than 90% in the past five years.",

    "description": "Almost a month after Prime Video launched AI-powered Video Recaps, viewers said it shared incorrect plot details about season one of \"Fallout.\"",
    "fullText": "Given the length of time it can take for the new season of your favorite TV show to come out, it's understandable that you might want a little video recap of what's happened so far.\n\nIdeally, that recap is accurate.\n\nFans of Amazon's hit show \"Fallout\" said that wasn't the case in its AI-made synopsis of season one, released ahead of the hit show's new season next week. Fans quickly spotted factual errors, and Amazon Prime Video took down the recap.\n\nOne Redditor said the AI feature told viewers that a flashback featuring the Ghoul (one of the main characters, played by Walton Goggins) took place in the 1950s instead of 2077.\n\nAn X user posted that the recap also mischaracterized the agreement the Ghoul and Lucy MacLean (played by Ella Purnell) made in the \"Fallout\" finale.\n\nInstead of saying the pair is teaming up to find Lucy's father, the recap said the Ghoul gave Lucy an ultimatum: \"die or join him.\"\n\nAmazon first launched its Video Recap, a feature that allows users to catch up on Prime Original TV shows between seasons, for beta testing in November.\n\n\"Video Recaps use AI to identify a show's most important plot points, combining them with synchronized voice narration, dialogue snippets, and music to create a visual summary that prepares viewers for the new season,\" the company said in a press release at the time.\n\nThe TV shows that Amazon said were undergoing Video Recaps testing — \"Jack Ryan,\" \"Upload,\" \"Bosch,\" and \"The Rig\" — did not include the feature at the time of writing.\n\nRepresentatives for Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLike so many companies, Amazon is investing heavily in AI.\n\nDuring the company's February earnings call, Chief Finance Officer Brian Olsavsky said that 2025 capital expenditures could reach over $100 billion, with the majority of it going toward AI and Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing platform.\n\nMany of Amazon's consumer services have integrated AI to enhance user engagement and experience, such as product suggestions and helping shoppers on its online platform find clothes that fit. In February, Amazon unveiled Alexa+, the next generation of Alexa, which is powered by generative AI to make it more conversational and personalized for users.\n\nEmbracing AI at Amazon, though, hasn't been without growing pains. In October, the company cited AI as it announced it would lay off 14,000 staff members.\n\n\"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),\" Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, wrote in a blog post at the time.\n\nIn an internal message to the remaining staff, Amazon Vice President of Device Software and Services Tapas Roy asked them to \"lean in on AI.\"\n\n\"Moving forward, we remain focused on our mission to help product teams launch delightful products,\" Roy wrote. \"In support of this mission, I encourage you all to: Focus on the work that most directly impacts our customers, lean in on Al to enhance your effectiveness, [and] raise your hand when you see opportunities to simplify or eliminate unnecessary processes.\"",

They will be the first new games in the series since 2018, and both will be published by Amazon.\n\nAnnounced at the Game Awards in LA, Tomb Raider Catalyst stars the “charismatic, self-assured, formidable Lara Croft” from the original 1990s games, says game director Will Kerslake. It’s set in the markets, mountains, and naturally the ancient buildings of northern India, where Lara is racing with other treasure hunters to track down potentially cataclysmic artefacts. It will be out in 2027.\n\nCatalyst is in development at Crystal Dynamics, the Canadian developer that has looked after Tomb Raider since 2003. Crystal Dynamics previously developed Tomb Raiders Legend, Anniversary and Underworld, as well as the reboot trilogy that featured a younger, more vulnerable Lara. Its most recent game in the series was 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider.\n\nTomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, meanwhile, is being developed in collaboration with Flying Wild Hog in Poland. Featuring modernised combat and redesigned tomb-delving puzzles, the game is an “expanded” ground-up reimagining of Lara Croft’s very first 1996 adventure, which established her as one of gaming’s most recognisable characters. “Our goal was to respect the spirit of Core Design’s original game, while updating the experience for today’s gamers including building it with Unreal Engine 5,” Kerslake says. “We see this is a reimagining of the original game with a gameplay experience that wasn’t possible on the technology at the time.” Legacy of Atlantis will be out in 2026.\n\nIn both games, Croft will be played by the British actor Alix Wilton Regan, who previously had significant roles in Dragon Age: Inquisition and Cyberpunk 2077. She was also due to star as Joanna Dark in the cancelled remake of 2000’s spy-shooter Perfect Dark.\n\nDespite the series’ recent hiatus, Tomb Raider still has immense brand recognition, built on its 1990s heyday. Amazon also has a TV series in the works with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, which is to star Sophie Turner as Croft. Over 30 years, Croft has been everything from Playboy pin-up to rugged wilderness adventurer to gentlewoman action hero.\n\n“Across the series, our goal is to show that Lara is always evolving,” Kerslake says. “Her core DNA will remain, but we believe it’s important to show how each adventure shapes her character over time.”",

    "fullText": "Most people don't get told their genius might destroy the company they built. But Jeff Bezos isn't most people. At Italian Tech Week in October, the Amazon founder looked back on an early piece of feedback that changed the way he approached invention—and may have helped save Amazon from becoming its own worst enemy.\n\n\"I am an inventor,\" Bezos told the audience. \"This is my fundamental nature.\" His favorite place? In a room with a whiteboard, surrounded by a small group, spitballing ideas. \"You can literally put me in front of a whiteboard and I can come up with a hundred ideas in half an hour,\" he said with a grin.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\n\nBut that endless flow of innovation—once considered a superpower—nearly became a liability. In the early years of Amazon, one longtime executive pulled Bezos aside with a blunt warning. \"Jeff, you have enough ideas to destroy Amazon,\" Jeff Wilke told him.\n\nIt stunned him. \"This was such a shocking idea for me,\" Bezos admitted. Wilke, a manufacturing expert, saw the problem clearly: every new idea was essentially a task dropped into a queue. If the company couldn't absorb it fast enough, it wasn't just useless—it was destructive.\n\n\"You have to release the work at the right rate that the organization can accept it,\" Bezo said, quoting Wilke. \"You're creating a backlog, a queue, work in process. It's adding no value and in fact, it's creating distraction.\"\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nThat was the moment Bezos shifted. Instead of flooding Amazon with nonstop initiatives, he started filtering. \"I started prioritizing the ideas better, keeping lists of them, keeping them to myself until the organization was ready,\" he said.\n\nEven more important, Bezos began thinking like a builder—not just of ideas, but of infrastructure. \"How can I build an organization that can be ready for more ideas?\" he said. The answer was scaling leadership, growing bandwidth, and creating systems that could handle multiple innovations at once.\n\nAmazon didn't slow down after that—it got smarter. \"We built a company that's very good at inventing and doing more than one thing at a time,\" Bezos said. But none of it worked until he accepted a hard truth: ideas are powerful, but only if they're released at the right moment. Without discipline, even genius becomes a liability.",

    "description": "Amazon plans a new rush pickup service for one-hour in-store orders, strengthening rapid delivery and click-and-collect offering.",
    "fullText": "Amazon wants more shoppers to get orders within an hour. A new kind of in-store pickup could be its next move to make that happen.\n\nAmazon is developing a \"rush\" pickup service that will let shoppers collect their orders at Amazon-owned stores within an hour, according to an internal document and a person familiar with the matter.\n\nShoppers will be able to place a \"unified\" order from both Amazon's online marketplace and items stocked in Amazon-owned stores, the document explained. The company operates several physical retail formats, including Whole Foods, Fresh grocery stores, and Go convenience stores.\n\nThe tech giant plans to pilot-launch the new program in at least one metro area by the first quarter of 2026, according to this document. The initiative is tracked by Amazon's SVPs, the most senior group of leaders at the company, it noted. However, it's uncertain whether that timeline is still in effect, said the person familiar, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe new pickup service would be Amazon's latest attempt to enable ultrafast, sub-one-hour deliveries.\n\nJust last week, the company launched Amazon Now, a new 30-minute delivery service in parts of Seattle and Philadelphia. It has also been testing similarly quick delivery offerings in countries such as the UK, India, and Mexico.\n\nFor those who want to pick up in-store, Amazon currently offers next-day pickup on some US online orders. Grocery subscribers can also collect select items in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIn-store pickup, often referred to as \"click-and-collect,\" is surging in e-commerce. Total US sales from click-and-collect services are expected to hit $112.96 billion this year, up 17% from 2023, and grow to $129.33 billion by 2027, according to eMarketer. The research firm projects roughly 152.9 million Americans, or 68% of digital buyers, will use click-and-collect in 2025.\n\nAmazon leads e-commerce by total sales, but Walmart may have an advantage when it comes to delivery speed. Thanks to its network of more than 4,600 US stores, Walmart can reach roughly 95% of American households within three hours. Walmart is the leader in click-and-collect services with a projected $38.50 billion in sales this year, eMarketer data shows.\n\nAccording to the internal document, Amazon expects the new \"rush\" pickup service to meet \"a key customer need for faster, more convenient access\" to its full product selection, while making better use of its physical store network and logistics infrastructure.\n\n\"By piloting this capability, we can validate customer demand for rapid pickup while learning how to effectively combine our physical and digital offerings,\" the document stated.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Buying the Zombies, Run! studio wasn’t part of ​my plan, but a post-apocalypse ​game with stories that make people feel seen pulled me in\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nA few days ago, I clicked a button on my phone to send funds to a company in Singapore and so took ownership of the video game I co-created and am lead writer for: Zombies, Run! I am a novelist, I wrote the bestselling, award-winning The Power, which was turned into an Amazon Prime TV series starring Toni Collette. What on earth am I doing buying a games company?\n\nWell. First of all. Zombies, Run! is special. It’s special to me – the game started as a Kickstarter and the community that grew up around it has always been incredibly supportive of what we’re doing. And it’s special in what it does. It’s a game to exercise with. You play it on your smartphone – iPhone or Android – and we tell stories from the zombie apocalypse in your headphones to encourage you to go further, faster, or just make exercise less boring. Games are so often portrayed as the bad entertainment form, but I made a game that fundamentally helps people to be healthier.\n\nThe experience of playing Zombies, Run! is also completely focused on storytelling. My co-creator Adrian Hon and I were talking about doing a project together. He said: “Let’s do something to make running more fun.” I said: “How about if we do a story where you’re being chased by zombies?” And here we are.\n\nWhen you play the game, you’re immersed in a world where every run makes you a hero – you’re collecting supplies, saving a child from no man’s land, investigating the mystery of how the apocalypse started. I’ve always focused on the storytelling being good. And it works. Players of the game become so attached to the characters that many of them report laughing out loud or even “crying while running”.\n\nOne of my jokes about storytelling in video games is that the way we tend to talk about it – in the games industry, in games journalism, even in marketing copy – is very much “never mind the quality, feel the width”. We say things like “this game has 100-plus hours of story” or “this game contains more than a million words”. Imagine marketing a movie saying that the script contains 29,000 words. Or selling a novel on the basis that it’ll take a long time to read.\n\nThat’s not how you do it. You tell the story. You give a hook. You say: “A single woman comes home one evening to find a man claiming to be her husband living in her house. And when he goes up to the attic, a different husband comes down in his place.” Now you can’t wait to find out what happens next. (That, incidentally, is the brilliant comic novel The Husbands by Holly Gramazio – who I think is the only other bestselling novelist to be also making her own video games.)\n\nSo, now I own a games company, what am I going to do? My feeling is that I must focus on the fundamentals. There’s a world of games out there that thinks it can replace writers with AI large language models. I think that’s going to make writing worse and worse. AI writing is fine for boilerplate text that is always roughly the same. It’s fine for non-writers to get their expertise into the world. But storytelling is different. It is human minds finding companionship with other human minds – we need stories, fundamentally, to feel less alone. To know that other people have been through things a bit like what we have. Things that make us laugh, and cry, even while running. You get that from work that is not the same as everything else, you get it from the unique work of other individual human minds.\n\nAnd actually, Zombies, Run! has always been a universe with strong values. We’re not a rightwing, rugged-individualism apocalypse, where one lone person can get through with just their guns. In our world – as in the real world – humans survive by working together.\n\nWhile we’re still going to have many exciting fleeing zombies, battling-the-undead storytelling, I think there’s probably also room in the ZR! universe for a 10-mission arc where you have to find all the figurines and paints you need to complete an expansion set in “Demons and Darkness”; or one where you’re working on bringing an overgrown garden back to blooming, beautiful life; or setting up and running the first post-apocalyptic travelling library while also trying to work out what happened to the first librarian who’s mysteriously disappeared, leaving only a series of cryptic notes in an old manuscript.\n\nAfter all, I do think this is quite a good time in the world to be thinking about how to rebuild after a series of catastrophic events.\n\nSelling story by the yard and not by a story hook is a marker, I think, of a lack of confidence in the form. We don’t need to lack confidence. Games are the biggest entertainment industry in the world. If we want to be taken seriously, we need to take ourselves seriously. Stop talking about the width, start talking about the quality.\n\nIt was the 20th anniversary of Xbox 360 recently, and one name that’s cropped up in every list of the console’s best games is the compulsive retro twin-stick shooter Geometry Wars. If you’re yearning for something similar, you must immediately download Evil Egg, a frenzied twin-stick blaster with gorgeous Commodore 64-style visuals and sound effects. Shoot everything that moves, hit the left trigger to boost and collect hearts to stay alive.\n\nAt first it’s a bewildering mass of rainbow pixels but as you detonate wave after wave of glitchy space pests, you begin to understand the patterns of different enemies and earn upgrades such as the executioner’s sword, which takes out foes in an orbital slash of laser particles. Evil Egg is polished, exciting, wild to look at, and has such a brilliant understanding of the genre and its unique dynamics. It’s free on Steam but I implore you to download it on Itch.io and name your own price. Keith Stuart\n\nAvailable on: PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 10-plus hours\n\nThere has been a lot of writing about Horses, the art game recently banned by digital platforms Steam and Epic Games Store. I particularly enjoyed this post by writer Harper Jay MacIntyre, which considers Horses, formalism and the trans experience. The article manages to bring in so many elements of modern games criticism and academia while providing a highly personal response to the game.\n\nThe most interesting retro game articles are the ones that reassess lost or derided titles rather than merely celebrate the classics. Was the Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man the worst game ever? Not according to this compelling analysis from Garrett Martin at AV Club who sees it as a misunderstood brutalist gem. I find myself in agreement.\n\nIt is also nice to see a legendary game justly praised in an interesting way. The BFI’s look at the legacy of Time Crisis considers the gun game in relation to cinema, referencing Beverly Hills Cop and Run Lola Run rather than just comparing it to Sega’s similar Virtua Cop.\n\nSkate Story – hellish premise aside, this is skateboarding paradise | ★★★★☆\n\nHorror game Horses has been banned from sale – but is it as controversial as you’d think?\n\nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 – inept game-based horror is one of the year’s worst | ★☆☆☆☆\n\nThis one comes from reader, Rebecca:\n\n“My elderly grandad is coming to stay with us for Christmas and wants to see what’s happening with video game graphics these days. Are there any titles you recommend that will let him explore beautiful locations without getting shot at?! We have a PlayStation 5 and a slightly out-of-date PC.”\n\nYour best option here is to go with one of the big open-world adventures and just find an area with no enemies around. If you You could bypass the threat of imminent violence completely by going for a driving game, such as Forza Horizon 4 on PC (which is set in Britain so he may even spot some familiar scenery). Alternatively, if visual realism isn’t as important as beauty, a cosier indie title such as Tchia, Journey or Firewatch may fit the bill. Really hope he enjoys them!\n\nWe’re still looking for your game of the year nominations for an end of year special – let us know yours by hitting reply or emailing us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "description": "AWS executive Sarah Cooper has invented her own roles at the giant using Amazon's 6-page proposal and PR/FAQ frameworks.",
    "fullText": "AWS executive Sarah Cooper has launched several companies and held roles at NASA and AWS, but she's only ever formally interviewed for three jobs.\n\nInstead, Cooper told Business Insider that her career moves often begin with writing a proposal about the work she wants to pursue, either to a VC, a cofounder, or an executive leader, and that becomes the role she steps into.\n\n\"I have a million ideas,\" Cooper said. \"It's a blessing and a curse.\"\n\nCooper has seen a high rate of success with her proposals. She used them to invent both her previous and current roles at AWS.\n\nCooper was previously the head of AWS Industry Products, where she worked closely with customers to develop industry solutions in the cloud. Now she leads the \"AWS AI-Native\" team, an AWS product organization that works with customers to understand how companies will evolve with AI.\n\nCooper said she wrote a proposal to pitch her last two roles, and she's a fan of the six-page memo, a favorite of Jeff Bezos. Instead of PowerPoint decks, Bezos often opted to start meetings by having attendees read a 6-page \"narratively structured\" memo silently at the start of the meeting. The founder has said he prefers memos to avoid \"hiding a lot of sloppy thinking in bullet points.\"\n\nThese six-page memos typically describe detailed plans for a new initiative and are written using 10-point font. Bezos wrote years ago in an annual shareholder letter that \"great memos are written and re-written,\" and can't be done in a couple of days, though the exact criteria remains more flexible.\n\nCooper also referenced using Amazon's classic PR/FAQ framework. The executive said she finds the format \"effective at helping people quickly understand what your idea is and why it matters.\"\n\nAmazon describes the framework as a means to develop ideas and initiatives that enable teams to quickly integrate feedback and promote fact-based decision-making. The press-release portion spans a few paragraphs and provides the reader with highlights of the customer experience. The FAQ section, typically five pages or less, dives into the details and also outlines the challenges of building the product or service.\n\nOnce a draft is written, the creator typically schedules a one-hour meeting with stakeholders to review the document and get feedback, the company said in a blog post about the framework.\n\nCooper said she's written over 14 PR/FAQs and investment narratives that have been funded, as well as many other ideas that the company didn't move forward with.\n\nCooper, who has been at Amazon for over nine years, says she also tries to reflect the organization's values when writing proposals. Amazon's PR/FAQ format originated from a process the company calls \"Working Backwards,\" a method for evaluating new ideas by first defining the ideal customer experience and then reverse-engineering what the team needs to build to achieve it.\n\nCooper said Amazon is \"customer-obsessed,\" so she tries to focus on that value when drafting a memo. She said she thinks less about the needs of a specific team and more broadly about customers and the best way to serve them, regardless of what's been done previously.\n\nWhile Cooper has spent her career writing proposals, many never see the light of day — and those that do don't always go smoothly, she said. In her late 20s, while serving as the CTO of a company, she wrote a proposal suggesting that the business should focus limited resources on scaling the supply chain, specifically with the supply chain involved in on-mine extraction to meet demand for contracts. The company disagreed on where to invest.\n\n\"I got pushed out of one of my companies, basically, for a proposal I wrote,\" Cooper said.",
