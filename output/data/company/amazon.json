    "description": "\"Mighty Nein\" is the Critical Role crew's second animated series project with Amazon.",
    "fullText": "The eight cofounders of the nerdworld business Critical Role came roaring back to Prime Video with the November debut of \"The Mighty Nein.\"\n\nThe business's eight cofounders first started out streaming their home \"Dungeons & Dragons\" game on Twitch. Then, in 2019, CR raised seed funding of over $11.3 million to create the animated series \"The Legend of Vox Machina.\"\n\n\"The Mighty Nein,\" based on their second Twitch-streamed \"D&D\" campaign, is their second animated series on Prime Video.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider in November, the cofounders outlined some of the biggest challenges they faced — and the lessons they learned — making the show.\n\n\"The largest challenge was trying to figure out how we were going to reorganize, and how we introduced the world,\" Critical Role CEO Travis Willingham said.\n\nConverting a 141-episode campaign into a show for Prime Video meant covering lots of on-stream ground, Willingham said. The team had to make a \"massive shift\" in how characters and plot points were introduced.\n\n\"For us, the livestream campaign was so good at sort of feeding one little nugget at a time, and the world got bigger and bigger and bigger. We thought it was far more effective to just hit you with the larger pieces at play and let those things sort of inform the characters and the storylines as you go along,\" Willingham added.\n\nWillingham said these hints set the stage for more developments down the road.\n\n\"We are going to sort of peel back the layers of that onion as we go along,\" Willingham said. \"But we are certainly taking our time and saving things for season two as well. So we're not in a rush.\"\n\nCofounder Sam Riegel told Business Insider that the crew's longtime game master, Matthew Mercer, had created an \"incredible continent filled with politics and socioeconomic strife and war, and ruin, and religious exploration.\"\n\n\"To show all of the antagonists, the villains, the political intrigue that's going on around our characters, we needed a whole other plot line to show what was going on in the background,\" Riegel said.\n\nRiegel added that another key challenge with the \"Mighty Nein\" was the complexity of some of the main characters' backstories.\n\n\"We don't want to throw all those backstories in the audience's face right at the top, but we do want to tease out that they come with baggage and trauma and issues that they have to work through,\" Riegel said.\n\n\"Luckily, we were afforded hourlong episodes in which to do so, and I think it paints a rich tapestry,\" Riegel said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mercer wove in information and plot points from the campaign that even Twitch viewers back in the day weren't aware of. That included more information on the series' key antagonists, the wizard Volstruckers, and the mysterious and enigmatic academic, Essek Thelyss, whom Mercer voices.\n\n\"We had the opportunity to dig in with the writer's rooms and the rest of the creative team to collaborate on how best to see that now fleshed out and shown and explored with the audience through this animated series,\" Mercer said. \"So there weren't too many changes. A lot of it was mainly just taking what was there or things that were sitting in my head and going, 'Alright, now we get to actually show this. That's really cool and exciting. Let's do it.'\"\n\nOne of the big challenges the team had to overcome was articulating the intricate aspects of an in-game world through animation. And that spanned character costumes and memorable campaign locations.\n\n\"When I sent Matt (Mercer) my idea of where Jester grew up and what the Lavish Chateau was, I had this strong visual in my mind,\" cofounder and cast member Laura Bailey said, referring to her character, the trickster cleric Jester.\n\n\"And then to see it in the animated series, it's so strange that they can capture exactly what it was that we've visualized for so long, and now everybody else gets to see these stunning set pieces that have existed only in this little world,\" Bailey added.\n\nCofounder Taliesin Jaffe said that he'd been \"very, very specific\" as well about how the carnival his character, Mollymauk Tealeaf, traveled with — should be animated.\n\n\"I'm famous for making very easy-to-animate character designs — I say deeply sarcastically,\" Jaffe joked.\n\nThe Critical Role team also had to look into how each character's magic was represented on-screen. For Liam O'Brien, it was crucial that his wizard, Caleb Widogast, cast magic in a manner that resembled a \"learned science,\" complete with alchemy and specific components.\n\nThe crew, O'Brien said, was also just happy to have the \"luxury of time\" to go back and revisit moments from their old \"D&D\" campaign.\n\n\"I am in love with the complicated world that this show has created — and that Sam and Travis have helmed — as we've all, in an all-hands effort, just created everything with love,\" O'Brien said.",

    "description": "The bankruptcy announcement comes after cash struggles and a failed acquisition by Amazon.",
    "fullText": "The parent company of Roomba, which has sold millions of cleaning robots, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday after 35 years of operation.\n\nIn a Sunday press release, Massachusetts-based robotics company iRobot said it had filed for bankruptcy protection in the District of Delaware court.\n\nThe company said that it would be wholly acquired by its main manufacturer and lender, vacuum cleaner maker Shenzhen PICEA. Picea has R&D and manufacturing facilities in China and Vietnam, per the release.\n\nThe Picea deal would allow iRobot to continue operating, developing new products, make \"timely payments to vendors and creditors,\" and meet its commitments to employees, the release said.\n\nUnder the deal, iRobot will be a private company owned by Picea, and its common stock will be wiped from stock exchanges.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by three roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company introduced the Roomba, its iconic disc-shaped vacuuming robot, in 2002.\n\nThe bankruptcy deal follows several quarters of weak sales and a cash crunch. The company wrote in its third-quarter earnings report that, as of September 27, its cash totaled $24.8 million, compared to $40.6 million as of June 28.\n\niRobot said it had withdrawn $5 million in restricted cash on September 27, after which it had \"no sources upon which it can draw for additional capital.\"\n\nIts third-quarter revenue, $145.8 million, was about a 25% drop compared to the same period the year before, with sales dropping 33% in the US.\n\nLast month, the company warned that the last possible iRobot buyer had backed out of a deal, which left it likely to pursue bankruptcy.\n\niRobot went through a failed acquisition attempt by Amazon. In 2022, Amazon announced that it would buy iRobot for $1.7 billion, but pulled the deal in January 2024, citing regulatory hurdles in the US and Europe.\n\nThe collapse of the Amazon deal hit iRobot hard. On the same day as Amazon's announcement, iRobot said it would lay off 31% of its staff, and its CEO, Colin Angle, would step down.\n\niRobot's stock price has dropped more than 50% in the past year and more than 90% in the past five years.",

    "description": "Almost a month after Prime Video launched AI-powered Video Recaps, viewers said it shared incorrect plot details about season one of \"Fallout.\"",
    "fullText": "Given the length of time it can take for the new season of your favorite TV show to come out, it's understandable that you might want a little video recap of what's happened so far.\n\nIdeally, that recap is accurate.\n\nFans of Amazon's hit show \"Fallout\" said that wasn't the case in its AI-made synopsis of season one, released ahead of the hit show's new season next week. Fans quickly spotted factual errors, and Amazon Prime Video took down the recap.\n\nOne Redditor said the AI feature told viewers that a flashback featuring the Ghoul (one of the main characters, played by Walton Goggins) took place in the 1950s instead of 2077.\n\nAn X user posted that the recap also mischaracterized the agreement the Ghoul and Lucy MacLean (played by Ella Purnell) made in the \"Fallout\" finale.\n\nInstead of saying the pair is teaming up to find Lucy's father, the recap said the Ghoul gave Lucy an ultimatum: \"die or join him.\"\n\nAmazon first launched its Video Recap, a feature that allows users to catch up on Prime Original TV shows between seasons, for beta testing in November.\n\n\"Video Recaps use AI to identify a show's most important plot points, combining them with synchronized voice narration, dialogue snippets, and music to create a visual summary that prepares viewers for the new season,\" the company said in a press release at the time.\n\nThe TV shows that Amazon said were undergoing Video Recaps testing — \"Jack Ryan,\" \"Upload,\" \"Bosch,\" and \"The Rig\" — did not include the feature at the time of writing.\n\nRepresentatives for Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLike so many companies, Amazon is investing heavily in AI.\n\nDuring the company's February earnings call, Chief Finance Officer Brian Olsavsky said that 2025 capital expenditures could reach over $100 billion, with the majority of it going toward AI and Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing platform.\n\nMany of Amazon's consumer services have integrated AI to enhance user engagement and experience, such as product suggestions and helping shoppers on its online platform find clothes that fit. In February, Amazon unveiled Alexa+, the next generation of Alexa, which is powered by generative AI to make it more conversational and personalized for users.\n\nEmbracing AI at Amazon, though, hasn't been without growing pains. In October, the company cited AI as it announced it would lay off 14,000 staff members.\n\n\"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),\" Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, wrote in a blog post at the time.\n\nIn an internal message to the remaining staff, Amazon Vice President of Device Software and Services Tapas Roy asked them to \"lean in on AI.\"\n\n\"Moving forward, we remain focused on our mission to help product teams launch delightful products,\" Roy wrote. \"In support of this mission, I encourage you all to: Focus on the work that most directly impacts our customers, lean in on Al to enhance your effectiveness, [and] raise your hand when you see opportunities to simplify or eliminate unnecessary processes.\"",

    "fullText": "An all-new Croft adventure, Tomb Raider Catalyst, will be released in 2027 – and a remake of the action heroine’s first adventure arrives next year\n\nAfter a long break for Lara Croft, a couple of fresh Tomb Raider adventures are on their way. They will be the first new games in the series since 2018, and both will be published by Amazon.\n\nAnnounced at the Game Awards in LA, Tomb Raider Catalyst stars the “charismatic, self-assured, formidable Lara Croft” from the original 1990s games, says game director Will Kerslake. It’s set in the markets, mountains, and naturally the ancient buildings of northern India, where Lara is racing with other treasure hunters to track down potentially cataclysmic artefacts. It will be out in 2027.\n\nCatalyst is in development at Crystal Dynamics, the Canadian developer that has looked after Tomb Raider since 2003. Crystal Dynamics previously developed Tomb Raiders Legend, Anniversary and Underworld, as well as the reboot trilogy that featured a younger, more vulnerable Lara. Its most recent game in the series was 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider.\n\nTomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, meanwhile, is being developed in collaboration with Flying Wild Hog in Poland. Featuring modernised combat and redesigned tomb-delving puzzles, the game is an “expanded” ground-up reimagining of Lara Croft’s very first 1996 adventure, which established her as one of gaming’s most recognisable characters. “Our goal was to respect the spirit of Core Design’s original game, while updating the experience for today’s gamers including building it with Unreal Engine 5,” Kerslake says. “We see this is a reimagining of the original game with a gameplay experience that wasn’t possible on the technology at the time.” Legacy of Atlantis will be out in 2026.\n\nIn both games, Croft will be played by the British actor Alix Wilton Regan, who previously had significant roles in Dragon Age: Inquisition and Cyberpunk 2077. She was also due to star as Joanna Dark in the cancelled remake of 2000’s spy-shooter Perfect Dark.\n\nDespite the series’ recent hiatus, Tomb Raider still has immense brand recognition, built on its 1990s heyday. Amazon also has a TV series in the works with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, which is to star Sophie Turner as Croft. Over 30 years, Croft has been everything from Playboy pin-up to rugged wilderness adventurer to gentlewoman action hero.\n\n“Across the series, our goal is to show that Lara is always evolving,” Kerslake says. “Her core DNA will remain, but we believe it’s important to show how each adventure shapes her character over time.”",

At Italian Tech Week in October, the Amazon founder looked back on an early piece of feedback that changed the way he approached invention—and may have helped save Amazon from becoming its own worst enemy.\n\n\"I am an inventor,\" Bezos told the audience. \"This is my fundamental nature.\" His favorite place? In a room with a whiteboard, surrounded by a small group, spitballing ideas. \"You can literally put me in front of a whiteboard and I can come up with a hundred ideas in half an hour,\" he said with a grin.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\n\nBut that endless flow of innovation—once considered a superpower—nearly became a liability. In the early years of Amazon, one longtime executive pulled Bezos aside with a blunt warning. \"Jeff, you have enough ideas to destroy Amazon,\" Jeff Wilke told him.\n\nIt stunned him. \"This was such a shocking idea for me,\" Bezos admitted. Wilke, a manufacturing expert, saw the problem clearly: every new idea was essentially a task dropped into a queue. If the company couldn't absorb it fast enough, it wasn't just useless—it was destructive.\n\n\"You have to release the work at the right rate that the organization can accept it,\" Bezo said, quoting Wilke. \"You're creating a backlog, a queue, work in process. It's adding no value and in fact, it's creating distraction.\"\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nThat was the moment Bezos shifted. Instead of flooding Amazon with nonstop initiatives, he started filtering. \"I started prioritizing the ideas better, keeping lists of them, keeping them to myself until the organization was ready,\" he said.\n\nEven more important, Bezos began thinking like a builder—not just of ideas, but of infrastructure. \"How can I build an organization that can be ready for more ideas?\" he said. The answer was scaling leadership, growing bandwidth, and creating systems that could handle multiple innovations at once.\n\nAmazon didn't slow down after that—it got smarter. \"We built a company that's very good at inventing and doing more than one thing at a time,\" Bezos said. But none of it worked until he accepted a hard truth: ideas are powerful, but only if they're released at the right moment. Without discipline, even genius becomes a liability.",

    "title": "Amazon plans a new 'rush' pickup service as it doubles down on rapid delivery",
    "description": "Amazon plans a new rush pickup service for one-hour in-store orders, strengthening rapid delivery and click-and-collect offering.",
    "fullText": "Amazon wants more shoppers to get orders within an hour. A new kind of in-store pickup could be its next move to make that happen.\n\nAmazon is developing a \"rush\" pickup service that will let shoppers collect their orders at Amazon-owned stores within an hour, according to an internal document and a person familiar with the matter.\n\nShoppers will be able to place a \"unified\" order from both Amazon's online marketplace and items stocked in Amazon-owned stores, the document explained. The company operates several physical retail formats, including Whole Foods, Fresh grocery stores, and Go convenience stores.\n\nThe tech giant plans to pilot-launch the new program in at least one metro area by the first quarter of 2026, according to this document. The initiative is tracked by Amazon's SVPs, the most senior group of leaders at the company, it noted. However, it's uncertain whether that timeline is still in effect, said the person familiar, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe new pickup service would be Amazon's latest attempt to enable ultrafast, sub-one-hour deliveries.\n\nJust last week, the company launched Amazon Now, a new 30-minute delivery service in parts of Seattle and Philadelphia. It has also been testing similarly quick delivery offerings in countries such as the UK, India, and Mexico.\n\nFor those who want to pick up in-store, Amazon currently offers next-day pickup on some US online orders. Grocery subscribers can also collect select items in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nIn-store pickup, often referred to as \"click-and-collect,\" is surging in e-commerce. Total US sales from click-and-collect services are expected to hit $112.96 billion this year, up 17% from 2023, and grow to $129.33 billion by 2027, according to eMarketer. The research firm projects roughly 152.9 million Americans, or 68% of digital buyers, will use click-and-collect in 2025.\n\nAmazon leads e-commerce by total sales, but Walmart may have an advantage when it comes to delivery speed. Thanks to its network of more than 4,600 US stores, Walmart can reach roughly 95% of American households within three hours. Walmart is the leader in click-and-collect services with a projected $38.50 billion in sales this year, eMarketer data shows.\n\nAccording to the internal document, Amazon expects the new \"rush\" pickup service to meet \"a key customer need for faster, more convenient access\" to its full product selection, while making better use of its physical store network and logistics infrastructure.\n\n\"By piloting this capability, we can validate customer demand for rapid pickup while learning how to effectively combine our physical and digital offerings,\" the document stated.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Buying the Zombies, Run! studio wasn’t part of ​my plan, but a post-apocalypse ​game with stories that make people feel seen pulled me in\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nA few days ago, I clicked a button on my phone to send funds to a company in Singapore and so took ownership of the video game I co-created and am lead writer for: Zombies, Run! I am a novelist, I wrote the bestselling, award-winning The Power, which was turned into an Amazon Prime TV series starring Toni Collette. What on earth am I doing buying a games company?\n\nWell. First of all. Zombies, Run! is special. It’s special to me – the game started as a Kickstarter and the community that grew up around it has always been incredibly supportive of what we’re doing. And it’s special in what it does. It’s a game to exercise with. You play it on your smartphone – iPhone or Android – and we tell stories from the zombie apocalypse in your headphones to encourage you to go further, faster, or just make exercise less boring. Games are so often portrayed as the bad entertainment form, but I made a game that fundamentally helps people to be healthier.\n\nThe experience of playing Zombies, Run! is also completely focused on storytelling. My co-creator Adrian Hon and I were talking about doing a project together. He said: “Let’s do something to make running more fun.” I said: “How about if we do a story where you’re being chased by zombies?” And here we are.\n\nWhen you play the game, you’re immersed in a world where every run makes you a hero – you’re collecting supplies, saving a child from no man’s land, investigating the mystery of how the apocalypse started. I’ve always focused on the storytelling being good. And it works. Players of the game become so attached to the characters that many of them report laughing out loud or even “crying while running”.\n\nOne of my jokes about storytelling in video games is that the way we tend to talk about it – in the games industry, in games journalism, even in marketing copy – is very much “never mind the quality, feel the width”. We say things like “this game has 100-plus hours of story” or “this game contains more than a million words”. Imagine marketing a movie saying that the script contains 29,000 words. Or selling a novel on the basis that it’ll take a long time to read.\n\nThat’s not how you do it. You tell the story. You give a hook. You say: “A single woman comes home one evening to find a man claiming to be her husband living in her house. And when he goes up to the attic, a different husband comes down in his place.” Now you can’t wait to find out what happens next. (That, incidentally, is the brilliant comic novel The Husbands by Holly Gramazio – who I think is the only other bestselling novelist to be also making her own video games.)\n\nSo, now I own a games company, what am I going to do? My feeling is that I must focus on the fundamentals. There’s a world of games out there that thinks it can replace writers with AI large language models. I think that’s going to make writing worse and worse. AI writing is fine for boilerplate text that is always roughly the same. It’s fine for non-writers to get their expertise into the world. But storytelling is different. It is human minds finding companionship with other human minds – we need stories, fundamentally, to feel less alone. To know that other people have been through things a bit like what we have. Things that make us laugh, and cry, even while running. You get that from work that is not the same as everything else, you get it from the unique work of other individual human minds.\n\nAnd actually, Zombies, Run! has always been a universe with strong values. We’re not a rightwing, rugged-individualism apocalypse, where one lone person can get through with just their guns. In our world – as in the real world – humans survive by working together.\n\nWhile we’re still going to have many exciting fleeing zombies, battling-the-undead storytelling, I think there’s probably also room in the ZR! universe for a 10-mission arc where you have to find all the figurines and paints you need to complete an expansion set in “Demons and Darkness”; or one where you’re working on bringing an overgrown garden back to blooming, beautiful life; or setting up and running the first post-apocalyptic travelling library while also trying to work out what happened to the first librarian who’s mysteriously disappeared, leaving only a series of cryptic notes in an old manuscript.\n\nAfter all, I do think this is quite a good time in the world to be thinking about how to rebuild after a series of catastrophic events.\n\nSelling story by the yard and not by a story hook is a marker, I think, of a lack of confidence in the form. We don’t need to lack confidence. Games are the biggest entertainment industry in the world. If we want to be taken seriously, we need to take ourselves seriously. Stop talking about the width, start talking about the quality.\n\nIt was the 20th anniversary of Xbox 360 recently, and one name that’s cropped up in every list of the console’s best games is the compulsive retro twin-stick shooter Geometry Wars. If you’re yearning for something similar, you must immediately download Evil Egg, a frenzied twin-stick blaster with gorgeous Commodore 64-style visuals and sound effects. Shoot everything that moves, hit the left trigger to boost and collect hearts to stay alive.\n\nAt first it’s a bewildering mass of rainbow pixels but as you detonate wave after wave of glitchy space pests, you begin to understand the patterns of different enemies and earn upgrades such as the executioner’s sword, which takes out foes in an orbital slash of laser particles. Evil Egg is polished, exciting, wild to look at, and has such a brilliant understanding of the genre and its unique dynamics. It’s free on Steam but I implore you to download it on Itch.io and name your own price. Keith Stuart\n\nAvailable on: PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 10-plus hours\n\nThere has been a lot of writing about Horses, the art game recently banned by digital platforms Steam and Epic Games Store. I particularly enjoyed this post by writer Harper Jay MacIntyre, which considers Horses, formalism and the trans experience. The article manages to bring in so many elements of modern games criticism and academia while providing a highly personal response to the game.\n\nThe most interesting retro game articles are the ones that reassess lost or derided titles rather than merely celebrate the classics. Was the Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man the worst game ever? Not according to this compelling analysis from Garrett Martin at AV Club who sees it as a misunderstood brutalist gem. I find myself in agreement.\n\nIt is also nice to see a legendary game justly praised in an interesting way. The BFI’s look at the legacy of Time Crisis considers the gun game in relation to cinema, referencing Beverly Hills Cop and Run Lola Run rather than just comparing it to Sega’s similar Virtua Cop.\n\nSkate Story – hellish premise aside, this is skateboarding paradise | ★★★★☆\n\nHorror game Horses has been banned from sale – but is it as controversial as you’d think?\n\nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 – inept game-based horror is one of the year’s worst | ★☆☆☆☆\n\nThis one comes from reader, Rebecca:\n\n“My elderly grandad is coming to stay with us for Christmas and wants to see what’s happening with video game graphics these days. Are there any titles you recommend that will let him explore beautiful locations without getting shot at?! We have a PlayStation 5 and a slightly out-of-date PC.”\n\nYour best option here is to go with one of the big open-world adventures and just find an area with no enemies around. If you You could bypass the threat of imminent violence completely by going for a driving game, such as Forza Horizon 4 on PC (which is set in Britain so he may even spot some familiar scenery). Alternatively, if visual realism isn’t as important as beauty, a cosier indie title such as Tchia, Journey or Firewatch may fit the bill. Really hope he enjoys them!\n\nWe’re still looking for your game of the year nominations for an end of year special – let us know yours by hitting reply or emailing us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "description": "AWS executive Sarah Cooper has invented her own roles at the giant using Amazon's 6-page proposal and PR/FAQ frameworks.",
    "fullText": "AWS executive Sarah Cooper has launched several companies and held roles at NASA and AWS, but she's only ever formally interviewed for three jobs.\n\nInstead, Cooper told Business Insider that her career moves often begin with writing a proposal about the work she wants to pursue, either to a VC, a cofounder, or an executive leader, and that becomes the role she steps into.\n\n\"I have a million ideas,\" Cooper said. \"It's a blessing and a curse.\"\n\nCooper has seen a high rate of success with her proposals. She used them to invent both her previous and current roles at AWS.\n\nCooper was previously the head of AWS Industry Products, where she worked closely with customers to develop industry solutions in the cloud. Now she leads the \"AWS AI-Native\" team, an AWS product organization that works with customers to understand how companies will evolve with AI.\n\nCooper said she wrote a proposal to pitch her last two roles, and she's a fan of the six-page memo, a favorite of Jeff Bezos. Instead of PowerPoint decks, Bezos often opted to start meetings by having attendees read a 6-page \"narratively structured\" memo silently at the start of the meeting. The founder has said he prefers memos to avoid \"hiding a lot of sloppy thinking in bullet points.\"\n\nThese six-page memos typically describe detailed plans for a new initiative and are written using 10-point font. Bezos wrote years ago in an annual shareholder letter that \"great memos are written and re-written,\" and can't be done in a couple of days, though the exact criteria remains more flexible.\n\nCooper also referenced using Amazon's classic PR/FAQ framework. The executive said she finds the format \"effective at helping people quickly understand what your idea is and why it matters.\"\n\nAmazon describes the framework as a means to develop ideas and initiatives that enable teams to quickly integrate feedback and promote fact-based decision-making. The press-release portion spans a few paragraphs and provides the reader with highlights of the customer experience. The FAQ section, typically five pages or less, dives into the details and also outlines the challenges of building the product or service.\n\nOnce a draft is written, the creator typically schedules a one-hour meeting with stakeholders to review the document and get feedback, the company said in a blog post about the framework.\n\nCooper said she's written over 14 PR/FAQs and investment narratives that have been funded, as well as many other ideas that the company didn't move forward with.\n\nCooper, who has been at Amazon for over nine years, says she also tries to reflect the organization's values when writing proposals. Amazon's PR/FAQ format originated from a process the company calls \"Working Backwards,\" a method for evaluating new ideas by first defining the ideal customer experience and then reverse-engineering what the team needs to build to achieve it.\n\nCooper said Amazon is \"customer-obsessed,\" so she tries to focus on that value when drafting a memo. She said she thinks less about the needs of a specific team and more broadly about customers and the best way to serve them, regardless of what's been done previously.\n\nWhile Cooper has spent her career writing proposals, many never see the light of day — and those that do don't always go smoothly, she said. In her late 20s, while serving as the CTO of a company, she wrote a proposal suggesting that the business should focus limited resources on scaling the supply chain, specifically with the supply chain involved in on-mine extraction to meet demand for contracts. The company disagreed on where to invest.\n\n\"I got pushed out of one of my companies, basically, for a proposal I wrote,\" Cooper said.",
