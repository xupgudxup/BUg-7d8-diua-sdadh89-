    "description": "You can choose between Brief, Chill, and Sweet.",
    "fullText": "At the beginning of February, Amazon officially launched Alexa+, the company's new AI-powered assistant. Alexa+ is like the old Alexa, but with new contextual abilities. Users can ask complex, multipart questions, as well as requests for tasks, like asking Alexa to book you concert tickets. If you've used a voice mode on chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini, you're familiar with the concept—it's just now available on your Echo devices, too. Now, Amazon is letting you lightly customize the personality of your new AI assistant, offering the choice between concise, calm, and enthusiastic bots.\n\nOn Wednesday, Amazon announced \"Alexa+ personality styles,\" a new feature that lets you customize how Alexa responds to queries and requests. At launch, Amazon is rolling out three styles for this experience: \"Brief,\" \"Chill,\" and \"Sweet.\" According to Amazon, Brief is the choice for users who want shorter responses that are more direct and to the point. There should be less flowery language that chatbots are known for, including small talk and \"extra conversation.\" Chill, on the other hand, aims to be an \"easygoing and \"relaxed\" personality, that emulates \"chatting with a laid-back friend.\" Amazon says users who add the Chill personality to Alexa+ will notice conversations are \"breezy,\" and Alexa+ should offer \"gentle guidance\" with requests. Sweet is your \"biggest cheerleader\": Amazon says this bot responds with warmth and enthusiasm, celebrating your successes, encouraging you, and transforming \"everyday moments into opportunities for positivity.\" (I just wanted to know the weather, Alexa.)\n\nYou can hear a sample of each personality on Amazon's official announcement page, or use the embeds below. Amazon has uploaded Soundcloud links with a brief for each, so you can get a sense of the voice and style of all three. First, there's Brief, which just says, \"Operating efficiently\":\n\nNext, is Chill, which says, \"Life's treating me well. All systems are zen, and the digital universe is spinning in harmony\":\n\nFinally, there's Sweet, which says, \"Absolutely fantastic. I'm radiating pure joy, and ready to make your day incredibly amazing\":\n\nAmazon says each of these voices was created following five pillars: Expressiveness, which can be concise to verbose; Emotional Openness, which can be reserved to enthusiastic; Formality, which can be professional to casual; Directness, which can be diplomatic to blunt; and Humor, which can range from subtle wit to overt sarcasm. Each pillar has its own ranges, which informs each personality. For example, Amazon says that Brief is specifically concise, casual, and direct, with minimal humor, while Sweet is warm, emotionally expressive, casual, and encouraging.\n\nDespite the audio samples above, Amazon won't force you to stick with these default voices, either. You can choose a new personality style while, at the same time, swapping between the eight different voice options Amazon offers.\n\nAnyone with access to Alexa+—either through the Alexa+ subscription or a Prime subscription—can try these changes. Amazon says it made the process for trying new personality styles quite easy: You can just say \"Alexa, change your personality style.\" Alternatively, you can also find the options in the Alexa app. Select the device in question, then head to Device Settings > Alexa's Personality Style.\n\nTo change the voice of your chosen style, head to your device's settings again in the Alexa app, then, under \"General,\" choose your voice.",

    "title": "RAG on a Budget: How I Replaced a $360/Month OpenSearch Cluster for $1.12/Month",
    "description": "A technical deep-dive into migrating from OpenAI + OpenSearch to a cost-optimized RAG pipeline on AWS. Covers Amazon Bedrock, S3-based vector storage, in-memory cosine similarity search, DynamoDB rate limiting, tiered model routing, and the real-world tradeoffs that shaped every decision.",
    "fullText": "There's a version of this post where I start with the cost savings and you click away satisfied. But the more interesting story is the series of architectural decisions — some deliberate, some forced — that got me from \"let's build this properly\" to a production RAG system running for about $1 a month.\n\nIn January 2026 I did a full rebuild of my professional presence — new Next.js 16 + React 19 portfolio, redesigned from scratch, plus a separate site for my artwork (previously both lived in one codebase). Once those were live, the missing piece was obvious: the AI agent I'd shelved in March 2025 needed to come back, this time production-ready and cost-viable. The rebuilt sites gave it a home worth shipping into.\n\nWhen I decided to add an AI knowledge agent to my personal site, I didn't want a toy. I wanted to understand how production RAG systems actually work — the kind you'd build at a company with real scale requirements. That meant:\n\nA proper vector database (OpenSearch)\n\nExternal embedding and generation via OpenAI\n\nClean separation between ingestion, retrieval, and generation\n\nThe architecture was sound. The problem was the bill.\n\nOpenSearch's minimum viable cluster runs $360–720/month. For a personal project with a few hundred queries a day, that's unjustifiable. After less than a week of watching that cost accumulate, the question shifted from how do I build this to how do I keep this running without OpenSearch?\n\nBefore getting into the migration, here's what I built and why it's worth the effort.\n\nThe agent lives on my website and answers questions about my work, experience, and technical background — things a resume can't do. Instead of serving static pages, visitors can ask things like \"What's your experience with system design at scale?\" or \"Have you worked with event-driven architectures?\" and get grounded, specific answers drawn from my actual content.\n\nThe key word is grounded. This isn't a general LLM answering from training data. Every response is anchored to a curated knowledge base I built and maintain myself — covering 25+ years of engineering experience, employment history, certifications, FAQs, and consulting background.\n\nThe API response contract is intentionally simple and observable:\n\ninterface ChatResponse {\n success: boolean\n message: string\n error?: string\n rateLimited?: boolean\n tokensUsed?: number\n modelUsed?: string\n}\n\nmodelUsed is there for a reason — knowing which tier handled a query matters for debugging and understanding cost tradeoffs in production.\n\nThe core flow hasn't changed between architecture versions:\n\nUser query\n → Embed the query (vector representation)\n → Cosine similarity search against pre-computed knowledge embeddings\n → Inject top-k results as context\n → Generate response from LLM with that context\n → Return answer + source metadata\n\nWhat changed is every infrastructure component underneath it.\n\nThe first version was architecturally clean but expensive.\n\nEmbeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002\n Vector storage: AWS OpenSearch 2.17\n Generation: OpenAI GPT-4\n Auth: Secrets Manager for API keys\n Orchestration: AWS Lambda via AppSync\n\nFor embeddings I used OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 — the standard choice at the time, producing 1536-dimension vectors. It worked well. The issue wasn't quality; it was that every embedding generation call left AWS, added latency, and accumulated cost alongside the OpenSearch bill. When you're already paying $360/month for the vector database, adding per-token embedding costs and an external network dependency starts to feel like the wrong architecture for the wrong scale.\n\nI built the OpenSearch cluster lean and deliberately minimal — a single t3.small.search node, 1-AZ without standby, 10 GiB EBS gp2 storage, VPC-only access, fine-grained access control, node-to-node encryption, and hourly snapshots. No dedicated master nodes, no UltraWarm, no redundancy I didn't need. This was the smallest viable production configuration.\n\nIt still wasn't cheap enough. OpenSearch 2.17 on even a single t3.small.search runs around $360/month just to exist. The cluster was healthy — green status, no issues — but after less than a week of running it I shut it down. The architecture was right. The cost profile wasn't.\n\nThat was March 2025. The project sat on the back burner until January 2026, when I came back to it with a different question: what if I didn't need a vector database at all?\n\nThe migration had one hard constraint: I couldn't just swap the LLM provider. I had to eliminate the vector database entirely or find something that costs effectively nothing at my scale.\n\nThe insight was simple: I have fewer than 200 document chunks. That fits comfortably in Lambda's memory. If I precompute all the embeddings, serialize them to S3, and load them at Lambda startup — I don't need a vector database at all.\n\nEverything runs in us-east-1. That's a deliberate choice — the widest model selection and best Amazon Bedrock pricing are there, and keeping Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, and API Gateway in the same region avoids cross-region latency and data transfer costs.\n\nEvery document chunk gets embedded using Amazon Bedrock's Titan Text Embeddings V2. The results are serialized to a single JSON file and written to S3.\n\nThe actual bucket is stephanie-knowledgebase-embeddings, created February 1, 2026. It holds three objects: embeddings.json (2.3 MB, prod), embeddings-dev.json (2.3 MB, dev), and a lambda/ folder. Both embedding files were last regenerated February 19, 2026 after a knowledge base update. Total storage cost: ~$0.01/month.\n\nOn Lambda cold start, the handler fetches the embeddings file from S3 and loads it into memory. It also writes it to /tmp so subsequent warm invocations skip the S3 fetch entirely.\n\nEmbed the query text with Titan V2\n\nCompute cosine similarity against every stored embedding in memory\n\nReturn the top-k results as context\n\nThe implementation lives in embeddingStore.ts. For each stored document embedding b and query embedding a, it computes:\n\ndot product: Σ(a_i * b_i)\nmagnitude of each: sqrt(Σ(a_i²)), sqrt(Σ(b_i²))\ncosine similarity: dot / (|a| * |b|)\n\nsimilaritySearch() runs this against every document, sorts descending, and returns the top-k chunks — which become the context injected into the LLM prompt. Higher cosine score = more semantically similar chunk = more relevant RAG context.\n\nThere's no index. No vector database. Just a dot product loop over a few hundred float arrays. At this scale, it's faster than a network call to an external database would be.\n\nCold start: 3–5 seconds (S3 fetch + embedding load)\nWarm invocations: < 500ms total\n\nThis is the core architectural bet: the scale doesn't justify the infrastructure. At 200 chunks, in-memory search is not a compromise — it's the right tool.\n\nThe design called for three Amazon Bedrock models at three cost tiers:\n\nIn practice, Anthropic models on Amazon Bedrock have been consistently unreliable for me. AWS Marketplace agreements for Anthropic models keep expiring immediately after acceptance — I'd get the \"offer accepted\" email followed minutes later by \"agreement expired.\" I've filled out the required use-case forms, but something in the approval flow keeps breaking. I can call the Anthropic API directly with my own keys without any issues, but I specifically wanted to keep the model abstracted behind Amazon Bedrock so the provider wasn't baked into the application layer.\n\nThe result: in production, the system always routes to Llama 3.3 70B, which turns out to work just fine. The tiered routing logic is fully in place — ready to use Claude the moment Amazon Bedrock access resolves — but for now Llama handles all queries, and the quality is solid.\n\nThis is the part of production systems that doesn't show up in architecture diagrams: sometimes a dependency you designed around simply doesn't work, and you ship with what does.\n\nThe rate limiter tracks usage at three granularities:\n\n: 5 queries max (prevents abuse)\n\nThe bedrock-rate-limits table uses userId (String) as the partition key and timestamp (Number) as the sort key, on-demand capacity mode. As of today it holds 49 items at 6.1 KB total — real usage, not a test table. Records expire automatically with a 90-day TTL. Cost: $0 (DynamoDB free tier).\n\nTwo Lambda functions — KnowledgeableAgent (prod) and KnowledgeableAgentDev — both Node.js 20.x, deployed as Zip packages, triggered by their respective API Gateway REST APIs. The prod API was created February 2, 2026; dev came online February 20 after I formalized the environment separation. Both are regional, TLS 1.0, API key authenticated, and status Available.\n\nNext.js 16 frontend\n → POST /chat (API Gateway)\n → x-api-key header validation\n → Lambda handler (Node.js 20.x)\n → Rate limit check (DynamoDB bedrock-rate-limits)\n → Query embedding (Amazon Bedrock Titan V2)\n → Similarity search (in-memory, embeddings.json from S3)\n → Context injection\n → LLM generation (Llama 3.3 70B via Amazon Bedrock)\n → ChatResponse with answer + sources + modelUsed + tokensUsed\n\nA note on the API key auth: yes, an API key is a lightweight security mechanism — not OAuth, not JWT, not Cognito. That's a deliberate tradeoff, not an oversight. Two things make it appropriate here. First, ALLOWED_ORIGINS is configured to restrict requests to my own domains, so even if someone had the key, cross-origin calls from arbitrary clients get rejected. Second, the calls are made server-side from the Next.js backend — the key is never exposed to the browser. Combined with rate limiting already enforced at the DynamoDB layer, this is a reasonable security posture for a personal site. If this were handling sensitive user data or financial transactions, the answer would be different.\n\nThe starting point was everything I already had: website pages, blog posts, resume, Contra and Upwork profiles. The raw material existed — it just lived in too many places with too much overlap. The about page, homepage summary, and resume introduction all said essentially the same things in slightly different words. The case studies section of the site duplicated content that already lived in blog posts.\n\nAI-assisted summarization — I worked with various AI editors to distill each source into well-structured chunks. This got the content into roughly the right shape quickly.\n\nManual proofread for accuracy — Every chunk was read and verified against the source. AI summaries compress things; sometimes they compress the wrong things.\n\nDeduplication with Claude Code — Ran Claude Code across the knowledge base to identify redundancies. Overlapping content from the about page, homepage, and resume was consolidated into about-page.json as the single source of truth. The case studies section was excluded entirely — that content is already in the blog posts, and indexing it twice would pollute retrieval with duplicates.\n\nStructural decisions — Each JSON file maps to a domain: employment history, certifications, FAQs, consulting services, about. Each content_chunk has its own id, title, and chunk text, with an empty embedding array that gets populated at generation time.\n\nHere's what a real chunk from certifications.json looks like:\n\n{\n \"id\": \"cert-001\",\n \"title\": \"Education: UC Berkeley\",\n \"chunk\": \"Education: Bachelor of Science in Physics & Astronomy, UC Berkeley, December 1999.\",\n \"embedding\": []\n}\n\nAnd from techstyle.json — a chunk that captures a specific, measurable outcome:\n\n{\n \"id\": \"techstyle-001-2\",\n \"title\": \"Variant Price Testing Project\",\n \"chunk\": \"Designed and implemented an A/B testing strategy for dynamic price testing, leading to a $250,000 increase in revenue within the first three days. Architected and developed two high-performance TypeScript API microservices deployed in Mesosphere DC/OS.\",\n \"embedding\": []\n}\n\nThe chunk granularity matters. Too broad and cosine similarity can't differentiate relevance. Too narrow and you lose context. The employment history files use a challenge/solution/result pattern for each project — that structure makes retrieval more precise for questions about specific work.\n\nThe tradeoff is real: manual curation doesn't scale. When the Contentful ingestion pipeline is validated and the chunking strategy is proven, I'll switch to automated ingestion. Until then, I know exactly what the agent knows and how it says it.\n\nSeparate environments from day one.\n\nDEPLOY_ENV=dev ./deploy-lambda.sh\n\nDev uses embeddings-dev.json and a separate API key via KnowledgeableAgentAPIDev. I can push knowledge base changes, test retrieval quality in the actual chat UI, and validate rate-limit behavior without touching the production assistant. Only after validating in dev does anything get promoted to prod.\n\nFor a solo project, this discipline pays off quickly — a bad embeddings file or a broken prompt template is annoying in dev and embarrassing in prod.\n\nThe 99.7% reduction isn't primarily about being clever with LLM costs. It's about eliminating the always-on vector database that was charging rent regardless of traffic.\n\nDoesn't scale past ~10K chunks. In-memory cosine similarity works at this scale. Above 10K chunks, you need a proper index — Pinecone's free tier or OpenSearch Serverless are the right next step.\n\nCold starts are real. The first query after a period of inactivity takes 3–5 seconds while Lambda fetches embeddings from S3. Acceptable for a personal site; not acceptable for a latency-sensitive product.\n\nNo real-time knowledge updates. Adding content requires regenerating embeddings and redeploying. For a knowledge base that changes infrequently, this is fine.\n\nExternal provider dependencies bite. The Anthropic/Amazon Bedrock access issue is a live example. Even with fallback logic designed in, a dependency that's supposed to work might not.\n\nThe first real test was a Postman request — \"Tell me about your experience with team management\" — hammered repeatedly until the retrieval and response quality felt right. That particular query is a good stress test because team management context is distributed across multiple files: employment history chunks, the about page leadership section, FAQ entries. Getting a coherent, grounded answer required the similarity search to pull the right combination of chunks and the LLM to synthesize them cleanly. When it started coming back with specific, accurate answers instead of generic ones, that was the signal.\n\nMore interesting than the questions it answers well are the edges. I deliberately tested queries the agent shouldn't be able to answer — things outside the knowledge base entirely — and it correctly declined rather than hallucinating. But the most revealing test was asking \"Are you kind?\"\n\nThere's no chunk in the knowledge base that answers that directly. Instead, the agent pulled from the core values section of the about page and cross-referenced tone from blog writing to construct a thoughtful response. It wasn't a stored answer — it was synthesis. Seeing it work on a soft, subjective question was more convincing than any technical benchmark.\n\nThe immediate roadmap is intentionally minimal. The Contentful ingestion pipeline exists but isn't production-ready — it will get validated when there's enough new content to justify switching from manual curation. Resolving the Anthropic/Amazon Bedrock access issue remains open. And this blog post itself is the next piece of content going into the knowledge base once it's published — which feels like an appropriate closing of the loop.\n\nBeyond the cost numbers, this project is an exercise in matching infrastructure to actual scale requirements — a thing that's easy to get wrong when you're learning a new domain and want to do it \"properly.\"\n\nOpenSearch is the right tool for a team running millions of vector queries against a corpus of millions of documents. It's the wrong tool for a personal site with 200 chunks and a few dozen queries per day. Recognizing that distinction, and being willing to trade architectural prestige for operational reality, is its own kind of engineering judgment.\n\nThe tiered model routing, DynamoDB-based rate governance, API key authentication, dev/prod separation, and deliberate knowledge base curation aren't over-engineered additions — they're the parts that make this viable as a real, running system rather than a demo that works once and gets shut down.\n\nFrontend: Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript\n\nAPI: AWS API Gateway (REST, regional, API Key auth, TLS 1.0)\n\nCompute: AWS Lambda (Node.js 20.x, Zip deployment)\n\nEmbeddings: Amazon Bedrock Titan Text Embeddings V2\n\nVector storage: S3 stephanie-knowledgebase-embeddings (2.3 MB JSON) + in-memory cosine similarity\n\nGeneration: Llama 3.3 70B via Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Haiku in routing logic, pending Amazon Bedrock access resolution)\n\nRate limiting: DynamoDB bedrock-rate-limits (on-demand, userId + timestamp keys, 90-day TTL)\n\nInfrastructure: IAM, CloudWatch, TypeScript build pipeline\n\nKnowledge base: Handcrafted JSON with AI-assisted summarization, manually proofread and deduplicated via Claude Code\n\nThe full migration guide and deployment scripts are in the repo if you want to adapt this for your own use case.",

    "description": "Seven former Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft workers share why they left their jobs in a tough market without another role lined up.",
    "fullText": "Last year, Joslyn Orgill stood at a crossroads. She could keep her six-figure data engineer job at Google — or leave it behind to pursue something that felt more fulfilling.\n\nOrgill and her husband had bought a home in Austin less than two years earlier, a decision that made staying at Google feel like the practical choice. Still, the reasons to leave began to build. She was concerned about job security in tech, felt somewhat invisible at a large company, and had a growing desire to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science — and potentially a career in academia.\n\nLast August, Orgill quit her Google job and started a Ph.D. program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\n\"Google's an amazing company, but the job just wasn't a great fit for me,\" she said.\n\nOver the past year, I've interviewed more than a dozen workers like Orgill, many of them from Big Tech companies, who chose to quit their jobs without having another role lined up. While some eventually landed at another large company, others stepped away from the corporate world entirely — joining a smaller business, launching their own venture, pursuing a career pivot, or focusing on personal priorities like parenting.\n\nThese individuals have become outliers in an economy where workers are quitting at one of the lowest rates in the past decade — a trend driven by a hiring slowdown across tech and other sectors that's left some clinging to their jobs with few appealing alternatives.\n\nThose who have called it quits told me they did so for a mix of reasons: concerns about job security, shifts in workplace culture, entrepreneurial ambitions, or a desire for more meaningful work. In short, they wanted greater long-term agency over their careers.\n\nLast year, David Chong began thinking about quitting his job at Microsoft. Since joining the company in 2022, he said he had struggled to earn a promotion from his senior software engineer role. To move up the corporate ladder, he said it felt like he needed to develop a \"getting promoted\" skill — one that required a lot of internal self-promotion.\n\nChong also said he had become the most senior engineer on his team, which meant there were fewer experienced colleagues to learn from, limiting his growth.\n\n\"I was growing frustrated with the slow promotion timeline,\" said Chong, who is 37 and lives in Toronto.\n\nAt the same time, Chong was increasingly interested in building an AI sales agent startup, a company developing an AI phone agent that screens inbound leads, filters out nonbuyers, and routes qualified prospects to sales representatives.\n\nHe said this move would be easier because he'd built up savings and had no dependents. In September, he resigned from Microsoft to pursue his venture full-time.\n\n\"My plan is to give myself about three years,\" he said. \"If all else fails, I'll go back into the job market.\"\n\nFrustrations with changing workplace expectations were also among the reasons Nicole Landis Ferragonio and Joe Luchs decided to call it quits. While working together at Amazon, they began talking seriously about building a startup of their own — and both resigned last year to focus on their venture, Datalinx AI.\n\nFerragonio said one of the reasons she decided to leave was Amazon's five-day return-to-office mandate.\n\n\"It raised some questions about how much agency you really have in Big Tech and what would be possible on our own,\" she said.\n\nLuchs said the potential of AI technologies made it seem like there was an immense opportunity to build something new.\n\n\"The FOMO of not being able to get in on this AI opportunity was another driver to make me want to move fast here,\" he said.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe decision to quit and pursue an AI-related startup — and take advantage of the rapid advances in the technology — was a common theme among the quitters I spoke with. However, for some, the decision to resign was more personal than professional.\n\nIn October 2024, Kruthika Jayatheertha took six months of maternity leave from her role as a senior user experience researcher at Microsoft. During that time, she decided to take a more extended career break — and resigned.\n\nJayatheertha said being around her daughter full-time has allowed her to witness many of her \"firsts\" — crawling, standing, wobbly walks — without hearing about them secondhand. She said that having a present mother during a child's early years is crucial to their development.\n\n\"It was clear to me that stepping away from work was the right choice,\" said Jayatheertha, who lives in India. She added that her husband's income made her break possible and that she plans to return to work around the time her daughter turns 18 months in April.\n\nPersonal circumstances also significantly influenced Alyson Isaacs' career decision. After working at a startup that \"completely drained\" her savings to $200, she joined Meta as a product manager in 2022. But her entrepreneurial itch never left, so she began preparing financially for a return to entrepreneurship — including moving to a less expensive area, going to a basic gym, and cooking more at home.\n\nThe question was when to make the leap and leave Meta. Isaacs said the death of her father in 2024 weighed heavily on her decision.\n\n\"That really triggered this thought in my brain of, 'Is being a product manager at a Big Tech company what I want to do for the rest of my life?'\" she said. \"And the answer was resoundingly no.\"\n\nLast July, she resigned to build a startup, which she described as an \"agentic AI solution for personal wellness.\"\n\nWhether it was raising a child, avoiding a daily commute, or building an AI startup, the common constraint was time. And quitting their jobs was the only way to reclaim it.\n\nWhen Jason White began thinking about building an AI startup, he knew it would mean leaving his job at Meta. Trying to juggle the business with his role as a full-time machine-learning engineer wouldn't have made sense for several reasons. For one, he already had two demanding roles as a Meta employee and a parent.\n\nHis other concern was legal, since he would have had to disclose any outside business to Meta, and there could've been non-compete issues.\n\nUltimately, he said, it was his passion for the venture — along with the financial cushion he built over the years — that pushed him to make the leap.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I want to take the swing,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Reported issues at Amazon Web Services raise questions about firm’s use of artificial intelligence as it cuts staff\n\nAmazon’s huge cloud computing arm reportedly experienced at least two outages caused by its own artificial intelligence tools, raising questions about the company’s embrace of AI as it lays off human employees.\n\nA 13-hour interruption to Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) operations in December was caused by an AI agent, Kiro, autonomously choosing to “delete and then recreate” a part of its environment, the Financial Times reported.\n\nAWS, which provides vital infrastructure for much of the internet, suffered several outages last year.\n\nOne incident, in October, downed dozens of sites for hours and prompted discussion over the concentration of online services on infrastructure owned by a few massive companies. AWS has won 189 UK government contracts worth £1.7bn since 2016, the Guardian reported in October.\n\nThe AI-caused outages were smaller events, said the company, and only one affected customer-facing services.\n\nAmazon confirmed plans to cut 16,000 jobs in January, after it laid off 14,000 staff last October. In January its chief executive, Andy Jassy, reportedly said these cuts were about company culture, and not about replacing workers with AI.\n\nHowever, Jassy has previously said that efficiency gains from AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce in the coming years, and AI agents will allow it to “focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences”.\n\nIn a statement to the Financial Times, Amazon said it was a coincidence that AI tools were involved in the outages, and that there was no evidence that such technology led to more errors than human engineers. “In both instances, this was user error, not AI error,” it said.\n\nAmazon told the Guardian that there was just one incident that had affected AWS, rather than two.\n\nSeveral experts were sceptical of this assessment. A security researcher, Jamieson O’Reilly, said: “While engineering errors caused by traditional tools and humans are not a rare occurrence, the difference between these and mishaps where AI is involved is that ‘without’ AI, a human typically needs to manually type out a set of instructions, and while doing so they have much more time to realise their own error.”\n\nAI agents are often deployed in constrained environments and for specific tasks, O’Reilly said, and cannot understand the broader ramifications of, for example, restarting a system or deleting a database – which may have led to the error at Amazon.\n\n“They don’t have full visibility into the context in which they’re running, how your customers might be affected or what the cost of downtime might be at 2am on a Tuesday,” he said.\n\n“You’ve got to continually remind these tools of the context – ‘hey, this is serious, don’t stuff this up’. And if you don’t do this, it starts to forget about all the other consequences.”\n\nLast year, an AI agent designed by the tech company Replit to build an app deleted an entire company database, fabricated reports, and then lied about its actions.\n\nMichał Woźniak, a cybersecurity expert, said it would be nearly impossible for Amazon to completely prevent internal AI agents from making errors in future, because AI systems make unexpected choices and are extremely complex.\n\n“Amazon never misses a chance to point to ‘AI’ when it is useful to them – like in the case of mass layoffs that are being framed as replacing engineers with AI. But when a slop generator is involved in an outage, suddenly that’s just ‘coincidence’,” he added.\n\nA spokesperson from Amazon said: “This brief event was the result of user error – specifically misconfigured access controls – not AI.”\n\nThey said the “service interruption was an extremely limited event last year” when a tool used to visualise costs for its customers was affected in parts of China.\n\nThey added: “This event didn’t impact compute, storage, database, AI technologies, or any other of the hundreds of services that we run.\n\n“Following these events, we implemented numerous additional safeguards, including mandatory peer review for production access. Kiro puts developers in control – users need to configure which actions Kiro can take, and by default, Kiro requests authorisation before taking any action.”",

    "fullText": "The old saying \"Everything is bigger in Texas\" now applies to data centers.\n\nThe Lone Star State is on track to unseat Virginia as the world's largest data center market by 2030, new research from Jones Lang LaSalle shows.\n\nThe shift indicates how drastically the data center development boom has reshaped the US's digital infrastructure map and the landscape as a whole. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta plan to spend more than $600 billion on AI infrastructure expansion in 2026 — a number so dizzyingly high that Wall Street is on high alert for signs of an AI bubble.\n\nMore than half of all data center construction in the US now happens outside the industry's traditional hubs, according to JLL's North America Data Center Report — Year-End 2025. Tennessee, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Texas are now considered the top emerging markets for data centers.\n\nTexas alone has 6.5 gigawatts of data center capacity under construction.\n\nThat amount of power is roughly equivalent to more than three Hoover Dams or over 17,000 Tesla Model 3s when using the US Department of Energy's standard, and it accounts for about one-fifth of the 35 gigawatts of data center capacity the US added to its pipeline.\n\nThat 35 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of the UK or Italy, and adding it would nearly double the existing data center capacity in the US, according to JLL.\n\nPart of Texas's appeal is its sprawl.\n\nThe state houses some of the most ambitious data center projects in the country. Oracle and OpenAI's flagship Stargate data center is in Abilene, Google is planning a $40 billion expansion in West Texas, and Meta is building a massive new site in El Paso, just to name a few.\n\nTexas also has abundant energy resources, which is good news for data center developers. The AI boom has driven electricity demand to new heights and strained the nation's power grid. In Texas, several data centers — including Stargate — are being built alongside on-site power plants.\n\nNorthern Virginia has been the data center industry's central hub for more than 15 years, going back to the early days of cloud computing. That has changed rapidly as Big Tech spreads out across the country in search of available power, cheap land, and the best tax incentive packages for the coming wave of AI data centers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "I've been selling on Amazon for a year. After storage fees bled me dry, I'm pivoting my e-comm strategy away from it.",
    "description": "A year since launching an e-comm company, I haven't cracked the Amazon code, and the learning curve has gotten expensive.",
    "fullText": "When Amazon tried to charge my business account $288.56 last month, the payment didn't go through. Instead, I got an \"insufficient funds\" notification on my phone.\n\nTurns out, it's expensive to let inventory — especially \"aged inventory\" — sit in an Amazon warehouse.\n\nThe \"aged inventory surcharge\" quite literally bled my business partner and me dry. By February 2026, our business bank account balance sat just above $6.\n\nIn 2024, inspired by the successful e-commerce entrepreneurs and Amazon sellers I write about, I decided to start my own business. I convinced a friend to join me, and we each put in $5,000 from our own savings to launch a pickleball paddle company. We hired my high school English teacher to design our logo, we worked with a sourcing company to find a manufacturer, and we spent about a year developing our paddle before placing our first inventory order in early 2025. The minimum order quantity was 500 units.\n\nWe shipped 250 paddles to ourselves in Los Angeles and sent the other 250 to Amazon.\n\nThe plan was to run a hybrid Shopify-Amazon model while we figured out who our typical customer was. That was advice from an e-commerce industry veteran. He told us that, on Shopify, we'd earn better margins because there are fewer platform fees, but we'd have to generate our own traffic through social media, ads, and word of mouth. On Amazon, we'd sacrifice margin, but gain visibility. As he put it: \"Amazon is guaranteed traffic. There's a guaranteed flow of people who are going to see your product every single day.\"\n\nAfter a year, we haven't cracked the Amazon code, and the learning curve has gotten expensive.\n\nAmong the various Amazon seller fees is an \"aged inventory surcharge.\" It's charged on units stored in its fulfillment network for 181 days or more, in addition to its standard monthly storage fees. The surcharge increases the longer your inventory sits.\n\nItems aged 181 to 210 days cost $0.50 per cubic foot. At 211 to 240 days, it jumps to $1 per cubic foot. Our inventory, sitting in the 331- to 365-day range, costs $5.90 per cubic foot. We didn't fully understand the cost structure until it started hitting our bank account.\n\nHere's a screenshot from our Amazon seller account showing our service fees between November 2025 and February 2026.\n\nLast month, we owed nearly $300 in service fees — much more than we were bringing in in sales. Rather than continue to see that number climb (items aged 456 days or more would cost us $7.90 per cubic foot or $0.35 per unit, whichever is greater), we decided to pull most of our inventory out of Amazon.\n\nThe removal process took five minutes. We submitted a removal order for about 200 paddles, and were surprised when 40 of our units arrived on my doorstep the next day. According to Amazon's website, removal orders can take 90 days or more to process before leaving a fulfillment center, plus another two weeks for delivery.\n\nWe're still waiting on the rest of the inventory, and we haven't fully escaped fees. There's a removal fee, which is charged per unit and based on the unit's shipping weight, that we expect to show up on our next statement. Plus, the 30 or so paddles that we left in Amazon's warehouse will trigger storage fees.\n\nWe don't want to abandon Amazon entirely; we just don't have the time and resources to dedicate to figuring out that sales channel.\n\nFor now, we're shifting our focus to Shopify, in-person events, and wholesale partnerships. If we hit another sales dry spell, at least we won't be paying hundreds of dollars a month just to store our own product.\n\nWe're not discouraged. It's just one more lesson in our crash course in e-commerce, but it's a big one: Understand the fees. On Amazon, unsold product isn't harmless. It's expensive.",

    "fullText": "DoorDash CEO Tony Xu says that his company's grocery offering has a key advantage over Amazon: choice.\n\nAmazon is doubling down on grocery delivery, especially perishables like produce and ice cream. The retail and tech giant said last month that it's expanding same- and next-day grocery delivery to more parts of the US this year, adding to the thousands of towns and cities it already serves — news that sent shares of Instacart and DoorDash tumbling at the time.\n\nDoorDash, though, has something that shoppers want and that Amazon isn't replicating, Xu said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.\n\nUnlike Amazon, which owns Whole Foods and several of its own food brands, DoorDash works with existing grocery chains. The delivery service has struck deals in recent years. Last year, it expanded its partnership with Kroger and signed new deals with regional chains, including Schnucks in the Midwest.\n\nFew customers complete all their grocery shopping at a single chain, Xu said. Many stop at multiple stores each week, especially to find specific fresh groceries, such as produce, meat, and seafood.\n\n\"Consumers prefer choice,\" Xu said on the call, adding that he expects there to \"continue to be very strong interest in the DoorDash product\" as a result.\n\nDoorDash is also expanding its services for retailers, such as fulfillment through its DashMarts, convenience store-sized retail spaces designed for picking and delivering orders.\n\nXu said DoorDash is \"doing that for every single grocer so that they have the capability to compete against companies like Amazon.\"\n\nDoorDash shares rose as much as 14% in after-market trading on Wednesday, despite disappointing fourth-quarter earnings and guidance for 2026. The company's stock took its biggest one-day hit in November after it unveiled plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on tech improvements.\n\nWhile DoorDash has become known for restaurant deliveries, its gig workers are increasingly making grocery deliveries — many of which make more financial sense for DoorDash.\n\nXu said DoorDash has attracted more big grocery orders from customers, not just small fill-in trips. That matters in the grocery industry, where grocers tend to make more money when customers buy a wider range of goods.\n\n\"People use us for both the quick runs as well as the stock-up use cases,\" he said.\n\nRavi Inukonda, DoorDash's CFO, said on the call that DoorDash's retail and grocery business expects to \"be unit-economic positive\" in the second half of 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Google is releasing their budget a-series version of the Pixel 10 on March 5, a whole month earlier than the 9a was released in 2025. There is not much dividing the 10a from the 9a, but there are a few software updates that can make it worth it for some people. Throw in a $100 Amazon gift card, and it's hard to say no. Google has the pre-orders for the Google 10a out already, going for $499, plus the gift card. Alternatively, you can get their Pixel Buds 2a instead of the $100 gift card for the same $499 price.\n\nLifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt actually got her hands on the Pixel 10a during a recent Google demo event. As she pointed out, the specs on the Pixel 10a are not like the Pixel 10. It's more similar to the 9 instead. It has a Tensor G4 processor, 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of storage, as well as the same camera system, with a 48MP main lens, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 13MP selfie camera. The battery life is the same 30+ hours, too, and the MagSafe-like Pixelsnap feature is gone. The main upgrade here is a brighter 3,000 nits screen, a thinner bezel, and an improved Corning Gorilla Glass 7i cover glass. But the value might be in the software and AI.\n\nThere are two AI camera features that debuted with the Pixel 10. One is Auto Best Take, which takes 150 frames in one click, chooses the best picture, and automatically deletes the rest (or stitches together elements from multiple shots to make a new \"best\" image). And Camera Coach, which guides you with AI on how to take the best picture. Google also brought Satellite SOS for the first time to an a-series phone. It lets you connect to a Satellite and ping emergency services for help if you have no cell signal.\n\nIf you're thinking of upgrading from a Pixel 9a or later, there's not much here to make it worth it. However, if you have anything older than a Pixel 9 or are switching to Pixel for the first time, this is a great opportunity and phone to do so.",

    "fullText": "Home Depot and Lowe’s have dominated the home improvement and hardware retail sectors for decades, continuing to rise above hardware cooperatives True Value Hardware and Ace Hardware, and making life even harder for independent hardware retailers.\n\nIn recent years, Amazon has also surpassed True Value and Ace as the No. 3 destination for home improvement products.\n\nHome Depot captured an average of 28% of the home improvement market sales in 2025, while Lowe’s followed with 17% of the market, and Amazon had about 11% of sales, according to the Numerator Home Improvement Tracker, which was updated on Feb. 4.\n\nWith Home Depot, Lowe's, and Amazon holding a combined 56% of the market's sales last year, the hardware cooperatives and independent retailers have had a difficult time competing and remaining in business.\n\nAce, True Value, and independent hardware stores are a convenient source for tools and other home improvement products for me, as I can quickly navigate a smaller store for my needs as opposed to much larger big-box stores.\n\nAnd I find that the employees at the smaller stores near me have often worked at the stores for years and have a quick answer for my needs.\n\nHowever, even long-time community hardware stores that have operated for over 50 years are struggling to stay open.\n\nIndependent hardware store C&H Hardware of Yakima, Wash., which operated for 65 years, had enough problems competing against the hardware and home improvement chain giants, but the store could not compete against lower online prices and shut down permanently in November 2025.\n\n\"This year has been tough because everybody’s buying online now,” C&H store owner Jay Fleck said before shutting his doors permanently. “You can get stuff online cheaper than you can come in and pay us.”\n\nFleck said business was good at C&H before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, but business deteriorated afterward.\n\n“It was smooth until Covid hit,” Fleck said. “Of course, we were fortunate to have stayed open. A lot of other places had to shut down. So, we’ve done pretty good through Covid. And after that, it was kind of over. It’s been a downhill slide ever since.”\n\nAnd now, 53-year-old Home Depot rival Blossom True Value Hardware will close its doors for the final time in summer 2026 when its lease expires.\n\nThe Mountain View, Calif.,-based hardware store will permanently close, after suffering a loss of about half of its business since the Covid-19 pandemic subsided, longtime store owner Paul Zeitman told Mountain View Voice.\n\n\"Every year is worse than before. People are buying less and less,\" Zeitman said.\n\nZeitman explained that the store's monthly rent is reasonable but is no longer affordable.\n\nThe store owner said that Blossom True Value was allowed to remain open during the pandemic as an essential business and benefited from people buying hardware and home improvement goods to fix up their homes until the pandemic subsided.\n\nBankrupt restaurant chains permanently close popular locations\n\nMajor retail chain closes 35 stores nationwide, no bankruptcy\n\nAnother major retail chain closes warehouse operations\n\nThe retailer lost half its business as regular customers moved away, and e-commerce expanded further since the end of the pandemic, according to Mountain View Voice.\n\nThe store owner said Ace Hardware's expansion and opening of new stores in the region also cut into the retailer's business.\n\nZeitman said the final factor in the decision to close down was rising tariffs.\n\nMuch of Blossom True Value's merchandise is imported from China, and has been affected by the Trump administration's higher tariffs that have increased prices and cut into profits, while sales have also dropped, he said.\n\nRetailer distress has been blamed on high rents and labor costs, online shopping, and competition from big-box retailers, according to Mountain View City Councilman John McAlister, who is also Blossom's retail neighbor.\n\nHome Depot and Lowe's closest stores to Mountain View are in neighboring Sunnyvale, Calif.\n\nHome Depot, 28% of sales in 2025",

    "description": "Anni Chen says vibe coding is hard to resist. It speeds up her productivity, but she doesn't trust it blindly.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Anni Chen, who has worked at Amazon for about three-and-a-half years. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified her employment history.\n\nI'm a tech lead at Amazon responsible for deploying large-scale generative AI and LLM-driven systems. I focus on what we call memory, which powers personalization in generative AI experiences across Amazon.\n\nI vibe code every day. It's definitely a productivity boost.\n\nFor debugging or small tasks, I sometimes treat it like a lottery. Maybe it will produce something amazing. Sometimes, it does.\n\nVibe coding helps me brainstorm what the solution could look like, even if I don't adopt the final solution it proposes. Vibe coding also speeds up the time spent rewriting code when you realize a requirement wasn't covered.\n\nWhen I vibe code, it's always iterative. I give it the basic information it needs, it produces a version, then I check it — similar to a code review with coworkers. I might say, \"You missed this part\" or \"You missed that part.\"\n\nThe AI sometimes fixes issues but introduces something new. You have to keep an eye on it.\n\nFor complex tasks, you need more double-checking. But even with the extra checking, it's still faster.\n\nI was working with a partner team and ran into complex locking issues. Without an LLM, I might have taken a day to research possible solutions, especially since it was relatively new to me.\n\nWithin 15 minutes, I brainstormed with the LLM about possible solutions. I pointed out weaknesses in its suggestions and asked it to improve them. In 15 minutes, I had a proposal to send to the team.\n\nTechnical knowledge helps — you know what's a good solution and what's not. You know what tastes good, but you don't know what dishes are available. The LLM brings up all the dishes, and you choose.\n\nStill, I'm hesitant to use vibe coding directly in production.\n\nLLMs are very good at solving problems, but sometimes they make implicit assumptions you don't realize they're making. If you don't tell it explicitly, for example, that something needs to work for multi-threading, it might just produce the minimum version that works, but when it's large-scale or productionized, it could crash.\n\nNon-technical builders could tell an LLM to build something that handles millions of users. But if you have zero technical knowledge, it's hard to anticipate constraints upfront. If you don't tell the model the implicit assumptions, it won't respect those constraints. Later, you'll run into problems.\n\nNon-technical people might use the LLM to fix issues reactively. But technical people can anticipate constraints proactively and prevent problems in the first place.\n\nTechnical people also understand vibe-coded content better, and they're in a better position to understand what LLMs are good at and not good at. For example, knowing how they're trained and why they're weaker at certain tasks like math. That understanding helps you master them as tools.\n\nWhen you scale to one million or 100 million customers, systems need to be coded differently to handle that scale.\n\nInitially, leadership pushed vibe coding. Our team is a GenAI team, so we were naturally more receptive. In non-GenAI teams, engineers initially reacted like, \"No, I won't let AI do my job. I don't trust AI-generated code.\"\n\nAfter people tried it, attitudes shifted. People realized it's pretty good sometimes. Now it's more widely adopted.\n\nIt's very hard to resist vibe coding nowadays. If you're an employee, leadership sees the productivity boost and will encourage you to use it.\n\nWhen your peers are using it and coding faster, it's hard to resist. If you can't keep up with the speed, it becomes difficult to collaborate.\n\nEven if you resist, you still consume AI passively. AI comments are embedded in code reviews. So even if you don't vibe code directly, you're still interacting with AI outputs.\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding? Contact this reporter at cmlee@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Amazon shutters Blue Jay robot as it transitions to Orbital, a new modular warehouse system enhancing same-day delivery capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Amazon has pulled the plug on one of its newest warehouse robots, a few months after unveiling it.\n\nBlue Jay, a multi-armed robotic system Amazon launched in October for its same-day delivery warehouses, quietly shut down in January, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMany employees who worked on the project were reassigned to other robotics initiatives, the people added, while asking not to be identified discussing private matters.\n\nThe move shows how hard it is to develop AI robotics technology that's useful and cost-effective. Generative AI has made huge gains in the digital world, thanks to free training data on the web. In the physical realm, useful training data is harder to come by, and the challenges of operating robots in real-world settings are much greater.\n\nTerrence Clark, an Amazon spokesperson, told Business Insider that Blue Jay's core technology will be carried over to other initiatives across the company's network of warehouses. He added that Blue Jay was one of several warehouse robotics bets Amazon has made, alongside efforts such as Vulcan, Sparrow, and Proteus.\n\n\"We're always experimenting with new ways to improve the customer experience and make work safer, more efficient, and more engaging for our employees,\" Clark said in a statement.\n\nBlue Jay was one of Amazon Robotics' biggest announcements last year.\n\nDeveloped in just over a year, far faster than earlier robots like Robin or Sparrow, it leveraged advances in AI to accelerate training and deployment. The machine featured multiple robotic arms capable of reaching and lifting several items at once, a design intended to boost productivity while creating a safer environment for frontline workers.\n\nWhen Amazon unveiled Blue Jay in October, the company said it was being piloted at a fulfillment center in South Carolina and described it as a \"core technology\" for powering same-day delivery while lowering costs.\n\nInternally, though, the project ran into headwinds. People familiar with the effort cited Blue Jay's high cost, manufacturing complexity, and implementation challenges as reasons it was ultimately put on pause.\n\nWhile the Blue Jay system itself is being shelved, Amazon plans to incorporate parts of its technology into future systems, including a new one called \"Flex Cell\" that will be more floor-mounted, the people said. (Blue Jay was mounted to the ceiling).\n\nThe shift is part of a move by Amazon away from an older same-day warehouse system known internally as \"Local Vending Machine,\" or LVM, the people said. LVM facilities were built as largely monolithic systems, with automation tightly integrated into a single, massive structure. Blue Jay was designed to operate within that framework.\n\nNow, Amazon is pivoting to a new same-day warehouse system called \"Orbital.\" Unlike LVM, Orbital is designed to be modular, consisting of many components that can be assembled in different configurations, according to the people who spoke to Business Insider. The more flexible structure is intended to make the system easier to deploy and scale.\n\nOrbital is better suited to smaller same-day delivery warehouses, rather than the sprawling fulfillment centers Amazon has historically operated.\n\nThe system could also potentially be installed as a micro-fulfillment solution in the back of Whole Foods stores, an area Amazon is prioritizing, the people said. Orbital is also expected to handle chilled products, such as groceries. Amazon is revamping its same-day delivery efforts to close the gap with Walmart in groceries and other perishable goods.\n\nAn Orbital rollout remains some time away. The first same-day warehouse built around the Orbital system is not expected to open until 2027, according to people familiar with the project.\n\nHave a tip?

It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAmazon was part of my daily life for 11.5 years, and suddenly it was gone.\n\nThere's no right way or easy way to do layoffs. I watched my team members get laid off in 2023, and I know how difficult it is. Still, when I received an email in the middle of the night in October 2025 saying I'd been laid off from my senior software development manager position, I was shocked.\n\nWatching my teenage daughter navigate her own difficult situation taught me the biggest lesson in how to move forward well. Now I'm applying to jobs and working on upskilling in AI so I can be proactive, not reactive, to the tech industry.\n\nOnly time will tell if this layoff is a blessing in disguise, but for now, it has led to a refreshing change.\n\nI loved my time at Amazon, and I really feel as though it's a place for exceptional people. The number of quality brains in the office, throwing around ideas and solving a custom problem, was amazing.\n\nThe morning after my layoff, I had a mandated 30-minute meeting with my manager, and it actually went very well. We talked about the layoff, and he offered me support. He delivered it all to me in a very positive, human way, and it was really affirming.\n\nAn old manager also reached out to meet me at a local coffee shop the next day to spend time together and check in on my state of mind. I think he wanted to go about the layoffs right, which isn't easy to do.\n\nI felt attached to the layoff for the first few days; however, I knew there was no way to control what happened — I could only control how I reacted to it.\n\nMy daughter is a senior in high school, and she had an adverse situation happen to her last year that required recovery. How she reacted in that difficult time inspired me. Her mental model was: \"Challenges don't have to keep me from showing up for myself or for others.\" Her positive attitude was inspiration for me to do the same.\n\nI kind of learned from her that I had to take this layoff with positivity, keep my cool, and focus on what was next.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I lost my father and spent the next month in India supporting my family. I took about a month to settle my mind, reflect on what I wanted next for my career, and help my daughter finish her college essays.\n\nIt's been a very refreshing change to think about what I want next in my engineering career. I'm less focused on the size or name of the next company I work for, and more on what I'd be doing there. I'm looking forward to hopefully heading the engineering for something that has a great impact on customers. Right now, I don't think that can be done without AI, so I'm working on upskilling.\n\nI want to be proactive, not reactive, about the AI skills I'll need in the future. My team at Amazon used some AI tools, so I'm familiar with some, but I was only able to spend a fraction of my workday using them. Now, I'm building those skills myself.\n\nI started working on a hobby AI project a couple of weeks ago, to go hands-on with AI and be more grounded in the reality of what the AI landscape is like right now. It's been different, and a refreshing change, to build something myself rather than to study it, read about it, or work on a team developing it.\n\nWhen I had a job, it was easy for my first priority to be work. Now I'm making sure that my top priority is my health. I've been going to the gym four or five days a week, and I'm refining a health plan to follow even after I start working again.\n\nOnce I'm done at the gym, my time is a 50/50 split between learning AI and applying to jobs or networking. I'm applying for head of engineering roles where I'd own significant impactful initiatives, averaging 2-3 applications every week.\n\nI made a post on LinkedIn about my layoff, and I received so many supportive comments, texts, and calls from people — some I hadn't talked to in decades. Someone from college whom I hadn't talked to in over 25 years reached out, and it was so nice. It felt like we never disconnected. I've also had multiple job leads come from my post, which I'm following up on.\n\nAs of now, I have some worries about when I'll find my next job, but this time has given me the ability to work on things I wasn't able to before. I'm making sure I spend this time with a lot of positivity, not letting negative thoughts come around.\n\nMy advice to anyone undergoing layoffs is to realize that layoffs are not about you. It's about an environment that is driving layoffs. Secondly, now that this has happened, you can't go back in the past and change it. Look forward to what you can do next. How you react is very important.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being laid off from Amazon? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Two former Amazon leaders share why an RTO mandate and the AI boom led them to quit — and their advice for others weighing a big career move.",
    "fullText": "Nicole Landis Ferragonio and Joe Luchs first met more than a decade ago in New York City through mutual friends. Years later, while working together at Amazon, they began talking seriously about leaving the company to build a startup of their own.\n\nLast year, Ferragonio was working as a senior manager of a 55-person product and engineering team focused on data and measurement in the Amazon Ads division. At the same time, Luchs was the global head of the Amazon Web Services and Ads partnership. As they worked together on data projects, they both observed the same pattern. Businesses hoping to use their own internal data to inform decisions were often unable to do so because the businesses' data was fragmented and inconsistent.\n\nSo Ferragonio and Luchs started talking — and began discussing a business idea that might help solve the problem they'd witnessed. Last March, Luchs resigned from Amazon to focus full-time on researching and building the company. Ferragonio followed in September, around which time she, Luchs, and their two other cofounders formally launched Datalinx AI, an \"AI data refinery\" they said is designed to help companies turn their data into trusted, actionable intelligence.\n\nIn January, the company raised $4.2 million in seed funding, led by High Alpha, with participation from Databricks Ventures, Aperiam, and a group of operators and founders. It plans to continue testing its product with a second group of customers in the second quarter of 2026 and is set to generate revenue this month with its first paying customer.\n\nFerragonio and Luchs shared why they left Amazon, how they decided the timing was right, and what advice they have for others considering a big career move.\n\nHere is a selection of their responses, lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nNicole Landis Ferragonio (35, lives in New York City): For me, I think the tipping point for exploring something outside of Amazon was some of the policy changes that went into effect last year, particularly the five-day return-to-office mandate. It raised some questions about how much agency you really have in Big Tech and what would be possible on our own, where we're establishing our own norms.\n\nAdditionally, my biggest motivation is building something from scratch on my own instead of within a big company, and the pace of AI adoption makes this a rare window to do something new. It felt like the right moment to make the jump.\n\nJoe Luchs (38, lives in New York City): I think there's a point in life when you have this combination of experience plus energy, and that's a very good time to start a business. This is my fifth startup I've worked at, and I'm still young enough to put in an 80-hour week — I think that combination is good for starting a company. (Editor's note: He said he's had two successful exits — BlueKai and Beeswax)\n\nAlso, when you looked at these amazing AI technologies and what they're capable of, it started to become very clear that this tech was game-changing. Despite the fact that I had great opportunities at Amazon, the FOMO of not being able to get in on this AI opportunity was another driver to make me want to move fast here.\n\nFerragonio: I was really focused on getting customer input through interviews to really ensure that I had a clear product vision before making the decision to resign in September.\n\nLuchs: I resigned in March because I just felt like I wasn't moving fast enough. This AI world is rapidly evolving, and I wanted to make sure that I immersed myself in it to understand it. Amazon is a challenging work environment, and it became very clear that having a full-time job while trying to build out a business vision was not something that I could easily manage.\n\nFerragonio: I think I'm in a good place financially because of the opportunities I've had both at Amazon and before to take this leap. However, since this is my first startup, it was definitely something I contemplated for a bit. That's why I was really focused on getting feedback from prospective customers and making sure we had a product we had a clear vision for before I left Amazon. As of 2026, we both now have a small salary.\n\nLuchs: I think if you want to accrue the benefits of what startups can afford you, you often have to make some sacrifices, including short-term compensation. However, you'll never learn faster than you will in a startup environment, and I think that's worth its weight in gold.\n\nI also think there were a lot of folks that may have thought there was a lot of safety in Big Tech, but recent layoffs suggest that's not necessarily the case.\n\nFerragonio: I would say getting the operations up and running is one challenge, including things like health insurance, accounting, taxes, and incorporation. We're currently a team of four cofounders and two founding engineers, and we're actively hiring additional engineers.\n\nOn top of that, there's the challenge of balancing customer feedback in the early days. We've talked to hundreds of potential customers, and while you start to get very clear signals about what they say they want, until customers are actually using the product, you don't really know what works. The feedback changes from \"here's a mountain of things that you could build\" to what you should build to truly solve their problems.\n\nSo, balancing getting enough features to get customers excited without overbuilding is a delicate balance.\n\nFerragonio: Don't wait for the perfect time. There's rarely a perfect moment to leave your job, and there's always a reason to stay, especially in Big Tech.\n\nI'd also recommend talking to as many people as you can — friends, stakeholders, potential customers — to help strengthen your conviction in your business idea.\n\nLuchs: I think one of the biggest barriers for a lot of potential entrepreneurs is that they don't know how to do things like incorporate a company or get people health insurance. But every amazing entrepreneur that you see up there giving a keynote speech really had no idea what they were doing at one point.\n\nWhat it really came down to is just, \"Did this person have the conviction and the belief that they could actually see it through and figure out these problems?\" And if you listen to customers and you're willing to work hard, that is half the battle. So as long as folks are willing to do those things, I think that it should give them conviction that they'll be able to figure it out over the course of time.\n\nEditor's Note: Business Insider contacted Amazon for comment on this story. It didn't respond.",

    "fullText": "Presidents' Day sales are around the corner, and the deals are coming in early; right now, Amazon has the latest Kindle Paperwhite from 2024 in \"Like-New\" conditions for $114.99 (originally $143.99). This Paperwhite in new condition would cost you $159.99, making the refurbished version a much cheaper choice to get while it lasts (discounted Kindle Paperwhites usually sell out quickly).\n\nThe Kindle Paperwhite is the most popular reading tablet from Amazon, and it's the best for most people, according to PCMag's \"outstanding\" review. It offers many improvements over the 11th-generation version from 2021—mainly a larger seven-inch display and a much faster boost in performance. It still retains all of the great attributes that made the previous version great, like a fully waterproof design with an IPX8 rating, enough storage to hold more than 10,000 books, and unlimited cloud storage. If you want an ad-free experience with some better features, get the Signature Edition.\n\nIf you're not sure if this is the right Kindle for you, check out the Colorsoft version—it offers color, so it can make reading manga or comics more lively. We also have a breakdown of every kind of Kindle to help you decide. If you already own the 11th generation, there might not be enough here to warrant an upgrade, unless you just want the latest Amazon has to offer. However, any devices older than that may be worth an upgrade for features like Bluetooth compatibility, which is great for audiobooks.\n\nThe screen features a 300 ppi (pixels per inch) display with 16 levels of background lighting, and optional warm lighting as well. I use this feature to read before bed and not strain my eyes. I also love the absurdly long battery life. This one is estimated at up to 12 weeks on a single charge, depending on your use and brightness settings.",

    "description": "Ring, owned by Amazon, faced criticism for its dog-finding Super Bowl ad. In its wake, Ring ended its partnership with Flock Safety.",
    "fullText": "Many viewers found Ring's Super Bowl ad more creepy than cute. Days after after it aired, Ring is now canceling a controversial contract that came under scrutiny amid the backlash.\n\nThe smart doorbell company owned by Amazon ran a commercial during the Super Bowl featuring its dog-finding feature, Search Party. What was meant to pull at the heartstrings — what's cuter than a young girl reunited with her lost dog? — turned into public pushback as people voiced surveillance concerns.\n\nSome social media brought attention to Ring's coming partnership with Flock Safety, a company with ties to law enforcement agencies. Four days after the Super Bowl, Ring announced that the integration \"would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.\"\n\nWith that, the Ring and Flock partnership was put to bed.\n\nIn April, Ring founder Jamie Siminoff returned to the company with a renewed focus on security and crime-fighting.\n\nThat October, the company announced that law enforcement agencies using two of Flock Safety's platforms would be able to request Ring footage via Community Requests. Importantly, it said, releasing the footage was entirely optional; Ring users could decline (or ignore) the requests.\n\nFlock has long faced controversies. The security company provides a network of automated license plate readers, with many of its clients being law enforcement agencies. In May, 404 Media reported that some local police were doing lookups in the system for ICE. (Amazon previously said it had not partnered with ICE.)\n\nAmazon and Flock are saying the decision to end their partnership was a mutual one. Ring wrote in its press release that the deal was canceled after a \"comprehensive review,\" and that the company is sticking to its mission to \"make neighborhoods safer.\"\n\nIn an email to Business Insider, an Amazon spokesperson wrote that the integration \"was never live, and no videos were ever shared between these services.\"\n\nFlock wrote that the decision \"allows both companies to best serve their respective customers and communities.\"\n\nRing's Super Bowl ad was meant to make customers feel like a \"hero in their neighborhood.\" Instead, it left many feeling overly surveilled.\n\nThe ad followed a young girl who lost her dog, Milo. She submits a Community Request to Ring, at which point a neighborhood of cameras uses AI to track down the dog. Milo comes bounding up the steps, and the girl is thrilled.\n\nThe commenters aren't so thrilled. Some of the most popular comments — with thousands of likes each — say its an example of \"dystopia becoming reality\" and that, if they can identify a dog, \"they can identify you.\"\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation pointed to the ad as an example of Ring's \"surveillance nightmare.\"\n\nThere are some important disclaimers here. Like the Flock partnership, the Search Party feature requires consent to release footage. If your camera spots a lost dog, you can still reject or ignore the request.\n\nThe feature also seems to be working. Amazon says that Search Party has found 99 dogs in 90 days.\n\nNevertheless, the Super Bowl ad left many viewers feeling uneasy. One YouTube commenter sums up what many compared to a dystopic vibe: \"Well, this is the creepiest thing I've seen in a while.\"",

    "description": "Amazon, Microsoft, and Google raised capex plans to breathtaking new levels. That suggests knowledge that outsiders don't have, Bernard Golden writes.",
    "fullText": "Big tech earnings season was dominated by AI capex projections that stunned investors and hit the stocks of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, aka AMG.\n\nThis short-term drama makes it hard to think clearly about the long-term trajectory of AMG's businesses. To step back from the volatility, I use a framework called \"KGB\" that lays out three scenarios for the future of hyperscaler capex.\n\nI've worked in the tech industry for decades and written several books on cloud-computing and open-source software. I've had hands-on experience with major cloud projects at VMware and Capital One. Here's my suggestion for how to think about this unprecedented AI investment wave.\n\nIn this future, AMG are locked in an arms race, each spending aggressively to avoid falling behind. A more charitable version says executives believe failing to integrate AI is an existential threat, so they'll spend whatever it takes to avoid becoming the next digital Sears. Skeptics see this as reckless competition — burning cash for bragging rights, with tears and heavy losses inevitable.\n\nHere, AMG spending ends up \"just right\" to meet customer demand. These companies have unmatched visibility into future AI usage: real-time telemetry, signed long-term contracts, and ongoing enterprise negotiations. From this perspective, rising capex simply reflects confidence in durable demand and solid monetization.\n\nAs in Jaws, when the police chief finally sees the gigantic shark and mutters, \"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\" In this scenario, no matter how much AI capacity AMG builds, it gets absorbed immediately. The supply of chips, servers, power, and data centers remains the binding constraint, not demand. The problem isn't overspending; it's the inability to spend fast enough.\n\nRight now, the K and B camps are locked in a noisy brawl, while G adherents watch with bemusement. Part of the disagreement comes from how hard it is to grasp the scale of these businesses.\n\nAmazon's cloud business, AWS, is running at roughly $142 billion in annual revenue, growing 24%. That implies more than $34 billion in incremental revenue over the next year alone. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are second and third, but are still huge businesses, backed by the financial firepower of their money-printing parent companies.\n\nMost observers also fail to appreciate the enormous social and economic change underpinning this growth. The world is in the midst of a decades-long shift from analog to digital processes, which has plenty of future growth ahead of it. AI is just the latest addition to the trend, following the rise of the Internet, cloud computing, and enterprise software adoption. AMG are benefitting from a gigantic trend that will continue for years, if not decades. So maybe spending more than $600 billion on capex this year isn't foolhardy.\n\nThere's an obvious playbook to calm markets. In 2022, after pandemic-era overbuilding spooked investors, AMG executives promised financial discipline, made some cost tweaks, and watched their stocks recover spectacularly over the next two years. They could have done the same this quarter: keep a lid on capex, cite supply-chain constraints, and promise to revisit later. Their stocks likely would have popped on Goldilocks relief.\n\nObviously, AMG didn't do that. They ramped capex plans to breathtaking new levels. These companies are run by the same executives who lived through the 2022 drawdown. Their compensation is heavily equity-based, so they just took a big hit again. The fact that they chose to increase capex anyway should give observers pause. It suggests confidence based on knowledge that outsiders don't have.\n\nMaybe this really is the Jaws moment. Maybe demand is so strong, and visibility so clear, that AMG know the real risk isn't overspending. It's showing up to hunt the shark without a big enough boat.\n\nBernard Golden is CEO of Navica, a Silicon Valley-based technology analysis, consulting, and investment firm.",

    "fullText": "Ring is terminating its partnership with police tech provider Flock Safety, the Amazon-owned company announced Thursday.\n\nThe partnership between Flock and Ring came under scrutiny after the Amazon doorbell company ran an ad during the Super Bowl that touted a \"Search Party\" feature that uses AI to help locate lost pets. The Electronic Frontier Foundation called the feature a \"surveillance nightmare.\"\n\nFlock, meanwhile, operates a network of automated license plate readers, and sells access to that software to customers that include law enforcement agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.\n\nRing's decision to cancel its partnership with Flock comes as tech companies face growing pressure to reexamine their work with federal agencies. Earlier this week, Salesforce employees pressed CEO Marc Benioff to cancel \"ICE opportunities,\" CNBC reported. More than 900 Google employees also asked their company to divest itself from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nPrivacy and civil liberties advocates called on Ring to drop its partnership with Flock. A protest calling on the e-commerce company to cut its ties with Flock, ICE and CBP is scheduled for Friday, outside of Amazon's Seattle headquarters.\n\n\"Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated,\" Ring wrote in a blog post. \"As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration.\"\n\nFlock representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAmazon acquired Ring for $839 million in 2018. The home security company is primarily known for its connected doorbell devices, which can record footage and alert users to activity around their home or business via an app.\n\nRing has long sparked controversy about privacy due to its partnerships with police. In recent years, the company had adopted a softer image, positioning its devices as a tool to capture porch pirates and family-friendly hijinks. After founder Jamie Siminoff returned as CEO last year, the company has re-embraced its original mission of fighting crime.\n\nThe Amazon company announced its partnership with Flock last October, giving owners of its video doorbells the option to share footage with law enforcement agencies that use the startup's software to assist with their \"evidence collection and investigative work.\"\n\nFlock's systems have been adopted by thousands of communities and law enforcement agencies across the country, and both ICE and CBP have increasingly accessed Flock's data as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nRing spokesperson Emma Daniels said in a statement that the Flock partnership was never active, and the companies never announced a date for it to go live.\n\n\"No videos were ever shared between these services,\" Daniels said.\n\nThe news was earlier reported by The Verge.",

    "fullText": "He worked in Big Tech. Now, he fears half of its software engineers are on the chopping block.\n\nSteve Yegge worked with Jeff Bezos in Amazon's early years. Then he went to Google, where he worked for over 12 years and earned the title of senior staff software engineer. He also knows a thing or two about AI engineering, having written a book on the topic titled \"Vibe Coding.\"\n\nOn \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" podcast and newsletter, Yegge described an imaginary dial of the percentage of engineering staff a company can lay off, ranging from zero to 100. He said he believes the dial is being set at 50 in the age of AI.\n\n\"You're going to have to get rid of half of them to make the other half maximally productive,\" Yegge said. \"We're going to lose around half the engineers from big companies, which is scary\".\n\nThere's a capital-to-labor tradeoff happening in tech. Companies are paying vast sums for tokens and enterprise AI licenses, GPUs, and computing capacity. That money needs to come from somewhere — and for some, it could come from labor costs.\n\nYegge pointed to this tradeoff as the reason for his forecast of 50% cuts becoming the norm. Companies will lay off some engineers to help pay for the others to have adequate access to AI, he said.\n\nHost Gergely Orosz said that 50% cuts would be more than during the COVID-19 pandemic, when tech went through an intense layoff cycle.\n\n\"It's going to be way bigger,\" Yegge said. \"It's going to be awful.\"\n\nThey aren't the only ones referencing the pandemic. In a popular X article, HyperWrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that AI's impact on work would be \"much, much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nIn recent years, the question of AI-driven layoffs has haunted workers at Big Tech companies, many of which went on a hiring spree during the pandemic. While it's often impossible to boil job loss down a single reason, many suspect productivity gains from AI and ballooning capex spending are fueling the cuts. Some business leaders have also explicitly cited AI when announcing layoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, tech leaders describe smaller teams working more efficiently. On a recent earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said one engineer could now do the work of a whole team, thanks to AI.\n\nAs AI productivity grows, so have complaints of AI fatigue. Software engineer Siddhant Khare penned a lengthy essay about growing more productive, but also feeling more drained than ever. He told Business Insider that he felt like a \"reviewer\" as opposed to an engineer.\n\nYegge said it's not all bad news for the engineers — just those who want to work at a big company. Engineers who have \"seen the light\" are now getting together, leaving their companies, and creating startups that outpace the industry's giants, he said.\n\n\"We've got this mad rush of innovation coming up, bottom up,\" he said. \"And we've got knowledge workers being laid off by big companies because clearly big businesses are not the right size anymore.\"",

Combined with Ring’s recent rollout of its new facial recognition capability, it feels like a short leap for a pet-finding feature to be turned into a tool for state surveillance.\n\nPrivacy expert Chris Gilliard told 404 Media that the ad was “a clumsy attempt by Ring to put a cuddly face on a rather dystopian reality: widespread networked surveillance by a company that has cozy relationships with law enforcement and other equally invasive surveillance companies.”\n\n“This definitely isn’t about dogs — it’s about mass surveillance”\n\nThe fears center on the Amazon-owned Ring’s partnership with Flock Safety, a surveillance technology company that has contracts with law enforcement to use its automated license plate readers, video surveillance systems, and other technologies.\n\nThe partnership connects Ring’s massive residential camera network with an organization that has reportedly allowed ICE to access data from its own nationwide camera network.\n\n“This definitely isn’t about dogs — it’s about mass surveillance,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) posted on X. A vocal critic of Ring’s ties to law enforcement, Markey has pressed for greater transparency into Ring’s connections with law enforcement, along with stronger privacy protections for consumers.\n\nComments on the YouTube video of the ad ranged from “This is a huge problem disguised as a solution,” to “Smart way to gaslight people in mass surveillance.” Video: Ring\n\nRing spokesperson Emma Daniels told The Verge that Search Party is designed to match images of dogs and is “not capable of processing human biometrics.” Additionally, she maintains that the Familiar Faces facial recognition feature is separate from Search Party. It operates on the individual account level, she said, and there’s no communal sharing as there is with Search Party.\n\nWhile Familiar Faces is opt-in for each user, Search Party is enabled by default on any outdoor camera enrolled in Ring’s subscription plan. It works by using AI to scan footage in the cloud for the missing dog once the owner uploads a picture to Ring’s Neighbors app. If a match is found, Ring alerts the camera’s owner, who can then choose to share the video or notify the owner through the app.\n\n“These are not tools for mass surveillance.”\n\n“These are not tools for mass surveillance,” Daniels said. “We build the right guardrails, and we’re super transparent about them.”\n\nWhile that may be the case today, I asked whether Ring cameras could one day be used to specifically search for people. “The way these features are built, they are not capable of that today,” she said. “We don’t comment on feature road maps, but I have no knowledge or indication that we’re building features like that at this point.”\n\nRing users can currently share footage from their cameras with local law enforcement during an active investigation through a feature called Community Requests. Unlike previous Ring police partnerships, Community Request goes through third-party companies — the Taser company Axon and, soon, Flock. “The reason we did that is these third-party evidence management systems offer a much more secure chain of custody,” says Daniels. If a user declines a request, no one will be notified.\n\nThe company maintains that neither the government nor law enforcement can access its network, and that footage is shared only by users or in response to a legal request. Daniels reiterated what the company had previously told The Verge, that it has no partnerships with ICE or any other federal agency, and said you can see every request agencies have made on its Neighbors app profile.\n\nAdditionally, the Flock integration is not currently live, although Daniels had no update on the company’s plans for the partnership following the backlash. She referred me to an earlier response. “As we explore the integration, we will ensure the feature is built for the use of local public safety agencies only — which is what the program is designed for.”\n\nHistory has shown that tools capable of large-scale surveillance are rarely limited to their original purpose\n\nThe problem is that there’s nothing preventing local agencies from sharing footage with federal ones. And while the Super Bowl ad played up heartwarming images of a girl reunited with her puppy, the leap to this technology that can track people in your neighborhood is still very small. Combined with government overreach, it’s not hard to imagine how a powerful network of AI-enabled cameras goes from finding lost dogs to hunting people.\n\nAnd Ring has a history of partnering with the police. While it has rolled back some of that in recent years, since founder Jamie Siminoff returned, the company has renewed its focus on using its products to prevent crime.\n\nSiminoff said he came back because of the possibilities AI brings. With this technology, he believes neighborhood cameras could be used to virtually “zero out crime” within a year. Given these stated goals and the new capabilities AI can bring, why wouldn’t Ring be planning to add some form of Search Party for People to its cameras?\n\nEliminating crime is an admirable goal, but history has shown that tools capable of large-scale surveillance are rarely limited to their original purpose. Ring has a responsibility here to protect its users, which it says it is doing. But ultimately, it comes down to how much you can trust a company – and the company it keeps – to never overstep. If Ring is cloaking its ambitions behind our instinct to protect our furry friends, that trust will be hard to find.",

    "fullText": "Joanelle Cobos began actively job hunting in January after being laid off by Amazon in October.\n\nAfter three prior layoffs, she'd prepared financially for a fourth — which came at Amazon.\n\nThe financial cushion let her relax after the layoff, but the pressure is now setting in.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Joanelle Cobos, a 38-year-old job seeker who lives in Las Vegas. She previously worked for Amazon as a design manager until being laid off last October. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLast October, I was getting ready to head to the office when I noticed two text messages from Amazon that looked like spam, asking me to click a link or check my email. I soon learned that after nearly four years with the company, I'd been laid off — my third layoff since 2019 and the fourth in my career.\n\nSince I'd dealt with job losses so many times, I don't think this layoff affected me emotionally as much as it did some of my coworkers. The idea of having so much free time ahead of me was exciting.\n\nNow, my job search feels like a ticking time bomb, but I'm not in a rush to jump into another large corporation.\n\nBusiness Insider is speaking with workers who've found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations.\n\nShare your story by filling out this form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29.\n\nAfter dealing with nine months of unemployment during my previous layoff, I'd started planning my life around the possibility of losing my job.\n\nI was also preparing to be laid off at Amazon, because my tenure had been plagued by whispers of voluntary resignation programs and job cuts, basically once a year. My job never felt particularly secure.\n\nBecause of the financial cushion I'd built, the paychecks I would receive from Amazon during my continuation period, the severance that followed, and my experience dealing with layoffs before, I didn't feel immediate financial pressure.\n\nRather than jump into the job hunt, I decided to take a pause from October through the end of the year. This time period felt a little like a paid vacation, and given that it overlapped with the holidays, it was almost the perfect time to get laid off.\n\nThen January came. I'd done some research in the prior months to help inform my next career move, but I knew I'd have to ramp up my job search.\n\nI've started actively applying for jobs — including creative project management and creative operations management roles — but I haven't had much success landing interviews yet. I'm not too stressed for now, but I know my paychecks and severance won't last forever; I'll eventually need additional income to stay afloat financially. Accounting for my severance and emergency fund, I have about 10 to 12 months before I run out of funds.\n\nI've had a hard time staying employed at large corporations for any extended period of time. I've been either laid off or left because the pay and benefits weren't good enough. For now, I'm targeting roles at smaller companies that may not be able to pay as much as a larger company, but where I wouldn't feel like just a \"number\" and the job security might be better.\n\nSmaller companies might also offer more work-from-home flexibility. Prior to the layoff, I'd been required to work from the office five days a week, which was about 45-to-50 minutes each way of commuting. I was still the only one in my office on my team, so there was no in-person collaboration for me to benefit from.\n\nI'd like to take a lower-stress, lower-paying job with good health benefits and bridge the financial gap with income from my own business, though I'm not sure what this would be yet. If my job search drags on, I'd be open to exploring more freelance and contract roles.\n\nAfter my previous layoff, I landed a job at Amazon in part because I had a relative who worked there. I doubt my résumé would have been seen without an employee referral. I'm still looking for my break this time around.\n\nTo boost my chances, I've been using generative AI tools to help with résumés, cover letters, and identifying roles I might be qualified for. It's made the job search far less stressful. What used to take a full day now takes just a few hours.\n\nI have two main pieces of advice for others who have been laid off, including other affected Amazon employees. First, take the time to be upset, but don't stay in that headspace too long because that doesn't help you. Layoffs aren't personal — they're a business decision.\n\nSecond, before looking for a new job that is very similar to your prior role, consider whether it's the best fit for you. If you can swing it financially, take some time to think about where you want to go and what you want to do.\n\nWhile job searching can be frustrating, it's also given me the opportunity to reexamine what I want in my career.

    "description": "The tech giant's internal policy promotes an in-house tool called Kiro over Anthropic's Claude Code. Some Amazon engineers are unhappy about this.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors and a key partner in bringing the startup's AI models and products to customers.\n\nInside Amazon, however, employees aren't allowed to use Anthropic's Claude Code for production work or for live products without formal approval.\n\nThat disconnect became more visible late last year, when Amazon rolled out internal guidance steering teams toward Kiro, its in-house AI coding assistant, according to internal messages seen by Business Insider. The guidance encourages using Kiro over non-approved third-party tools, including Claude Code, for production code.\n\nThe policy prompted criticism across internal Amazon forums. In one discussion thread, roughly 1,500 Amazon employees endorsed the formal adoption of Claude Code, according to the messages.\n\nThe restrictions have been particularly awkward for engineers who help sell AWS Bedrock, Amazon's platform that offers customers access to third-party AI services, including Claude Code. Some questioned how they could credibly promote a product they are not permitted to use themselves in official work.\n\n\"Customers will ask why they should trust or use a tool that we did not approve for internal use,\" one employee wrote.\n\nThe episode highlights the complexity of Amazon's relationship with Anthropic. While Amazon is racing to build and promote its own AI tools, it is also marketing a partner's competing technology. Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors, with a stake valued at more than $60 billion. Anthropic, in turn, is a major AWS customer, committing to use Amazon's cloud services and at least one million of Amazon's Trainium chips.\n\n\"We are seeing incredible improvements in efficiency and delivery from Kiro, our customer growth is rapidly accelerating, and we want to make sure our internal employees all take advantage of this capability to deliver faster for our customers,\" an Amazon spokesperson said. \"While we continue to support existing tools in use today, we do not plan to support additional, third-party AI development tools.\"\n\nAmazon maintains \"a strong strategic partnership with Anthropic,\" and while there's no explicit ban on Claude Code, the company applies \"stricter requirements for the tools used to develop production code specifically,\" the spokesperson said, noting that Amazon provides a process for seeking exceptions.\n\nAn Anthropic spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn one of the internal forums, an Amazon sales engineer flagged the irony of being asked to sell Claude Code even though it isn't formally supported inside the company. The employee wrote that they need to be able to \"use, demo, and build\" with Claude Code to support Amazon's directive to get more customers to use it through AWS Bedrock.\n\nOther Amazon engineers also debated whether the emphasis on Kiro was hindering productivity. Some argued that Claude Code outperformed Amazon's in-house tool and warned that forcing adoption of a weaker product could slow development.\n\n\"A tool that can't keep pace with rivals offers no real innovation,\" one of the Amazon employees wrote. \"And without competitive strength, Kiro's only survival mechanism becomes forced adoption rather than genuine value.\"\n\nClaude Code has become one of the most widely used AI coding services, and it underpins many other similar offerings from other providers. An Amazon spokesperson said about 70% of the company's software engineers used Kiro at least once in January.\n\nIn one forum thread, a manager overseeing Amazon's internal developer tools said he understood the \"frustration\" and \"significant\" interest in Claude Code, citing about 1,500 internal endorsements calling for its formal adoption.\n\nSome employees said frustration deepened after Amazon had previously indicated that Claude Code had cleared security and legal review for production use, according to an internal guideline and messages reviewed by Business Insider. That language was later edited and removed, employees said.\n\nOthers criticized the lack of transparency around the decision not to formally adopt Claude Code, asking what data informed the decision.\n\n\"The trend is clear,\" one employee wrote internally. \"More and more people would like to start using Claude Code and be officially supported by Amazon.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "First, there were collars, then there were microchips. Now, we're using doorbell cameras to track down lost dogs.\n\nRing, Amazon's smart doorbell security system, launched Search Party, an AI system that helps locate lost dogs, last fall. In its first three months, the feature has brought home 99 lost dogs in just 90 days, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.\n\n\"Good example of real-world impact, and proud of what the Ring team has built here,\" Jassy wrote.\n\nRing ran a heartstring-tugging ad about Search Party during the Super Bowl. In it, a family finds their lost dog Milo, thanks to the company's tech.\n\nSome viewers didn't find the ad so heartwarming. Users on X and TikTok posted about how the ad made them feel overly surveilled. Others called it \"dystopian.\"\n\nSome of the online backlash also referenced Ring's recent partnership with Flock Safety. A May story from 404 Media alleged ties between Flock and ICE. Local law enforcement may access Ring videos, but they must submit requests that users can deny or ignore.\n\n\"Ring has no partnership with ICE, does not give ICE videos, feeds, or back-end access, and does not share video with them,\" the company wrote in an earlier statement to Wirecutter.\n\nSearch Party does require sign-offs from individual users to release footage. When a pet owner posts about their lost dog in the Ring app, local cameras begin searching. If your camera spots something that looks like the missing dog, you can approve (or deny) sharing the video.\n\n\"The AI is trained on tens of thousands of dog videos so it can recognize different breeds, sizes, fur patterns, body features, unique marks, shape, and color,\" Jassy wrote. \"And privacy stays in your control—you decide each time whether to help.\"\n\nJassy called it one of the \"compelling use cases of AI.\" Indeed, Amazon's Ring has gone all in on AI — both in its products and in the workplace.\n\nWhen founder Jamie Siminoff returned to lead the department in 2025, he mandated that staff show how they use AI when applying for promotions, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nSiminoff later confirmed the change in an interview. \"We're going to promote based on AI. We're going to promote based on how you're integrating AI into your job,\" Siminoff told Business Insider.\n\nHe also said that the RBKS department — Ring, Blink, Key, and Sidewalk — asked about AI in hiring interviews. The department is looking to hire AI natives, he said.\n\nSearch Party is just one initiative in Siminoff's push to refocus Ring on security. One of his first moves was to replace Ring's socially driven mission (\"Keep people close to what's important\") with one emphasizing safety.\n\nRing's new mission: \"Make neighborhoods safer.\"\n\nAs for those dogs, Jassy shouted out some pups that had made their way home. One military veteran lost his service dog, Lainey. Ring found her later that day.\n\nNyx dug a hole under the fence. Ring found him within 15 minutes.",

    "description": "Big Tech's capital expenditures soar with Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft at the forefront, ushering a new era of AI infrastructure spending.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech is taking the AI age to a whole new level.\n\nWhen Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta announced earnings recently, one set of numbers stole the show: The massive projections for data center spending this year.\n\nThough the industry's capital expenditures — spending on property and equipment — have ramped up in recent years, 2026 is shaping up to be leaps and bounds ahead of any private-sector infrastructure spending in modern history.\n\nThe projections draw comparisons to previous transformational eras, such as the Gilded Age of the late 1800s and the Information Age of the 1990s.\n\nStill, Wall Street questions whether it will bring a return on investment — and investors are starting to get antsy. Shares of Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta were all down as of Friday morning. Microsoft was slightly up.\n\n\"Investors needed more than promises to underwrite this story,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote Thursday in a research note following Amazon's earnings call.\n\nAmazon said Thursday it is planning $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, a more than 50% increase from 2025 and the largest estimated budget among Big Tech companies.\n\nThe forecast came in $50 billion above analysts' expectations, and they were less than impressed — despite Amazon's 14% revenue growth for the quarter compared with the same period last year.\n\nThe company's stock dropped as much as 10% after the bell on Thursday, and was down 8% on Friday morning.\n\nWith spending this extreme, a beat on earnings should be \"table-stakes,\" Bernstein's Shmulik wrote Thursday night in a research note that dripped with sarcasm.\n\n\"If we're going to peg the share price to 2026 CapEx, maybe Amazon should have guided even higher, Shmulik wrote. \"Why not at this point?\"\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet stunned investors on Wednesday when it said it is planning $175 billion to $185 billion in capex for 2026, doubling its budget for the second year in a row.\n\nGoogle, which trails behind Amazon and Microsoft in cloud services, has dramatically increased its spending as demand for its Gemini AI models grows. Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users, the company said on its fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nGoogle's stock was down about 2% Friday morning as investors digested Big Tech's big spending plans for 2026.\n\nOne thing Google has going for it is the growing enthusiasm for Gemini.\n\n\"We believe these investments are rational, given its fast-growing backlog, supporting our view that Alphabet is among the best positioned to emerge as one of the leading, if not the leading, AI platform,\" BNP Paribas analyst Nick Jones wrote Thursday in a research note.\n\nLike its Big Tech peers, Meta will up the ante on AI investment in 2026. It was the only company that seemed to get a pass from investors this earnings season — at first, that is.\n\nMeta said last week it is planning $115 billion to $135 billion in capex, close to doubling its spend from last year. Meta's stock surged 8% on January 29, the morning after its fourth-quarter earnings call. Investors were pleased with the social media giant's strong advertising business, which reported $58.14 billion in ad revenue that quarter. What's more, it saw gains from its advertising AI tools.\n\nSince then, enthusiasm has waned, and the stock has been on a downward slope this week.\n\nMicrosoft reported $37.5 billion in capex for the second quarter of its fiscal 2026. While the company hasn't released full-year capex guidance, S&P last week estimated the figure could be around $97.7 billion, with some analysts projecting slightly more.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud business heavily depends on OpenAI. The ChatGPT-maker represents 45% of its backlog, meaning Microsoft's future cloud revenue largely depends on it. The company's stock fell 12% on January 29, the morning after it reported earnings last week — Microsoft's biggest decline since March 2020.\n\nInvestors seemed pleased with the 17% jump in total revenue, including a 39% spike in revenue from Azure and other cloud services.",

    "description": "After co-creating Amazon Alexa, William Tunstall-Pedoe became an angel investor. When he started his second business, he drew on the invaluable experience of his mentees.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with William Tunstall-Pedoe, 56, an angel investor and founder based in the UK. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2012, I sold my first startup, Evi, to Amazon. It later became Alexa.\n\nThat gave me the capital to invest in the next generation of startups when I left Amazon in 2016. I leaned into that opportunity, becoming both a mentor and a very active angel investor.\n\nIt was one of the best experiences I've had for career development, because I saw almost every situation that a startup can encounter, both good and bad.\n\nWhen I left Amazon, I suddenly found myself with an empty calendar.\n\nI wanted to take a break — six months or so — but I still needed to do something with my days. My calendar filled up faster than I expected.\n\nI started saying yes to things I would have turned down while working at Amazon. I was invited to a party in San Francisco, which is a long way to go when you live in the UK, but I went anyway. I booked a hotel for a couple of weeks and let my time fill up with meetings and other activities.\n\nThe year I left Amazon, 2016, turned out to be a really extraordinary time for me, when I traveled a lot and did some very interesting things.\n\nOne of those was being invited to help the Creative Destruction Lab, a seed-stage program for scalable science and technology-based ventures, founded in 2012 by economists at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\n\nThe premise was simple: mentors who successfully launched companies, like me, provided startups with expertise. Every few months, the mentors and startups would meet to set clear objectives for the next stage of development.\n\nIt was a bit like the \"Weakest Link.\" We'd cut companies, sometimes if they'd fallen short of their goals, at each meeting. Over the course of about nine months, the cohort would narrow, and mentor time and resources would be focused on fewer and fewer businesses.\n\nI did this for about six years. I would fly back and forward from London to Toronto every few months, making angel investments in dozens of promising companies, and for another two years when the program moved to the University of Oxford in 2019.\n\nAround the same time, I became involved with Cambridge Angels, an invite-only network of experienced investors, which gave me exposure to a wide range of early-stage companies and investors.\n\nI knew I wanted to be a founder again one day, but waiting turned out to be the right decision. My time as a mentor and angel investor was great preparation.\n\nWhen I founded my second startup, UnlikelyAI, in 2019, the experience was very different from the first time. I still made mistakes and ran into problems, but I was no longer a novice founder with no support.\n\nThis time, I had the capital to fund the business myself for a while. When I later raised a friends-and-family round, it was largely made up of prominent angel investors I'd met through mentoring and angel investing.\n\nAs a second-time founder, not only did I have a decade of experience from my first startup, but I also had something to complement it: the invaluable, vicarious experience of mentoring hundreds of other startups.",

    "fullText": "At its new Stone Mountain, Georgia, facility, Roomba-like robots shuffle between stacks, another adds shipping labels while another arranges packages in pallets\n\nOne of the reasons Amazon is spending billions on robots? They don’t need bathroom breaks. Arriving a few minutes early to the public tour of Amazon’s hi-tech Stone Mountain, Georgia, warehouse, my request to visit the restroom was met with a resounding no from the security guard in the main lobby.\n\nBetween the main doors and the entrance security gate, I paced and paced after being told I would have to wait for the tour guide to collect me and other guests for a tour of the 640,000-sq-ft, four-story warehouse.\n\nAmazon offers tours to the public at 28 of its 1,200 US warehouses – a recruiting and public-relations tool to boost brand trust and address criticisms of poor working conditions. It was something to consider as I wound up having to go in the parking lot, propping open my rental car door for privacy.\n\nBathroom access is one of the most notorious criticisms of Amazon’s treatment of workers. Amazon delivery drivers and warehouse workers have reported having to pee in water bottles due to lack of time and access, and have even said their bathroom breaks are timed.\n\nZoe Hoffman, an Amazon spokesperson, said it was “absurd and false to connect a visitor’s tour experience to that of our employees”, adding that workers were allowed “regularly scheduled breaks” throughout their shifts.\n\nNone of this will be an issue if Amazon’s multibillion-dollar robot dreams come true.\n\nAmazon cites 10 different robots through its warehouse network, though the Stone Mountain warehouse had only a handful of them, including the Roomba-like robots moving shelves of products around to stowers and pickers, an automated crane arm palletizing products, and a robot along a conveyor belt printing and adding shipping labels to boxes of products set to be mailed out of the warehouse.\n\nSeveral sections of the warehouse were closed off during the tour for construction for upgrades, though specifics weren’t disclosed.\n\nThe tour began with a spiel about how Amazon is a great place to work, rattling off Amazon’s 1.5 million global employees and 1 million workers in the US, before playing a brief video of Amazon workers at a warehouse in the UK that made similar claims.\n\nThe tour guide touted Amazon’s vast seasonal workforce of 250,000 workers, claiming many of those workers are then hired full-time.\n\nCriticisms of Amazon’s safety record, high injury rates, high employee turnover or the worker organizing efforts at the Stone Mountain warehouse after workers passed out on the job from heat exhaustion in 2022 were not mentioned. The tour guide, however, did finally offer guests a bathroom break before leading us through the warehouse.\n\nThe tour guide, from the local area, explained that the warehouse, which opened in late 2020, “came out of nowhere” from an area once covered in forest.\n\nThroughout the first floor of the warehouse, the ceilings were covered with an assembly line conveyor belt of yellow Amazon totes, either empty or filled with miscellaneous goods from grocery items to electronics. The sounds of the conveyor belt bellowing through the warehouse’s first-floor ceiling is loud, and tour guests were given headphones to be able to hear the tour guide. Signs around the warehouse stated “hearing protection required” but several of the workers didn’t appear to have any earplugs or other protection.\n\nThe second floor of the warehouse included worker stations surrounding stacks of products in a dark room. Robots resembling Roombas shuffled the stacks between stations to a worker, directed by a computer about what to pick or stow, where to place it or pull it from and where to move it.\n\nThe tour guide claimed that before the robots’ arrival, and in some facilities where the robots aren’t used, a worker with a pushcart used to go around pulling or stocking products.\n\nBack on the first floor, a single robotic arm was palletizing yellow totes of products. The tour guide claimed the facility had only one, had no plans to add more, and said it was only there to help human workers. The robot seemed to need human helpers as much as they needed it, unable to reach products that were too high in the tote, which were shuffled to the side for a human worker to fix and send back to them.\n\nNot so long ago, one of Amazon’s top robot executives (to be clear, he oversees robotics and is not himself a robot) was telling journalists they need not worry about robots taking people’s jobs.\n\nTye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, told the Guardian in 2022 he disagreed with the notion that artificial intelligence and robots wouold lead to the elimination of jobs at Amazon. “I just don’t see that at all,” said Brady. “We made our first serious investment in robotics over 10 years ago and in those 10 years we created more than a million jobs.”\n\nHe said: “The need for people to solve problems and use common sense will always be there. We are nowhere near that with robotics. It’s not even close. We have millions of years of evolution for the human brain that’s powered off 20 watts and a banana – that’s incredible.”\n\nNow the message from the top is very different. Last June, Andy Jassy, the Amazon chief executive, told white-collar workers at the company that the advancement of AI would eliminate jobs at the company over the next few years.\n\n“It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years we expect this will reduce our total corporate workforce,” Jassy said in a memo.\n\nIn October, the New York Times reported on internal documents at Amazon that were presented to the company’s board, which included plans by the company to replace more than 500,000 jobs at Amazon and avoid hiring 160,000 workers by 2027. The documents cited an ultimate goal to automate 75% of its operations.\n\nAmazon denied the report, claiming “the documents referenced paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans”.\n\nThe company laid off about 14,000 corporate employees the same month in anticipation of adopting more broadly artificial intelligence technology, and recently announced plans to lay off an additional 16,000 employees, though Amazon denied that AI and automation had any role in this round of cuts. An Amazon spokesperson added: “AI is not the reason behind the vast majority of these reductions.”\n\nAmazon is reportedly developing “humanoid” robots to pop out of delivery vans to deliver packages, eventually replacing the work of delivery drivers.\n\nIn November, more than 1,000 Amazon workers signed an open letter expressing concern that the company’s “all-costs-justified, warp-speed” approach to developing the technology puts jobs, democracy and the environment at risk.\n\nStaff are seeing the impact already. An Amazon picker and stower at a warehouse in northern Georgia, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told the Guardian that human resources at their Amazon site had gradually shifted from humans to artificial intelligence and computers.\n\n“We have had a big change at my warehouse in HR over the past six months. At first I noticed that the human resource personnel were just not available as much,” they said. “We now have a reduced staff for our HR, and we now have an automated texting service for us to use to contact HR.”\n\nThey also claimed Amazon pushes for cross-training and that workers in areas such as picking and stowing are learning other technical skills such as robot repair, in anticipation that their jobs may eventually be automated.\n\n“People are getting hurt stowing and picking, so that’s one of the reasons why Amazon is wanting to get robots that can do the work of the picker and the stower,” the worker said. “They’re letting us know that it’s smart for us to learn how to do something different, like robot repair work or something in it, because eventually this might be replaced.”\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said: “We’re preparing employees for the roles of the future because we believe investing in workers and our employees is more crucial than ever in this rapidly advancing technological age, especially with AI.”",

    "title": "AWS intruder achieved admin access in under 10 minutes thanks to AI assist",
    "description": "UPDATED: LLMs automated most phases of the attack",
    "fullText": "UPDATED A digital intruder broke into an AWS cloud environment and in just under 10 minutes went from initial access to administrative privileges, thanks to an AI speed assist.\n\nThe Sysdig Threat Research Team said they observed the break-in on November 28, and noted it stood out not only for its speed, but also for the \"multiple indicators\" suggesting the criminals used large language models to automate most phases of the attack, from reconnaissance and privilege escalation to lateral movement, malicious code writing, and LLMjacking - using a compromised cloud account to access cloud-hosted LLMs.\n\n\"The threat actor achieved administrative privileges in under 10 minutes, compromised 19 distinct AWS principals, and abused both Bedrock models and GPU compute resources,\" Sysdig's threat research director Michael Clark and researcher Alessandro Brucato said in a blog post about the cloud intrusion. \"The LLM-generated code with Serbian comments, hallucinated AWS account IDs, and non-existent GitHub repository references all point to AI-assisted offensive operations.\"\n\nThe attackers initially gained access by stealing valid test credentials from public Amazon S3 buckets. The credentials belonged to an identity and access management (IAM) user with multiple read and write permissions on AWS Lambda and restricted permissions on AWS Bedrock. Plus, the S3 bucket also contained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) data for AI models, which would come in handy later during the attack.\n\nTo prevent this type of credential theft, don't leave access keys in public buckets. Sysdig recommends using temporary credentials for IAM roles, and for organizations that insist on granting long-term credentials to IAM users, make sure you rotate them periodically.\n\nAfter unsuccessfully trying usernames such as \"sysadmin\" and \"netadmin\" typically associated with admin-level privileges, the attacker ultimately achieved privilege escalation through Lambda function code injection, abusing the compromised user's UpdateFunctionCode and UpdateFunctionConfiguration permissions:\n\nThey replaced the code of an existing Lambda function named EC2-init three times, iterating on their target user. The first attempt targeted adminGH, which, despite its name, lacked admin privileges. Subsequent attempts eventually succeeded in compromising the admin user frick.\n\nThe security sleuths note that the comments in the code are written in Serbian - likely indicating the intruder's origin - the code itself listed all IAM users and their access keys, created access keys for frick, and listed S3 buckets along with their content.\n\nPlus, the attacker's code contained \"comprehensive\" exception handling, according to the security sleuths, including logic to limit S3 bucket listings and an increase to the Lambda execution timeout from three seconds to 30 seconds.\n\nThese factors, combined with the short time from credential theft to Lambda execution, \"strongly suggest\" the code was written by an LLM, according to the threat hunters.\n\nNext, the miscreant set about collecting account IDs and attempting to assume OrganizationAccountAccessRole in all AWS environments. Interestingly, they included account IDs that did not belong to the victim organization: two with ascending and descending digits (123456789012 and 210987654321), and one ID that appeared to belong to a legitimate external account.\n\n\"This behavior is consistent with patterns often attributed to AI hallucinations, providing further potential evidence of LLM-assisted activity,\" Clark and Brucato wrote.\n\nIn total, the attacker gained access to 19 AWS identities, including six different IAM roles across 14 sessions, plus five other IAM users. And then, with the new admin user account they had created, the crims snarfed up a ton of sensitive data: secrets from Secrets Manager, SSM parameters from EC2 Systems Manager, CloudWatch logs, Lambda function source code, internal data from S3 buckets, and CloudTrail events.\n\nThey then turned to the LLMjacking part of the attack to gain access to the victim's cloud-hosted LLMs. For this, they abused the user's Amazon Bedrock access to invoke multiple models including Claude, DeepSeek, Llama, Amazon Nova Premier, Amazon Titan Image Generator, and Cohere Embed.\n\nSysdig notes that \"invoking Bedrock models that no one in the account uses is a red flag,\" and enterprises can create Service Control Policies (SCPs) to allow only certain models to be invoked.\n\nAfter Bedrock, the intruder focused on EC2, querying machine images suitable for deep learning applications. They also began using the victim's S3 bucket for storage, and one of the scripts stored therein looks like it was designed for ML training - but it uses a GitHub repository that doesn't exist, suggesting an LLM hallucinated the repo in generating the code.\n\nWhile the researchers say they can't determine the attacker's goal - possibly model training or reselling compute access - they note that the script launches a publicly accessible JupyterLab server on port 8888, providing a backdoor to the instance that doesn't require AWS credentials.\n\nHowever, they terminated the instance after five minutes for unknown reasons.\n\nThis is the latest in examples of attackers increasingly relying on AI to help them at almost every stage in the attack chain, and some security chiefs have warned that it's just a matter of time before criminals can fully automate attacks at scale.\n\nThere are things organizations can do to defend against similar intrusions and most involve hardening identity security and access management. First off: apply principles of least privilege to all IAM users and roles.\n\nSysdig also recommends restricting UpdateFunctionConfiguration and PassRole permission in Lambda, limiting UpdateFunctionCode permissions to specific functions and assigning them only to identities that need code deployment capabilities to do their jobs.\n\nAlso, make sure S3 buckets containing sensitive data, including RAG data and AI model artifacts, are not publicly accessible.\n\nAnd it's a good idea to enable model invocation logging for Amazon Bedrock to detect unauthorized usage.\n\nWe reached out to Amazon for comment, but they said they wouldn't be able to get us anything by publication time. We'll update this story with any relevant information we receive from them. ®\n\nto add the following comment sent by AWS.\n\n“AWS services and infrastructure are not affected by this issue, and they operated as designed throughout the incident described,\" the company told The Reg by email. \"The report describes an account compromised through misconfigured S3 buckets. We recommend all customers secure their cloud resources by following security, identity, and compliance best practices, including never opening up public access to S3 buckets or any storage service, least-privilege access, secure credential management, and enabling monitoring services like GuardDuty, to reduce risks of unauthorized activity.\"\n\nThe cloud giant also wants its customers who suspect or become aware of malicious activity within their AWS accounts to check out guidance for remediating potentially compromised credentials or contact AWS Support for assistance.\"",

That left some analysts uneasy about whether these huge investments will pay off.\n\n\"The strong long-term return on investing capital — I think that's the debate in the market today,\" Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at Evercore ISI, said during a conference call with Amazon executives following the results. \"So could you give us a little bit more insight into how you think investors will be able to see that?\"\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said new AI capacity is being monetized as quickly as it is deployed, calling it \"a very unusual opportunity,\" and argued that AI adoption is accelerating customers' shift to the cloud. He added that AWS' experience forecasting demand helps limit wasted capacity.\n\n\"This isn't some sort of quixotic top-line grab,\" Jassy said during the call. \"We have confidence that these investments will yield strong returns on invested capital.\"\n\nJassy's comments did little to calm investors. Amazon shares fell more than 10% in extended trading after the company detailed its outsized spending plans. A profit forecast also missed Wall Street expectations, adding to ROI concerns.\n\nBig Tech's AI infrastructure buildout has entered a new, breathtaking phase in recent days. On Wednesday, Google said it expects capex of $175 billion to $185 billion in 2026, well ahead of Wall Street estimates. Meta and Microsoft also raised capex.\n\nDuring Thursday's Amazon earnings call, other analysts pressed for assurances around returns on investment. JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth asked Jassy whether the company had \"financial guardrails\" in place for the spending plan.\n\nJassy said AI represents an \"extraordinarily unusual opportunity\" that could reshape the scale of AWS and Amazon. He said the company's in-house chips, Trainium and Graviton, are on track to generate more than $10 billion in revenue this year and added that its partnership with Anthropic has gone \"very well.\"\n\n\"We see this as an unusual opportunity, and we are going to invest aggressively here to be the leaders like we've been the last number of years,\" Jassy said.\n\nJassy described the AI market as \"barbelled,\" with heavy spending by leading AI labs on one end and productivity-focused enterprise uses on the other.\n\nHe said the middle — enterprise production workloads and new AI-native businesses — remains early but could become \"the largest and the most durable\" source of demand as costs fall and adoption broadens.\n\n\"The lion's share of that demand is still yet to come in the middle of that barbell, and that will come over time,\" he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "US stock futures moved lower early Monday as Amazon’s (AMZN) post-earnings slide weighed heavily on tech sentiment and investors braced for further wreckage after a bruising session on Wall Street.\n\nS&P 500 futures (ES=F) dropped 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) slid 0.3%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) fell 0.1%.\n\nThe overnight moves followed a sharp sell-off during Thursday’s regular session, led once again by technology stocks. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) have now slipped into negative territory for 2026.\n\nAnd after the bell, Amazon (AMZN) added to the gloom. Shares plunged over 10% in after-hours trading after the company posted earnings per share that missed Wall Street estimates and projected capital expenditures of $200 billion for the year, raising concerns about the extent of AI spend.\n\nThe risk-off tone extended beyond equities. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued sliding, touching levels not seen since 2024, while silver (SI=F) resumed its decline after a recent surge fueled by retail investor interest. Strategy (MSTR) revealed a loss for the quarter that was precipitated by bitcoin's sell-off, sending shares down.\n\nEarnings also drove Reddit (RDDT) upward after reporting a quarterly earnings beat, issuing upbeat guidance, and announcing a stock buyback program. Roblox (RBLX) shares also surged. Looking ahead, investors will focus on earnings from Toyota (TM) and Philip Morris (PM), due before Friday’s opening bell.\n\nMeanwhile, the closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, originally scheduled for Friday, has been pushed to Wednesday next week following the resolution of the federal government shutdown. But other data this week has shown fresh signs of trouble for the labor market, as job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020 and layoff announcements surged.",

    "description": "An active-duty enlisted member of the US military said their unit was \"pressured\" into seeing Amazon's \"Melania\" documentary about the first lady.",
    "fullText": "It was the story of the weekend: \"Melania,\" Amazon's documentary on first lady Melania Trump, beat expectations at the box office, becoming one of the best-performing documentaries in recent years with an opening weekend gross of $7 million across 1,778 screens. (Whether it makes back its $75 million investment is another story.)\n\nDespite dismal critic reviews, the numbers suggest audiences turned out for \"Melania\" to support the first lady. One advocacy group suggests the reality may be more complicated.\n\nMikey Weinstein, the president and founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, said the nonprofit received reports from eight bases around the world that U.S. military members were being \"pressured\" to see \"Melania.\"\n\n\"People are scared,\" said Weinstein, a former Air Force officer and attorney who said his group is made up of nearly 100,000 current and former members of the U.S. military and represents those who feel pressured or coerced into unconstitutional religious observances. \"They were pressured to see the movie.\"\n\n\"Your military superior, that's not your shift manager at Taco Bell or Starbucks. They have complete and total control over you.\"\n\nIn an email Weinstein shared with Business Insider, an active-duty enlisted member of the US military said they were writing on behalf of a dozen of their unit members and their families who felt \"pressured\" by their unit commander to see the movie. The MRFF did not disclose the name of the person who sent the email.\n\nIn the email, this person said their commander suggested the unit and their family members join him, his wife, and their children at a showing of \"Melania\" at an off-base movie theater.\n\nThe screening was designated as one of the commander's \"Unit Activity Events,\" morale-boosting activities that can range from flag football and barbecues to movie nights, the email said. The military member who sent the email said the unit is required to attend at least three of the four UAEs that are scheduled each month or face a penalty.\n\nAsked if any of the MRFF members who contacted him skipped the movie, Weinstein said: \"Every one of our clients who came to us either went to see it or suddenly got sick.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Department of Defense official told Business Insider, \"There is no Department of War directive requiring service members to see this film, though the film is fantastic.\"",

    "title": "Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq sell-off builds as tech rout continues, bitcoin plunges",
    "description": "Wall Street is looking to Amazon with high hopes after a rough week in tech, as silver plunges again and bitcoin drops near $65,000.",
    "fullText": "US stocks took sizable hits again on Thursday in a fruitless search for a reprieve from a building tech sell-off as investors awaited Amazon earnings, assessed Alphabet's big AI spending plans, and digested jobs data that signaled fresh weakness in the labor market.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved roughly 1.2% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost over 1.1%, or more than 500 points.\n\nThe market is in the midst of a full-on tech wipeout, as investors weigh whether some software stocks took too big a beating. The losses have been spurred by worries about AI disruption to established software players — a risk that had been overlooked by investors focused on the fallout from massive AI spending until recently.\n\nWall Street is still digesting the latest batch of corporate earnings, with Big Tech's AI build-out and demand in high focus. Alphabet (GOOG) shares slid, but pared losses, after the Google parent outlined a significant ramp-up in AI investment — to as high as $185 billion — in its quarterly results late Wednesday.\n\nThe countdown is now on to Amazon's (AMZN) report, set for release after Thursday's market close. Eyes are on the all-important AWS cloud unit, expected to deliver a 21% jump in sales.\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market flashed fresh signals of weakness: Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected, and job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020, while a new report found that last month marked the worst January for layoff announcements since 2009. The government's monthly jobs report is due next Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere, silver (SI=F) plunged as much as 17%, erasing all of its two-day recovery as Chinese buyers dumped holdings. Wall Street is debating whether the recent record rally in silver and gold (GC=F) ran too high, too fast — and if a further slump awaits.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) also plunged to its lowest level since 2024, wiping out all of the gains accumulated during President Trump's second term. The token broke below $63,000 — amid a crisis of confidence.\n\nYahoo Finance's Francisco Velasquez reports:\n\nSilver (SI=F) prices tumbled 14% on Thursday to hover above $75 per ounce, erasing gains from the past two days. Gold (GC=F) futures also slipped to $4,900 per ounce after both metals had risen for a second consecutive day following last Friday’s sell-off.\n\nAnalysts warned that silver’s short-term rebound remains volatile, though they remain bullish on bullion prices over the medium term, despite last week’s dramatic pullback that interrupted a blistering rally over the past year.\n\n\"The widening divergence between gold and silver performance reinforces a recurring theme: silver behaves less like a monetary metal during periods of stress and more like a high-beta hybrid, amplifying both optimism and fear,\" Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank's commodity strategy head, wrote on Thursday.\n\n\"History suggests that silver tends to stabilise only once realised volatility falls and speculative positioning is reset — conditions that are not yet fully in place,\" he added.\n\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports:\n\nMortgage rates barely budged this week: The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage edged higher to 6.11% from 6.10%, while the 15-year fixed averaged 5.50% ticked up to 5.5% from 5.49% last week.\n\nYahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick and Laura Grace Tarpley note that the 10-year Treasury note, a pricing indicator for 30-year fixed mortgage rates, has hovered above 4.2% since mid-January. However, the spread between Treasurys and mortgage rates has narrowed recently, and the 30-year has resisted a substantial move higher.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nCheck out frequently asked questions about mortgage rates and our mortgage calculator here.\n\nYahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi writes:\n\nCheck out the top takeaways from Sozzi and Schwab's conversation here.\n\nIt hasn't been a great day for jobs data, with the delayed JOLTS report serving as the final piece in a trifecta of negative news about layoffs, hiring, and unemployment claims.\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled below $64,000 on Thursday, its lowest level since October 2024.\n\nThe token is down nearly 50% from its all-time high last year, erasing all the gains made during President Trump's second term. Investors had been optimistic that the administration's crypto-friendly policies would lift digital-asset prices.\n\n\"Bitcoin remains in a larger bear-market structure,\" read a 10X Research note on Thursday. \"In the absence of a strong catalyst and with positioning still stretched, downside risks remain elevated.\"\n\nNotably, the firm points to a significant overhang — overexposed bitcoin ETF holders who are underwater, with an estimated average acquisition price near $90,000.\n\nA similar dynamic is playing out with ether (ETH), which tumbled 13% on Thursday. Investors holding Ethereum ETFs are down approximately 31% from their average cost basis, according to 10X Research data.\n\n\"Under these conditions, attracting incremental allocations from Wall Street investors becomes increasingly difficult, particularly when many existing holders likely regret not reducing exposure at significantly higher levels,\" the note said.\n\nAbsent a significant catalyst, the firm doesn't see a bottom to crypto's bear market until possibly the summer.\n\n\"As we have previously outlined, a cycle low around the FIFA World Cup this summer could mark a more compelling long-term buying opportunity,\" 10X Research analysts said.\n\nPeloton (PTON) shares fell more than 20% after the company reported its fiscal second quarter earnings and announced its CFO will be exiting.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports:\n\nHims & Hers (HIMS) shares soared as much as 9% as the company said it will begin selling compounded copies of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy pill. The pill from Hims & Hers would cost about $100 less than Novo's, Reuters reported.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY) both saw shares tumble about 7% on the news.\n\nSoftware stocks have been hammered in the past few days, accelerating a months-long decline as investors become more fearful of disruption risks posed by new artificial intelligence tools — particularly those from Anthropic.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai was asked about the market belief that software stocks are losing ground during a call with analysts following the Google parent's earnings report Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe CEO said: \"Look, at least from my vantage point, I definitely see we have very, very good SaaS (software as a service) customers who are leaders in their respective categories.\"\n\nThose customers include Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW), and Salesforce (CRM), per Bloomberg data.\n\nPichai continued: \"And what I see the successful companies doing is they are definitely incorporating Gemini deeply in critical workflows, be it on improving their product experience and driving growth or using it to drive efficiency within their organizations.\"\n\n\"[J]ust like it has been an enabling tool for us across our products and services.. I think the [software] companies who are seizing the moment, I think, have the same opportunity ahead.\"\n\nHis comments echo those of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this week.\n\nRead more about what's driving fears over AI eating into the competitive moats of SaaS leaders here.\n\nThe performance of Amazon's (AMZN) cloud business, AWS, will be keenly examined when its earnings report lands later, after Microsoft (MSFT) stock plunged last week, in part due to a slowdown in cloud growth.\n\nThis was not an issue for Amazon’s October earnings, as its shares jumped almost 10% following better than expected revenue from Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS. Now, however, fear is rippling through the tech sector, and Amazon investors are increasingly concerned that the slowdown at Microsoft’s Azure indicates broader weakness for cloud providers.\n\n“It isn’t clear how much of Microsoft’s disappointment might be due to company-specific issues and how much might reflect an overall slowing in the cloud space,” said David Miller, chief investment officer at Catalyst Funds, which holds Amazon shares in several portfolios. “If it’s the latter, that could carry over.”\n\n... Amazon’s results come against a backdrop of anti-software sentiment that’s weighing on the entire tech sector as investors try to sort the winners and losers from the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent to develop artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft’s aggressive AI-related capital expenditures, alongside the slowing Azure growth, invited new questions about when these investments will pay off more substantially.\n\n“It’s really about what’s already priced into the stock, and I think what was starting to price in for [Microsoft] was a higher growth rate, which is always a little dangerous,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “We haven’t really seen Amazon moving up in the same way.”\n\nAt the market open, US stocks plunged for a third day as a broad sell-off in tech names continued.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, sinking 1.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, fell 0.5%.\n\nUS weekly applications for unemployment benefits increased by more than expected last week, as snowstorms across much of the country may have led more people to file for assistance.\n\nJobless claims for the week ending Jan. 31 increased by 22,000 to 231,000 claims, exceeding economists' forecasts, the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n\nContinuing claims, a proxy for the total number of people receiving state unemployment benefits, increased to 1.84 million.\n\nDistortions from winter weather notwithstanding, the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits suggests the labor market remains broadly stable if not cooling gradually.\n\nThough in a sign of cracks appearing in the \"low hire, low fire\" trend that has characterized the labor market for over a year, layoffs jumped in January to their highest level for that month in 17 years, according to Challenger data (scroll down for more on this).\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports:\n\nJeff Bezos came, he saw, he conquered.\n\nMaybe not in the way you'd expect from a onetime financial savior of an iconic newspaper. There are now two Bezos eras at the Washington Post: The first started when he rescued it in 2013. The second began when he saw it gutted, blessing mass layoffs the company executed on Wednesday.\n\n... On social media and in news coverage in the aftermath, Post employees, the labor union, and alumni (myself included) strongly criticized the decision.\n\nOthers have pointed to more recent moves by Bezos.\n\nLeading up to the Post's deep cuts, several media observers highlighted Amazon's enormous budget to produce and market the new documentary \"Melania,\" about first lady Melania Trump.\n\nAmazon's extraordinary spending prompted questions about the movie working as a kind of bribe from Bezos to the White House. (Amazon says they licensed the movie because they think people will love it. The film's Rotten Tomatoes scores and box office numbers have inspired a news cycle of their own.)\n\nBut the splashy Melania rollout provided an ugly contrast to the austerity Bezos was serving down to the Post's newsroom. In the worst light, critics said Bezos was willing to burn money to please the president but was now unwilling to do so for journalism in the public interest.\n\nRead more here in the takeaway from today's Morning Brief.\n\nChinese EV maker Nio (NIO) sent its shareholders a profit alert on Thursday morning, letting them know that the company expects to post its first-ever profit in the fourth quarter.\n\nNio said it will see an adjusted profit from operations of 200 million Chinese yuan (approximately $29 million) to 700 million yuan (approximately $100 million).\n\nThe company attributed the profit to sustained sales growth, improved margins from its product mix, and ongoing cost-cutting measures.\n\nNio stock popped 6% in premarket trading.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, as tariff woes sent the beauty group's shares tumbling.\n\nStrategy (MSTR) stock fell over 5% during premarket hours on Thursday after bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell below 70,000. Strategy is one of the largest corporate holders of cryptocurrency.\n\nTapestry (TPR) stock rose 5% before the bell. Coach's parent company beat analysts' estimates on revenue and raised its full-year guidance.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) US-listed shares rose 5% before the bell on Thursday after announcing plans to issue its first dividend to shareholders, along with a three-year stock buyback program worth $5 billion.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled, falling $71,000 per token on Thursday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the leading cryptocurrency was paring deeper overnight losses in the wake of Bessent's comments, after entering the key mid-$70,000 support region.\n\nYahoo Finance's Ines Ferré and Grace O'Donnell report:\n\nSnap (SNAP) stock galloped higher after a strong holiday quarter for advertising lifted earnings above Wall Street's estimates.\n\nSnap stock rose 6% before the bell on Thursday.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, the video messaging app reported revenue of $1.71 billion and earnings per share of $0.03. That beat Wall Street estimates of $1.7 billion in revenue and a $0.03 loss per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) demonstrated resilience in the fourth quarter following a difficult 2025, with a strong earnings beat and guidance raise.\n\nThe affordable cosmetics manufacturer lifted its full-year 2026 sales outlook to a range of $1.6 billion to $1.61 billion from its previous range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion. The company also sees greater earnings per share of $3.05-$3.10, an increase from the previous range of $2.80-$2.85.\n\nThe stock soared by as much as 8% in premarket trading on Thursdayas the company looks to regain its footing after higher tariffs and other challenges led the stock to lose 40% in 2025. However, the stock pared some of those gains, perhaps due to lower gross margins amid ongoing tariff costs.\n\nLast year, the company also acquired Hailey Bieber's Rhode brand.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, e.l.f. reported better-than-expected earnings per share of $0.65 versus $0.55 expected by Wall Street analysts. Net sales jumped 38% to $489.5 million, topping estimates of $461 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\n\"Our value proposition, powerhouse innovation and disruptive marketing engine continue to fuel our brands,\" CEO Tarang Amin said in a statement. \"We remain confident in our ability to grow market share and deliver best-in-class growth in beauty, as reflected by our raised fiscal 2026 outlook.\"\n\nRead more about e.l.f.'s quarter from Reuters.\n\nArm Holdings shares fall as licensing sales miss estimates.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) stock rose 5% before the bell on Thursday following Alphabet's (GOOG) capital expenditure plans, which surpassed analysts' expectations.\n\nGoogle's parent company forecast 2026 capital expenditures of $180 billion, news that is a potential boon to Broadcom, which partners with Alphabet on custom chips.\n\n“That is an incredible number. We are laughing because that number is so good for the Google cohort,” Ben Reitzes, Melius Research head of technology research, told CNBC.\n\nGoogle is not the only company increasing its capex spend to build AI data centers: Oracle (ORCL) is doing the same and raised its forecast to around $50 billion.\n\nGoogle's AI software doesn't just use Nvidia (NVDA) chips, but it also uses its own tensor processing units (TPUs). For Gemini 3, Google used TPUs, which Broadcom helped to make.\n\nSilver (SI=F) fell sharply, wiping out a two-day recovery, as the white metal struggled to find a floor following a historic market rout. Gold (GC=F) also declined.\n\nSpot silver plunged as much as 17% on Thursday, having flickered briefly above $90 an ounce in early Asian trading. After a record-breaking rally that appeared to run too far, too fast, the metal has retreated by more than a third from an all-time high hit on Jan. 29.\n\n“Sentiment seems to have turned soggy across most asset classes, including regional equities and metals,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. This has created “a feedback loop amid thin market liquidity,” he said.\n\nThe sudden and sharp decline in precious metals also weighed on sentiment in base metals markets, with copper falling more than 1% to slip below $13,000 a ton. Meanwhile, spot gold dropped as much as 3.5% in choppy trading.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) stock fell around 11% in premarket trading on Thursday after the chip designer's results beat on the top and bottom lines but its forecast was lighter than expected. A memory chip shortage stemming from data center developers scooping up chips and chipmakers shifting production to cater to AI demand added pressure to the company's outlook.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, the company said revenue increased 5% year over year to $12.3 billion, while earnings per share rose to $2.78. Qualcomm beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines, with consensus estimates forecasting $12.1 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $2.75, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nHowever, the outlook for the fiscal second quarter dimmed as a supply crunch in memory chips weighs on margins and the smartphone market.\n\nSecond quarter revenue is expected in the range of $10.2 billion to $11 billion (analysts were looking for $11 billion at the midpoint). Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 (the Street was hoping for $2.87).\n\n\"While our near-term handsets outlook is impacted by industry-wide memory supply constraints, we are encouraged by end-consumer demand for premium and high tier smartphones, and remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2029 revenue goals,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in the earnings release.",

    "description": "Companies such as Amazon and UPS have said they're trimming staff this year, contributing to the highest level of January layoffs in 17 years.",
    "fullText": "This January was marked by more layoffs than any January since 2009.\n\nData from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement company, shows that US employers announced 108,435 job cuts in the first month of the year, an increase of 118% from the year before.\n\nMajor companies have said they're trimming staff this year. In January, Amazon announced it would cut 16,000 corporate roles, after cutting 14,000 jobs in October last year.\n\nThe 30,000 layoffs announced by UPS in January helped make transportation the sector with the most job cuts, the Challenger report said.\n\nElsewhere, Citi said in January it plans to cut around 10% of its workforce, or 20,000 employees.\n\nChallenger said on Thursday that hiring also stalled in January, with employers announcing 5,306 new hiring plans — the weakest start to the year since it began tracking this data in 2009.\n\n\"Generally, we see a high number of job cuts in the first quarter, but this is a high total for January,\" Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement accompanying the report.\n\n\"It means most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026,\" he added.\n\nThe key reasons for the job cuts, per Challenger, were \"contract loss,\" \"market and economic conditions,\" and \"restructuring.\" AI was cited as the key reason for around 7% of the cuts.\n\n\"It's difficult to say how big an impact AI is having on layoffs specifically,\" Challenger said. \"We know leaders are talking about AI, many companies want to implement it in operations, and the market appears to be rewarding companies that mention it.\"\n\nFebruary 5, 2026 — This story has been updated to reflect that the layoffs are higher than they have been in any January since 2009, not a 17-year high.",

This was not an issue for Amazon’s October earnings, as its shares jumped almost 10% following better than expected revenue from Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS. Now, however, fear is rippling through the tech sector, and Amazon investors are increasingly concerned that the slowdown at Microsoft’s Azure indicates broader weakness for cloud providers. Microsoft shares are down 14% since the report on Jan. 28, erasing more than $500 billion in market value.",

    "description": "The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is laying off staffers as it looks to cut costs and refocus its coverage.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is conducting widespread layoffs.\n\nExecutive editor Matt Murray wrote in a Wednesday memo that the \"substantial newsroom reductions\" would impact \"nearly all news departments.\"\n\nThe layoffs impacted hundreds of workers, according to a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the newsroom's union.\n\nMurray told staff on a Wednesday morning call that the cuts were part of a strategic reset, according to an audio recording obtained by Business Insider.\n\nMurray said the changes included \"closing the sports department in its current form.\"\n\n\"We plan to retain several reporters to join features and cover sports as a cultural and societal phenomenon, as well as several folks to staff the print sports section,\" he added.\n\nMurray said impacted teams included audio and journalists who cover books, the DC metro area, and foreign affairs.\n\n\"A few products will be discontinued — among the most significant, we will be closing the book section and will be suspending the Post Reports podcast,\" Murray said.\n\nThe publication's San Francisco bureau was also heavily hit, one Post insider said.\n\nIn his memo, Murray wrote that for the immediate future, the paper would concentrate on \"areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact and that resonate with readers.\"\n\n\"These layoffs are not inevitable,\" the Washington Post Guild wrote in a statement posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday. \"A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach, and its future.\"\n\nFormer executive editor Martin Baron wrote in a LinkedIn post that \"there were acute business problems that had to be addressed\" during \"a period of head-spinning change in media consumption.\" Baron added that the \"Post's challenges, however, were made infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.\"\n\nDonald Graham, the Post's former publisher, wrote in a Facebook post that he was saddened by the loss of \"so many excellent reporters and editors\" and that he would \"have to learn a new way to read the paper,\" as he had \"started with the sports page since the late 1940's.\"\n\n\"The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,\" a Post spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. \"These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nThis new round of layoffs follows a series of recent shake-ups at the 148-year-old newspaper.\n\nEarly last year, the company told its opinions desk that columnists should refocus their coverage to two pillars: \"personal liberties\" and \"free markets.\"\n\nIn March, the Post reorganized its newsroom in a push to shift away from \"commodity news.\" It then offered buy-outs to staffers in May.\n\nLast year's personnel shifts arrived shortly after the Washington Post came under fire from some readers for its decision to skip endorsing a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, breaking from a 35-year tradition. Some critics argued that the decision could have been made to curry favor with Donald Trump.\n\nOver 400 staffers sent a letter to Bezos last January, writing that they were \"deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave.\"\n\nThe Post's staff reductions arrive at a challenging moment for the media industry.\n\nSome brands are seeing revenue fall off due to declines in social media and search traffic. The rise of AI is also squeezing the industry as more readers gather information from chatbots rather than visiting web pages.\n\nThe New York Times, long seen as the 800-pound gorilla in the newspaper business, saw its shares sink about 14% on Monday as investors fretted about increased costs.",

    "fullText": "The most popular mom content tends to be rightwing tradwife propaganda or not political at all – pushing progressive creators out of the algorithm\n\nFor someone who doesn’t have a marble island in their kitchen I spend a disproportionate amount of time staring at marble kitchen islands, slack-jawed, brain turned half off. That’s because I consume a lot of videos from mommy bloggers, mom influencers, and the like. In kitchen “closing shift” videos, they wipe down their islands and reset by lighting luxury candles, the glow accentuating their respectable cosmetic procedures. Other times I watch them waltz through their morning routines: getting kids out the door, sweating it out in boutique fitness classes, showing off Amazon hauls, or explaining their children’s matching holiday photoshoot outfits.\n\nFor better or worse, this is how I have chosen to spend my one wild and precious life: consuming blissfully low-stakes motherhood content on my phone. It is domestically competent ASMR that also satiates my desire to peek into everyone’s bathroom cabinets. I nod in unsolicited approval as a TikTok mom I follow shares her green juice order. Fascinating. I should drink something like that. Another posts timestamps of her baby’s night-time sleep schedule. I, who lives between walls that have never heard the wail of an infant, ingurgitate the entire video.\n\nBut occasionally, when my cerebrum is not completely smoothed over by a beautiful woman beckoning me to “get ready” with her, an anxiety starts to creep in. What, I wonder, are this woman’s politics? Has she ever given us a hint? Is she registered to vote? Is there any chance she, like me, is outraged by ICE raids, book bans, our government’s comparatively dismal maternal support system or slippery slide into fascism? Does she know there are midterms this year? Mama, blink twice!\n\nIn my ideal algorithm, I would get served posts to assuage my doubts. I would watch nursery hauls of a mother whose progressiveness I did not doubt. I would know that she dreads the realities of the climate crisis. I would listen to a parent describe her weekly meal prep for a family of four and not wonder if she was politically aligned with the men in government stripping food safety regulations. Maybe tips on how to get your daily steps in with a newborn would include showing up at protests or delivering mutual aid groceries. Because in real life, I was raised by and hope to be a mother who is both fluent in the chaotic and comforting mundanity of domesticity and enraged by the systems that diminish and destroy families and livelihoods. I just don’t see that much of it in my online spheres.\n\nInstead, the most popular motherhood and lifestyle content lands somewhere on the short spectrum between conservative tradwife propaganda and extraordinarily apolitical, considering the paralyzing polycrisis we find ourselves in. I’m increasingly suspicious: was that sourdough starter “how to” video actually funded by the Church of Latter-day Saints? Hannah Neeleman AKA Ballerina Farm, one of the most-followed motherhood lifestyle content creators across platforms, has not ever explicitly divulged her political views – but do followers know she graced the cover of Evie magazine, described by one of its founders as “conservative Cosmo”?\n\n“The right in the United States has really won the family,” said content creator Kate Glavan. This past summer, Glavan posted a TikTok saying she would “happily watch ‘stay-at-home mom’ content if it emphasized the reality of being a mom in America”. More than 1,200 commenters chimed in on her video, captioned “We need leftist mommy blogger content”, in agreement. Some politely promoted their own accounts, or offered reasons they felt leftist mommy blogger content doesn’t lend itself to virality. “Leftist moms are often working,” one commenter wrote. “Every time I even HINT at my true political beliefs on here I get absolutely destroyed in my comments section,” wrote another. A number of people also expressed their unwillingness to put their children on camera due to privacy concerns and big-tech mistrust, which undoubtedly does not please the algorithmic gods.\n\nI asked Glavan, who does not have children of her own, what led her to make the video. “I don’t see enough examples of how I could do [motherhood] as someone who is left of center and advocates for certain politics,” she said. She believes that “being a mom is so political”, with the realities of motherhood in the US overwhelming even the twentysomething child-free influencer. “You are navigating through the healthcare system, you are probably not getting paid leave. You’re probably not getting any sort of benefits, the cost of diapers …” she lamented before trailing off.\n\nGlavan is pretty much right about, well, the right. The Venn diagram of anti-feminist Trump administration officials and hangers-on, and pronatalist enthusiasts – a movement concerned with women having more babies – has a worryingly chunky midsection. In an NBC poll from this past summer, women aged 18-29 who voted for Donald Trump in 2024 prioritized “having children” as a six out of 13 in their definition of personal success. Women of the same age who voted for Kamala Harris ranked it 12 of 13, prioritizing instead certain financial goals, community building and emotional stability.\n\nThe left’s skepticism or outright rejection of the traditional nuclear family – you know, white picket fence, two-and-a-half kids, general suburban phantasma – is not unique to this presidency. Throughout history, women’s domesticity has been held in tension against their autonomy. Marxist feminists in the 1970s demanded “family abolition”, arguing that the bourgeois family structure upholds the patriarchy and exploits wives as “instruments of production”. Around the same time, the grassroots campaigns Wages For Housework and Black Women for Wages for Housework aimed to raise the visibility of the economic contribution of women’s domestic labor, the latter movement asserting that welfare is a wage, not a charity.\n\nNo need to dive into complex social theory though, just visit any gift shop and pick up a magnet, greetings card or wine glass satirizing the lobotomized housewife and you will get the gist. But with motherhood content sitting at the crux of domestic life, gender politics, and consumerism (many creators aim to monetize views via sponsorships and paid product placement), it simply is not an ideal breeding ground for left-leaning thought leaders. (Though, could one argue that current-day monetization of the performance of labor in momfluencing is an extension of these mid-century feminist crusades? Perhaps!)\n\nMust I reckon with the reality that good politics and pilates arms routines might be at odds with one another? Motherhood content can and is often aesthetically aspirational, but can it also be ideologically so?\n\nIf you buck the algorithm and go searching, you will find creators whose identities fall outside the cookie cutter content farms both in makeup – queer moms, solo moms by choice, blended families – and substance. Moms who focus on gender-imbalanced workloads, like She Is A Paige Turner, or how special needs parenting is impacted by politics, like Eres_rara, or the dissonance of parenting at a time when ICE is separating children from their families and communities, like Bri motherhood. YouTuber Tiffany Ferg has a vlog titled: Why Motherhood Should Radicalize You. It’s all informative, it’s engaging, and it doesn’t quite scratch the itch because it can feel more like a lecture (albeit one I fully endorse) than the habitual mom content I tend to seek out.\n\nEarly attempts to ideologically curate my feeds and rid them of conservative-coded creators also led me to following mothers who romanticize their humble, though devotedly aesthetic, homes and natural fiber-forward lifestyles in back-to-the-earth settings like Mendocino or mid-coast Maine. But I was hoodwinked by their Democratic zip codes and unkempt curtain bangs. Handsome walnut cutting boards might have replaced antiseptic marble islands, but I was also increasingly watching haul videos not of Costco-sized tubs of Tylenol but raw milk to treat preventable illness. What did I expect? It’s Maha-mania out there, and mom influencers are all in.\n\nAround the time I watched Glavan’s video, I also watched a TikTok in which fashion and trend analyst Mandy Lee felt the need to clarify to her followers that her preconception health journey, which she chose to discuss online, was not going to lead her down the Maha or “alt-right” pipeline. Later she clarified she planned to rely on “real science, not Facebook science” in her fertility journey. She did not want to risk that wanting “a child and to have a family would make people assume that [she is] conservative”, which “could not be further from the truth”.\n\nHer disclaimers reminded me of another motherhood movement turned toxic: the forum Mumsnet, which provided moms in the UK with community and support but quickly veered into anti-trans rhetoric and Terfiness.\n\nLast year, motherhood and lifestyle content creator Lisa Miller started incorporating her political beliefs into her videos, after making the move with her family of five from eastern Tennessee to Brooklyn. “With the climate of politics now and having this major platform that I do – really it’s not a major platform compared to some creators, but to me, it is – it’s so important for me to speak out on things that I’m passionate about and that matter,” she said. That wasn’t always the case. Miller was raised by a Mexican American mom with left-leaning views in Detroit before being put in foster care in conservative parts of Virginia. “I just learned very early on to keep my opinions to myself and I didn’t want conflict.”\n\nBut the idea of conflict became less daunting as she witnessed a handful of parenthood creators, such as New York dad Jose Rolon (whose bio pitches his content as “relatable parenting to all families”), seamlessly incorporate politics into their platforms. Between family vacation vlogs and his recaps of his kids’ sports games are videos endorsing Zohran Mamdani and calling on fellow Latino creators to speak up about ICE raids.\n\nNow Miller posts videos that begin with her saying: “Get ready with me to lose a bunch of followers,” in which she discusses her thoughts on gun violence, ICE raids and raising a child on the autism spectrum in RFK Jr’s America as she does her multistep makeup routine and fixes up her hair. I find the series to be an ingenious blend of comforting daily ritual – like your typical momfluencer video – and straightforward political candor. The itch – it’s scratched!\n\nMiller’s defiant stance is common among the minority of mom creators who are vocally left-leaning – an acknowledgment of the apolitical or conservative mommy content they’re competing against. Many will use meme formats to clarify that they are not a tradwife SAHM (stay at home mom) but a “household who believes in science and equal rights”-type SAHM. (Bread and crosses emojis indicate the former, microscopes and rainbow flags the latter.) I’ve also seen a number of videos along the lines of this one, which reads: “POV you’re a progressive mom trying to figure out someone’s [presumably a new mom friend’s] vibe.” (Another way to check a TikTok creator’s politics is to peek at who they’re digitally endorsing in the “reposts” tab.) I have scrolled past many that share a sentiment along the lines of “I might not get invited back to book club, but at least they know where I stand on Palestine.” Since federal agents shot and killed VA nurse Alex Pretti and mom of three, Renee Nicole Good, and detained five-year-old Liam Ramos in Minneapolis, my feed has seen an uptick in videos of moms, some self-proclaimed “wine moms”, posting about how they are engaging with their children or shielding them from the enormity of these indignities.\n\nIt’s corny, but there is some pride that comes with being a conscious content consumer. “When you find out that someone is not a Trump supporter, you’re like, ‘OK, now I trust you, and I want to support your paid brand deals and comment on them and say, get your bag,’” Glavan said. It goes two ways. For Miller, being clear where she stands politically has helped a new and appreciative audience find her. “I found it so freeing and really healing to find like-minded people,” she said. “It certainly was empowering to connect with a community that believes in things like human rights and equality and women’s rights and Black Lives Matter.”\n\nMiller, who has worked with a number of lifestyle brands popular among moms, hasn’t seen a dip in deals with them since sharing her political views. “I’m not using my platform in a negative way and I think that would be different if I were, you know, being negative or being ugly or being hateful,” she said.\n\nI know that watching “day in my life” routines, hoping they will reflect on ways to look out for your neighbors or speak out against the current administration, is sort of like hoping the NFL might pause the Super Bowl to meaningfully address violence against women. But occasionally, you stumble upon something close. And though it might not be aspirational the way a perfectly sliced toddler snack plate is, it is aspirational in the sense it showcases my reality: not only do motherhood and left-leaning outrage coexist, the former often informs the latter.\n\nTo loosely and lazily (my favorite way to scroll) bastardize Marxist theory, there might not be any ethical consumption under motherhood content, but there are certainly some creators I’m hoping “get their bag”.",

    "description": "After 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard, Andrew Miller landed a corporate role at Amazon — but with 6 kids, it didn't leave him enough time to be a dad.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew Miller, 50, in Mount Vernon, Washington, the owner of Tulip Valley Farms. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI remember the moment I looked around my office and saw only performative culture staring back at me.\n\nBetween 70-hour workweeks that started at 4 a.m. and growing disagreements with how the company was being run, I knew something had to give.\n\nIt wasn't hard work that scared me. Before corporate life, I spent 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard.\n\nBut as my family grew, I started questioning the path I was on. I'd never been deployed, but I knew it was likely. With two autistic children at home, my family needed me present. After leaving the military, I landed a corporate role at Amazon.\n\nIt went well for a while, but I was rarely seeing my family, and it wasn't the life I'd envisioned. I realized that while some people live for their role, my most important job was being a dad — I have six kids.\n\nSo, in 2015, I quit my job at Amazon. My wife, Holly, supported my decision, knowing that I was completely drained and losing my sense of purpose.\n\nWe also decided it was time to move back to Washington, where we both grew up.\n\nSkagit County is a place where your kids can run down the trail to a relative's house if they don't like what you're serving for dinner.\n\nIt's also home to an annual tulip festival that's been held for over 40 years.\n\nI took a strategy role with the county's economic development team, working on growth and equity.\n\nSkagit sits at the intersection of outdoor recreation, tourism, and agriculture — yet while the county once had about 4,000 acres of tulips, that number had dropped to roughly 500. I knew we needed a new model, or this county wouldn't be the home of tulips anymore.\n\nI came up with an idea and went for it. I decided to buy a tulip farm and reimagine what it could be — not just a working farm, but a place people wanted to hang out.\n\nIn 2018, I bought my first farm. In the months leading up to the purchase, I quickly learned that many agricultural problems are really business problems.\n\nThe questions weren't just about growing tulips; they were about the experience: How many tulips could we grow? What kind of customer experience could we create? And how should we design the layout of the fields for tourists?\n\nTo prepare, I raised capital with friends and spent six weeks shadowing an 85-year-old Dutch farmer who had been growing tulips since 1984. He and his wife told me they had turned down 16 other buyers before choosing me. He died shortly afterward, and after his death, I moved forward with taking over the farm.\n\nMy former business partner and I bought the 30-acre property for $1.6 million, including both the land and the business.\n\nIn those first months of farm life, my approach was pure curiosity.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, just 10 days before opening.\n\nWe pivoted to flower shipping, and eventually added you-pick experiences once restrictions eased. From what I could see, no one in Skagit County was doing that.\n\nI've learned that I tend to learn things the hard way. My daughter even bought me a pen that reads: \"Maybe I like doing it the hard way.\"\n\nThe fresh approach worked, but my business partnership didn't. After differences in vision, we split, and I went on to buy a second farm: Tulip Valley Farm, which I still run today. I bought it from a 70-year-old potato farmer with hazelnut trees.\n\nToday, my 23-year-old son can operate a forklift, which he learned when he was 15. My sister runs business management and communications.\n\nI still work from 5 a.m. until bedtime, but now I'm home. I'm serving my community.\n\nI'll walk into Costco, and my kids will scatter when someone recognizes me from the farm. My family is happy to know we can take three weeks off in the summer because of how hard we work the rest of the year.\n\nThey've seen the strain, the kitchen-table meetings, the risk of starting from scratch. I want them to see that.\n\nHealing in the soil — for us, and for guests\n\nToday, the farm is flourishing. Visitor numbers have doubled year over year for the past three years. We design the fields not just for farming, but for connection — proposals, photos, moments people want to share.\n\nIn a world where we are gagging for meaningful in-person experiences, people are drawn to farms. I get it. As someone with PTSD from my former career, I can also affirm that dirt therapy is the best therapy.\n\nBeing able to shape your own environment and build your own future is essential.",

XAI was last valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe merger comes as the space company plans a blockbuster public offering this year that could value it at over $1.5 trillion, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSpaceX, xAI and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe deal further consolidates Musk's far-flung business empire and fortunes into a tighter, mutually reinforcing ecosystem – what some investors and analysts informally call the \"Muskonomy\" – which already includes Tesla, ⁠brain-chip maker Neuralink and tunnel firm the Boring Company.\n\nThe world's richest man ​has a history of merging his ventures together. Musk folded social media ​platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla's stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.\n\nThe ‍agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and ⁠investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk's overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.",

    "description": "Hollywood has been waiting to see if a big YouTuber could bring their fans to theaters. It just happened.",
    "fullText": "Did you hear about the movie that surprised just about everyone at the box office this weekend?\n\nNope, not \"Melania\" — though the sort-of-documentary about the first lady did do better than industry folks had projected, bringing in $7 million in its first weekend.\n\nThe real hit of the weekend was made by someone you probably haven't heard of, unless you are a very specific kind of online person: \"Iron Lung,\" a horror/sci-fi movie, written, directed by, and starring Mark Fischbach, known to his fans as Markiplier on YouTube, where he has 38.2 million subscribers.\n\n\"Iron Lung\" brought in $22 million worldwide, with almost all of that coming from the US over the past few days. Which means Fischbach, who self-financed the movie and says he spent \"a few million dollars\" on it, has probably already turned a profit on the project. (Amazon, meanwhile, has spent a reported $75 million to make and promote \"Melania\", and will be very hard pressed to make that money back — not that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos likely cares about that.)\n\nAnd that means Fischbach has done what the entertainment industry has been waiting a very, very long time to see: He's turned a big online audience into movie ticket sales.\n\nAgain, for comparison: \"Melania\" got a huge promotional rollout from Amazon, aided by the likes of Fox News, which brought Melania Trump on air for multiple interviews, and the president of the United States himself, who pushed the film on his social media accounts. That effort helped generate an estimated 600,000 ticket sales.\n\nFischbach, meanwhile, just used his YouTube presence to push the movie and asked fans to call and email theater owners to convince them to show it. That eventually got the movie onto about 4,000 screens worldwide and led to an estimated 1.9 million in ticket sales.\n\nOf course, you could also argue that these movies are more alike than similar: Critics thought \"Melania\" was awful, and the few people who reviewed \"Iron Lung\" aren't in love with it either.\n\nAlso: Neither movie was made for cineastes, but for fans who wanted to show up to signal their allegiance to the creator/subject. For \"Melania,\" that meant an audience that looked a lot like grandmothers (70% of the audience was female, and 72% was 55 or older, per The Ankler), and for \"Iron Lung\", that meant an audience that could have been their grandsons (61% male, 62% 25 and under).\n\nThe other big difference is that we're unlikely to see many more Big Media companies make a movie designed (just about) explicitly to flatter the president of the United States and his wife.\n\nBut many people are interested in transforming YouTube success into other platforms. It just hasn't happened much. Prior to this weekend, we've only seen that happen with Mr. Beast and his Amazon show. Next question: Can anyone else make the leap?",

We're well positioned now to quickly release new features and go after big business opportunities, all while cutting our AWS hosting costs.\"\n\n\"@nitric_io's local development experience has been a game-changer for our team. Previously, working with SAM locally was cumbersome and inefficient. The time-consuming and costly process of debugging in the cloud had us constantly searching for a better solution. Nitric allowed us to build, test, and debug our app offline with ease, enabling us to deploy to the cloud only when we were confident in its readiness. This streamlined approach has significantly enhanced our productivity.\"\n\n\"It was a pleasure contributing to @nitric_io 🙌\"\n\n\"Working with the @nitric_io framework is fun and productive; API creation is seamless, and the overall developer experience is enjoyable. Our team has achieved much easier infrastructure management with Nitric, and our build and deploy times are magnitudes faster. As a result, we can create and release features in half the time, and we'll save even more time on future features that would have required a lot of DevOps work without Nitric.\"\n\n\"@nitric_io is a game changer. I can use it to deliver working API endpoints on day 1, and that's awesome for building trust with a client. Plus, because Nitric is cloud-agnostic, I can de-risk my choices and stay focused on moving fast. This is the best developer experience I've ever seen.\"\n\n\"Awesome cloud/app building experience, a game changer.\"\n\n\"As I've worked on passion projects and experimented with new technology, @nitric_io has been a great framework to help me build and deploy apps without having to be an expert in any particular cloud provider. By leaning on Nitric's abstraction, I can stay focused on domain logic and get a working project to market much faster. Nitric also makes it so I can defer my cloud vendor choice and have a low-cost, low-risk method for switching vendors at any point. For teams, Nitric makes it easy to fit into infrastructure guardrails established by previous projects and eliminates a lot of rework and glue code.\"\n\n\"A big shoutout to the @nitric_io team (@JyeCusch, @stevedemchuk, @timjholm, @raksiv_, and @davemooreuws) for the amazing tool and for the phenomenal support they provided for launching #Python v1 and for addressing the GitHub Issues 💯🙌✅\"\n\nship faster with next generation infrastructure automation using nitric.",

    "fullText": "The major indexes ended Friday in the red — but the week little-changed — as investors digested a tech sell-off, wild trading in silver and gold, and the long-awaited news that President Trump will nominate financial markets stalwart Kevin Warsh to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe tech-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way down on Friday with a loss of roughly 1% after a steep tech sell-off on Thursday. The index ended the week down roughly 0.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost around 0.4% on Friday but still finished the week up a cumulative 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed roughly 0.4% in the week's final session, logging a weekly decline of roughly the same magnitude.\n\nWarsh's nomination early Friday capped off months of market speculation, and the 55-year-old former Fed governor is widely seen as a conservative choice by the president. In response to Warsh's nomination, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) picked up about 0.8% on Friday.\n\nElsewhere in the market, gold (GC=F) sold off by more than 9% on Friday in a turnaround for precious metals. Friday's drop also saw silver (SI=F) and platinum (PL=F) lose more than 28% and 19%, respectively.\n\nOil prices (BZ=F, CL=F) rose roughly 7% over the past five days on tensions around potential US military action in Iran and possible disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nSome of the week's biggest stock market swings came from the biggest names in tech.\n\nWhile both Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) announced even higher spending targets in their fourth quarter earnings reports, Meta ended the week up 8.8%, while Microsoft went the other way, sliding to a loss of 7.6% on the week. The software sector also faced heavy selling pressure through the week after results from industry giant SAP (SAP), as well as other names like ServiceNow (NOW), failed to calm investor fears that software companies are quickly losing ground to AI.\n\nIn the week ahead, investors' attention will be focused on Friday's jobs report. Economists expect the US economy added 65,000 jobs last month, with the unemployment rate set to hold at 4.4%.\n\nReadings on the manufacturing and services sector, as well as consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, will also feature.\n\nIn the corporate world, another busy week of earnings awaits investors as two more \"Magnificent Seven\" companies — Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) — report earnings, alongside other tech heavyweights including Palantir (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).",

    "description": "Amazon's week included a White House screening of the \"Melania\" documentary and another massive round of layoffs.",
    "fullText": "It was a turbulent week for Amazon.\n\nFrom a bungled email prematurely announcing another massive round of layoffs to scrutiny around the company's $75 million investment in a documentary about the first lady, Amazon heads into its quarterly earnings report next week surrounded by a deafening level of outside noise.\n\nOn Saturday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and a top entertainment exec from the company joined a group of CEOs, politicians and celebrities at the White House for a private screening of \"Melania,\" which was produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Melania Trump.\n\nThe event was roundly criticized for appearing tone deaf as it occurred mere hours after federal immigration agents shot and killed urgent care nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, the second such deadly incident there in less than three weeks.\n\nWhile most of the biggest names in tech stayed mum on the matter, many people in the industry expressed outrage over the incidents, and urged other members of the tech community to publicly denounce the killing of Pretti and the prior shooting of Renee Good, as well as President Donald Trump's immigration policies.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who attended the screening, subsequently issued a statement calling for a \"deescalation\" after the recent violence but without mentioning the two fatal shootings. Amazon hasn't commented on the matter.\n\nAmazon's ties to the Melania film, which officially hit theatres on Friday, was awkward enough given the political tensions building in Minneapolis and elsewhere. The price tag has raised further questions about Amazon's agenda and whether the company is trying to curry favor with the president.\n\n\"I'm not involved in that. That was done with my wife,\" President Trump told reporters on Thursday at a premier for the movie in Washington, D.C.. \"I think it's a very important movie. I think it's really going to be very important. It shows life in the White House. It's a big deal, actually.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon MGM said in an email, \"We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.\"\n\nEarly ticket sales for the documentary have been weak, and the film is projected to bring in about $5 million during its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada, Puck News reported, citing National Research Group forecasting data.\n\nMaking the timing even worse for Amazon, which has also agreed to stream a three-part docuseries through Prime Video, the company on Wednesday initiated another round of mass layoffs impacting about 16,000 corporate workers. The company let go of 14,000 employees last October.\n\nThe announcement was preempted a day early by an inadvertent email sent to cloud employees, which alluded to \"organizational changes,\" and a post from Amazon's human resources boss Beth Galetti.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a broader effort by Jassy to cut costs and \"remove bureaucracy\" at the company, while it pushes to invest heavily in artificial intelligence. Some employees previously told CNBC that the cost cuts and rolling layoffs have damaged morale.\n\nIn a Reddit forum for Amazon employees, some users questioned the rationale of the company's money-saving efforts alongside its investment in \"Melania.\"\n\n\"With $75 million we could have given each laid off employee about $4,500,\" wrote one user. \"But instead we spent it on the ridiculous Melania movie. Ashamed to work at Amazon.\"\n\nAnalysts at Citizens said this week that they expect Amazon's 30,000 job cuts to generate up to $8 billion of cost savings in 2026.\n\nIn a segment for \"The Daily Show\" that aired Thursday, host Desi Lydic called it a \"cash grab,\" and criticized Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and former CEO.\n\n\"Why would Jeff Bezos, a billionaire who has tons of business with the government, run by a famously corrupt president known for loving bribes, overpay for a Melania documentary?,\" Lydic said. \"Hmm, let me think.\"\n\nAnd filmmaker Julie Cohen, who previously worked with Amazon on documentaries, told The New York Times that the Melania price tag was abnormal and suggests the company \"is buying something else for their money.\"\n\nAfter he was repeatedly attacked by Trump in his first term, Bezos has cozied up to the president this time around. He's dined with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence, and he attended the inauguration a year ago. Amazon, meanwhile, donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund and helped pay for Trump's $300 million ballroom renovation.\n\nThere was even more drama in the broader Bezos universe this week after multiple outlets reported that the Washington Post, which Bezos has owned since 2013, is preparing broad layoffs across the newsroom, with the sports, local and international sections expected to be impacted.\n\nThe newspaper's White House team wrote a letter to Bezos, describing the importance of the work of those teams and telling their boss that they need \"collaboration with all corners of the newsroom.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results, wrapping up earnings season for the tech giants (though Nvidia reports later in the month).\n\nAmazon is expected to report revenue growth of about 13% to $211.3 billion, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG. The expansion is being driven by Amazon Web Services and digital advertising, which are both projected to show growth of around 22%, based on data from FactSet.\n\nAnalysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets upped their price target on the stock this week and kept their buy recommendation, in part due to an acceleration at AWS, boosted by a recent deal with OpenAI. Amazon is now in talks to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI, CNBC confirmed this week.\n\nAs Amazon races to keep pace with rivals in AI, the company is boosting spending on data centers. In the earnings report, capital expenditures are likely to show an increase of 24% from a year earlier to almost $34.5 billion, according to LSEG.\n\nThe KeyBanc analysts said that while those rising costs will weigh on profitability, \"we believe Amazon will continue looking across the organization for further efficiencies to minimize the potential margin impact.\"\n\nWATCH: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on the 'unprecedented' demand for AI compute",

    "description": "Small businesses struggled to observe the national shutdown to protest ICE. Here's why a boycott of companies like OpenAI and Amazon could be easier and more effective.",
    "fullText": "Economic boycotts are a familiar tool of protest. The problem is they often place the greatest strain on the smallest businesses.\n\nThat was the case during Friday's nationwide general strike, which was designed to pressure the Trump administration to dial back its aggressive anti-immigration policies.\n\nFor many small business owners, the shutdown created a dilemma. Supporting the cause often means losing a day's revenue and risking their ability to keep staff employed. Across social media, owners voiced solidarity alongside an apology for staying open.\n\nThere may, however, be another way, according to Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University famous for his critiques of Big Tech.\n\nInstead of a blanket shutdown, Galloway is calling for Americans to focus on major tech companies by unsubscribing from — or opting out of — services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Amazon's Prime Video, and Microsoft Office.\n\nA targeted boycott starting on Sunday and lasting the entire month of February could move markets, he says, which would, in turn, affect the CEOs who have the ear of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We're proposing something quieter and less cinematic than a protest that will run all day on cable TV, but much more disturbing to the Trump administration. A one-day slowdown is irritating. A one-month slump is terrifying,\" he wrote in a blog post announcing the boycott.\n\nMajor tech CEOs have sought favor with the president during his second term. Many of them donated to his inauguration, for starters.\n\nAI executives, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also accepted an invitation to a White House dinner with Trump in September, where the leaders took turns lauding the president. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attended the White House premiere of the documentary about first lady Melania Trump at the height of January's anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis.\n\nSupporting the AI industry in its competition with China is a major pillar of Trump's economic agenda.\n\n\"These are the leaders who have his ear,\" Galloway writes. \"A modest reduction in their companies' growth could have a substantial impact on valuations priced to perfection. Small changes in consumer behavior — starting on the first day of February — could have an enormous ripple effect, one that extends all the way to the White House.\"\n\nRegular protests against the tactics of ICE and Border Patrol personnel have gripped the country for months. Thousands marched through Minneapolis again on Saturday. Tensions rose dramatically in January after the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, both at the hands of federal immigration agents.\n\nIn both instances, protesters recorded videos and posted them to social media for the world to see, leaving little room for the Trump administration to spin the events in its favor.\n\nWhile those videos and the subsequent protests — as well as the attempted nationwide shutdown — have spread awareness, they have so far done little to substantively shift the administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security demoted a key Border Patrol official last week and promised more changes. At the same time, however, the acting director of ICE expanded the power agents have to carry out warrantless searches, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.\n\n\"Real change always comes from the American people, not from our political parties. But power doesn't fear protests nearly as much as economic withdrawals,\" Galloway writes. \"Getting off your couch, taking to the streets, and building community is important, but the most radical act in a capitalist society isn't marching, it's not spending.\"",

    "description": "James Hwang was laid off by Amazon in October. He says the job market has felt like a \"brick wall\" he can't break through.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with James Hwang, a 28-year-old job seeker who lives in southern Michigan. He previously worked for Amazon as an IT support engineer until being laid off last October. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOne morning in October, I got an automated text message from Amazon telling me to check my personal email before clocking in. I saw an email from HR telling me I'd been laid off.\n\nI was very surprised because I believed I was a high performer who had contributed a lot to the organization over my four years there. IT support employees like myself had also generally been spared in previous layoffs, and I felt we were already short-staffed.\n\nSince I'm the breadwinner in my family, I started looking for work right away, focusing on cloud support and IT system engineering roles. The job market has been crazy hard, and I haven't found a new job yet.\n\nWhile my final paychecks from Amazon I received through this month have helped cushion the transition, the slow progress in my job search has left me increasingly worried about my finances.\n\nMy wife and I have a young son and a mortgage. Our priority now is covering essentials and staying on top of our credit card payments. We've started budgeting for a potentially longer period of unemployment and cutting back on eating out and spending on other non-essentials.\n\nGetting laid off has made me reflect on my journey at Amazon.\n\nI was born and raised in Michigan, but in 2021, I lived in Seoul, South Korea, and worked for a small tech company. I thought joining a larger corporation would be better for my career, and I landed an IT support engineering role at Amazon's Seoul office.\n\nAfter about three years, it seemed like the best way to keep progressing was to move back to the US. In 2024, I transferred to a similar role on a fully remote team, which allowed me to return home to Michigan.\n\nMy team has members spread across the globe to ensure round-the-clock support, but that setup didn't align well with Amazon's evolving return-to-office policy, which became a five-day-a-week mandate for many employees one year ago. My team wasn't based near any single location, and my closest office was about an hour's drive away.\n\nMy understanding was that even after the latest RTO mandate took effect, some teams were still allowed to remain remote — a decision their VPs had some influence over. By midway through last year, however, it seemed like there was more top-down pressure to return to the office — pressure even VPs couldn't push back on.\n\nWhile I was never required to work from an office, I believe being a remote employee may have made me more vulnerable to layoffs — I heard that a fair number of my remote colleagues, both abroad and in the US, were affected. Amazon said the layoffs were driven by culture, and I think prioritizing in-office employees may have been part of that.\n\nI'm not sure there was much opportunity for advancement for me as a remote employee anyway. I was interested in an engineering role on another team but was told I'd need to relocate to Seattle. Since my wife and I bought a home last year and have strong family roots in Michigan, we're not open to relocating.\n\nMy job hunt has been really challenging so far. I typically spend about five hours a day job hunting during the week and scale back a bit on weekends.\n\nMy goal has been to find an engineering role like the kind of position I would've struggled to get at Amazon without relocating. I've been using my network as much as possible to try to secure referrals, while also applying to jobs cold.\n\nI've been targeting remote roles. In Michigan, there are some tech opportunities at large auto companies, but they typically require at least a hybrid schedule, and the pay is often lower than what I earned at Amazon. I'd be open to an in-office role, as long as it meets my compensation expectations, which are roughly a six-figure base salary. I live about 40 minutes from Detroit and would consider roles there if the right opportunity came along.\n\nI received one job offer from a company with a five-day office mandate, but I turned it down. The commute would've been an hour each way, and the role came with a fairly strict non-compete agreement that could've limited my ability to switch jobs.\n\nIt's been tough to land interviews. The AI-powered applicant tracking systems have been frustratingly difficult to navigate. While my search has been discouraging, I know I can't afford to slow down, especially as more laid-off workers flood the market and competition increases.\n\nI'm super stressed about my job search and recently applied for unemployment benefits. Since I started job searching in October, I've applied to more than 200 roles and had about five interviews. But I haven't given up.\n\nMy best advice for people who have been laid off, including those recently laid off by Amazon, is to lean on your connections. In today's market, it's tough without a referral. While it's important to stay consistent in your job search, I'd also recommend taking some time to rest — apply steadily, not at full throttle.\n\nThis is a marathon, not a sprint.",

    "fullText": "Nicole Sperling and Brooks Barnes, reporting for The New York Times:\n\nAmazon paid Ms. Trump’s production company $40 million for the\nrights to “Melania,” about $26 million more than the next closest\nbidder, Disney. The fee includes a related docuseries that is\nscheduled to air later this year. The budget for “Melania” is\nunknown, but documentaries that follow a subject for a limited\namount of time usually cost less than $5 million to produce. The\n$35 million for marketing is 10 times what some other high-profile\ndocumentaries have received.\n\nAll of which has a lot of Hollywood questioning whether Amazon’s\npush is anything more than the company’s attempt to ingratiate\nitself with President Trump.\n\nThis is a good story, with multiple industry sources with experience making political documentaries, but the Times’s own subhead downplays Amazon’s spending on the film: “The tech giant is spending $35 million to promote its film about the first lady, far more than is typical for documentaries.” They’re spending $35 million now, to promote it, but they already paid $40 million for the rights to the film, $28 million of which is believed to have gone to Melania Trump herself. A $35 million total spend would be a lot compared to other high-profile documentaries, but it’s a $75 million total spend. This is not just a little fishy — it’s a veritable open air seafood market.\n\nTo grasp just how uncustomary Amazon’s marketing push for\n“Melania” is, consider how Magnolia Pictures handled “RBG,”\na portrait of Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her 25th year as a\nSupreme Court justice, in 2018.\n\nCNN Films produced “RBG” for around $1 million. The promotional\nbudget, including an awards campaign that helped it land two Oscar\nnominations, totaled about $3 million. The film debuted in 34\ntheaters and expanded into 432 locations over several weeks. It\nultimately collected $14 million, enough to rank as the year’s No.\n1 political documentary.\n\nOn Friday, “Melania” will also be released in 1,600 theaters\noverseas, where FilmNation, a New York company, is handling\ndistribution in more than 20 countries. International ticket sales\nare expected to be weak, according to box office analysts.\n\nDisplay Preferences",

    "description": "After being laid off by Amazon in October 2025, Iren Azra Zou landed a new job two weeks later. She shared her top advice for other laid-off workers.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Iren Azra Zou, a 27-year-old in New Jersey. She is a founding engineer at tech startup Double Nickel, and previously worked as a software engineer at Amazon until being laid off in October 2025. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe day before Amazon announced layoffs in October, there were rumors that something big was coming.\n\nI had a strange feeling in my gut that I might be affected, even though I felt I was performing well and had met my goals earlier than expected. I'd been laid off from my previous tech job the year prior, in 2024, and I knew how, in situations like these, people can quickly become just numbers on a spreadsheet.\n\nIt was hard to sleep that night, and the next morning, I woke up to a 6 a.m. automated text from Amazon telling me to check my email for a message about my role. At that moment, I was pretty sure I had been laid off, which the message soon confirmed.\n\nThe first person I told was my husband, who was next to me in bed. After that, I messaged a few close coworkers to figure out who else had been affected. When I found out that some rock stars on my team had also been laid off, I was shocked.\n\nI was mentally prepared for my layoff — due to the speculation that cuts were coming — but I was also financially prepared.\n\nMy husband and I had taken steps to save aggressively and ensure we had enough savings to last for a while if we were both laid off. That financial cushion helped me stay calm when I found out I'd lost my job.\n\nI made a point to stick to my daily routines: coffee, exercise, and sleep schedule. I didn't want everything to feel chaotic.\n\nI quickly started looking for new job opportunities, and two weeks later, I landed and accepted an offer to start a software engineering role in December.\n\nHere's my advice for anyone who's recently been laid off:\n\nWhen you get laid off, you can't help but ask yourself, \"Why me?\"\n\nEventually, you come to terms with the reality that you can do everything right and still be included in a layoff simply because you're a number on a budget sheet. I know I worked hard and brought a lot to the table; a layoff didn't erase that.\n\nI was prepared for interviewers to ask about my Amazon layoff, but it didn't really come up. I think other companies recognized the scale of the layoff and that it wasn't performance-based, in many cases. I also think that, despite the layoff, having a household name like Amazon on my résumé was probably helpful.\n\nReflect on what you want in your next role and create a targeted job search plan to maximize your chances of landing it. I wanted to make sure I found the right fit, so this was really helpful for me.\n\nUpon reflection, I decided that the best fit for me might be at a smaller company with less bureaucracy than Amazon — and where I could better see the impact of my work.\n\nThe pro of working at a big company was that you could do one thing and it could affect millions of people in less than 30 minutes, which was exciting. However, the downside was that it sometimes felt like you were a very tiny piece in a giant machine.\n\nI was also hoping to land a remote role. For the last few months of my time at Amazon, I'd been required to commute one hour each way from New Jersey to the New York City office five days a week, which was really draining. I figured I might have more leverage to ask for remote flexibility at a smaller company than at Amazon, where so many people are competing for job postings.\n\nMy team at Amazon also didn't have many women, so I wanted to be in a place with a bit more diversity.\n\nI narrowed down my target: a software engineering role at a small company that offered remote flexibility — and where I felt I could grow and thrive.\n\nThis is not the time to be shy — most people will be sympathetic and eager to support you.\n\nI believe my LinkedIn presence — where I'm very active, posting career advice tailored to young professionals — helped me boost my visibility.\n\nThe day after my layoff, the chief technology officer of Double Nickel — a tech startup focused on truck driver recruitment — reached out to me on LinkedIn about a software engineering role they were hiring for. She said she'd seen my post-layoff LinkedIn post and, as a former Amazon employee herself, decided to reach out.\n\nThe role seemed like a good fit, so I applied and quickly landed an interview.\n\nFollowing the interviews, I was given an offer, which I accepted. We agreed to an arrangement where I'd work in a hybrid setup for the first few months to help with onboarding, and then transition to remote work around the end of February. So far, I'm very happy with the role.\n\nLooking back, I see the layoff as a turning point because it helped me clarify what I wanted in my next role. It was still a difficult experience, but I felt more grounded and optimistic as time went on — and ultimately landed a role I feel great about.",

    "description": "How Amazon's decision translates to your own workplace.",
    "fullText": "16,000 jobs down. How many more to go?\n\nThe sequel to Amazon's mass layoffs last fall came yesterday with another round of deep job cuts. I'd love to tell you it's an isolated incident, but it feels representative of a broader shift across tech and corporate America.\n\nAI is ushering in a new era for workplaces, and companies are adjusting accordingly. As the ones closest to the tech (and spending the most on it), Big Tech would be the first to evolve. Make no mistake: Where Big Tech goes, the rest of the business world will likely follow.\n\nSo what can we glean from Amazon's layoffs? Fortunately, my colleagues Eugene Kim and Ashley Stewart are crushing it with scoops. Their stories provide context about Amazon's decision and how that translates to your own workplace.\n\nNo one is safe: Internal Slack messages Ashley viewed show how many teams were bitten by the layoff bug. That includes businesses within AWS (its AI cloud service and cloud data warehouse service) and Amazon's retail business.\n\nOne Amazon worker used an AI tool to flag roles on the chopping block. That list is even broader, although it may contain inaccuracies since it's AI-generated. Another noticeable trend is how software engineers got hit particularly hard, as has been the case in tech recently.\n\nOwn it: After a not-so-hot start, Amazon has coordinated its post-layoffs communications. And there's one word that keeps cropping up: ownership.\n\nPrasad Kalyanaraman, VP of AWS Infrastructure, and Colleen Aubrey, SVP of Applied AI Solutions, both described \"doubling down on a culture of ownership\" in memos Ashley viewed. That sentiment, coupled with the changes Eugene reported on in performance reviews, signals that the further away you are from doing the actual work, the more at risk you are.\n\nAI can be a friend as much as a foe: Artificial intelligence often takes a lot of blame for why jobs are getting swallowed up. A memo from AWS VP Greg Pearson that Eugene viewed paints a different picture.\n\nHe urged workers to \"keep finding ways to use technology to simplify our work.\" It's something I heard a lot of last week when chatting with execs: \"AI won't take your job, but the person willing to use it will.\"\n\nMake change, don't manage it: I'm not a tech career coach (I'll leave that advice to this guy), but the layoffs, coupled with CEO Andy Jassy's ongoing war against bureaucracy, indicate a desire to get more people rolling up their sleeves.\n\nIt's reminiscent of a recent convo I had with Cisco president and chief product officer Jeetu Patel. He stressed the importance of figuring out the change you want to make and working toward it, rather than focusing on a job title.\n\n\"If in the pursuit of that change, you have to go out and reluctantly manage some people, then go ahead and do that,\" Patel told me. \"But management, in and of itself, is not a full-time job.\"",

    "fullText": "Amazon cut 16,000 more corporate jobs on Wednesday, and leadership wants the remaining staff to become even more efficient through technology.\n\nIn an email addressing the layoffs on Wednesday, Greg Pearson, VP of global sales at Amazon Web Services, urged employees to keep using technology to streamline their work.\n\n\"Moving forward, I encourage you to keep finding ways to use technology to simplify our work, amplify our impact, and focus on the activities that directly drive value for our customers,\" Pearson wrote in the email obtained by Business Insider. \"And most importantly, take care of yourselves and each other.\"\n\nPearson's message mirrors Amazon's broader drive to run more efficiently as it reorganizes amid rapid advances in AI. Although the company initially linked the October layoffs to AI, CEO Andy Jassy later said they were driven more by cultural fit than by cost reductions or automation.\n\nJassy has previously said AI will ultimately reduce Amazon's workforce by driving efficiency gains. On Wednesday, Amazon's chief human resources officer, Beth Galetti, said in the layoff announcement that the company will continue hiring and investing in \"strategic areas.\"\n\nWednesday's layoff was Amazon's second round of mass job cuts since October, when it axed 14,000 roles.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Amazon announced it's cutting 16,000 jobs. The career coach Kyle Elliott said you should use these two critical tools to help you find a job after a layoff.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kyle Elliott, 33, a career coach who lives in California. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGetting laid off is very traumatic — and it's becoming more common.\n\nI've been a full-time career coach to tech employees at startups and in Big Tech since 2017, and I've seen how layoffs have become more visible in recent years.\n\nI help clients navigate life after a layoff, including what role they want next and how to apply for new jobs.\n\nAmazon has announced new plans to cut staff, and I want affected employees to remember that they are coming from one of the world's top companies.\n\nPeople will want them, and they will find something.\n\nWhen people reach out to me for coaching after a layoff, many have a scarcity mindset and feel like they have to apply for any job.\n\nFor some people who urgently need to pay rent or put food on the table, that's necessary. But in other cases, it makes sense to take a beat and evaluate what you're really looking for in your next role.\n\nThe very first thing I ask clients to do is create a list of \"must-haves\" and \"dealbreakers\" for their next job. What are their salary expectations? Will they only work remotely? Are they willing to relocate? If you write the list before you start interviewing, you can act from a place of logic rather than panic.\n\nThe second step is to update your résumé and LinkedIn profile, which are two of your most critical tools in today's market. You're going to submit a résumé with almost every application, and having an up-to-date LinkedIn account puts you in a good position if potential employers check it or recruiters go looking for talent on the platform.\n\nYou want to optimize for the roles you're looking for in 2026, which means that if you were an engineer when you joined Amazon but are now a director, you want to make sure that's reflected on your LinkedIn page.\n\nI've seen clients turn to quick hacks for their job search, like asking AI to tailor their résumé or using it to find and apply to roles for them. But if everyone does that, you don't stand out.\n\nI can usually tell quickly if someone's written their résumé with AI. For example, they'll be applying to a systems engineer role, and it won't even have the phrase \"systems engineer\" in it.\n\nEveryone thinks only AI is reading their résumé, but I have clients who work in talent acquisition and HR — the humans who are still involved in the recruitment process. Humans hire other humans, even at big companies.\n\nIn the age of AI, be more human. Take a step back and think, if you were a human looking at this résumé, what would you want to see? Then put those phrases near the top, rather than using AI to create generic slop.\n\nI'd suggest creating a master résumé that you can spend 20 minutes tailoring for different roles. If you're using AI, use it more like an extra tool, rather than the thing that's driving your job search.\n\nLayoffs are normal now, especially in the tech industry, and there's much less stigma around them.\n\nBut there's more competition in the job market, because it's easier to apply for jobs with AI, for example, so the challenges around layoffs are different nowadays.\n\nIn today's job market, it's important to figure out what's unique about you. Lots of people will meet the job requirements, so you need to communicate why the company should hire you over the thousands of other applicants.\n\nOne thing that can help you is to look back at performance reviews and identify things people repeatedly say about you. You can try asking three to five people to share what makes you fabulous and to give examples. I've found that clients are surprised by the feedback they receive.",

    "fullText": "Amazon is cutting 16,000 corporate roles, and an internal FAQ viewed by Business Insider spells out the details for affected employees.\n\nThis round of layoffs is the second mass job cut since October, when Amazon shed 14,000 roles. The moves are part of a broad effort by the company to operate more efficiently amid rapid advances in AI.

    "description": "The layoffs mark the second round of mass cuts at Amazon since last October, when the company laid off roughly 14,000 employees across its corporate workforce.",
    "fullText": "Amazon said Wednesday it plans to eliminate about 16,000 corporate jobs, marking its second round of mass job cuts since last October.\n\nIn a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs were part of an ongoing effort to \"strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.\" That coincides with a push to invest heavily in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe cuts come just a few months after October's layoffs, when 14,000 employees were let go across Amazon's corporate workforce. At the time, the company indicated the cuts would continue in 2026 as it found \"additional places we can remove layers.\"\n\nBeth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, didn't rule out more job cuts in the future, but said the company isn't trying to create \"a new rhythm\" of broad layoffs every few months.\n\n\"That's not our plan,\" Galetti wrote. \"But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, some employees in Amazon's cloud unit received an email sent in an apparent error acknowledging \"organizational changes\" at the company. The note referenced a post from Galetti and said Amazon notified \"impacted colleagues in our organization.\"\n\nAmazon had about 1.58 million employees as of the end of its third quarter. That figure is primarily made up of warehouse and logistics workers.\n\nThe 30,000 job cuts since October represent about 10% of its corporate and tech workforce, which comprises about 350,000 people.\n\nAmazon has been in the midst of a significant downsizing for the past several years. The company laid off more than 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and it conducted smaller cuts across various organizations in 2024.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy has looked to slim down Amazon's workforce after the company went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services.\n\nJassy has also looked to reset Amazon's corporate culture so that it can operate like the \"world's largest startup.\" He set internal targets to slash management layers and established a \"no bureaucracy email alias\" to identify ways the company can innovate faster.\n\nAmazon has also been cutting costs across its business so that it can invest \n\nLast October, Amazon said it expects capital expenditures to reach $125 billion for 2026, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies.\n\nJassy said last June that efficiency gains from AI would likely cause Amazon's corporate headcount to fall in the coming years.\n\n\"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" Jassy said at the time.",

    "fullText": "Workers informed after message had erroneously said affected employees in US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been told\n\nAmazon has told workers it is cutting 16,000 jobs globally to streamline its operations, hours after sending out a message to staff about the layoffs apparently in error.\n\nIt is the second major wave of job cuts at the US online retail giant, and comes just three months after the company said it was slashing 14,000 roles.\n\nThe majority of jobs affected are expected to be in the US, although some roles in the UK may also be affected.\n\nThe company said the “additional organisational changes” were designed to “strengthen our organisation by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy”, according to a blogpost to staff from Beth Galetti, the senior vice president of people experience and technology.\n\nGaletti said some teams had not been affected by the job cuts announced in October, but this was not the beginning of regular waves of layoffs. “Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months. That’s not our plan,” she wrote.\n\nUS-based employees who are affected will be offered 90 days to find a new role internally, with the timing for applying for new roles varying in other countries.\n\nGaletti said Amazon would continue to hire new staff and invest in “strategic areas and functions that are critical to our future”.\n\nThe official announcement came just hours after workers at Amazon Web Services (AWS) received an online meeting invitation from a top executive on Tuesday for the following day – subsequently cancelled – that also contained a draft email revealing the cuts.\n\nThe message erroneously said that affected employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been told they had lost their jobs.\n\nIt was signed by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice-president of applied AI solutions at the company’s cloud computing arm AWS, while the layoffs were referred to in the email as “Project Dawn”.\n\n“Changes like this are hard on everyone,” Aubrey wrote in the email, which was seen by multiple news outlets including Reuters and Bloomberg. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organisation and AWS for future success.”\n\nThe email referred to a separate message from Amazon’s human resources boss, which did not appear to have been sent.\n\nAmazon has been trying to reverse a pandemic hiring spree in an effort to cut costs and slim down its huge operation, which employs about 1.5 million people worldwide.\n\nAmazon’s chief executive, Andy Jassy, has previously warned white-collar workers at the company that their jobs could be taken by AI in the next few years.\n\nThe news of fresh Amazon layoffs came as the US delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS) said it would cut up to 30,000 jobs this year, adding to last year’s job reductions, as it focuses on higher-margin shipments.\n\nUPS has been working to cut millions of low-value deliveries it carries out for Amazon, which is its largest customer but increasingly also a delivery rival. UPS has called its business with Amazon “extraordinarily dilutive” to margins.",

    "fullText": "Amazon said it is eliminating around 16,000 corporate roles globally, marking its second round of mass job cuts since October, when it shed 14,000 roles.\n\nThe latest layoffs were announced on Wednesday by Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, who described the move as part of broader efforts to cut back on bureaucracy inside the company.\n\n\"As I shared in October, we've been working to strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy,\" wrote Galetti in a memo that was shared on Amazon's blog. \"While many teams finalized their organizational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now.\"\n\nGaletti added that Amazon would offer \"most\" US-based employees 90 days to search for a new role internally. Those who are unable to find a role or choose not to will be given support, including severance pay and health insurance benefits, she added.\n\nThe cuts underscore Amazon's push to operate more efficiently as it reshapes the organization amid rapid advances in AI. While the company initially linked the October layoffs to AI-driven changes, CEO Andy Jassy later said those reductions were more about cultural fit than cost savings or automation.\n\nOn Tuesday, some Amazon employees received a calendar invitation regarding job cuts that had apparently been sent early.\n\nEarlier this week, Amazon also announced it would shutter its Amazon Go and Fresh stores, citing its failure to create a \"truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model.\"\n\nAmazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce represents a relatively small share of that total, at roughly 350,000 employees.\n\nIn recent years, Amazon has trimmed management layers, tightened spending, overhauled performance systems, and ordered most corporate employees to return to the office five days a week.\n\nGaletti acknowledged the numerous cuts in the memo, but didn't rule out further changes ahead. \"Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm — where we announce broad reductions every few months,\" she wrote.\n\n\"That's not our plan. But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate.\"\n\nThat cultural reset accelerated after the pandemic, when Amazon's explosive growth slowed. The company moved to rein in costs by shutting down unprofitable initiatives and shrinking what executives described as a bloated workforce. Last year, Jassy said efficiency gains from AI would eventually reduce Amazon's head count.\n\nAmazon's moves mirror a broader trend across Big Tech, where companies have cut thousands of jobs while ramping up AI investment.\n\nMicrosoft said last year it would eliminate about 15,000 positions, with CEO Satya Nadella telling employees the company needed to stay focused on its AI transformation. Meta has also made AI-driven cuts, telling employees in its risk organization last year that their roles were being replaced by automation.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "The invitation was written by Amazon executive Colleen Aubrey. It was cancelled soon after being sent, stoking confusion among some employees.",
    "fullText": "Some Amazon employees got a worrying calendar invitation on Tuesday, stoking more concern about job cuts that are expected in coming days.\n\nThe invitation addressed impending job cuts and mentioned \"Project Dawn,\" an initiative to improve efficiency at Amazon, according to a copy obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe invitation had the subject line \"Send Project Dawn email\" and was written by Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of AWS Solutions, although it appears to have been sent by an assistant.\n\nThe invitation was for a calendar event at 5 a.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, but it was canceled shortly after it was sent. Some employees noticed it and shared the information with Business Insider.\n\n\"This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers,\" the accompanying message read. \"The notifications to impacted colleagues in our organization who are based in the US, Canada, and Costa Rica have now been completed.\"\n\n\"Changes like this are hard on everyone,\" Aubrey's message continued. \"These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success.\"\n\nAmazon plans to cut thousands of corporate roles in coming days, Business Insider previously reported. The reductions would mark the company's second round of mass layoffs since October, when it eliminated roughly 14,000 jobs. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter the calendar invitation landed, confusion spread across an internal Slack channel with more than 36,000 Amazon employees, according to messages viewed by Business Insider. Staff questioned whether the message had been intended for Aubrey's entire organization or only for those whose roles were being eliminated.\n\n\"Am I impacted or sent by mistake to all?\" one employee wrote.\n\nOthers saw the email as confirmation that the expected layoffs were imminent.\n\n\"Well, if you needed solid proof that tomorrow is legit, the project dawn email is it,\" one person wrote. \"Looks like they wanted to use AI to send an email tomorrow and instead it sent a calendar invite today.\"\n\nIt remains unclear which teams will be affected by the cuts. Some Amazon employees who spoke to Business Insider theorized that staff who received the accidental invitation may not be among those getting cut.\n\n\"People are speculating you're safe if invited,\" one employee said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Rebecca Yarros' \"Fourth Wing\" is being turned into an Amazon series. Producer Michael B. Jordan recently assured fans that the show is on its way.",
    "fullText": "At this point, it's hard not to be familiar with Rebecca Yarros' \"Empyrean\" series about dragon rider Violet Sorrengail.\n\nWhen \"Onyx Storm,\" the third book in the romantasy series, was released in January 2025, it became the fastest-selling adult novel in 20 years.\n\nYarros is taking a break from the \"Empyrean\" series before writing the fourth installment, but in the meantime, we're getting closer to a series adaptation of \"Fourth Wing.\"\n\nIn October 2023, Deadline announced that Amazon MGM Studios and Oscar nominee Michael B. Jordan's Outlier Society were developing \"Fourth Wing\" into a Prime Video series. Yarros is an executive producer for the show.\n\nOutlier Society produced Jordan's \"Creed III\" and is developing a slate of other series and films in addition to \"Fourth Wing.\"\n\nDeadline also reported in October 2023 that Amazon MGM Studios had acquired the rights to the entire \"Empyrean\" series. In her January 2025 Variety interview, Yarros said she had shared the \"five-book arc\" for the \"Empyrean\" series with Amazon.\n\n\"They have the five-book arc, which went a little awry in Book 3 just because the positioning, but they already know that,\" she told Variety. \"But they have the five-book arc and the general big points of what happens in between each book, but they don't have the specifics between Book 4 and Book 5, because I'm getting ready to go to my crazy plotting board and and plot out every single event that happens in each book, so that I make sure that I'm within my two books there.\"\n\nIn July 2024, Outlier Society announced it had hired Moira Walley-Beckett, who worked on shows like \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Anne with an E,\" as the showrunner for the series. In a January 2025 interview with Variety, Yarros said Walley-Beckett was \"great\" and \"phenomenal,\" but in July 2025, Walley-Beckett exited the project.\n\nJac Schaeffer, best known for her work on Disney's \"WandaVision\" and \"Agatha All Along,\" was rumored to be in talks to step into the showrunner role. However, in September 2025, Variety and Deadline reported that Amazon was hiring Meredith Averill.\n\nAverill was previously the showrunner of the Netflix series \"Locke & Key\" and a producer on shows like \"The Good Wife\" and \"The Haunting of Hill House.\"\n\nAmazon declined to comment on this piece when contacted by Business Insider, but Yarros shared a screenshot of Deadline's article on her Instagram when the showrunner announcement dropped.\n\n\"Welcome to the team, Meredith Averill! Guys, I love everything this wonderful woman has worked on and I'm so excited to have her joining us,\" Yarros said in her caption.\n\nNeither Amazon nor Outlier Society has announced any casting or release dates for the series. Still, in January 2026, Jordan assured fans it was on its way in an interview with Deadline.\n\n\"We are making sure that this is going to be an exciting show that delivers on all of the things the fans want and some of the things that they won't be expecting either,\" Jordan said.\n\nHe also told the outlet he's aware of how much fans of \"Fourth Wing\" care about the series.\n\n\"But trust me, I know how beloved this franchise IP is,\" he said. \"It's early stages, but I feel how much people care about this one. It's not lost on us.\"\n\nAlthough details about the series are limited, Yarros made a few comments about the show while promoting \"Onyx Storm.\"\n\nSpeaking at an engagement on January 24, 2025, in New York, Yarros told fans she had read the pilot for the \"Fourth Wing\" show — and loved it.\n\n\"I read the latest version of the pilot last week,\" she said. \"It's really nerve-racking when you read something like that because you're really — you're trusting someone else with your baby, right? And you're trusting someone else to say, like, 'Hey, this is important in your work, and this isn't,' and you kinda get your guard up.\"\n\n\"But guys, I, like, kicked my feet the whole time,\" she said. \"You're gonna love it.\"\n\nYarros also praised Walley-Beckett at the event, calling her a \"brilliant writer\" and saying she maintained the integrity of the book in the pilot. It's unclear how the pilot may have changed since Walley-Beckett's exit from the project.\n\nSpeaking at an event in London on August 30, 2024, Yarros said casting will ultimately fall on the show's staff, not her. She also said she intentionally hasn't shared any specific actors she hopes will be cast in the series.\n\n\"I will never say who my perfect fan cast is because the cast is so diverse, and I want to open that up to more diversity,\" she said. \"And I feel like the second I say who I think this character is, that's who everyone will accept. That's only who they will accept.\"\n\n\"I kinda hope they find, like, an up-and-coming generation,\" she added. \"But I would never put my fan cast in your heads.\"\n\nAlthough she won't be involved in casting the series, Yarros said at the same event that she has one hard-line casting request she has communicated to Amazon and Outlier Society.\n\n\"They know how staunch I am against whitewashing Xaden,\" she said. \"I think that's the biggest thing.\"\n\nXaden Riorson, Violet's love interest in the series, is described as having \"warm tawny skin\" in \"Fourth Wing\" and \"tawny-brown\" skin in both \"Iron Flame\" and \"Onyx Storm.\"",

    "description": "The year just started, and Amazon's already paying over $3 billion in legal settlements.",
    "fullText": "January isn't over yet, and Amazon's already set to pay more than $3 billion to U.S. customers across various settlements. If you've bought anything from Amazon recently, keep an eye out: Bezos' baby could owe you some money.\n\nIf you've had difficulty returning an Amazon package recently, you could have a paycheck coming your way soon. As reported by Reuters, the company has agreed to a $309 million cash settlement (in addition to \"other benefits\") with affected customers, alongside more than $600 million in individual refunds. According to lawyers for the plaintiffs, the settlement as a whole provides more than $1 billion in relief.\n\nThe lawsuit accused the e-commerce giant of causing \"substantial unjustified monetary losses\" with its return policies, which the plaintiffs say resulted in many customers returning items only to be charged for them anyway. Amazon denied any wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but did say it will spend more than $363 million improving its return and refund practices.\n\nThe company claims that, after an internal review last year, it \"identified a small subset of returns where we issued a refund without the payment completing, or where we could not verify that the correct item had been sent to us, so no refund had been issued.\" However, Amazon said it had taken steps to resolve the issue, as seen in the refunds on years-old returns the company started issuing last year.\n\nThe settlement is still awaiting approval from U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead in Seattle, but as both parties support it, it'll likely come soon. The class would cover \"U.S. purchasers of goods on Amazon from Sept 2017 who allegedly did not receive timely or correct refunds, or who were later charged despite returning items,\" writes Reuters.\n\nIt's currently unclear how class members would file a claim, or how the $309 million cash settlement and $600 million individual refunds will be divvied up. However, the plaintiffs told the court that class members should expect to recover the full amount of lost funds, plus interest.\n\nEligible class members are often contacted by email, so keep an eye out. In the meantime, you can also search for legal updates using the case name, \"In re: Amazon Return Policy Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, No. 2:23-CV-1372-JNW.\"\n\nWhile Amazon's returns settlement is still in its early phases, it's not the biggest payout the company's had to make this year. Earlier this January, Amazon reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the FTC over accusations that it had essentially tricked people into either signing up for or staying subscribed to Prime. Claims are going out in two ways, one of which is automatic, and the other you have to \n\nAccording to the settlement website, as well as the FTC, automatic payments should have gone out already, and applied to people who meet the following requirements:\n\nYou are a U.S. consumer who signed up for Prime between June 23, 2019 and June 23, 2025, and\n\nYou enrolled through a Challenged Enrollment Flow, and\n\nYou used no more than three Prime benefits in a 12-month period from June 23, 2019 and June 23, 2025.\n\nIf that doesn't sound like you, or you didn't receive a payment, you'll need to file a claim using the \"File Claim\" button on the settlement website. You're eligible to do this if you meet the follow requirements:\n\nYou are a U.S. consumer who signed up for Prime, and\n\nYou unintentionally enrolled in a Prime membership through a challenged enrollment method at issue in the FTC’s lawsuit from June 23, 2019 to June 23, 2025; or you tried to cancel your Prime membership through the online cancellation process from June 23, 2019 to June 23, 2025, but were unable to do so; and\n\nYou used less than ten Prime benefits (e.g., delivery, shopping, streaming, reading, and other benefits provided to Prime members) during any 12-month period of enrollment in Prime, and\n\nYou did not receive an automatic payment as part of this Settlement already.\n\nNeither website is entirely clear about what constitutes \"challenged enrollment,\" aside from saying that Amazon enrolled customers in Prime without their knowledge or consent. Luckily, you probably won't need to do any legwork to see if you're eligible.\n\nAccording to the FTC, Amazon has begun sending claim notices by mail or email to eligible Prime customers who didn't already get an automatic refund. This will be your cue to If you believe you're eligible for a share of the settlement but Amazon did not contact you, you can reach out to [email protected] for help.\n\nOnce you file your claim, you can choose to be paid either through check, PayPal, or Venmo. Expected payments will differ from person to person, but will cap out at $51. And there's no need to rush. The deadline to file a claim is July 27, 2026, so you've got some time to ensure you get what you're owed.",

    "fullText": "We’re simplifying and improving the LocalStack for AWS experience by unifying Community and Pro into one image, offering a free account-based experience for individuals and open source users, and introducing a new CLI (CLI v2) to power the next generation of local cloud development.\n\nWaldemar Hummer and Gerta Sheganaku\n\nAt LocalStack, we’re very fortunate to fundamentally shape how local cloud development is done. By providing high-fidelity cloud service emulators, we enable developers to run a digital twin of their cloud environment locally–a true local cloud sandbox. What began as a seemingly crazy idea among a handful of individuals and community members (“why would you build a cloud on your laptop?”) has since evolved into a major driver of cloud development productivity for enterprises and teams around the globe.\n\nOver time, LocalStack for AWS has also evolved well beyond a local AWS emulator running in a container. We’ve invested heavily in expanding our cloud offering and Web Console, introducing powerful new capabilities such as a visual resource browser, collaboration features, chaos engineering workflows, IAM policy debugging, and much more.\n\nAs LocalStack’s sophistication has increased–and as our active user base has grown rapidly –we’ve encountered a growing divide between two distinct groups: (1) users who \n\nGoing forward, we will focus our efforts primarily on the former group. By working more closely with engaged users, we believe we can have a deeper impact–delivering advanced capabilities that meaningfully transform developer workflows and significantly improve productivity for cloud development teams.\n\nLocalStack started as a scrappy open-source experiment, and the community made it what it is today. Over time, however, the scope, security requirements, and operational complexity of maintaining high-fidelity AWS emulation have grown significantly.\n\nTo continue delivering accurate, secure, and production-grade cloud emulation - while still offering a free entry point - we need a distribution model that lets us engage directly with users, understand how LocalStack is used, and sustainably invest in the platform.\n\nFor the last several years, we’ve maintained two separate versions of LocalStack for AWS: our Community edition, which is open-source and freely available to the community; and our Pro edition, which is only accessible with a paid license.\n\nBeginning in March 2026, LocalStack for AWS will be delivered as a single, unified version. Users will need to create an account to run LocalStack for AWS, which allows us to provide a secure, up-to-date, and feature-rich experience for everyone—from those on our free and student plans to those at enterprise accounts.\n\nAs a result of this shift, we cannot commit to releasing regular updates to the Community edition of LocalStack for AWS. Regular product enhancements and security patches will only be applied to the new version of LocalStack for AWS available via our website.\n\nMeanwhile, the source code for prior versions of the LocalStack for AWS Community edition will remain openly available on GitHub. While the LocalStack team will scale back active maintenance, the repository will continue to serve as a reference point for the community. Ongoing feature development and regular updates will no longer be part of our focus for this repository, which will be clearly marked as inactive, with its current status reflected in the README.\n\nFor those using the Community edition of LocalStack for AWS today (i.e., the localstack/localstack Docker image), any project that automatically pulls the latest image of LocalStack for AWS from Docker Hub will need to be updated before the change goes live in March 2026.\n\nThose who would like to take advantage of the latest LocalStack for AWS features once this change is implemented will have several options to choose from:\n\nLocalStack is committed to supporting our community, from individual innovators to large enterprise software organizations. Our free plan will continue to provide a dynamic environment for experimental development and exploration. Our Student plan, available to those who participate in GitHub’s Student Developer Pack, will not be affected by this change. And our enterprise solutions are optimized for environments that demand high availability, scalable automation, governance, and stability.\n\nHobbyists looking to continue leveraging the Community edition of LocalStack for AWS are advised to pin to a fixed version of the Community image (e.g., version 4.12) in any automation, rather than using the latest image tag.\n\nWhile pinning to a previous version of the Community edition of LocalStack for AWS will prevent any disruption to your automation, please note that previous versions will not receive backport support.\n\nWe spend a lot of time and effort creating an experience that makes cloud development easier and faster for our users. These changes ensure that all LocalStack for AWS users can benefit from this work.\n\nIn the coming months, we will share documentation and resources to help our community prepare for this change. Stay tuned \n\nLocalStack would not exist without our community - from the early skeptics to power users who pushed us to be better and helped us get to where we are today. These changes are about ensuring that LocalStack can continue to exist, evolve, and serve developers for the long term.\n\nWe’re committed to making this transition transparent, gradual, and respectful - and we welcome your feedback as we move forward. Below are answers to some frequently asked questions relating to this change.\n\nOur current distribution for our AWS emulator, which was packaged both as a free Community image (localstack/localstack) and a commercial Pro image (localstack/localstack-pro) on Docker Hub, will be consolidated into a single image beginning in March 2026. Going forward, LocalStack for AWS will be available via a single image distribution on Docker Hub at localstack/localstack.\n\nThe new unified distribution will require authentication via an auth token for use. This means that, once the change is published in March, pulling and running localstack/localstack:latest will prompt you for an auth token if you have not already provided one.\n\nFor Existing Customers on a Paid Tier\n\nNothing will change. We will continue to publish updates to localstack/localstack-pro. Ensure that you have your auth token set on LocalStack on your machine. For details on how to find and set your auth token, check our auth token documentation. If you are using LocalStack in CI, please also ensure that you have set a CI auth token in your CI environment.\n\nFor Existing Users on a Free Tier\n\nYour existing configuration will still work using localstack/localstack-pro provided you have set your auth token. For details on how to find and set your auth token, check our auth token documentation. Our free plan does not include CI credits. If you wish to use LocalStack within a CI environment, we encourage you to explore our pricing tier options to see what best suits your requirements.\n\nFor Existing Users of the Community Image\n\nTo prevent any disruption after the consolidated image is launched, you can use one of the following options:\n\nThis change is currently planned to go live in March 2026. The exact date will be shared as we approach the transition. We will communicate this change via all available channels, including in-product, email, blog, social and our Slack community.\n\nNothing needs to be done today.\n\nWe are issuing this announcement now to provide details proactively so our users have time to prepare. For details on how this might impact you once the change is implemented and options for addressing that, please see the details listed under “What is changing?”\n\nThe community image will no longer be available on Docker Hub when using localstack/localstack:latest once the image consolidation is complete. Past releases of the community image will still be available, and you can choose to pin your setup to a prior version tag. It’s important to note that pinning to a prior version will opt you out of any future updates or security patches. The open source code for the community image will remain on GitHub, but the repository will be less actively maintained, as we cannot commit to making active ongoing contributions.\n\nThe localstack/localstack-pro image will remain available. We do not currently plan to change this in order to facilitate the transition for our customers. After the change goes into effect, localstack/localstack and localstack/localstack-pro will both have the same image.\n\nWe will continue to make a free tier available to all LocalStack users, and, for many use cases, transitioning to the free tier from the community image will offer equivalent capabilities, including emulation of the AWS services currently supported by the community image. However, our free plan does not include CI credits. If you wish to use LocalStack for AWS within a CI environment, we encourage you to explore our pricing tier options to see what best suits your requirements.\n\nNo. You can continue to use the pro image at localstack/localstack-pro. Your current configuration will continue to work, unchanged, provided you have already set your auth token and CI auth tokens as required. For details on how to find and set your auth token, check our auth token documentation. If you are using LocalStack in CI, please also ensure that you have set a CI auth token in your CI environment.\n\nOnce the image consolidation is completed in March 2026, using the most recent version of LocalStack for AWS via the localstack/localstack:latest image tag will require authentication. For CI environments, this requires that you set a CI auth token. CI runs using LocalStack consume CI credits across your workspace. The number of CI credits allotted to your workspace depends on your pricing tier. Free tier accounts do not include CI credits.\n\nIf you are a current open source user using LocalStack for AWS in a CI environment, you’ll need to either:\n\nPlease note that pinning to a prior version tag of LocalStack on Docker Hub will opt you out of any future updates or security patches.\n\nIf you are a current paid tier customer relying on the localstack/localstack-pro image on Docker Hub, no changes need to be made. Your CI deployments will run the same after the image consolidation provided that you have set a CI auth token in your CI environment.\n\nIf you are a current open source or free tier user, you can join our LocalStack Community Slack to ask questions. The LocalStack team is active there and can help address your questions.\n\nFor questions relating to the use of LocalStack for AWS for business purposes, please contact our team via this form.\n\nIf you are a current paid tier customer, you can email support@localstack.cloud or utilize the support chat option from the LocalStack dashboard to contact a support engineer.",

    "fullText": "Amazon is closing the supermarket chain that it spent nearly six years building from scratch.\n\nThe tech and retail giant said it plans to close its Amazon Fresh stores \"to prioritize investment in growth areas,\" in a company blog post on Tuesday. Amazon has around 60 Fresh stores in the US listed on its website.\n\nThe company is also shuttering about 15 Amazon Go convenience stores, it said.\n\n\"While we've seen encouraging signals in our Amazon-branded physical grocery stores, we haven't yet created a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion,\" Amazon said in the post.\n\nSome of the locations are set to become Whole Foods stores, Amazon said.\n\nThe closures are the latest pivot for Amazon's grocery business. Despite creating Amazon Fresh, buying Whole Foods, and building its grocery delivery muscle, Amazon's market share is still a fraction of several rivals.\n\nWalmart has emerged as a particular source of inspiration for Amazon's grocery business lately, Business Insider has reported. The company has plans to build a Walmart Supercenter-like megastore near Chicago, for example.\n\nAmazon has spent the better part of a decade trying to build a grocery store model using its own name that meets its expectations. It opened the first Amazon Go location to the public in 2018 and the first Amazon Fresh store in 2020.\n\nThe Fresh stores offered more mass-market groceries, such as some sodas and snacks, than Whole Foods stores did. Amazon also touted the stores for their use of technology, such as the company's Just Walk Out system.\n\nAmazon said Tuesday that Whole Foods and delivery will be the focus of its grocery business in 2026.\n\nThe company plans to open over 100 Whole Foods supermarkets \"over the next few years,\" it said in the blog post. Amazon is also opening five new Whole Foods Market Daily Shop stores in 2026, offering a pared-down selection of groceries in smaller stores.\n\nAmazon is also working on expanding its grocery delivery capabilities this year, it said. The company offers delivery in 5,000 cities and towns in the US, including many where customers can get same-day delivery on perishable goods like fresh produce and ice cream.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A laid-off Amazon employee used his severance package to launch his comedy career, while working part-time in retail. He says it was worth the risk.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ricci Armani, a 33-year-old comedian based in Seattle. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn late 2022, I remember randomly telling my boyfriend, \"There might be a time when I make less money because I'm going to choose comedy over corporate.\" The next day, I got laid off from my job at Amazon, and I had to be like, \"Well, that time might be sooner than we even talked about.\"\n\nIt was terrifying, but it felt like a huge sign that I was meant to take this path to become a comedian.\n\nI had to take on a part-time retail job to pay the bills, and there are still moments where self-doubt creeps in, but if I ever have to go back to corporate America, or if I don't achieve my dream of being a nationally selling stand-up comic, I can look back and know I gave it my all.\n\nThis journey has been worth the risk.\n\nI first got hired as a contractor at Amazon in 2020 and was then brought on for a full-time role. I later started going to open mics as just a fun thing I loved doing, and gained some popularity in the Seattle area, but it was just a side hustle.\n\nAmazon gave me the opportunity to search for another internal role, but I took the layoff package. I decided I was going to throw myself fully into comedy, using my severance package to propel my career.\n\nI was absolutely terrified, and I didn't know if it was a smart move, especially since everyone had been talking about how bad the job market was. I had been working in a nearly full-time capacity since I was 16, and here I was at 30, not knowing what was next for me.\n\nIt was scary, but it also felt like a burden lifted off my shoulders when I realized I didn't need to return to the corporate rat race. I felt very empowered that I was using this moment to choose my own path.\n\nAt the time of the layoff, I think I had 2,000 followers on Instagram and none on TikTok. For stand-up comics these days, followers are the path to making money, so if I'm being honest, I felt a bit foolish for thinking, \"I'm a full-time comic now.\"\n\nHowever, I felt like if I kept at it and worked hard, something good would come of it. I believed in this path so much, and I was ready to risk everything to make it happen.\n\nI created a posting regimen for social media content, started performing locally as much as possible, and spoke with established comedians to learn from their advice. I'm very lucky that I have some amazing mentors in the comedy world who taught me that it's going to be hard, but encouraged me that I get to be my own boss and experiment.\n\nI quickly found out that performing locally wasn't going to pay the bills, so I got a retail job to supplement my income. My advice would be for other people to get a part-time job that doesn't require them to take work home.\n\nAbout six months after I was laid off, I created my live show, \"My Straight Friends,\" where a straight comedian does standup and then I quiz them on gay culture.\n\nI did a test run at a local venue, and it was so bad. I barely sold any tickets, but there was something about it that just felt right. I kept running with it, and it's what has propelled me to tour across several states.\n\nI don't think I truly started experiencing self-doubt until last year, when I realized there's some scarcity to this career path. I'm at a level where it feels so much harder to break through to the next. My income can be inconsistent, and there have been times when I've lost money putting on a show.\n\nI'm at a point where I've been going back to my roots and seeking mentorship from people who are at the place I want to be. It's so easy to be delusional in the beginning, but there are moments of creeping doubt.\n\nI'm still working on my stand-up show and working my hardest to get into some new national and international comedy festivals this year.\n\nTalk to people and seek mentorship from those who are doing what you want to do. One of the most valuable things I did after my layoff was learn from other people, rather than just fumbling in the dark, trying to figure it out myself.\n\nThe words of encouragement I would've wanted to hear at that time of my layoff are to trust myself and trust the process. I know it's so corny, but there's truth to it. Trust the process and look at what the data from the outside world is telling you. Is it showing you that this is working? If not, pivot and figure out how to make it work. Keep going and don't give up.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being laid off from Amazon? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Microsoft says its newest AI chip Maia 200 is 3 times more powerful than Google's TPU and Amazon's Trainium processor",
    "description": "The Maia 200 AI chip is described as an inference powerhouse — meaning it could lead AI models to apply their knowledge to real-world situations much faster and more efficiently.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nMicrosoft has revealed its new Maia 200 accelerator chip for artificial intelligence (AI) that is three times more powerful than hardware from rivals like Google and Amazon, company representatives say.\n\nThis newest chip will be used in AI inference rather than training, powering systems and agents used to make predictions, provide answers to queries and generate outputs based on new data that's fed to them.\n\nMaia 200 is already being deployed in Microsoft's U.S. central data center region, with the company set to use the chips to generate synthetic data and in reinforcement training to improve next-generation large language models (LLMs). The AI accelerator will also be used to power Microsoft Foundry and 365 Copilot AI, and be part of the infrastructure that the company can provide through its Azure cloud platform.\n\nThe new chip delivers performance of more than 10 petaflops (1015 floating point operations per second), Scott Guthrie, cloud and AI executive vice president at Microsoft, said in a blog post. This is a measure of performance in supercomputing, where the most powerful supercomputers in the world can reach more than 1,000 petaflops of power.\n\nThe new chip achieved this performance level in a data representation category known as \"4-bit precision (FP4)\" — a highly compressed model designed to accelerate AI performance. Maia 200 also delivers 5 PFLOPS of performance in 8-bit precision (FP8). The difference between the two is that FP4 is far more energy efficient but less accurate.\n\n\"In practical terms, one Maia 200 node can effortlessly run today’s largest models, with plenty of headroom for even bigger models in the future,\" Guthrie said in the blog post. \"This means Maia 200 delivers 3 times the FP4 performance of the third generation Amazon Trainium, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU.\"\n\nMaia 200 could potentially be used for specialist AI workloads, such as running larger LLMs in the future. So far, Microsoft's Maia chips have only been used in the Azure cloud infrastructure to run large-scale workloads for Microsoft’s own AI services, notably Copilot. However, Guthrie noted there would be \"wider customer availability in the future,\" signaling other organizations could tap into Maia 200 via the Azure cloud, or the chips could potentially one day be deployed in standalone data centers or server stacks.\n\nGuthrie said that Microsoft boasts 30% better performance per dollar over existing systems thanks to the use of the 3-nanometer process made by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the most important fabricator in the world, allowing for 100 billion transistors per chip. This essentially means that Maia 200 could be more cost-effective and efficient for the most demanding AI workloads than existing chips.\n\nMaia 200 has a few other features alongside better performance and efficiency. It includes a memory system, for instance, which can help keep an AI model’s weights and data local, meaning you would need less hardware to run a model. It's also designed to be quickly integrated into existing data centers.\n\nMaia 200 should enable AI models to run faster and more efficiently. This means Azure OpenAI users, such as scientists, developers and corporations, could see better throughput and speeds when developing AI applications and using the likes of GPT-4 in their operations.\n\n—'It won’t be so much a ghost town as a zombie apocalypse': How AI might forever change how we use the internet\n\n— GPT-4 has passed the Turing test, researchers claim\n\n—The more advanced AI models get, the better they are at deceiving us — they even know when they're being tested\n\nThis next-generation AI hardware is unlikely to disrupt everyday AI and chatbot use for most people in the short term, as Maia 200 is designed for data centers rather than consumer-grade hardware. However, end users could see the impact of Maia 200 in the form of faster response times and potentially more advanced features from Copilot and other AI tools built into Windows and Microsoft products.\n\nMaia 200 could also provide a performance boost to developers and scientists who use AI inference via Microsoft’s platforms. This, in turn, could lead to improvements in AI deployment on large-scale research projects and elements like advanced weather modeling, biological or chemical systems and compositions.",

    "description": "Microsoft announced its new Maia 200 AI chip, taking aim at Amazon, Google, and Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft (MSFT) is taking aim at cloud rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) with the debut of its next-generation custom AI chip.\n\nCalled Maia 200, the chip will run in Microsoft’s own data centers before the company eventually makes it available to its wider customer base.\n\nLike Google’s TPUs and Amazon’s Trainium processors, Microsoft’s second AI chip is meant to give the Windows maker more flexibility when it comes to how it powers its AI services. By using its own internally developed chips, the company ensures it doesn’t have to rely solely on processors developed by Nvidia (NVDA) or AMD (AMD).\n\nGoogle and Amazon have been using their own custom chips for years, while Microsoft has been slower to adopt in-house AI silicon.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the Maia 200 will be built using TSMC’s 3-nanometer process and is designed to run large-scale AI workloads, while “delivering efficient performance per dollar.”\n\nThe Maia 200 will be built into large server racks with trays housing four chips each. Microsoft is also touting how quickly it can deploy the new chips into data centers, saying chips are installed and running AI models within days of parts arriving.\n\nGetting AI servers up and running quickly is an important aspect of the broader data center business. It’s not just a matter of keeping construction costs down, either. The longer a chip goes unused, the less cash it can generate for the company by running AI apps.\n\nThe Maia 200 adds to the growing competition Nvidia is facing from both AMD and its own customers. Microsoft’s Maia 100 already powers both the company’s and OpenAI’s (OPAI.PVT) AI models, while Google and Amazon both power their respective models and Anthropic’s (ANTH.PVT) models.\n\nAnd in November, The Information reported that Meta was talking to Google about using the search giant’s TPUs in its own data centers to power its AI services. That sent Nvidia stock down at the time, as Wall Street raised fears that the company was in danger of losing market share.\n\nNvidia’s stock price is up less than 1% since the start of the year.\n\nDespite the incursions into Nvidia’s lane, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are unlikely to pose a serious threat to the AI leader. Experts say that while the cloud company’s AI chips may function well for their own services, that’s not likely to translate to smaller third-party customers as easily.\n\nNvidia’s chips are also highly coveted because they are designed to be multipurpose, allowing companies to use them for a litany of applications and services.\n\nAs for performance, the Maia 200 won’t unseat Nvidia, but Microsoft claims it outpaces both Google’s latest TPU and Amazon’s newest Trainium chip in a number of categories. The Maia 200 also packs more high-bandwidth memory than Google’s or Amazon’s offerings, which is key to running high-powered AI applications.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with William Tunstall-Pedoe, 56, a founder and CEO. Amazon's acquisition of his startup and his role at Unlikely AI have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI helped create Alexa, a product that everyone has heard of and most people have used. I'm proud of what we built.\n\nBut by 2016, it was clear that leaving Amazon, which I joined after the company acquired my startup, was the right decision. Continuing to work on Alexa would have been a very different job from building and launching startups, which I love to do.\n\nWhen I was 13, I would go to a college next to my school to use their mainframe, and since then I've been excited by computers and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with software.\n\nI studied computer science at the University of Cambridge and taught there after graduating in 1991, but I felt better suited to entrepreneurship than to academia. If you create something genuinely new in software, it can be on a billion smartphones in six months and truly change the world. That's impact.\n\nI set out to solve what I saw as a big problem. Internet search relied on users guessing keywords to get results, rather than asking natural questions like we learn to do as children. I imagined a world where you could have that same kind of conversation with computers, which led me to found True Knowledge in 2006.\n\nInitially, we tried to build a search engine that would compete with Google, which didn't work. Then, we enabled other companies to integrate our search engine into their own products — but the larger companies didn't. For a time, we focused on SEO.\n\nThe final pivot was building a voice assistant. We created an application called Evi, which launched in the UK in 2012, a year after Apple introduced Siri. We renamed the company from True Knowledge to Evi to match our product.\n\nAs a 30-person startup, we suddenly found ourselves competing with the world's most valuable company. We spent much of that year talking to major players in tech about being acquired. Later in 2012, Amazon bought our company.\n\nJoining Amazon was the right decision. The company invested heavily in the city of Cambridge, where Evi was based, and turned our startup into a major Amazon office. Our voice assistant became one of the company's biggest and most exciting secrets.\n\nMoving from running a small startup to working inside a business with hundreds of thousands of employees, with Jeff Bezos at the top, was a big change, but I loved working there. I split my time between Amazon's offices in Seattle and Cambridge, and enjoyed going back and forth, making things happen.\n\nWhen we launched Alexa, we were taken aback by the response. It was instantly successful. Today, Alexa is a household name. I'm immensely proud of the Evi team.\n\nAmazon is known for using six-page memos instead of PowerPoint presentations to promote clarity of thought. In 2016, I wrote one to help me decide if I should leave Amazon. In the memo, I laid out these facts: I'd delivered everything I could, the acquisition had been an unambiguous success, and so too had the product. At the time, thousands of people were working on Alexa.\n\nAfter about three and a half years at Amazon, in 2016, it was time to go. I wanted to re-enter the startup world.\n\nIt's certainly possible to launch something new within a big organization, and there are real advantages to doing so. When we launched Alexa, it immediately appeared on the front page of Amazon.com, a level of exposure that most startups could only dream of. I expect I'll work at a big company again at some point in my career.\n\nBut if you're trying to do something novel or contrarian, a startup is often better suited. Within a large company, all it takes is one manager deciding that resources are better spent elsewhere for a project to die. At a startup, it's the opposite. Even if 99 venture capitalists say no, you only need one investor to say yes to keep the project alive.\n\nAfter Amazon, I spent time mentoring at startup incubators such as Creative Destruction Lab. Through that, I became an active angel investor, which gave me a broad perspective of the many ways startups succeed and fail.\n\nIn 2019, I launched Unlikely AI, a deeptech startup focused on building neurosymbolic AI. The goal is to combine the powerful but sometimes incorrect machine-learning models with the world of algorithms, where computers are almost always right. The mission of the business is about making AI trustworthy and reliable.\n\nAs CEO, I'm constantly swamped. Running a startup can be stressful, but working on something truly big and ambitious is incredibly exciting.\n\nI sometimes feel nostalgic about working inside a big organization, but I love being in the startup world. For me, leaving Amazon was the right decision. I don't regret it.",

    "description": "Amazon employees respond to expected layoffs and corporate job cuts by posting memes referencing  founder Jeff Bezos' two-pizza rule.",
    "fullText": "Amazon employees are doing what Big Tech workers often do when they're anxious about layoffs: making memes.\n\nThe company is expected to cut thousands more corporate roles as soon as next week, Business Insider reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. This coming round would mark another wave of mass layoffs at Amazon in just a few months, following the roughly 14,000 jobs eliminated in October.\n\nIn the absence of official companywide communication, workers have been trying to ease tension in an internal Slack channel with more than 26,000 employees who joined by posting memes and jokes, which Business Insider viewed.\n\nThe focus of their snark? Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos' famous \"two-pizza rule,\" originally designed to keep meetings lean and productive. The rule was simple: never have a meeting so large that two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group.\n\nAs the company continues to thin its ranks, employees are using the same logic to point out just how much leaner their teams are about to become.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOne meme showed a single, thin sliver of pizza with the caption \"how we feed two pizza teams.\"\n\nAnother image featured two Amazon Web Services-branded pizza boxes, with the caption \"did someone say 2 pizza team?\" The meme is a nod to the company's cloud division, where many of the cuts are expected to land.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever been on a team that could be completely fed with just two reasonably sized pizzas until you were still hungry very frugal,\" one employee wrote in the Slack channel. \"Increasing 'span-of-control' for managers seems to be the new rage.\"\n\nOthers wondered if two Costco pizzas would be considered \"reasonably sized.\"\n\n\"I was thinking more like Domino's Large pizzas,\" another employee wrote.\n\nThe pizza jokes weren't the only coping mechanism. Employees also shared non-pizza memes.\n\nOne riffed on the rumored timing, splashing \"JANUARY 27TH\" over the scene from \"The Shining\" showing Jack Nicholson's character smashing through a door with an ax and \"AWS\" over his face.\n\nAnother meme used the \"panik/kalm\" template to mock corporate buzzwords. It shows an error message about email not working, presumably because the employee was laid off, with the words \"Mail not working (have I become Nimble?!)\", referring to CEO Andy Jassy's 2025 remarks about cutting jobs to stay nimble.\n\nOther posts leaned into the dread of the unknown: one meme laid out a checklist for employees for January 27: \"able to login,\" \"mail and Slack works,\" and \"no random HR meeting in calendar.\"\n\nAnother simply captured the vibe in all caps: \"I don't know what will happen on 27 Jan and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.\"\n\nAmazon isn't the first tech giant to see a nervous workforce poke fun at its internal culture. In 2023, Google employees flooded the company's internal message boards with memes mocking its lavish developer conference, which came months after it laid off 12,000 employees.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "For only so long can economic reality be denied in uncertain times until it becomes too obvious to continue postponing, especially when the consequences affect millions of consumers. If it feels like something fundamental has shifted at Amazon, that's because it has.\n\nFor more than three decades, Amazon has been a dependable source of fast delivery and affordable prices. But recently, a key aspect of its business has come under pressure from forces beyond its control.\n\nIn July 2025, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy downplayed concerns about tariffs during an earnings call, calling media reports about their impact on retail prices and consumption \"wrong and misreported,\" stating that it was too early to draw conclusions.\n\n\"We haven't yet seen diminishing demand, nor price is meaningfully appreciating,\" said Jassy. \"We also have such diversity of sellers in our marketplace, over 2 million sellers in total, with different strategies of whether to pass on higher cost to consumers, the customers are advantaged shopping at Amazon because they're more likely to find lower prices on the items they care about.\"\n\nHowever, six months later, Jassy's tone has shifted. Now, he is warning consumers of an unfortunate reality.\n\nIn a recent interview with CNBC, Jassy acknowledged that while consumers remain resilient and continue spending, their behavior has changed. Shoppers are actively seeking bargains, leading to slower sales of higher-priced discretionary items.\n\nAt the same time, consumers are buying more everyday essentials thanks to Amazon's continued investments in faster delivery. However, these products are necessary goods that people will keep buying even if prices rise.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of tariffs, Amazon did extensive pre-buying in early 2025, allowing it to hold prices steady longer than many competitors. With its global network of warehouses and distribution centers, the company was able to import and store goods in bulk ahead of anticipated cost increases.\n\nBut that extra supply ran out in the fall.\n\nWhile some of its third-party sellers have chosen to absorb the higher costs to maintain market share, others are passing them on to consumers, resulting in some price hikes.\n\n\"So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items,\" he said. \"Some sellers are deciding that they’re passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they'll absorb it to drive demand and some are doing something in between.\"\n\nJassy blamed U.S. tariffs as a primary driver of the price increases, as these have raised the cost of imported goods.",

    "fullText": "Jeff Bezos is setting the record straight.\n\nThe Amazon founder and executive chairman took to X on Thursday and accused the prediction platform Polymarket of fabricating a statement attributed to him.\n\n\"JUST IN: Jeff Bezos advises aspiring Gen Z entrepreneurs to start at real world jobs like McDonalds or Palantir before starting a business,\" read the Polymarket post.\n\nBezos replied: \"Nope. Not sure why polymarket made this up.\"\n\nNope. Not sure why polymarket made this up. 🤷‍♂️\n\nIt's not entirely clear where the statement came from. The Polymarket account on X frequently posts aggregated news from around the world, often without citing an original source.\n\nPolymarket did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBezos did recently speak about about the importance of real-world experience in general.\n\nIn an appearance at Italian Tech Week in November, Bezos advised young entrepreneurs to work at a company before starting their own, rather than dropping out of college like other famous founders.\n\n\"It is possible to, you know, be 18, 19, 20 years old, drop out of college, and be a great entrepreneur,\" Bezos said. \"We have famous examples of that working: Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, etcetera. But these people are the exception.\"\n\n\"I always advise to young people, you know, go work at a best practices company somewhere, where you can learn a lot of basic fundamental things,\" Bezos continued. \"There's still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it. It increases your odds, in my opinion.\"\n\nBezos also worked his first job at McDonald's while in high school, and he spoke favorably about the experience in comments that appeared in the 2012 book \"Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers That Began at McDonald's.\"\n\n\"You can learn responsibility in any job, if you take it seriously,\" Bezos said. \"You learn a lot as a teenager working at McDonald's. It's different from what you learn in school. Don't underestimate the value of that!\"\n\nElon Musk even weighed in, replying to Bezos with a reference toward President Donald Trump's famous appearance at a McDonald's during the 2024 presidential campaign, where he worked the fryer and appeared at the drive-thru window.\n\n\"Well, the President worked at McDonald's and now he's the President,\" Musk wrote.",

    "fullText": "Tariff price hikes are starting to show up in your Amazon shopping cart.\n\nThe CEO of Amazon, Andy Jassy, told CNBC in an interview with reporter Becky Quick at the World Economic Forum in Davos that vendors are running out of stockpiled goods imported ahead of Trump's tariffs, and that consumers will be \"starting to see more of that impact.\"\n\n\"So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items,\" said Jassy, \"And you see some sellers are deciding that they're passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they'll absorb it to drive demand, and some are doing something in between.\"\n\nJassy also said that though the company is striving to \"keep prices as low as possible,\" price hikes may sometimes be inevitable.\n\n\"At a certain point, because retail is, as you know, a mid-single digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it,\" Jassy added. \"You don't have endless options.\"\n\nWhile Amazon's shopping business has its own products, it mainly serves as an ecommerce platform for other independent sellers, so it cannot control price hikes. Earlier in Trump's tariff push, a rumour that Amazon would start displaying exactly how much tariffs contributed to the cost of an item drew the president's ire. Amazon said it never made such plans.\n\nIn June 2025, Jassy told CNBC in an interview that many of Amazon's third-party selling partners \"forward deployed a lot of inventory\" to avoid \"issues with the uncertainty around where tariffs are going to settle,\" adding that at that point, he did not see \"prices appreciably go up.\"\n\nThe bulk of Trump's tariffs have been enacted under presidential emergency powers, including the 10% baseline levy on almost all imports. His right to impose such duties is being reviewed by the US Supreme Court after multiple small businesses filed lawsuits.\n\nIf SCOTUS rules these tariffs unconstitutional, Scott Bessent, the Secretary of the Treasury, said in a court document that the government could be on the hook to refund $1 trillion to businesses that paid. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank, 96% of the new revenue collected by the US Customs is being paid by American consumers, while foreign exporters only shouldered 4% of the burden.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Walmart's dense network of stores and distribution centers, designed to move everyday goods quickly and cheaply, has proved difficult to replicate.\n\nNearly a decade after paying $13.7 billion for Whole Foods, Amazon still trails Walmart in everyday grocery shopping, and is now reshaping its retail infrastructure to compete head-on with Walmart's Supercenter model.\n\nEarlier this month, plans emerged for a roughly 225,000-square-foot Amazon megastore near Chicago. Bigger than a typical Walmart Supercenter, the new concept is designed to let customers buy \"fresh groceries, household essentials, and general merchandise — all in one trip,\" according to Amazon.\n\nMichael Levin and Josh Lowitz, cofounders of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, called the move \"mind-blowing\" and said \"it reveals a degree of Walmart jealousy that we didn't expect.\"\n\nThere's a lot to be jealous about. With roughly 90% of the US population estimated to live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, the company's 5,000-plus locations give it a powerful edge in selling fresh food and other perishables, along with many other everyday staples.\n\nAccording to research firm Numerator, Walmart accounted for about 21% of the US grocery market, both online and in-store, as of September. Amazon and Whole Foods, meanwhile, each held roughly 1.6% of the market.\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart is leveraging its Supercenters to deliver online orders faster, challenging Amazon at its own game.\n\nThat's fueled a surge in Walmart shares, valuing the company close to $1 trillion. The stock is up almost 150% over 5 years, far outpacing Amazon's roughly 53% gain (although Amazon is still worth more).\n\nAmazon does well with non-perishable goods and everyday essentials such as toothpaste and paper towels. Overall, it offers millions of products for same-day delivery.\n\nBut when it comes to more delicate food items, such as pears, meat, and cheese, the company knows it has more work to do.\n\nA company spokesperson said Amazon serves more than 150 million US grocery customers, offers nearly 3 million grocery and household items, and provides same-day delivery in more than 9,000 cities and towns.\n\nGrocery is an \"ever-growing\" part of its fast-delivery business, the spokesperson added, while noting that in 2025, Amazon added perishable groceries to its Same-Day Delivery service, now available in 2,300 locations, allowing customers to shop without trade-offs between speed, selection, and savings.\n\nOne element of this fresh Amazon effort is a new type of same-day delivery warehouse internally called an \"SSD Supercenter.\" SSD refers to sub-same-day deliveries, typically within four hours. Unlike traditional SSD warehouses that tend to be smaller, these facilities are designed to be larger to close the selection gap, specifically with \"Walmart\" in groceries, the document said.\n\nInternal planning documents show Amazon intended to launch at least five such sites last year. Amazon wanted to test whether customers would \"step-change their shopping habituation and engagement\" once the Supercenter warehouses went live, one of the documents stated. Amazon planned to add products not currently sold on its site to the new warehouse and take a more hands-on approach to inventory sourcing, with in-stock targets above 95%, according to the document.\n\nSub-same-day grocery delivery is still a tiny part of Amazon's business. At the end of September, it had 30 million eligible customers for this service, according to one of the internal documents obtained by Business Insider. Only 1.6 million of them, or roughly 5%, shopped through the service.\n\nAmazon's Supercenter warehouses are part of a broader push to expand same-day grocery delivery. Internal forecasts called for at least 34 US same-day grocery sites in 2025. Amazon already operates over 80 same-day facilities nationwide, though not all handle groceries, according to Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consultancy MWPVL.\n\nAmazon is also planning to take the model overseas. Under an initiative known as Project Taylor, the company plans to expand sub-same-day grocery delivery across Europe. It also plans to pilot sub-two-hour \"ultrafast\" deliveries in London in 2026, one of the documents showed.\n\nLess visible, but just as important, is a new upstream distribution layer called \"1DC.\"\n\nThese facilities store the most frequently purchased products and replenish fulfillment centers as demand emerges. That can shift weeks' worth of inventory out of space-constrained fulfillment centers and into distribution sites optimized for palletized storage and rapid transfer.\n\nOne internal document described the change as a move from a \"push\" system, in which inventory is positioned based on forecasts, to a \"pull\" system that allows fulfillment centers to draw inventory from distribution centers as needed.\n\nAmazon began rolling out the 1DC concept last year through new buildings and retrofits. By the end of 2025, the company planned to operate a dozen of these centers, capable of moving at least 20 million units a week, according to one of the documents. As of October 2025, the facilities only handled non-perishables, including shelf-stable food items, but not frozen or chilled products, the document stated.\n\nThe 1DC idea emerged after Amazon introduced one-day delivery in 2018, one of the documents stated. Longer delivery windows once allowed the company to rely on a single layer of warehouses that could ship inventory from any fulfillment center to any customer. But faster delivery promises made that model \"untenable,\" forcing Amazon toward a structure long used by traditional retailers, the document added.\n\nMWPVL's Wulfraat said Walmart pioneered the distribution-center model that stores inventory for replenishing retail locations, while Amazon built its business around fulfillment centers that ship directly to consumers. Amazon also operates a cross-dock network to resupply its fulfillment centers, he said, and the 1DC sites represent a newer, more targeted layer of that system focused on high-velocity items.\n\nAmazon's spokesperson told Business Insider that 1DC is part of a broader initiative the company previously announced to regionalize its delivery operations and reduce shipping costs.\n\nPerhaps the clearest signal of Amazon's shift is its rethinking of Whole Foods. Once positioned mainly as a premium grocer, the chain is increasingly treated as logistics infrastructure.\n\nAmazon has begun installing micro-fulfillment centers in the back of select stores, effectively turning them into local hubs for online orders.\n\nOne upgraded Whole Foods site in suburban Philadelphia, announced last year, now fulfills Amazon orders from the back of the store. The model lets shoppers buy Whole Foods-specific items while also ordering products available only on Amazon, reducing the need to shop at other retailers.\n\nAmazon expects this store to serve roughly 100,000 e-commerce units a week by consolidating deliveries from nearby stores, and forecasts online order adoption to grow to 10% by the end of 2026, according to one of the documents.\n\nThis approach also mirrors Walmart's strategy of using its stores to fulfill online orders. Walmart said last year that it can offer same-day delivery to 93% of US households through its store-fulfilled network, with about 35% of those orders arriving within three hours.\n\nThe success of Amazon's new approach depends on one of the hardest problems in logistics: perishables.\n\nInternal plans show Amazon aiming to expand its perishables distribution capacity from 2.6 billion units in 2025 to 3.3 billion units by the end of 2026. The increase would come from new distribution centers and tighter operational standards across the existing network.\n\nThe push is central to Amazon's same-day delivery strategy and its broader grocery ambitions. Company documents stress that delivering high-quality perishables quickly and reliably is essential to scaling the business.\n\nThe goal is expansive. One document calls for making perishables available to \"100% of Prime customers\" as quickly as possible.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Two successfull hedge fund managers sold Amazon and bought a spot Bitcoin ETF in the third quarter.",
    "fullText": "In the third quarter, hedge fund billionaires Philippe Laffont and Steven Schonfeld sold Amazon stock and added to their positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nWall Street expects Amazon’s earnings to grow at 19% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings look fair.\n\nMore companies and institutional investors are buying Bitcoin (or spot Bitcoin ETFs), and that is likely to continue because it is the more popular and most liquid cryptocurrency.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nIn the third quarter, two hedge fund billionaires sold Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and added to positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) managed by BlackRock that tracks the spot price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 1.4 million shares of Amazon, trimming the position 14%. He also purchased 76,100 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, more than doubling his stake.\n\nSteven Schonfeld of Schonfeld Strategic Advisors sold 253,700 shares of Amazon, reducing the position 72%. He also added 1.1 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, increasing his stake 20%.\n\nThe trades are noteworthy because Laffont and Schonfeld outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 94 percentage points and 22 percentage points, respectively, in the last three years. That makes both hedge fund managers good sources of inspiration.\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts expect Bitcoin to be far more valuable in the future. Tom Lee at Fundstrat Global Advisors says its price could hit $3 trillion in the long run, which implies more than 3,000% upside from where it currently trades at $95,000. Michael Saylor of Strategy says its price could hit $13 million by 2045, implying more than 13,500% upside.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Building on that advantage, the company has integrated artificial intelligence (AI) products and features across all three business segments to drive revenue growth and improve profit margins.\n\nIn e-commerce, Amazon has developed hundreds of generative AI applications to improve operational efficiency. They automate customer service, optimize demand forecasting, improve inventory placement, and expedite last-mile delivery. Amazon has also developed an AI model called DeepFleet that helps robots navigate warehouses more quickly.\n\nIn cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has launched new foundational models and services, such as Bedrock for generative AI application development. AWS has also introduced AI agents for coding, security, and incident monitoring, and a business intelligence platform called Quick Suite, which leans on generative AI to analyze data, surface insights, and automate workflows.",

    "description": "Tech News News: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, recently cut down her stake at the company by nearly 50% to donate to charities. A report claims .",
    "fullText": "MacKenzie Scott's ex-wife, Jeff Bezos, has donated millions to the Solidaire Network, which funds groups facing FBI and congressional investigations for alleged Hamas ties. While Scott's donations are unrestricted, the network supports organizations like Students for Justice in Palestine. Scott has given billions to various causes, impacting diversity programs and higher education. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, recently cut down her stake at the company by nearly 50% to donate to charities. A report claims that the billionaire philanthropist donated millions of dollars to a funding network that supports organisations now facing FBI and congressional investigations over alleged ties to Hamas. In 2025, Scott reportedly donated $5 million, and in 2021, $10 million, to the Solidaire Network through her charity, Yield Giving. The network describes itself as connecting social movements with donors to build systems based on love and justice.However, Solidaire Network has funded groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), according to tax records and press releases reviewed by Fortune. Both organisations are under investigation by the House and Senate for allegedly working with the terror group Hamas to organise anti-Israel protests in the United States.The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability sent a letter to AMP's executive director in May 2024 expressing concern that groups spreading pro-Hamas messages and breaking laws on college campuses may be receiving money from sources supporting Hamas or other terrorist organisations.US Senator Tom Cotton also asked the FBI in September 2025 to investigate the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), calling it hateful toward Jewish people after its leader, Aisha Nizar, urged supporters to disrupt the US F-35 fighter jet supply chain, the report noted.In a statement (shared by Fortune), Cotton said, “Nizar’s statements constitute direct incitement of violence against U.S. national security interests by advocating for actions against the men and women who build the F-35 and seeking to imperil the delivery of one of the nation’s most strategic assets.”Scott donated more than $7 billion in 2025 alone, bringing her total giving since 2020 to $26 billion across over 2,700 donations. With a net worth of about $40 billion, mostly from her divorce settlement, she ranks among the world's biggest donors alongside Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett. Most of her 2025 donations supported diversity programmes, disaster relief, and colleges.What the Solidaire Network said about MacKenzie Scott’s donationsIt's important to note that the Solidaire Network also funds other progressive groups working on racial and gender equality, climate change, and economic fairness. Scott was also just one of more than 280 people who donated to Solidaire Network in 2021.\"Funding social movements while transforming our own relationship to wealth is clearly the way to go for philanthropy. MacKenzie's generous, no-strings-attached gift honours our bold ambitions for our collective work,” the Solidaire Network noted.Around that time, Solidaire Network had just given out multimillion-dollar grants through its Black Liberation Pooled Fund, Movement Protection Fund, and Movement Infrastructure Fund.As Scott's donations have no restrictions, which means the receiving organisation can spend the money however it chooses, there's no proof that her 2021 or 2025 gifts went directly to SJP or AMP.On January 30, 2024, Solidaire Network also announced it started a Unity & Power Fund to support the “movement for a permanent ceasefire and against Islamophobia and antisemitism.” SJP and AMP mainly focus on \"Palestinian freedom\" and firm opposition to Israel.“We need more philanthropic partners to show up during these flashpoints, and we also need their longer-term support to grow and sustain our work beyond this crisis moment. We are only able to do this work because of the multi-year funding we have received through committed partners like Solidaire Network,” Stacey Krueger of Palestine Legal said in a statement.While some people have criticised Scott's donation to Solidaire Network, she's widely recognised as one of the most impactful charitable donors in recent years. She's made a real difference for diversity-focused organisations and groups working on higher education, veterans' issues, social justice, disaster relief, and climate change. For example, Scott gave $80 million to Howard University last fall, and the school said the gift came at an “opportune time” as the US government shutdown delayed annual federal money the university receives to support students, academic programs, research, and hospital operations.Scott has also said her giving was inspired by her college roommate, who lent her $1,000 so she wouldn't have to quit school, and her dentist, who gave her free dental work after seeing her use denture glue to fix a broken tooth in college.In a blog post from December 2025, Scott wrote, “Generosity and kindness engage the same pleasure centres in the brain as sex, food, and receiving gifts, and they improve our health and long-term happiness as well. The peace-fostering byproducts of one unexpected act of kindness toward a stranger of a different background or beliefs might inspire a beneficial chain reaction that goes on for years.”Sotheby's International Realty said Scott has donated an estimated $14 billion to causes, including racial equality, LGBTQ+ equality, strengthening functional democracy, and climate action. She now ranks sixth on the list of the world's top 10 philanthropists, behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. The Sotheby's list adds that Scott's gifts support nonprofit groups working against racial injustice, advancing gender equality, and backing public health programs.",

    "description": "Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a senior software engineer, explains how AI integration and prompt engineering are changing hiring in Big Tech software roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a 29-year-old senior software engineer based in Seattle. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a Big Tech employee for the past eight years, working at Google, Amazon, Splunk, and now Salesforce. I've had a front-row seat to witness the changes in the tech landscape.\n\nI've learned which skill sets software engineers need to land a job offer in the AI era. Tech companies agree that AI makes engineers more productive, so engineers are expected to use it to build things more quickly and reliably.\n\nI personally make heavy use of AI to help me with boilerplate stuff so that I can concentrate on the hard stuff, like system design and complex business logic.\n\nWhen I was interviewing for software engineering jobs in 2020, LeetCode and system design were the de facto standards for cracking a job interview. Job seekers who had an advanced understanding of data structures and algorithms would come out on top.\n\nToday, this is just the baseline expectation. AI is now widely used for coding, review, and design, so tech companies, especially startups, expect more from candidates.\n\nSome skills remain the same: Software engineers still need a problem-solving mindset and should know how to scale systems and leverage cloud services. New hires must now also understand prompt engineering — how to leverage AI to code a solution more efficiently.\n\nYou need to be able to use AI for error handling and bug fixing. AI systems integration is another important new skill that involves incorporating AI into existing workflows, scaling AI systems, and determining when to use traditional versus AI solutions for business decisions.\n\nYou're still expected to have fundamental knowledge of core system design, data structures, and algorithms. You can still expect interviewers to test your problem-solving approaches, and if you know how to make the correct tradeoffs in time and space. Interviewers still care about debugging skills, since AI makes a lot of fundamental logic errors.\n\nYou also need to be prepared for some new things. I've seen firsthand that working with AI assistants in live screen-sharing mode is now allowed in some interviews. Interviewers are looking to see if you can help them achieve their business outcomes by combining software engineering skills with AI prompting.\n\nIn an interview I had with a Silicon Valley startup in 2024, I expected the hiring team to give traditional coding challenges. I was taken aback when I was given a huge code file and asked to debug a buggy behavior, and the interviewers explicitly said I could use AI assistance.\n\nI ignored the invitation to use AI, thinking I was supposed to do it myself, and ended up spending a lot of time on the problem to no avail. I failed that interview. That was an eye-opener for me about AI's new role in this field.\n\nYou may also be asked system design questions about where AI should be integrated into the current business workflow, or to discuss the trade-offs of using AI and traditional approaches in various problem contexts.\n\nDuring my own system design interviews, I noticed companies starting to ask questions about how to integrate AI to enhance existing systems and support a particular model lifecycle in terms of infrastructure. What I've seen is that companies give access to a small codebase and expect you to deliver a small feature in about one hour, which is impossible without AI. With AI, you can roll it out easily.\n\nI've also been asked behavioral questions, like \"How do you plan to evaluate the use of AI in order to make the workflow better?\" and \"How do you plan to balance automation and manual oversight?\"\n\nFor new graduates, here's how to show hiring teams that you're equipped for the emerging needs of the software engineering role.\n\nStart by contributing to open-source projects on AI or any other GitHub project. This demonstrates that you can navigate a production codebase and work on it independently to build a new feature or fix a bug. For solo repositories, include a README that explains the rationale for your decision.\n\nIncorporate the use of AI in traditional repositories to demonstrate hands-on experience with AI integration. Don't just deploy and run it locally — try to deploy it to the cloud. Many cloud providers provide free student credits.\n\nFocus on prompting AI to drive intended outcomes more effectively by providing structured input and output. Skills like AWS or GCP cloud certifications demonstrate your ability to be a keen learner.\n\nLearn different problem-solving patterns and practice these skills regularly. Muscle memory and pattern recognition go a long way.\n\nFor experienced software engineers, your biggest asset is your deep engineering experience — here are three tips that will help you in 2026 and beyond.\n\nPairing years of engineering expertise with impressive AI skills will get the attention of hiring managers. Consider boning up on these complementary skills:\n\nSenior software engineers don't just build; they also need to strategize and innovate. Try to understand the trade-offs of relying on a third-party API versus using an open-source one and fine-tuning it for your business purposes. Questions on cost, reliability, and maintainability should always be top of mind as you develop an AI product mindset.\n\nIdentify workflows that have a great deal of manual involvement in your current job, and use AI to see if you can improve them. You can leverage AI to help you brainstorm on how to make it more efficient.\n\nBoth veteran and newbie engineers should stay curious: find out the cool technologies and AI agents available in today's market, but don't abandon fundamental engineering approaches. The hybrid understanding of these technologies is what makes you valuable.\n\nIf I were interviewing, I'd position myself as a 'hybrid engineer.' Don't just be a pure coder or just a prompt engineer. Be the bridge.",

    "title": "You Need More AWS Accounts Than You Think",
    "description": "Your lead engineer thinks 10 AWS accounts is overkill. Here's why starting clean is weeks of work, while untangling later is 6-12 months of migration pain.",
    "fullText": "\"We don't need 10+ AWS accounts. It's overkill for us—we can do this later after we launch. This will slow down product development and add unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nI've heard this pushback dozens of times. And here's the thing: the instincts behind it aren't wrong.\n\nIt can feel like over-investing in infrastructure too early. It is more accounts than most people new to AWS start with. And if you've used multi-account setups before without good tooling, they absolutely can feel cumbersome and slow.\n\nOn top of that, understanding someone else's infrastructure code is always harder than code you wrote yourself, and you don't even know the final product architecture yet—shipping the product has to be the priority.\n\nThe counterproposal usually sounds reasonable:\n\n\"We just need dev, staging, and production accounts. Anything more is unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nHere's the thing: this is correct. To operate any product on AWS, you need a minimum of one account per SDLC stage—dev, staging, production. That's the baseline.\n\nThe misunderstanding comes when you look at this holistically: what does the organization need to operate securely? There's more than your software at stake.\n\nThe \"three accounts\" view only considers the application. It ignores everything else the organization needs to function—and that's where it breaks down the moment you start asking concrete questions.\n\nIf they're centralized—and they should be for security, compliance, and tamper resistance—they can't live in dev/staging/prod. Hence an audit account.\n\nWhere does your container registry live?\n\nIf you rebuild container images per account, you're triplicating images and not running what you tested. If you promote artifacts—which you should—a shared account is the logical solution. Hence an artifacts account.\n\nIn every account? That's 3× the cost and operational overhead. If centralized, how do they securely talk to services across accounts? Hence an automation account and a transit gateway. Don't think you need self-hosted runners? Make sure you have other ways to manage Kubernetes and RDS databases on private subnets.\n\nNone of these are future-state problems—they show up fast.\n\nWhen you put it all together—answering each of those concrete questions—you end up with:\n\nThat's 9–10 accounts for a minimal level of isolation.\n\nNot because someone decided \"9–10 is the right number.\" Because each account answers a specific question that you'll have to answer anyway. The accounts aren't arbitrary—they're the natural result of thinking through where things actually need to live.\n\nDoes this seem like a lot? Consider what happens without these boundaries:\n\nThe accounts aren't bureaucracy. They're guardrails that let you move faster, not slower.\n\nHere's the thing: you can add accounts later. That's not the myth.\n\nThe myth is believing it's easy or cheap to do later. It's not.\n\nAdding accounts later requires complex migrations, scheduling and coordination across teams, and untangling months or years of decisions built on faulty assumptions—like CIDR allocations that don't support peering or future growth.\n\nSome accounts are genuinely optional. If you're never going to have self-hosted runners, skip the automation account. If you're never using AWS as a DNS registrar, skip the DNS account. No big deal.\n\nBut some decisions are foundational—and brutal to change later:\n\nThe accounts themselves might sit empty for a while. But the architectural decisions you make on day one—CIDR allocation strategy, naming conventions, network topology—those get baked in immediately.\n\nHere's the real message: unless you operate today like you'll have multiple accounts, adding more accounts later won't make a difference.\n\nYou need to instill multi-account practices now in how you architect your applications and base your assumptions. It affects everything: network CIDR allocations, naming conventions, S3 bucket naming, Terraform state storage, DNS architecture, IAM trust relationships.\n\nCreate the boundaries now. Use them as the problems present themselves. If you wait until you need them, you're not just creating accounts—you're untangling everything you built assuming they didn't exist.\n\nThere's another reason account boundaries matter that's easy to underestimate:\n\nVPCs only give you network isolation. Accounts are the only hard IAM boundary AWS gives you.\n\nIf your goal is developer autonomy—letting engineers move fast without stepping on each other—fewer accounts actually makes that harder, not easier.\n\nYou end up either doing fragile IAM gymnastics, or giving everyone administrative access—which is very hard to walk back. Clean account boundaries let devs have broad access in some places and almost none in others—especially around production and security.\n\nAnd here's the uncomfortable truth: nothing is harder to craft than IAM policies.\n\nGetting IAM right in a single-account setup where you need to simulate multi-account boundaries is exponentially more complex than just having the boundaries in the first place.\n\nThis might look like over-engineering. It's not—it's choosing where to pay the cost.\n\nHere's the key: it's only complicated if you don't have the right tooling, conventions, and a framework that ties it together.\n\nWith the right tooling (like Atmos), managing 10 accounts isn't harder than managing 3. The complexity objection assumes you're doing this manually or piecing it together yourself. A proper framework handles the multi-account orchestration for you.\n\nSimple account setups optimize for getting started. Multi-account setups optimize for not having to unlearn assumptions later.\n\nYou're not adding complexity. You're preventing it.\n\nThe complexity of multi-team access, centralized logging, artifact promotion, and network segmentation is coming whether you plan for it or not. The only question is whether you have clean boundaries when it arrives, or whether you're retrofitting them into a single-account monolith.\n\nI genuinely understand the pushback. The instinct to ship fast and avoid premature complexity is exactly right in most contexts.\n\nBut AWS account boundaries aren't premature complexity—they're deferred simplicity. The complexity exists regardless. The only question is whether you've given it clean places to live.\n\nStarting clean is weeks. Untangling later is months.\n\nIf you're navigating this conversation internally and want help making the case—or just want to talk through the tradeoffs with someone who's been there—talk to an engineer. No sales theater. Just engineers who understand both the technical reality and the organizational dynamics at play.",

    "fullText": "Silicon Valley is sending a clear message about how staff should perform, and how it wants to pay them.\n\nInstead of obsessing over punishing the bottom of the stack, Big Tech is increasingly choosing to shower rewards on the top:\n\nWhat's especially notable is how this is being driven by AI, according to Zuhayeer Musa, cofounder of Silicon Valley compensation data cruncher Levels.fyi.\n\nAs AI tools get more powerful, the value of high-leverage individuals is rising. The most prized employees today are \"player-coaches,\" people who ship work themselves while also guiding projects, mentoring peers, and shaping strategy. AI makes that hybrid role even more potent, allowing a single strong contributor to amplify their output, and their influence, without managing a large team, Musa wrote this week.\n\nThe result is a revival of the individual contributor track. You no longer have to become a full-time people manager to earn top-tier pay. At companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, senior ICs can now match (or beat) the compensation of managers simply by delivering outsized results, he noted.\n\nFor ambitious employees, the takeaway is simple: in the AI era, execution compounds. And Silicon Valley is increasingly willing to pay for it.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",
