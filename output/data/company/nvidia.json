    "fullText": "Dec 9 (Reuters) - Beijing is set to limit access to Nvidia's advanced H200 chips despite U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to allow the ​export of the technology to China, the Financial Times reported on ‌Tuesday, citing two people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nRegulators in Beijing have been discussing ways to ‌permit limited access to the H200, Nvidia's second-best generation of artificial intelligence chips, according to the report.\n\nSuch a move would add a hurdle to Nvidia and other top U.S. chipmakers' ability to address the China market, after Trump's Monday announcement appeared ⁠to settle a debate over ‌whether these companies should keep their global lead by selling AI chips to China or withhold shipments.\n\nNvidia shares, which had risen ‍as much as 2% in premarket trading, pared gains after the report and were last up about 0.6%. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for ​comment on the report.\n\nBeijing has been pushing back against domestic firms' use of ‌U.S. technology, especially Nvidia chips, as it retaliates against American restrictions.\n\nEarlier U.S. restrictions banned the sale of advanced AI processors to China, weighing on Nvidia's ability to grow in one of the world's largest markets for AI chips and development.\n\nThe export of the H200 chips will be permitted with a 25% fee levied ⁠on such sales, Trump said in a ​post on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nIpek Ozkardeskaya, senior ​analyst at Swissquote Bank, said the approval alone may have limited impact on Nvidia's business in China unless it is allowed to ‍export other chip ⁠lines such as Blackwell or Rubin.\n\nShares of AMD and Intel also pared gains and were last up about 0.3% in premarket trading. So far ⁠this year, Nvidia has gained nearly 40% compared with the S&P 500 benchmark index's 16.4% rise ‌in the same period.",

    "description": "Chris Lattner helped build the software behind Google TPUs. Now he's coming after Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, where bold technical bets abound, few bets look bolder than trying to break the grip of Nvidia's CUDA, a software stack that's quietly become the operating system of the AI boom.\n\nThat's what Modular, a startup founded by software gurus from Apple and Google, is trying to do.\n\nCofounders Chris Lattner and Tim Davis have spent decades building the software plumbing that sits beneath the modern tech industry. Lattner is famous for creating Apple's Swift programming language. He also built the software underpinning Google's TPU AI chips, with Modular cofounder Tim Davis.\n\nThey're now aiming that expertise at CUDA itself. The attempt borders on madness, but it's the kind of audacious project that could transform the AI industry.\n\n\"It's seen by a lot of people as somewhat crazy,\" said Kylan Gibbs, CEO of startup Inworld AI and a former product manager at Google DeepMind. \"That's where Chris has the advantage: He's smart enough to actually know how to do it, and somewhat crazy enough to set out to do it.\"\n\nCUDA began life almost 20 years ago as a way to make graphics chips programmable. Today, it has grown into a multilayered software ecosystem — language, libraries, compilers, inference systems — that most AI companies rely on.\n\nThat success comes at a cost: Most of the industry is now optimized around a single vendor's hardware. CUDA binds AI workloads to Nvidia GPUs. That is great for Nvidia, but deeply limiting for everyone else.\n\nOn the surface, there seems to be a ton of competition: AMD sells GPUs. Google has TPUs. Amazon created Trainium AI chips, and a host of startups are building similar hardware.\n\nThe problem is that each chip comes with its own software stack optimized just for that component. That means an endless reinvention of the wheel. Most of the time, it's simpler to just stick with CUDA — and Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nAnd yet, AI developers crave portability: Being able to use any combination of GPUs from multiple providers without juggling different software stacks.\n\n\"Nobody is building portable stuff, because why would anyone work on software for more than one chip when the chip projects themselves are doing the software?\" Lattner, Modular's CEO, told me in an interview.\n\nNvidia could extend CUDA to run well on rival AI chips. But doing so would undermine Nvidia's greatest moat: the closed-loop bond between its software and its chips. \"Obviously, they don't want portability,\" he said.\n\nFor Lattner, this paradox presents a big opportunity.\n\n\"We realized there's nobody in the industry that's actually incentivized to do this. It's very expensive, very hard,\" he said. \"And at the same time, everybody wants it.\"\n\nThat's what inspired Lattner and Davis to leave Google and start Modular in 2022, the year ChatGPT took the world by storm.\n\nSince then, Modular has raised $380 million from investors including Greylock, General Catalyst, and GV, Google's venture capital arm. The latest financing in September valued the startup at $1.6 billion. Modular isn't the only effort to break the CUDA lock-in. There has been ZLUDA, an open-source project that was funded by AMD, and more recently, the startup Spectral Compute, which has raised $6 million.\n\nLattner has used some of this money to hire talented programmers from Google, Apple, and other tech companies. They spent three years working in relative obscurity to create the building blocks of a new AI software stack.\n\nThe foundation starts with a brand-new programming language, called Mojo, that offers deep controls for making AI chips run as efficiently as possible.\n\nModular designed this to work similarly to Python, a popular and easy-to-use programming language. But Mojo also has the speed and power of other, more complex languages, such as C++, that are essential for AI development. Mojo also works well with PyTorch, an open-source framework that is often used when building AI models and applications.\n\nI first heard about Modular earlier this year when interviewing Carles Gelada, a former OpenAI researcher. \"There are several interesting projects to create GPU-agnostic frameworks and platforms, and challenge CUDA,\" he said at the time. \"Mojo is the most interesting one.\"\n\nMAX is the next major layer of Modular's new software stack. It powers AI inference, which is how models are run. This part of the system works with Nvidia GPUs, AMD GPUs, and similar chips from Apple. Modular hopes to add more AI chips in the future.\n\nOn top of that is another layer called Mammoth, which helps AI developers manage GPU clusters.\n\nIn late September, Modular announced that it got top performance out of Nvidia's new Blackwell B200 GPUs and AMD's latest MI355X GPUs — crucially on the same software platform.\n\nLattner said Modular got these AMD GPUs to perform roughly 50% better than when these chips run on AMD's own software.\n\nMore importantly, the ability to run different GPUs on the same software stack now supports the tantalizing opportunity to compare Nvidia's offerings with rival AI chips on a more level playing field.\n\n\"The obvious question is: can MI355X compete with Blackwell?\" Modular wrote in a blog announcing the results. \"Early signs point to yes.\"\n\nGibbs, the CEO of Inworld AI, has been putting Modular's software through its paces in the real world.\n\nInworld builds high-speed, real-time conversational AI technology that supports offerings from big companies, including Disney, NBCUniversal, and Niantic Labs.\n\nEarlier this year, when the startup designed a new text-to-speech AI model and got early access to Nvidia B200 GPUs, they issued Modular a challenge: Cut our costs by 60% and reduce our latency by 40% and we'll work with you.\n\n\"Within about four weeks, we were able to get this incredible performance,\" said Gibbs, who signed a partnership deal with Modular soon after. \"I've bet with my wallet.\"\n\nWhile Inworld was mostly lured by Modular's performance gains on Nvidia's latest GPUs, Gibbs likes the flexibility of using different AI chips more easily in the future, if needed.\n\n\"The promise is that we'd be able to move to new hardware,\" he said. \"Let's say AMD takes off, let's say TPUs take off for Google, or there could be other new hardware that comes online. So it's nice to have that optionality.\"\n\nIn fact, Google's TPUs are suddenly having a moment. The internet giant released a new AI model called Gemini 3 to rave reviews recently. That was trained and run using TPUs, and some other AI companies have signed deals to use these chips instead of, or alongside of, Nvidia GPUs.\n\nThat's put Nvidia on the defensive. A project like Modular, with its promise of portability across different AI hardware, adds to this pressure.\n\n\"Nvidia could kill this in a day,\" said Gibbs of the Modular project. \"Nvidia could basically say, 'okay, we don't really care that you run just on Nvidia hardware. Here's a CUDA option that runs on AMD GPUs as well.' It'd be a bit crazy for them to do that, but it's something they could do and that would of course be somewhat bad.\"\n\nFor all Lattner's critique of the industry, he says Modular is not trying to kill Nvidia. In fact, he argues that Nvidia will continue to thrive, even if Modular succeeds spectacularly.\n\n\"We're trying to build something like Android, but for AI hardware,\" he told me, referring to Google's mobile operating system that powers most of the world's smartphones.\n\nDespite billions of people using Android devices, this success didn't kill iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. iPhones still rule in the US, for example.\n\nLattner thinks something similar will happen in AI as Modular's software makes other hardware more competitive, giving developers more freedom, and chipping away at the industry's single-vendor monoculture.\n\n\"So Nvidia doesn't have to die, but we do want more competition. We do want more innovation,\" he said. \"I think that's good for the world.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Export-controlled technology worth US$30 million with fake brand labels was allegedly addressed to a facility near Toronto’s Pearson airport",
    "fullText": "A Chinese-born Canadian citizen who lives in Mississauga, Ont., was arrested in Virginia by the FBI and charged with trying to smuggle restricted high-tech Nvidia computer chips used in AI processing to China\n\nU.S. authorities seized export-controlled technology worth about $30 million that was addressed to an air freight facility in Mississauga, close to Toronto Pearson International Airport, according to allegations filed in court.\n\nNvidia labels on the components had been removed and replaced with labels for a fake company, authorities said.\n\nThe arrest of Benlin Yuan, of Mississauga, immediately west of Toronto, and the large shipment destined for Toronto are part of Operation Gatekeeper, described by U.S. authorities as targeting “a sophisticated illicit procurement conspiracy and smuggling network that orchestrates buying and exporting controlled high-tech computer chips to China.”\n\nYuan is described in U.S. prosecution documents as president of an information technology company based in Virginia that provides data centre services and IT support and consulting in Canada and the United States. The documents say it is a subsidiary of a Chinese company based in Beijing.\n\nHe was arrested in Sterling, Virginia, on Nov. 28 and charged with conspiring to violate export control acts.\n\nThe network is accused of purchasing at least US$50 million worth of GPUs from a large U.S. technology company.\n\nThe computer products Yuan is alleged to be involved in exporting are Nvidia A100, H100, and H200 Tensor Core graphic processing units, known as GPUs, and HGX baseboards. The equipment is used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications and in high-performance computing. The chips can handle huge amounts of data that is needed in AI applications, an exploding field that is revolutionizing technology.\n\nThe GPUs can perform calculations at higher speeds than most previous computers.\n\nSince about November 2023, a Chinese company has worked to import these chips from the United States, prosecutors allege. The entire plot is alleged to have involved US$160 million in tech goods.\n\nYuan is accused of joining the conspiracy this spring.\n\nIn a criminal complaint sworn by a special agent in the U.S. Department of Commerce, Yuan helped buy the technology using straw purchasers and intermediaries, meaning in the name of a person or company that is not the real end buyer.\n\nThe buyers allegedly declared the goods were for use by customers within the United States or in countries that do not require an export licence, including Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nAt various U.S. warehouses, Nvidia labels were allegedly removed from the computer circuits and relabeled with a fake manufacturing brand of SANDKYAN, according to the criminal complaint against Yuan.\n\nWhen preparing the items for export, the shipping paperwork misclassified the products as harmless and unrestricted pieces of tech: “adapters,” “adapter modules,” and “computer controllers,” authorities claim.\n\nThey were then shipped, directly or indirectly, to China.\n\nInvestigators received a tip about pallets of suspicious GPUs at a New Jersey warehouse that were addressed to companies in China.\n\nAn undercover agent was sent inside, where he spent an hour.\n\nThe agent allegedly saw two engineers who appeared to be of Chinese origin unboxing Nvidia components. One of the engineers spoke to the undercover agent in Mandarin, documents say. The engineers said they had to cover up all of the Nvidia branding on the equipment for “export purposes,” court filings allege.\n\nThe agent watched Nvidia labels being pulled off and new ones for the fake firm put in their place. The next day the agent returned and found the boxes had been resealed. The products were now labeled as having been “Made in Taiwan.”\n\nNot only were those packages addressed for shipping to Toronto, but warehouse employees told agents they recently had several similar tech exports to Canada.\n\nThe packages were removed and secured in a government warehouse. That sparked a flow of complaint calls and demand letters about the missing GPUs. The people expecting the goods believed the undercover officer had stolen the products and started negotiating to have them returned, authorities allege.\n\nThey offered $1 million to get their packages back, but insisted the equipment be inspected before payment was made.\n\nYuan is accused of organizing the “inspection.”\n\nHe is accused of recruiting and arranging the group of inspectors and of being one of the six who arrived to examine the packages, about two weeks after the seizure, court filings allege.\n\nThe inspection arrangements were allegedly planned in a group chat using an encrypted communication app and confirmed later over a video conferencing app.\n\nYuan was told by a high-level representative of the buyer in China to make sure no one said the items were destined for China, according to the criminal complaint. He is accused of helping them develop an elaborate “compliance backstory” to justify the products based on false information.\n\nThey also allegedly discussed how to make the million-dollar payment and Yuan was told to send copies of the driver’s licences of everyone on the inspection team. Three trucks were arranged for the pick up.\n\nHe is also accused of handling the storage of a different shipment of Nvidia products destined for China. A cooperating witness for U.S. prosecutors alleged that Yuan told him not to put fake labels on this one as he thought they looked suspicious; he would rather the Nvidia labels just be removed.\n\nAlexander Blanchard, a Virginia-based lawyer for Yuan, declined to comment about Yuan or the case when asked by National Post.\n\n“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said Nicholas Ganjei, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.\n\n“These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control AI technology; the country that controls AI technology will control the future.”\n\nU.S. regulation restricts the export of items that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of other nations or could be detrimental to the foreign policy or national security of the United States.\n\nAdvanced computing integrated circuits, including certain Nvidia-manufactured GPUs were added to the export restriction list in 2022. Some of the latest Nvidia chips have been classed by the U.S. as “critical technologies” that China could use to “modernize its military capabilities in ways that threaten the national security interests of the United States and its allies,” according to export regulations.\n\nThe chips require a special licence to export to China.\n\nOn Monday, the same day Operation Gatekeeper was announced, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States will allow Nvidia’s H200 processors to be exported to China with a 25 per cent fee.\n\nAlan Hao Hsu, also known as Haochun Hsu, 43, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company both pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities in October as part of Operation Gatekeeper.\n\nNewly unsealed court documents say Hsu received more than US$50 million in wire transfers from China to help fund the scheme. He is scheduled for sentencing in February.\n\nFanyue Gong, also known as Tom Gong, 43, a citizen of China who lives in Brooklyn, New York, was also charged in the probe. He is described as the owner of a New York technology company. He was arrested in New York on Dec. 3, and charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the United States.\n\nFive unnamed co-conspirators are linked to IT companies based in Hong Kong or Shenzhen, a city on the Pearl River that acts as a bridge between Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\n• Email: ahumphreys@postmedia.com | X: AD_Humphreys\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

    "fullText": "Ever heard of a chipmaker called \"SANDKYAN?\"\n\nNo? That's because it doesn't exist — it was the fake company name involved in what US authorities are saying was a \"sophisticated\" AI chip-smuggling operation.\n\nOn Monday, prosecutors announced they have arrested several parties in connection with an operation that involved smuggling Nvidia's most advanced AI chips to China and Hong Kong in violation of US export control laws.\n\nAmong those are Fanyue \"Tom\" Gong, a 43-year-old tech-company owner in New York, and Benlin Yuan, a 58-year-old Canadian executive. They were arrested on December 3 and November 28, respectively, after investigators linked them to the trafficking network, the Department of Justice said in a press release published Monday.\n\nThe Nvidia chips, known as GPUs, are used to train cutting-edge AI models and high-performance computing systems. They are tightly restricted due to their potential military applications.\n\n\"These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications,\" said US Attorney Nicholas Ganjei for the Southern District of Texas, adding that the smuggling operation threatened national security.\n\nYuan's lawyer told Business Insider he had no comment about the cases. A representative for Gong could not immediately be identified.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider that the export system is \"rigorous and comprehensive\" and that it will \"continue to work with the government and our customers to ensure that second-hand smuggling does not occur.\"\n\nIt comes as President Donald Trump on Monday announced his approval for Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China under a plan that includes a 25% payment to the US.\n\nProsecutors said the smuggling operation relied on falsified paperwork, shell companies, and covert relabeling.\n\nThe people involved purchased GPUs through straw buyers and intermediaries who claimed the hardware was destined for US customers or countries that don't require export licenses, prosecutors said.\n\nOnce the chips reached US warehouses, the DOJ said, workers under Gong's direction removed Nvidia labels and then rebranded the GPUs as \"SANDKYAN,\" a fake company name.\n\nShipping documents were also rewritten to classify the GPUs as generic computer parts, the DOJ said.\n\nThe mislabeled GPUs were then exported covertly to China, Hong Kong, and other restricted destinations, often routed through a Hong Kong logistics firm and a China-based AI company.\n\nYuan, who ran the US arm of a Beijing IT company, recruited inspectors and instructed them not to disclose the GPUs' true destination, Ganjei said.\n\nProsecutors said Yuan also helped craft false explanations when federal authorities detained certain shipments.\n\nThe arrests are part of \"Operation Gatekeeper,\" a wider crackdown that earlier led Texas businessman Alan Hao Hsu and his company to plead guilty to smuggling offenses. According to court documents unsealed on December 8, Hsu exported or attempted to export $160 million worth of Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips to China, Hong Kong, and other prohibited countries.\n\nProsecutors said they seized more than $50 million in GPUs and cash from Hsu's operation. The activity took place between October 2024 and May 2025, the DOJ said.\n\nGong and Yuan remain in custody pending further proceedings. Yuan was charged with conspiring to violate the Export Control Reform Act, while Gong was charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the US. If convicted, Yuan faces up to 20 years in prison. Gong faces up to 10 years.",

    "fullText": "Commerce department finalising deal to allow H200 chips to be sold to China as strict Biden-era restrictions relaxed\n\nDonald Trump has cleared the way for Nvidia to begin selling its powerful AI computer chips to China, marking a win for the chip maker and its CEO, Jensen Huang, who has spent months lobbying the White House to open up sales in the country.\n\nBefore Monday’s announcement, the US had prohibited sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips to China over national security concerns.\n\nTrump posted to Truth Social on Monday: “I have informed President Xi, of China, that the United States will allow NVIDIA to ship its H200 products to approved customers in China, and other Countries, under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security. President Xi responded positively!”\n\nTrump said the Department of Commerce was finalising the details and that he was planning to make the same offer to other chip companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel. Nvidia’s H200 chips are the company’s second most powerful, and far more advanced than the H20, which was originally designed as a lower-powered model for the Chinese market that would not breach restrictions, but which the US banned anyway in April.\n\nThe president said the US would receive 25% of the proceeds, more than the 15% previously agreed to with Nvidia in an earlier deal to lift restrictions, and following similar unorthodox plans for the federal government to take a financial cut from private business dealings.\n\nIn August, Trump said the US would receive a 10% stake in the tech company Intel. Some lawmakers have questioned the legality of such arrangements.\n\nAccording to the Hill, the Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andy Kim of New Jersey sent letters to the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, last week outlining their concerns over selling these chips to China and saying it risked powering the country’s “surveillance, censorship and military applications”.\n\nThey wrote: “I urge you to stop ignoring the input of bipartisan members of Congress and your own experts in order to cut deals that trade away America’s national security.”\n\nOn social media, Warren called for Huang to appear before Congress to testify under oath.\n\nHuang has worked closely with Trump since the inauguration and has made several trips to the White House. The CEO attended the president’s AI summit in July, met Trump as recently as last week and was even a guest at the White House dinner for the Saudi crown price, Mohammed bin Salman. Huang has pledged to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years.\n\nHuang has visited China several times, meeting officials and Chinese tech executives, as US bans were variously lifted and reintroduced. Earlier this year, China imposed its own controls on the imports of Nvidia chips, with top tech firms reportedly instructed to cancel orders, citing national security concerns and confidence in China’s domestic chip development.\n\nIn October, Huang said Nvidia has gone from having 95% of the Chinese market to having none, and called the bans a “strategic mistake”.\n\nSelling chips to China, the world’s second largest economy, could now mean a windfall worth billions of dollars for Nvidia, which is already valued at $4.5tn.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said: “We applaud President Trump’s decision.” He said offering the H200 chips “to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America”.\n\nThe Nvidia spokesperson and Trump said the move would support US jobs and manufacturing.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump condemned the Biden administration’s policies, which imposed strict export controls on powerful chips. The Biden administration had said withholding such technology from China bolstered US competition, protected national security and hampered AI development in China.\n\n“That Era is OVER!” Trump wrote. “My Administration will always put America FIRST.”\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry said it had noted the reports. “China has always adhered to the principle that China and the United States can achieve mutual benefit and win-win results through cooperation,” the spokesperson said.\n\nMa Jihua, a telecom industry analyst, told the state media outlet the Global Times that years of US curbs on AI exports had “provided a rare chance of China’s domestic chip industry to grow and catch up”.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia just scored a win from President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Monday, Trump said he told Chinese leader Xi Jinping that the US would allow Nvidia to sell its H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China.\n\n\"This policy will support American Jobs, strengthen US Manufacturing, and benefit American Taxpayers,\" Trump said in the post.\n\nTrump said, \"$25% will be paid to the United States of America.\" He has previously proposed having the US take a cut of chip sales to China.\n\nNvidia's stock was up in after-hours trading following Trump's announcement.\n\n\"We applaud President Trump's decision to allow America's chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America,\" a spokesperson for Nvidia said in a statement to Business Insider. \"Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.\"\n\nNvidia's powerful H200 chips have been in high demand as AI models become more powerful.\n\nWhile Nvidia was already able to sell some of its other chips to China, the US government has limited its ability to sell some powerful chips due to national security concerns. Sales of its H20 chips to China during Q3 were \"insignificant,\" CFO Colette Kress said on its latest earnings call.\n\n\"While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the US and China governments and will continue to advocate for America's ability to compete around the world,\" Kress said during the Q3 earnings call.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with Trump last week to discuss export controls on chips.\n\n\"I've said repeatedly that we support export control, that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\" Huang told reporters last week.\n\nNvidia stock was up roughly 2% after hours.",

And despite the trillions of dollars invested, AI is yet to show a way it can sustainably turn over profits.\n\nSo what happens, asks Nosheen Iqbal, if one day the faith falters, the money stops coming in and the bottom falls out?",
