    "fullText": "SHANGHAI, Dec 17 (Reuters) - MetaX Integrated Circuits jumped 700% in its Shanghai market debut as the Chinese AI chipmaker tapped into strong momentum triggered by Beijing's push to reduce reliance on chips from U.S. firms Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nFounded by former AMD executives, MetaX raised roughly $600 million in an initial public ​offering last week, days after larger rival Moore Threads debuted with a 400% pop.\n\nMetaX opened at 700 yuan a share in Shanghai versus an IPO price of ‌104.66 yuan, before surging as high as 895 yuan, defying persistent AI bubble concerns in other markets. The stock ended the trading session at 829.9 yuan, up 693%.\n\n\"It's another IPO tale in China that turns a crow into ‌a phoenix,\" said fund manager Yang Tingwu at Tongheng Investment.\n\nThe price surge \"creates huge arbitrage opportunities\" for pre-IPO investors, Yang said, and \"we're likely witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years\".\n\nMakers of artificial intelligence (AI) chips are rushing to sell shares in China to capitalise on interest generated by a government drive to boost local production in competition with the U.S.\n\n\"AI and semiconductors are key areas of competition in the Sino-U.S. tech rivalry,\" Guotai Haitong Securities said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing. \"Against the backdrop of geopolitical tension, AI chipmaking has huge growth potential,\" as China seeks to achieve self-sufficiency.\n\nResearcher ⁠Frost & Sullivan forecast China AI chip sales to top $189 billion ‌by 2029 versus $54 billion in 2026.\n\nMetaX, which makes graphics processing units (GPUs), raised 4.2 billion yuan ($596 million) last week in a share sale that was more than 4,000 times oversubscribed by retail investors.\n\nThe IPO - China's sixth biggest so far this year, according to KPMG - priced the money-losing ‍startup at 50 times its 2024 sales. That compared with a multiple of 34 for Nvidia and 14 for AMD, MetaX said in a pre-listing statement.\n\nMetaX's debut catapulted the value of the five-year-old startup to more than 300 billion yuan ($42.58 billion) and boosted the wealth of founder and major shareholder Chen Weiliang, 49.\n\nAfter working for AMD Shanghai for 13 years, Chen founded MetaX with a mission to \"contribute to China's rejuvenation ​and national prosperity.\" The founding team also included Peng Li and Yang Jian, both former AMD engineers.\n\n\"The company is a leading GPU maker in China thanks to its AMD gene,\" ‌Li Hui, analyst at Huajin Securities, said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing.",

    "fullText": "Commons committee monitoring revolving door that gave jobs to George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Tony Blair\n\nWhen the billionaire chief executive of AI chipmaker Nvidia threw a party in central London for Donald Trump’s state visit in September, the power imbalance between Silicon Valley and British politicians was vividly exposed.\n\nJensen Huang hastened to the stage after meetings at Chequers and rallied his hundreds of guests to cheer on the power of AI. In front of a huge Nvidia logo, he urged the venture capitalists before him to herald “a new industrial revolution”, announced billions of pounds in AI investments and, like Willy Wonka handing out golden tickets, singled out some lucky recipients in the room.\n\n“If you want to get rich, this is where you want to be,” he declared.\n\nBut his biggest party trick was a surprise guest waiting in the wings. At Huang’s cue, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, walked out as the crowd whooped at Huang’s pulling power.\n\nStarmer, looking slightly dazed, saluted his host’s “absolutely phenomenal” presentation, told the audience about how he had been “texting away” with Huang and effusively thanked one of the world’s richest men for his “confidence in what we are doing, in your investment, your foresight”. Huang sent him away with a gift: an inscribed AI processing unit.\n\nNot done, Huang called on to the stage Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, followed by Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for business. The parade of British cabinet ministers at this private Nvidia event spoke volumes about how successfully US tech oligarchs have pulled British politicians – serving and former – into their orbit.\n\nThis week, they landed another big fish. The $500bn Chat GPT maker Open AI hired the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne, prompting him to gush he was joining “the most exciting and promising company in the world”.\n\nHe was just the latest senior figure to pass through the revolving door between Westminster and Silicon Valley. In October, the former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals, and with Microsoft, which has invested heavily in both AI startups. Liam Booth-Smith, Sunak’s chief of staff, who sits in the House of Lords, also this summer took a senior role at Anthropic after it signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government.\n\nThey followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook. Clegg is now an AI investor who last week predicted “we will move from staring at the internet to living in the internet”. He made tens of millions of dollars at Meta. Some reports said as much as $100m. He would not confirm that but said he was paid “extremely well”.\n\nMeanwhile, Tony Blair, prime minister for a decade until 2007, is becoming increasingly influential on technology policy, lobbying successfully, through his Tony Blair Institute (TBI), for the UK to introduce a digital ID.\n\nTBI is part-funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle. A former TBI policy expert, Kirsty Innes, recently became a special adviser to Kendall.\n\nThe Commons science, innovation and technology select committee is monitoring the revolving door situation. Alex Sobel MP, a member of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which is currently investigating AI, said: “I am deeply concerned tech companies may be using their huge buying power to water down much-needed regulation by hiring those who have served at the highest level of previous governments.”\n\nJobs with the biggest US AI companies can be a good fit for frontline politicians because they also require comfort with risk-taking, said one tech company insider. Another advantage is that tech leaders do not tend to demand polished management skills. Meanwhile, their value is growing as AI companies increasingly target their products at government clients as well as businesses and consumers. Osborne’s task appears to be to wedge his foot in the door of governments to help OpenAI to inject its technology into the bloodstream of public systems. It already has government-level arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Germany, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Kazakhstan, but it wants more.\n\nSelling state-level AI is competitive. Palantir, which hosted Starmer at its Washington base in February and signed a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Defence in September, is pushing its systems into health trusts, police forces and local councils in Britain. The company’s UK communications are being led by a former head of strategic communications at Downing Street.\n\nBritain is an important place for AI firms to gain influence: regulations on AI development remain looser than in the EU, its universities foster important innovations, and the UK also has one of the world’s most respected AI safety institutes.\n\nThe revolving door also spins the other way, sending tech industry people into positions of public influence. The UK government last month appointed Raia Hadsell, the vice-president of research at Google DeepMind, as an “AI ambassador”, alongside Tom Blomfield the founder of the online bank Monzo. Blomfield is also a partner at Y Combinator, the San Francisco start-up incubator that used to be led by Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.\n\nCivil servants from the government’s digital service set up a consultancy called Public Digital, which has since won millions of pounds worth of public contracts. One of its partners, Emily Middleton, last year took a senior director general role in the government’s digital service.",

The HBM3E bandwidth advantage over MI300X is impressive but what really caught my eye is how the 126MB L2 cache almost completely offsets the cross-die latency penalty. Ran some FluidX3D variants last quarter and bandwidth-bound workloads like that absolutley benefit more from raw HBM throughput than extra L3 capacity. Dunno if this stays true for transformer inference where the attention mechanism can exploit larger caches, but for traditional HPC the B200's aproach seems optimal.Expand full commentReplyShareNo postsReady for more?",

    "description": "Google's TPU business is ramping up. Here's everything you need to know about Google's AI chips, and what they mean for Nvidia's dominance.",
    "fullText": "Google has been in the AI chip game for more than a decade. Now its custom hardware is moving markets.\n\nShares of Nvidia and other chipmakers tumbled last month following a report that Meta — one of Nvidia's largest customers — was exploring a deal to use Google's AI chips, known as Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs.\n\nGoogle has primarily used its TPUs for internal use, but it also leases them to external customers through the cloud. Nvidia, meanwhile, has become the dominant provider of AI chips with its graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nGoogle has a potential blockbuster business to unlock. In a research note sent December 2, Morgan Stanley projected that 5 million of Google's TPUs will be purchased in 2027 and about 7 million in 2028, significantly increasing its prior projections.\n\nHere's a breakdown of everything you need to know about TPUs, what they're used for, and when they might become a more prominent threat to Nvidia's chip dominance.\n\nOver a decade ago, Google needed more powerful and specialized compute power for the type of AI work it wanted to do. A team led by the now-CEO of Groq, Jonathan Ross, designed a new chip based on a specific type of integrated circuit for machine learning. The TPU was born.\n\nGoogle has continued to improve and refine its TPUs over the years, making them more effective at both training models and inference, the process where a trained model answers a question or performs a task. As large language models have grown in size, Google has also increased the memory bandwidth of later TPUs to handle these bigger workloads.\n\nGoogle says its latest \"Ironwood\" TPU, which the company is making widely available, is more than four times better than its predecessor for both training and inference.\n\nNvidia's GPU cards, which launched in 1999, were originally designed for gaming, not AI. When researchers later discovered that the chips were useful for tasks such as training neural networks, Nvidia doubled down on the AI market.\n\nGoogle's TPUs, on the other hand, were designed for AI from the get-go. Being more specialized means they're more efficient than Nvidia's chips at some tasks, and faster for running select AI models. They have something called a systolic array, which lets a more constant stream of data pass through the chip, rather than having to keep fetching more from memory.\n\nWhere Google's TPUs have a big edge is in cost at scale. It's possible to have thousands of TPUs working in tandem in a single \"pod.\" Because they are faster at some calculations than GPUs, running many TPUs at once can sometimes be more cost-efficient.\n\nThat may become more important as companies increase investments at the inference stage, which Google says its latest TPU is especially good at. That could save companies money.\n\nOne advantage that Nvidia has over Google is its CUDA software, which makes it possible for regular applications to use GPUs for general computing tasks — not just for graphics. CUDA also only works with Nvidia chips, one of the biggest points of friction stopping companies from switching to Google's chips.\n\nGoogle is trying to change that. For example, there is a lot of industry demand to have TPUs better support Pytorch, a popular tool for building AI applications that was created inside Meta. Google is allocating more resources and attention to better supporting Pytorch, which data suggests is seeing much more demand than Google's own Tensorflow software, according to Google employees and industry experts.\n\nWhen it comes to TPUs, Google remains its own biggest customer. It uses the chips across the company to power products like Search and Maps. Its latest Gemini 3 model was trained on TPUs.\n\nWhile Google has prioritized its own needs, it has leased its TPUs to other customers. Apple used TPUs to train its in-house AI model, Business Insider previously reported. In October, Anthropic announced a blockbuster deal with Google that it says will see it using up to 1 million TPUs. Broadcom, which helps build the TPU chips for Google, revealed in its Q4 earnings call this week that it has received a total of $21 billion in orders from Anthropic for Google's Ironwood TPUs.\n\nMeta is also in early testing of Google's TPUs, according to a person familiar with the matter, although it's not clear if it will result in a long-term deal.\n\nGoogle's TPU business could be poised to explode in the coming years. In a research note this month, Morgan Stanley wrote that every 500,000 TPU chips sold could potentially add around $13 billion in revenue to Google's balance sheet in 2027.\n\nHaving TPUs isn't just a potential revenue boost for Google. It also gets a feedback loop in using TPUs to run and train its AI models, learning from them, and changing how it develops its next chips to be better at the things Google needs.\n\nNvidia's GPU is still very much the chip du jour, but other tech giants are increasingly pouring resources into their own custom chips. Amazon just announced its new Trainium3 custom AI chip, which the company says can cut the cost of training and powering AI models in half compared with a GPU.\n\nMany TPU buyers are also Nvidia customers, and some industry insiders told Business Insider that it's more likely that the rise of more specialized chips will see companies and labs diversify the chips they use, rather than going all in on one provider.\n\nThat could still hurt Nvidia, which could lose pricing power as a result of a more diverse market.\n\nHowever, even if Google's TPU business finds more momentum, it doesn't mean Nvidia will suddenly crumble overnight. Jordan Nanos, member of technical staff of research firm SemiAnalysis, said his firm believes companies, including Nvidia, Google, and Amazon, will all \"sell lots\" of chips in the future.\n\n\"We don't see TPU as a significant threat to Nvidia's business, but it has been a real player in the market for many years,\" said Nanos. \"It is possible that Google sells TPU servers externally in the future, to many more customers. Right now, they are very selective.\"\n\nHave something to share? Contact this reporter via email at hlangley@businessinsider.com or Signal at hughlangley.01.

He has consistently given the same advice: Buy an index fund that tracks the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)\n\n\"In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 index fund,\" Buffett told attendees at Berkshire's annual meeting in 2021. He has suggested the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).\n\nHere's how that advice could turn $400 invested monthly into $835,000 over 30 years.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 measures the performance of the S&P 500, which tracks 500 large U.S. companies. It includes value stocks and growth stocks from all 11 stock market sectors, and covers about 80% of domestic equities and 40% of global equities by market value.\n\nThe index fund provides exposure to many of the most influential businesses in the world. The top 10 positions are listed by weight below:\n\nOne risk associated with owning an S&P 500 index fund is the extraordinary concentration of the underlying index. The top 10 companies account for 41% of the S&P 500 by market-cap weight, which means a large decline in two or three of those stocks could really drag on the entire index.\n\nHowever, the top 10 companies also account for approximately 33% of the S&P 500's earnings, so the statistic is not as alarming as many pundits make it out to be. Their price-to-earnings multiples are above average, but their strong competitive positions warrant premium valuations.\n\nThere is a simple reason Warren Buffett believes an S&P 500 index fund is the best way for the average investor to get stock market exposure: Buying individual stocks requires more work than most people are willing to take on, and beating the S&P 500 is challenging even for professional money managers.",

    "fullText": "Young tech talent hoping to land a job in the private sector has a new way in: the public sector.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration announced the launch of the United States Tech Force on Monday, a two-year program that offers participants federal government jobs and eventual recruitment opportunities for private sector roles.\n\nThe government is partnering with at least 28 tech companies on the program, including Apple, Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Dell, Box, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, Palantir, Oracle, Uber, and xAI, among others.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management is spearheading the early-career program in partnership with other agencies. Participants will be placed at agencies across the government to work on modernization projects and, in part, implement AI, according to the Tech Force website.\n\nTech Force plans to hire around 1,000 applicants to start, according to the site, and is looking for people \"highly skilled in the areas of software engineering, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data analytics, or technical project management.\"\n\nApplicants will submit an application, complete a technical assessment, have interviews with agency leaders, and undergo a background test. OPM will do the initial resume review and technical assessment before passing the hiring decisions off to individual agencies, OPM Director Scott Kupor said during a call before the announcement.\n\nPrivate sector partners can provide training resources and mentorship opportunities, and have committed to considering Tech Force participants for employment after the two years, according to the site. Kupor said on Monday's call that there will also be a speaker series featuring company CEOs. The program, he added, will end with public- and private-sector job fairs.\n\nCompanies haven't made any firm hiring commitments, Kupor said on the call.\n\n\"It wouldn't be appropriate for us to ask companies to hire people without knowing who those people are,\" Kupor said. He added that he'll \"be certainly disappointed\" if the program doesn't lead to hiring by the private-sector partners.\n\nSalaries will likely range from around $130,000 to $195,000, Kupor said. There are no specific degree or experience requirements for the positions, which will be posted on USA Jobs. Those interested are encouraged \"to apply as soon as possible\" on the site. Kupor said he hopes to get everybody hired by the end of March.\n\nThe roles are largely based in Washington, DC, and remote work options will depend on the agency and role, according to the site. They're non-partisan positions and are entirely distinct from the US DOGE Service.\n\nThough the Tech Force is primarily an early-career program, the government is also seeking \"experienced engineering managers from private sector partners,\" the site says. Companies can nominate employees, who will generally be expected to take unpaid leave or otherwise separate from their role to take the two-year position, per the site.\n\n\"They will become full-time employees of the government for the time they're here, and therefore be subject to all the various ethics rules,\" Kupor said. He added that each company will have its own policy, but expects that it will be \"easy\" for participants to return to their private-sector positions.\n\nKupor said on the call that the government plans to run the program on an annual basis and that he hopes to expand it in the years to come.\n\nAre you interested in applying to the Tech Force program?

    "description": "Jensen Huang biography author Stephen Witt explains why Google's self-developed AI model, Gemini, could pose a threat to Nvidia's AI dominance",
    "fullText": "Nvidia's (NVDA) AI turf could take a blow if Google (GOOGL, GOOG) keeps firing on all cylinders.\n\n\"The biggest risk right now obviously is Google,\" said Stephen Witt, author of \"The Thinking Machine,\" a Jensen Huang biography.\n\nThat risk, he told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid, is largely tied to Google's Gemini model. Witt described it as the \"best AI right now in the benchmarks outside the Nvidia stack.\"\n\nWitt explained that Gemini was trained entirely on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). If Google proves it can sustain world-leading AI development using only its homegrown chip stack, it sets a potent precedent for other tech giants to follow suit.\n\n\"That's a huge risk,\" Witt said. \"If Google ends up winning this AI race ... Nvidia will be in trouble.\"\n\nThis risk, coupled with competition from rivals like Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), is why \"it's very easy to imagine a world\" where Nvidia's high-flying stock declines. The AI chipmaker's shares are up over 1,270% in the past five years.\n\nTo mitigate the core risk of rivals like Google winning the chip war, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is already looking past generative AI. Witt said a significant amount of the CEO's personal effort is being poured into the next great computing wave: robotics.\n\nIf Huang can dominate the robotics wave, he said, \"that will mean several trillion dollars in market capitalization for this company.\"\n\nHowever, Nvidia has another issue: the lack of any clear succession plan.\n\n\"It's just Jensen at the top,\" Witt said. \"There's no second in command. There's no obvious successor.\" He noted that the board has been silent, and Huang has offered no advice on a succession strategy.\n\nThat suggests Nvidia's $4 trillion valuation — which accounts for over 8% of the entire S&P 500 (^GSPC) — is, in many ways, resting solely on Huang's vision.\n\nWitt described Huang as a \"world-class engineer\" who could \"design these microchips himself,\" a skill that whoever takes the helm must also possess. He noted that neither of Huang's two children, who work at the company, has a technical background, making them noncontenders for the top spot.\n\nWitt also provided a look behind the polished stage persona of Huang, known for his trademark leather jacket. Beneath the showmanship is a highly intense, \"almost totally neurotic\" leader who is driven not by optimism, but by fear.\n\n\"He's driven by negative emotions, things like fear of failure, guilt, even shame are what make Jensen get up in the morning and work so hard to make Nvidia succeed,\" Witt explained.",

    "description": "An internal memo, obtained by Business Insider, assessed Microsoft's deployment of cutting-edge GPUs.",
    "fullText": "As Nvidia works to install some of its newest chips in Microsoft data centers, an employee at the GPU giant observed in early fall that Microsoft's cooling approach at one facility seemed \"wasteful.\"\n\nNvidia has been deploying its GB200 Blackwell architecture at Microsoft and other tech giants as demand for compute to train and run AI models surges.\n\nBlackwell, announced in March 2024, is roughly twice as powerful as its predecessor, Hopper, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at launch. GB200 is part of an earlier wave of Blackwell deployments, with the GB300 generation now available.\n\nIn early fall, an internal email sent by a staffer on the Nvidia Infrastructure Specialists (NVIS) team described one Blackwell installation of server racks for OpenAI, which Microsoft supports as its cloud partner and largest investor.\n\nThe email described the setup of two GB200 NVL72 racks, each of which houses 72 Nvidia GPUs. The setup uses liquid cooling technology, given the heat generated by multiple GPUs operating closely in tandem.\n\nThe staffer wrote that Microsoft's \"cooling system and data center cooling approach for their GB200 deployment seems wasteful due to the size and lack of facility water use, but does provide a lot of flexibility and fault tolerance,\" according to the memo.\n\nWhile liquid cooling is used for the servers, data centers also use a second, building-level system to expel heat from the facility, according to Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California.\n\nThe Nvidia employee may have been referring to a building-level system that uses air-cooling instead of water, explained Ren, who studies how data centers use water and other resources.\n\n\"This type of cooling system tends to be using more energy,\" he said, \"but it doesn't use water.\"\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson described a cooling setup consistent with Ren's two-phase explanation.\n\n\"Microsoft's liquid cooling heat exchanger unit is a closed-loop system that we deploy in existing air-cooled data centers to enhance cooling capacity on first and third-party platforms,\" the Microsoft spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.\n\n\"These systems ensure we maximize our existing global data center footprint for scale while promoting efficient heat dissipation and optimizing power delivery to meet the demands of AI and hyperscale systems,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nAs AI infrastructure expands, energy and water use in data-center cooling have become flashpoints globally, prompting pushback in some regions where new facilities are being built.\n\nRen noted that because data centers can use air cooling, water cooling, or a hybrid system at the building level, \"there's a trade-off\" between resources.\n\nAir cooling requires more energy, but can \"address some of the public concerns with water consumption — because water is something people can really see,\" he said.\n\n\"These companies are profit-driven,\" he added, \"they weigh in the water cost, the energy cost, and also the publicity cost.\"\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, said it intends to be \"carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste\" by 2030.\n\n\"We've also announced a zero water cooling design for our next-generation data centers and breakthroughs in on-chip cooling,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe internal email from the Nvidia staffer described some logistical hiccups that occurred during the Blackwell installation in early fall, which can be typical in the early deployment of new data center hardware.\n\n\"Onsite support for this activity was a necessity,\" the staffer wrote. \"Many hours were spent creating the validation process documentation as well as vetting the steps worked and made sense to those less familiar with how cluster and system validation is usually performed.\"\n\nAdditionally, the handover processes between Nvidia and Microsoft \"required a lot more solidification than what was performed before arrival.\"\n\nStill, the memo suggested Blackwell's production hardware quality had improved compared to early samples.\n\nThe email said GB200 NVL72 production hardware \"has good quality\" compared to the qualified samples sent to customers for early testing. Both racks had a 100% pass rate on certain compute performance tests.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider that its Blackwell systems \"deliver exceptional performance, reliability, and energy efficiency for a wide variety of computing applications.\"\n\n\"Our customers, including Microsoft, have successfully deployed hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GB200 and GB300 NVL72 systems to meet the world's growing need for artificial intelligence,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "description": "AI spending is front and center again for investors. Oracle plunged Thursday, with top hardware makers including Nvidia and Broadcom also dropping.",
    "fullText": "Oracle just raised a fresh red flag for investors worried that tech companies are getting ahead of themselves when it comes it their massive capex spending.\n\nOracle stock plunged 14% on Thursday after the tech giant reported an earnings beat but delivered revenue that was below Wall Street estimates, posting $16.06 billion compared to $16.21 billion expected by analysts. Cloud sales rose 34% from the previous quarter but also fell short of estimates.\n\nImportantly, Oracle also pledged to spend about $15 billion more next year than previously forecast, sparking fresh concerns about aggressive capex among the biggest tech firms.\n\nThe tech titan's stock drop was enough to weigh on other AI names and drag markets lower in Thursday's session.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood at the 9:30 a.m. ET opening bell on Thursday:\n\n• Nasdaq 100: 25,563.72, down 0.8%\n\nOracle stock has been highly volatile lately, dropping almost 20% in the last month after a huge surge following a blockbuster revenue forecast issued in September.\n\nIt's flurry of deals cemented the company as an AI power player, announcing a $300 billion contract with OpenAI, new partnership commitments with both Nvidia and Meta Platforms, and plans to expand its AI and cloud computing infrastructure in booming international markets.\n\nNow Oracle's lackluster earnings are prompting speculation that its big plans in the space are going to take awhile to payoff, and that it's spending plans are too ambitious. Morgan Stanley described the results as a moment when investors might resume their disbelief about the AI trade.\n\n\"Cloud growth at the low-end of the guide with building pressure on gross margins and op margins may further sap investor confidence in ORCL's ability to execute efficiently against a large and growing book of GPUaaS business, leaving the shares lacking a clear catalyst,\" analysts at the bank wrote on Thursday.\n\nSeveral other high-growth AI stocks were pulled down by Oracle's earnings report, dragging down the entire S&P 500 index, which fell 0.31% in premarket hours, while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite index rose slightly.\n\nHere are some of the biggest losers on Thursday:\n\nFor many investors, it is likely concerning that a company like Oracle could manage to fall short of analyst estimates after doing so much to position itself as an AI infrastructure leader this year. The key takeaway is likely that the company overpromised on what it could deliver.\n\n\"Oracle faces its own mounting scrutiny over a debt-fueled data center build-out and concentration risk amid questions over the outcome of AI spending uncertainty,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne. \"This revenue miss will likely exacerbate concerns among already cautious investors about its OpenAI deal and its aggressive AI spending.\n\nThe concerns aren't limited to Oracle. While some have recently argued that the biggest AI fears may be overblown, it's possible that if one major tech player overspent on AI in 2025, others may have done the same. This could weigh on investor sentiment around AI as the market heads into 2026.",

The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for ​comment on the report.\n\nBeijing has been pushing back against domestic firms' use of ‌U.S. technology, especially Nvidia chips, as it retaliates against American restrictions.\n\nEarlier U.S. restrictions banned the sale of advanced AI processors to China, weighing on Nvidia's ability to grow in one of the world's largest markets for AI chips and development.\n\nThe export of the H200 chips will be permitted with a 25% fee levied ⁠on such sales, Trump said in a ​post on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nIpek Ozkardeskaya, senior ​analyst at Swissquote Bank, said the approval alone may have limited impact on Nvidia's business in China unless it is allowed to ‍export other chip ⁠lines such as Blackwell or Rubin.\n\nShares of AMD and Intel also pared gains and were last up about 0.3% in premarket trading. So far ⁠this year, Nvidia has gained nearly 40% compared with the S&P 500 benchmark index's 16.4% rise ‌in the same period.",

    "description": "Chris Lattner helped build the software behind Google TPUs. Now he's coming after Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, where bold technical bets abound, few bets look bolder than trying to break the grip of Nvidia's CUDA, a software stack that's quietly become the operating system of the AI boom.\n\nThat's what Modular, a startup founded by software gurus from Apple and Google, is trying to do.\n\nCofounders Chris Lattner and Tim Davis have spent decades building the software plumbing that sits beneath the modern tech industry. Lattner is famous for creating Apple's Swift programming language. He also built the software underpinning Google's TPU AI chips, with Modular cofounder Tim Davis.\n\nThey're now aiming that expertise at CUDA itself. The attempt borders on madness, but it's the kind of audacious project that could transform the AI industry.\n\n\"It's seen by a lot of people as somewhat crazy,\" said Kylan Gibbs, CEO of startup Inworld AI and a former product manager at Google DeepMind. \"That's where Chris has the advantage: He's smart enough to actually know how to do it, and somewhat crazy enough to set out to do it.\"\n\nCUDA began life almost 20 years ago as a way to make graphics chips programmable. Today, it has grown into a multilayered software ecosystem — language, libraries, compilers, inference systems — that most AI companies rely on.\n\nThat success comes at a cost: Most of the industry is now optimized around a single vendor's hardware. CUDA binds AI workloads to Nvidia GPUs. That is great for Nvidia, but deeply limiting for everyone else.\n\nOn the surface, there seems to be a ton of competition: AMD sells GPUs. Google has TPUs. Amazon created Trainium AI chips, and a host of startups are building similar hardware.\n\nThe problem is that each chip comes with its own software stack optimized just for that component. That means an endless reinvention of the wheel. Most of the time, it's simpler to just stick with CUDA — and Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nAnd yet, AI developers crave portability: Being able to use any combination of GPUs from multiple providers without juggling different software stacks.\n\n\"Nobody is building portable stuff, because why would anyone work on software for more than one chip when the chip projects themselves are doing the software?\" Lattner, Modular's CEO, told me in an interview.\n\nNvidia could extend CUDA to run well on rival AI chips. But doing so would undermine Nvidia's greatest moat: the closed-loop bond between its software and its chips. \"Obviously, they don't want portability,\" he said.\n\nFor Lattner, this paradox presents a big opportunity.\n\n\"We realized there's nobody in the industry that's actually incentivized to do this. It's very expensive, very hard,\" he said. \"And at the same time, everybody wants it.\"\n\nThat's what inspired Lattner and Davis to leave Google and start Modular in 2022, the year ChatGPT took the world by storm.\n\nSince then, Modular has raised $380 million from investors including Greylock, General Catalyst, and GV, Google's venture capital arm. The latest financing in September valued the startup at $1.6 billion. Modular isn't the only effort to break the CUDA lock-in. There has been ZLUDA, an open-source project that was funded by AMD, and more recently, the startup Spectral Compute, which has raised $6 million.\n\nLattner has used some of this money to hire talented programmers from Google, Apple, and other tech companies. They spent three years working in relative obscurity to create the building blocks of a new AI software stack.\n\nThe foundation starts with a brand-new programming language, called Mojo, that offers deep controls for making AI chips run as efficiently as possible.\n\nModular designed this to work similarly to Python, a popular and easy-to-use programming language. But Mojo also has the speed and power of other, more complex languages, such as C++, that are essential for AI development. Mojo also works well with PyTorch, an open-source framework that is often used when building AI models and applications.\n\nI first heard about Modular earlier this year when interviewing Carles Gelada, a former OpenAI researcher. \"There are several interesting projects to create GPU-agnostic frameworks and platforms, and challenge CUDA,\" he said at the time. \"Mojo is the most interesting one.\"\n\nMAX is the next major layer of Modular's new software stack. It powers AI inference, which is how models are run. This part of the system works with Nvidia GPUs, AMD GPUs, and similar chips from Apple. Modular hopes to add more AI chips in the future.\n\nOn top of that is another layer called Mammoth, which helps AI developers manage GPU clusters.\n\nIn late September, Modular announced that it got top performance out of Nvidia's new Blackwell B200 GPUs and AMD's latest MI355X GPUs — crucially on the same software platform.\n\nLattner said Modular got these AMD GPUs to perform roughly 50% better than when these chips run on AMD's own software.\n\nMore importantly, the ability to run different GPUs on the same software stack now supports the tantalizing opportunity to compare Nvidia's offerings with rival AI chips on a more level playing field.\n\n\"The obvious question is: can MI355X compete with Blackwell?\" Modular wrote in a blog announcing the results. \"Early signs point to yes.\"\n\nGibbs, the CEO of Inworld AI, has been putting Modular's software through its paces in the real world.\n\nInworld builds high-speed, real-time conversational AI technology that supports offerings from big companies, including Disney, NBCUniversal, and Niantic Labs.\n\nEarlier this year, when the startup designed a new text-to-speech AI model and got early access to Nvidia B200 GPUs, they issued Modular a challenge: Cut our costs by 60% and reduce our latency by 40% and we'll work with you.\n\n\"Within about four weeks, we were able to get this incredible performance,\" said Gibbs, who signed a partnership deal with Modular soon after. \"I've bet with my wallet.\"\n\nWhile Inworld was mostly lured by Modular's performance gains on Nvidia's latest GPUs, Gibbs likes the flexibility of using different AI chips more easily in the future, if needed.\n\n\"The promise is that we'd be able to move to new hardware,\" he said. \"Let's say AMD takes off, let's say TPUs take off for Google, or there could be other new hardware that comes online. So it's nice to have that optionality.\"\n\nIn fact, Google's TPUs are suddenly having a moment. The internet giant released a new AI model called Gemini 3 to rave reviews recently. That was trained and run using TPUs, and some other AI companies have signed deals to use these chips instead of, or alongside of, Nvidia GPUs.\n\nThat's put Nvidia on the defensive. A project like Modular, with its promise of portability across different AI hardware, adds to this pressure.\n\n\"Nvidia could kill this in a day,\" said Gibbs of the Modular project. \"Nvidia could basically say, 'okay, we don't really care that you run just on Nvidia hardware. Here's a CUDA option that runs on AMD GPUs as well.' It'd be a bit crazy for them to do that, but it's something they could do and that would of course be somewhat bad.\"\n\nFor all Lattner's critique of the industry, he says Modular is not trying to kill Nvidia. In fact, he argues that Nvidia will continue to thrive, even if Modular succeeds spectacularly.\n\n\"We're trying to build something like Android, but for AI hardware,\" he told me, referring to Google's mobile operating system that powers most of the world's smartphones.\n\nDespite billions of people using Android devices, this success didn't kill iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. iPhones still rule in the US, for example.\n\nLattner thinks something similar will happen in AI as Modular's software makes other hardware more competitive, giving developers more freedom, and chipping away at the industry's single-vendor monoculture.\n\n\"So Nvidia doesn't have to die, but we do want more competition. We do want more innovation,\" he said. \"I think that's good for the world.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Export-controlled technology worth US$30 million with fake brand labels was allegedly addressed to a facility near Toronto’s Pearson airport",
    "fullText": "A Chinese-born Canadian citizen who lives in Mississauga, Ont., was arrested in Virginia by the FBI and charged with trying to smuggle restricted high-tech Nvidia computer chips used in AI processing to China\n\nU.S. authorities seized export-controlled technology worth about $30 million that was addressed to an air freight facility in Mississauga, close to Toronto Pearson International Airport, according to allegations filed in court.\n\nNvidia labels on the components had been removed and replaced with labels for a fake company, authorities said.\n\nThe arrest of Benlin Yuan, of Mississauga, immediately west of Toronto, and the large shipment destined for Toronto are part of Operation Gatekeeper, described by U.S. authorities as targeting “a sophisticated illicit procurement conspiracy and smuggling network that orchestrates buying and exporting controlled high-tech computer chips to China.”\n\nYuan is described in U.S. prosecution documents as president of an information technology company based in Virginia that provides data centre services and IT support and consulting in Canada and the United States. The documents say it is a subsidiary of a Chinese company based in Beijing.\n\nHe was arrested in Sterling, Virginia, on Nov. 28 and charged with conspiring to violate export control acts.\n\nThe network is accused of purchasing at least US$50 million worth of GPUs from a large U.S. technology company.\n\nThe computer products Yuan is alleged to be involved in exporting are Nvidia A100, H100, and H200 Tensor Core graphic processing units, known as GPUs, and HGX baseboards. The equipment is used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications and in high-performance computing. The chips can handle huge amounts of data that is needed in AI applications, an exploding field that is revolutionizing technology.\n\nThe GPUs can perform calculations at higher speeds than most previous computers.\n\nSince about November 2023, a Chinese company has worked to import these chips from the United States, prosecutors allege. The entire plot is alleged to have involved US$160 million in tech goods.\n\nYuan is accused of joining the conspiracy this spring.\n\nIn a criminal complaint sworn by a special agent in the U.S. Department of Commerce, Yuan helped buy the technology using straw purchasers and intermediaries, meaning in the name of a person or company that is not the real end buyer.\n\nThe buyers allegedly declared the goods were for use by customers within the United States or in countries that do not require an export licence, including Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nAt various U.S. warehouses, Nvidia labels were allegedly removed from the computer circuits and relabeled with a fake manufacturing brand of SANDKYAN, according to the criminal complaint against Yuan.\n\nWhen preparing the items for export, the shipping paperwork misclassified the products as harmless and unrestricted pieces of tech: “adapters,” “adapter modules,” and “computer controllers,” authorities claim.\n\nThey were then shipped, directly or indirectly, to China.\n\nInvestigators received a tip about pallets of suspicious GPUs at a New Jersey warehouse that were addressed to companies in China.\n\nAn undercover agent was sent inside, where he spent an hour.\n\nThe agent allegedly saw two engineers who appeared to be of Chinese origin unboxing Nvidia components. One of the engineers spoke to the undercover agent in Mandarin, documents say. The engineers said they had to cover up all of the Nvidia branding on the equipment for “export purposes,” court filings allege.\n\nThe agent watched Nvidia labels being pulled off and new ones for the fake firm put in their place. The next day the agent returned and found the boxes had been resealed. The products were now labeled as having been “Made in Taiwan.”\n\nNot only were those packages addressed for shipping to Toronto, but warehouse employees told agents they recently had several similar tech exports to Canada.\n\nThe packages were removed and secured in a government warehouse. That sparked a flow of complaint calls and demand letters about the missing GPUs. The people expecting the goods believed the undercover officer had stolen the products and started negotiating to have them returned, authorities allege.\n\nThey offered $1 million to get their packages back, but insisted the equipment be inspected before payment was made.\n\nYuan is accused of organizing the “inspection.”\n\nHe is accused of recruiting and arranging the group of inspectors and of being one of the six who arrived to examine the packages, about two weeks after the seizure, court filings allege.\n\nThe inspection arrangements were allegedly planned in a group chat using an encrypted communication app and confirmed later over a video conferencing app.\n\nYuan was told by a high-level representative of the buyer in China to make sure no one said the items were destined for China, according to the criminal complaint. He is accused of helping them develop an elaborate “compliance backstory” to justify the products based on false information.\n\nThey also allegedly discussed how to make the million-dollar payment and Yuan was told to send copies of the driver’s licences of everyone on the inspection team. Three trucks were arranged for the pick up.\n\nHe is also accused of handling the storage of a different shipment of Nvidia products destined for China. A cooperating witness for U.S. prosecutors alleged that Yuan told him not to put fake labels on this one as he thought they looked suspicious; he would rather the Nvidia labels just be removed.\n\nAlexander Blanchard, a Virginia-based lawyer for Yuan, declined to comment about Yuan or the case when asked by National Post.\n\n“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said Nicholas Ganjei, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.\n\n“These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control AI technology; the country that controls AI technology will control the future.”\n\nU.S. regulation restricts the export of items that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of other nations or could be detrimental to the foreign policy or national security of the United States.\n\nAdvanced computing integrated circuits, including certain Nvidia-manufactured GPUs were added to the export restriction list in 2022. Some of the latest Nvidia chips have been classed by the U.S. as “critical technologies” that China could use to “modernize its military capabilities in ways that threaten the national security interests of the United States and its allies,” according to export regulations.\n\nThe chips require a special licence to export to China.\n\nOn Monday, the same day Operation Gatekeeper was announced, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States will allow Nvidia’s H200 processors to be exported to China with a 25 per cent fee.\n\nAlan Hao Hsu, also known as Haochun Hsu, 43, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company both pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities in October as part of Operation Gatekeeper.\n\nNewly unsealed court documents say Hsu received more than US$50 million in wire transfers from China to help fund the scheme. He is scheduled for sentencing in February.\n\nFanyue Gong, also known as Tom Gong, 43, a citizen of China who lives in Brooklyn, New York, was also charged in the probe. He is described as the owner of a New York technology company. He was arrested in New York on Dec. 3, and charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the United States.\n\nFive unnamed co-conspirators are linked to IT companies based in Hong Kong or Shenzhen, a city on the Pearl River that acts as a bridge between Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\n• Email: ahumphreys@postmedia.com | X: AD_Humphreys\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

    "fullText": "Ever heard of a chipmaker called \"SANDKYAN?\"\n\nNo? That's because it doesn't exist — it was the fake company name involved in what US authorities are saying was a \"sophisticated\" AI chip-smuggling operation.\n\nOn Monday, prosecutors announced they have arrested several parties in connection with an operation that involved smuggling Nvidia's most advanced AI chips to China and Hong Kong in violation of US export control laws.\n\nAmong those are Fanyue \"Tom\" Gong, a 43-year-old tech-company owner in New York, and Benlin Yuan, a 58-year-old Canadian executive. They were arrested on December 3 and November 28, respectively, after investigators linked them to the trafficking network, the Department of Justice said in a press release published Monday.\n\nThe Nvidia chips, known as GPUs, are used to train cutting-edge AI models and high-performance computing systems. They are tightly restricted due to their potential military applications.\n\n\"These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications,\" said US Attorney Nicholas Ganjei for the Southern District of Texas, adding that the smuggling operation threatened national security.\n\nYuan's lawyer told Business Insider he had no comment about the cases. A representative for Gong could not immediately be identified.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider that the export system is \"rigorous and comprehensive\" and that it will \"continue to work with the government and our customers to ensure that second-hand smuggling does not occur.\"\n\nIt comes as President Donald Trump on Monday announced his approval for Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China under a plan that includes a 25% payment to the US.\n\nProsecutors said the smuggling operation relied on falsified paperwork, shell companies, and covert relabeling.\n\nThe people involved purchased GPUs through straw buyers and intermediaries who claimed the hardware was destined for US customers or countries that don't require export licenses, prosecutors said.\n\nOnce the chips reached US warehouses, the DOJ said, workers under Gong's direction removed Nvidia labels and then rebranded the GPUs as \"SANDKYAN,\" a fake company name.\n\nShipping documents were also rewritten to classify the GPUs as generic computer parts, the DOJ said.\n\nThe mislabeled GPUs were then exported covertly to China, Hong Kong, and other restricted destinations, often routed through a Hong Kong logistics firm and a China-based AI company.\n\nYuan, who ran the US arm of a Beijing IT company, recruited inspectors and instructed them not to disclose the GPUs' true destination, Ganjei said.\n\nProsecutors said Yuan also helped craft false explanations when federal authorities detained certain shipments.\n\nThe arrests are part of \"Operation Gatekeeper,\" a wider crackdown that earlier led Texas businessman Alan Hao Hsu and his company to plead guilty to smuggling offenses. According to court documents unsealed on December 8, Hsu exported or attempted to export $160 million worth of Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips to China, Hong Kong, and other prohibited countries.\n\nProsecutors said they seized more than $50 million in GPUs and cash from Hsu's operation. The activity took place between October 2024 and May 2025, the DOJ said.\n\nGong and Yuan remain in custody pending further proceedings. Yuan was charged with conspiring to violate the Export Control Reform Act, while Gong was charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the US. If convicted, Yuan faces up to 20 years in prison. Gong faces up to 10 years.",

    "fullText": "Commerce department finalising deal to allow H200 chips to be sold to China as strict Biden-era restrictions relaxed\n\nDonald Trump has cleared the way for Nvidia to begin selling its powerful AI computer chips to China, marking a win for the chip maker and its CEO, Jensen Huang, who has spent months lobbying the White House to open up sales in the country.\n\nBefore Monday’s announcement, the US had prohibited sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips to China over national security concerns.\n\nTrump posted to Truth Social on Monday: “I have informed President Xi, of China, that the United States will allow NVIDIA to ship its H200 products to approved customers in China, and other Countries, under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security. President Xi responded positively!”\n\nTrump said the Department of Commerce was finalising the details and that he was planning to make the same offer to other chip companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel. Nvidia’s H200 chips are the company’s second most powerful, and far more advanced than the H20, which was originally designed as a lower-powered model for the Chinese market that would not breach restrictions, but which the US banned anyway in April.\n\nThe president said the US would receive 25% of the proceeds, more than the 15% previously agreed to with Nvidia in an earlier deal to lift restrictions, and following similar unorthodox plans for the federal government to take a financial cut from private business dealings.\n\nIn August, Trump said the US would receive a 10% stake in the tech company Intel. Some lawmakers have questioned the legality of such arrangements.\n\nAccording to the Hill, the Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andy Kim of New Jersey sent letters to the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, last week outlining their concerns over selling these chips to China and saying it risked powering the country’s “surveillance, censorship and military applications”.\n\nThey wrote: “I urge you to stop ignoring the input of bipartisan members of Congress and your own experts in order to cut deals that trade away America’s national security.”\n\nOn social media, Warren called for Huang to appear before Congress to testify under oath.\n\nHuang has worked closely with Trump since the inauguration and has made several trips to the White House. The CEO attended the president’s AI summit in July, met Trump as recently as last week and was even a guest at the White House dinner for the Saudi crown price, Mohammed bin Salman. Huang has pledged to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years.\n\nHuang has visited China several times, meeting officials and Chinese tech executives, as US bans were variously lifted and reintroduced. Earlier this year, China imposed its own controls on the imports of Nvidia chips, with top tech firms reportedly instructed to cancel orders, citing national security concerns and confidence in China’s domestic chip development.\n\nIn October, Huang said Nvidia has gone from having 95% of the Chinese market to having none, and called the bans a “strategic mistake”.\n\nSelling chips to China, the world’s second largest economy, could now mean a windfall worth billions of dollars for Nvidia, which is already valued at $4.5tn.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said: “We applaud President Trump’s decision.” He said offering the H200 chips “to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America”.\n\nThe Nvidia spokesperson and Trump said the move would support US jobs and manufacturing.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump condemned the Biden administration’s policies, which imposed strict export controls on powerful chips. The Biden administration had said withholding such technology from China bolstered US competition, protected national security and hampered AI development in China.\n\n“That Era is OVER!” Trump wrote. “My Administration will always put America FIRST.”\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry said it had noted the reports. “China has always adhered to the principle that China and the United States can achieve mutual benefit and win-win results through cooperation,” the spokesperson said.\n\nMa Jihua, a telecom industry analyst, told the state media outlet the Global Times that years of US curbs on AI exports had “provided a rare chance of China’s domestic chip industry to grow and catch up”.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia just scored a win from President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Monday, Trump said he told Chinese leader Xi Jinping that the US would allow Nvidia to sell its H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China.\n\n\"This policy will support American Jobs, strengthen US Manufacturing, and benefit American Taxpayers,\" Trump said in the post.\n\nTrump said, \"$25% will be paid to the United States of America.\" He has previously proposed having the US take a cut of chip sales to China.\n\nNvidia's stock was up in after-hours trading following Trump's announcement.\n\n\"We applaud President Trump's decision to allow America's chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America,\" a spokesperson for Nvidia said in a statement to Business Insider. \"Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.\"\n\nNvidia's powerful H200 chips have been in high demand as AI models become more powerful.\n\nWhile Nvidia was already able to sell some of its other chips to China, the US government has limited its ability to sell some powerful chips due to national security concerns. Sales of its H20 chips to China during Q3 were \"insignificant,\" CFO Colette Kress said on its latest earnings call.\n\n\"While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the US and China governments and will continue to advocate for America's ability to compete around the world,\" Kress said during the Q3 earnings call.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with Trump last week to discuss export controls on chips.\n\n\"I've said repeatedly that we support export control, that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\" Huang told reporters last week.\n\nNvidia stock was up roughly 2% after hours.",

And despite the trillions of dollars invested, AI is yet to show a way it can sustainably turn over profits.\n\nSo what happens, asks Nosheen Iqbal, if one day the faith falters, the money stops coming in and the bottom falls out?",
