    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame relayed a Warren Buffett story to warn of wasteful tech spending, and took aim at Nvidia and Palantir again.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry raised the alarm on an AI bubble in a recent Substack exchange, calling out market darlings and warning that a prolonged slump is coming.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame took aim at the tech boom in a written debate with Anthropic cofounder Jack Clark and podcaster Dwarkesh Patel.\n\nBurry cautioned that so-called hyperscalers, including Microsoft and Alphabet, are wasting huge sums on microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete, to power AI tools such as chatbots that will become commoditized.\n\nHe drew a parallel to a Baltimore department store briefly owned by Warren Buffett in the 1960s: Hochschild-Kohn.\n\n\"When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too,\" Burry wrote. \"In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out.\"\n\nWhen one of the local department stores upgraded its window displays or debuted a new cash-register system, \"the others had to follow suit,\" author Alice Schroeder wrote in \"The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life.\"\n\nBuffett and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, compared the situation to \"standing on tiptoe at a parade,\" she added. \"Once anybody did it, everybody had to do it.\"\n\nBurry wrote on Substack: \"This is why trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning. Most will not benefit, because their competitors will benefit to the same extent, and neither will have a competitive advantage because of it.\"\n\nBased on how previous capital-spending booms have played out, Burry wrote that we're now \"past the point where stocks will reward investors for further buildout, and getting into the period where the true costs and the lack of revenue will start to show themselves.\"\n\nLooking forward, he predicted that tech industry employment will \"be lower, or not much higher, because I think we are headed for a very long downturn.\"\n\nBurry shot to fame after his contrarian bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short,\" and actor Christian Bale portrayed him in the movie adaptation.\n\nHe pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack late last year. Several of his early posts have taken aim at high-flying AI stocks, warning they're overvalued and destined to tumble.\n\n\"I think the market is most wrong about the two poster children for AI: Nvidia and Palantir,\" he told Clark and Patel.\n\nThe chipmaker and data-analysis specialist are \"two of the luckiest companies\" because their products were inadvertently well-suited to AI from the get-go, he added.\n\n\"Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach,\" Burry wrote.\n\nHe also said Palantir CEO Alex Karp criticizing him for being short the stock showed he's \"not a confident CEO.\"\n\n\"He's marketing as hard as he can to keep this going, but it will slip,\" Burry added.\n\nPalantir and Nvidia didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe value investor shared three things that have surprised him about the AI boom. The first was that Google \"fumbled it and gave an opening to competitors with far less going for them,\" he said. \"Google playing catch-up to a startup in AI: that is mind-blowing.\"\n\nThe second was that ChatGPT, OpenAI's chatbot, \"kicked off a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure race.\"\n\n\"It's like someone built a prototype robot and every business in the world started investing for a robot future,\" he wrote.\n\nThe third was Nvidia's continued dominance when he expected more power-efficient chips to have taken off by now.\n\nSpeaking about AI's real-world impacts, Burry cast doubt on the idea that trade careers are an \"AI-proof choice.\"\n\n\"If I'm middle class and am facing an $800 plumber or electrician call, I might just use Claude,\" he said, referring to Anthropic's AI chatbot.\n\n\"I love that I can take a picture and figure out everything I need to do to fix it,\" he added.\n\nBurry also raised the prospect that AI chatbots will \"make people dumber,\" such as doctors who overuse them and start to forget their medical knowledge.",

The most prized employees today are \"player-coaches,\" people who ship work themselves while also guiding projects, mentoring peers, and shaping strategy. AI makes that hybrid role even more potent, allowing a single strong contributor to amplify their output, and their influence, without managing a large team, Musa wrote this week.\n\nThe result is a revival of the individual contributor track. You no longer have to become a full-time people manager to earn top-tier pay. At companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, senior ICs can now match (or beat) the compensation of managers simply by delivering outsized results, he noted.\n\nFor ambitious employees, the takeaway is simple: in the AI era, execution compounds.

    "fullText": "Progress of artificial general intelligence could stall, which may lead to a financial crash, says Yoshua Bengio, one of the ‘godfathers’ of modern AI\n\nWill the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) lead us to a land of financial plenty – or will it end in a 2008-style bust? Trillions of dollars rest on the answer.\n\nThe figures are staggering: an estimated $2.9tn (£2.2tn) being spent on datacentres, the central nervous systems of AI tools; the more than $4tn stock market capitalisation of Nvidia, the company that makes the chips powering cutting-edge AI systems; and the $100m signing-on bonuses offered by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to top engineers at OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nThese sky-high numbers are all propped up by investors who expect a return on their trillions. AGI, a theoretical state of AI where systems gain human levels of intelligence across an array of tasks and are able to replace humans in white-collar jobs such as accountancy and law, is a keystone of this financial promise.\n\nIt offers the prospect of computer systems carrying out profitable work without the associated cost of human labour – a hugely lucrative scenario for companies developing the technology and the customers who deploy it.\n\nThere will be consequences if AI companies fall short: US stock markets, boosted heavily by the performance of tech stocks, could fall and cause damage to people’s personal wealth; debt markets wrapped up in the datacentre boom could suffer a jolt that ripples elsewhere; GDP growth in the US, which has benefited from the AI infrastructure, could falter, which would have knock-on effects for interlinked economies.\n\nDavid Cahn, a partner at one leading Silicon Valley investment firm, Sequoia Capital, says tech companies now have to deliver on AGI.\n\n“Nothing short of AGI will be enough to justify the investments now being proposed for the coming decade,” he wrote in a blog published in October.\n\nIt means there is a lot hanging on progress towards advanced AI, and the trillions being poured into infrastructure and R&D to achieve it. One of the “godfathers” of modern AI, Yoshua Bengio, says the progress of AGI could stall and the outcome would be bad for investors.\n\n“There is a clear possibility that we will hit a wall, that there’s some difficulty that we don’t foresee right now, and we don’t find any solution quickly,” he says. “And that could be a real [financial] crash. A lot of the people who are putting trillions right now into AI are also expecting the advances to continue fairly regularly at the current pace.”\n\nBut Bengio, a prominent voice on the safety implications of AGI, is clear that continued progress towards a highly advanced state of AI is the more likely endgame.\n\n“Advances stalling is a minority scenario, like it’s an unlikely scenario. The more likely scenario is we continue to move forward,” he says.\n\nThe pessimistic view is that investors are backing an unrealistic outcome – that AGI will not happen without further breakthroughs.\n\nDavid Bader, the director of the institute for data science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, says trillions of dollars are being spent on scaling up – tech jargon for growing something quickly – the underlying technology for chatbots, known as transformers, in the expectation that increasing the amount of computing power behind current AI systems, by building more datacentres, will suffice.\n\n“If AGI requires a fundamentally different approach, perhaps something we haven’t yet conceived, then we’re optimising an architecture that can’t get us there no matter how large we make it. It’s like trying to reach the moon by building taller ladders,” he says.\n\nNonetheless, big US tech companies such as Google’s parent Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are ploughing ahead with datacentre plans with the financial cushion of being able to fund their AGI ambitions through the cash generated by their hugely profitable day-to-day businesses. This at least gives them some protection if the wall outlined by Bengio and Bader comes into view.\n\nBut there are other more worrying aspects to the boom. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, estimate that $2.9tn will be spent on datacentres between now and 2028, with half of that covered by the cashflow from “hyperscalers” such as Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nThe rest will have to be covered by alternative sources such as private credit, a corner of the shadow banking sector that is activating alarm bells at the Bank of England and elsewhere. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, has borrowed $29bn from the private credit market to finance a datacentre in Louisiana.\n\nAI-related sectors account for approximately 15% of investment grade debt in the US, which is even bigger than the banking sector, according to the investment bank JP Morgan.\n\nOracle, which has signed a $300bn datacentre deal with OpenAI, has had an increase in credit default swaps, which are a form of insurance on a company defaulting on its debts. High-yield, or “junk debt”, which represents the higher-risk end of the borrowing market, is also appearing in the AI sector via datacentre operators CoreWeave and TeraWulf. Growth is also being funded by asset-backed securities – a form of debt underpinned by assets such as loans or credit card debt, but in this case rent paid by tech companies to datacentre owners – in a form of financing that has risen sharply in recent years.\n\nIt is no wonder that JP Morgan says the AI infrastructure boom will require a contribution from all corners of the credit market.\n\nBader says: “If AGI doesn’t materialise on expected timelines, we could see contagion across multiple debt markets simultaneously – investment-grade bonds, high-yield junk debt, private credit and securitised products – all of which are being tapped to fund this buildout.”\n\nShare prices linked to AI and tech are also playing an outsized role in US stock markets. The so-called “magnificent 7” of US tech stocks – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia – account for more than a third of the value of the S&P 500 index, the biggest stock market index in the US, compared with 20% at the start of the decade.\n\nIn October the Bank of England warned of “the risk of a sharp correction” in US and UK markets due to giddy valuations of AI-linked tech companies. Central bankers are concerned stock markets could slump if AI fails to reach the transformative heights investors are hoping for. At the same time the International Monetary Fund said valuations were heading towards dotcom bubble-levels.\n\nEven tech execs whose companies are benefiting from the boom are acknowledging the speculative nature of the frenzy. In November Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, said there are “elements of irrationality” in the boom and that “no company is going to be immune” if the bubble bursts, while Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has said the AI industry is in a “kind of industrial bubble”, and OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, has said “there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.”\n\nAll three, to be clear, are AI optimists and expect the technology to keep improving and benefit society.\n\nBut when the numbers get this big there are obvious risks in a bubble bursting, as Pichai admits. Pension funds and anyone invested in the stock market will be affected by a share price collapse, while the debt markets will also take a hit. There is also a web of “circular” deals, such as OpenAI paying Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares. If these transactions unravel due to a lack of take-up of AI, or that wall being hit, then it could be messy.\n\nThere are also optimists who argue that generative AI, the catch-all term for tools such as chatbots and video generators, will transform whole industries and justify the expenditure. Benedict Evans, a technology analyst, says the expenditure numbers are not outrageous in the context of other industries, such as oil and gas extraction which runs at $600bn a year.\n\n“These AI capex figures are a lot of money but it’s not an impossible amount of money,” he says.\n\nEvans adds: “You don’t have to believe in AGI to believe that generative AI is a big thing. And most of what is happening here is not, ‘oh wow they’re going to create God’. It’s ‘this is going to completely change how advertising, search, software and social networks – and everything else our business is based on – is going to work’. It’s going to be a huge opportunity.”\n\nNonetheless, there is a multitrillion dollar expectation that AGI will be achieved. For many experts, the consequences of getting there are alarming. The cost of not getting there could also be significant.",

    "description": "Apple once set the bar for suppliers including TSMC. Now it's being unseated by Nvidia and AI cloud giants.",
    "fullText": "For over a decade, Apple sat at the center of the tech supply chain. Its enormous scale let it dictate pricing, lock up capacity, and steer the roadmaps of suppliers that made everything from chips and memory to substrates and packaging. That era is ending.\n\n\"Apple is no longer the gravitational center of the hardware universe,\" said Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology, who tracks the industry's supply chain.\n\n\"Apple still moves huge volumes and has unmatched brand strength. But the company is no longer the anchor client for fabs, substrate makers, or key component suppliers. That's a fundamental change.\"\n\nThis is important because the tech companies that control the supply chain are more likely to win. When you can order the largest amount of a key component, you get better pricing and a more reliable supply. That results in better-priced products that are available sooner than your rivals. This power is now shifting toward AI giants, including Nvidia and huge cloud players such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (aka \"AMG\").\n\nThe most visible sign is at TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker. It's famous for churning out cutting-edge iPhone chips, which gave Apple a huge advantage over other consumer hardware players.\n\nWhen TSMC reported results this week, it became very clear that its smartphone business is no longer its most important segment. High-performance computing — a category dominated by AI chips for companies like Nvidia and hyperscale cloud providers — now accounts for roughly 58% of TSMC's revenue, far surpassing smartphone processors.\n\nTSMC makes chips for Nvidia's AI servers, which are being snapped up in huge volumes by the cloud giants. They pack this gear into huge data centers that train and run AI models to power new services such as ChatGPT. Is that a better business than making iPhone chips?\n\nTSMC's CEO C.C. Wei answered that. He's been talking to these AI giants a lot lately. Here's what he said on this week's earnings call:\n\n\"They show me the evidence that the AI really helps their business. So they grow their business successfully and see the financial return. So I also double-checked their financial status. They are very rich.\"\n\nSuppliers go where the money is. Increasingly, the biggest Benjamins are coming from AI and cloud giants, not Apple.\n\nThis shift is rippling through the rest of the supply chain. Memory chip makers are reallocating capacity away from phones and PCs to feed AI data centers hungry for DRAM, dynamic random access memory. This is a common type of memory chip that's used in AI servers and iPhones.\n\nMemory prices have surged lately, and that's likely to push up smartphone costs and potentially squeeze margins. Nvidia has locked in long-term memory supply, leaving smartphone makers with less negotiating power.\n\n\"For the past 15 years, Apple's scale let it dictate component supply, pricing, and roadmaps,\" Gastwirth said. \"That leverage diminishes when suppliers earn higher margins and higher growth from AI customers than from smartphones.\"\n\nBottlenecks are emerging in unexpected places, too. A shortage of high-end glass cloth, a critical input for chip substrates, has suppliers prioritizing AI customers who pre-pay and sign multi-year contracts.\n\nApple, which uses these substrates across nearly all its products, is now competing with AI chipmakers for limited supply and even sending engineers to help smaller suppliers qualify alternative materials, according to a report this week from Nikkei.\n\nManufacturing partners are also re-prioritizing. Foxconn, once synonymous with iPhone assembly, now generates more revenue from AI servers than from consumer electronics. Its fastest-growing customers are hyperscalers and Nvidia, not Apple.\n\nNone of this makes Apple irrelevant. The company remains one of the world's largest buyers of components. However, in a supply chain increasingly shaped by AI, pricing, allocation, and capacity planning are being set elsewhere — and Apple is learning what it's like to be just another very large customer.\n\n\"In the 2010s, Apple set the pace for the supply chain,\" Gastwirth said. \"In the late 2020s, Nvidia, hyperscalers, and AI infrastructure now dictate pricing, allocation, and long‑term capacity planning.\"\n\nApple didn't respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang thinks privileged Gen Z grads should lower their expectations if they want success.",
    "fullText": "Orianna Rosa Royle is the Success associate editor at Fortune, overseeing careers, leadership, and company culture coverage. She was previously the senior reporter at Management Today, Britain's longest-running publication for CEOs.\n\nWe are often told that setting the bar high is key to success. After all, if you shoot for the moon and miss, at least you’ll land with the stars. But Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang wants privileged Gen Z grads to lower their expectations.\n\n“People with very high expectations have very low resilience—and unfortunately, resilience matters in success,” Huang said during an interview with the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “One of my great advantages is that I have very low expectations.”\n\nIndeed, as the billionaire boss pointed out, those at elite institutions like Stanford probably have higher expectations for their future than your average Joe.\n\nThe university is one of the most selective in the United States—it ranks third best in the country, according to the QS World University Rankings, and the few students who get picked to study there are charged more than $68,000 in tuition fees for the premium, compared to the average $38,270 per annum cost.\n\nBut, unfortunately for those saddled with student debt, not even the best universities in the world can teach you resilience.\n\n“I don’t know how to teach it to you except for I hope suffering happens to you,” Huang added.\n\nHuang’s advice for America’s next-gen elite comes from a place of experience: His life now is a world away from his childhood, which was, by his own admission, steeped in adversity.\n\nThe tech genius—who with a net worth of $155 billion is one of the world’s wealthiest people—was born in Taiwan in 1963 and spent the bulk of his early life in Thailand, before moving to the U.S. at 9 years old.\n\nHis serendipitous Stateside move came after his dad, who worked for an air conditioner manufacturer, did some training in the country and set his sights on the American Dream.\n\n“I was fortunate that I grew up with my parents providing a condition for us to be successful on the one hand,” he said. “But there were plenty of opportunities for setbacks and suffering.”\n\nOne example of Huang’s hardship was his daily high school experience: The teenager had to cross a dangerous footbridge with missing planks over a river to get to his public school in Kentucky, where he was then relentlessly tormented.\n\n“The way you described Chinese people back then was ‘Ch-nks,’ ” Huang previously told the New Yorker, adding that bullies even tried to toss him off the bridge.\n\nIn the Stanford interview, he also credited his success and work ethic with his first job at Denny’s, where he was the “best dishwasher” before getting promoted to busboy and giving that his “best” also.\n\n“I never left the station empty-handed. I never came back empty-handed. I was very efficient,” Huang added. “Anyways, eventually I became a CEO. I’m still working on being a good CEO.”\n\nCoincidentally, it was at Denny’s where he cooked up the idea for a company that specialized in computer chips to render graphics, over a Super Bird sandwich with his friends Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. The trio went on to cofound Nvidia, and the rest is history.\n\nFor those fortunate enough to never have personally experienced hardship growing up, Huang doesn’t have any advice on how to welcome more of it into your life now. But he did have some advice on embracing tough times.\n\n“I don’t know how to do it [but] for all of you Stanford students, I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering,” Huang said. “Greatness comes from character and character isn’t formed out of smart people—it’s formed out of people who suffered.”\n\nIt’s why despite Nvidia’s success—the company has a $2 trillion market cap—Huang would still welcome hardship at his organization.\n\n“To this day I use the phrase ‘pain and suffering’ inside our company with great glee,” he added. “I mean that in a happy way because you want to refine the character of your company.”\n\nEssentially, if you want your workforce to always be on their A game, don’t let them rest on their laurels.\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on March 13, 2024.",

    "description": "AI may automate tasks, but your job's purpose may be immune from AI disruption. This applies to radiology, law, coding, and even waiting tables.",
    "fullText": "Hospitals, law firms, and tech companies are getting a preview of how AI is likely to reshape work: by automating tasks without eliminating the underlying jobs.\n\nThat's the core message Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasized in a recent appearance on the No Priors podcast.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, he argued that fears of mass job destruction often confuse the \"tasks\" involved in a job with the broader \"purpose\" of the role. AI, in his view, changes how tasks get done, but the purpose remains the same. And that means, the technology probably won't destroy jobs and could even increase demand for the people responsible for outcomes at work.\n\nHuang's framing is straightforward: Most jobs contain repeatable tasks that technology can compress, and a broader purpose that remains human-led. He highlighted radiology as a real-world example.\n\nYears ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted that AI would eradicate many radiology jobs and advised students to avoid the field. The opposite happened. While AI is automating many radiology tasks, there are actually more radiologists employed now than when Hinton made his prediction in 2016.\n\nHere are the killer stats, shared in this 2025 blog post that describes why radiologists are still in huge demand: In 2025, American diagnostic radiology residency programs offered a record 1,208 positions, a 4% increase from 2024, and the field's vacancy rates are at all-time highs. Also, in 2025, radiology was the second-highest-paid medical specialty in the country, with an average income of $520,000, over 48% percent higher than the average radiologist salary in 2015 (the year before Hinton's prediction).\n\nHow did this happen? Huang argued that the job's purpose isn't \"reading scans.\" Those are tasks that AI has automated. The true purpose of a radiologist is to diagnose disease, guide treatment, and support those efforts with research. When AI helps clinicians evaluate more images with higher confidence, hospitals can serve more patients, generate more revenue, and justify hiring more specialists.\n\nThe same logic, he said, applies across the economy.\n\n\"I spend most of my day typing,\" Huang noted, describing typing as a task, not his job's purpose. Tools that automate writing don't eliminate the need for executives; they often expand the amount of work leaders and other employees can take on, he said.\n\n\"The fact that somebody could use AI to automate a lot of my typing — I really appreciate that, and it helps a lot,\" he said. \"It hasn't really made me, if you will, less busy. In a lot of ways, I become more busy because I'm able to do more work.\"\n\nThis \"task versus purpose\" framework is increasingly visible in knowledge work, where AI tools are speeding up and automating tasks such as drafting, summarizing, and generating code.\n\nHuang pointed to software engineering as a case where AI can reduce time spent on a core task (writing code) while raising demand for the job's purpose: solving problems and identifying new ones worth solving.\n\nNvidia, he said, is hiring aggressively even as AI coding tools such as Cursor spread through the company's engineering teams, because productivity gains allow companies to pursue more ideas. That can boost revenue, leaving more money to hire new staff.\n\nLaw is another example he cited. Reading and drafting contracts are tasks, while the purpose of a lawyer is to protect clients and resolve disputes. AI can accelerate document-heavy work, but the role's true value relies on judgment, strategy, and accountability — and you need experienced, trustworthy human attorneys for that.\n\nThis even applies to waiters working in a restaurant. Their task is taking food orders, but their purpose is to ensure guests have a great time, Huang said.\n\n\"If some AI is taking the order or even delivering the food, their job is still helping us have a great experience,\" the CEO added. \"They would reshape their jobs accordingly.\"\n\nHuang's argument isn't that AI won't disrupt roles — it will. But he contends the early evidence points less toward a wholesale collapse of employment and more toward job redesign.\n\nFor workers, the implication is pragmatic: if your role is defined primarily by a repeatable task, AI is a direct threat. If it's anchored in outcomes — diagnosis, customer experience, problem-solving, conflict resolution — AI may be less a replacement than a lever, changing what you spend time on while keeping your job's purpose intact.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia's (NVDA) China business continues to face geopolitical hurdles, which could pose longer-term competitive risks for the AI chipmaker.\n\nOngoing US-China tensions have upended Nvidia’s sales in what was one of its largest markets. In the company’s most recent quarter, revenue from China, which includes Hong Kong, dropped 45% from a year ago to about $3 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nAnd while the Trump administration green-lighted the sale of Nvidia’s H200 chip to China this week, albeit with a 25% tax, Reuters reported that China is barring imports of the GPUs except in special cases.\n\nSo far, Nvidia's dominant position in the chip market doesn't appear to have suffered much after the company initially lost access to the Chinese AI market in 2025. It became the first company with a $5 trillion valuation last fall. Despite a decline in China sales, its third quarter revenue overall soared more than 60% during the period to about $57 billion.\n\nBut over the long term, the Chinese commercial sector’s development and use of domestic chips could narrow Nvidia’s lead on the global stage, Wall Street analysts told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThey said Nvidia's dominance in AI software could suffer if Chinese tech developers begin making advances in open source alternatives, which would hurt its leadership in hardware as well.\n\n“That's the real nightmare scenario,” Seaport analyst Jay Goldberg said.\n\nMuch of Nvidia’s competitive edge comes from its software stack. Developers using its AI systems rely on the company’s CUDA platform, which includes a library of proprietary tools that lets them program its GPUs efficiently and reinforces the company’s dominance in the chip market.\n\nAs companies build on CUDA, the cost of switching to a new software platform becomes disadvantageous, and they end up sticking with Nvidia’s offerings, which are only available if developers are programming on Nvidia's GPUs. Hence, the preference for Nvidia's software is key to maintaining its lead in the hardware space.\n\nWhile China’s chip suppliers — from tech giants Huawei and Alibaba (BABA) to newly public players such as Moore Threads and MetaX — lag Nvidia in the performance capabilities of their chips, there’s a risk that the country’s AI developers, forced to use those inferior, domestically-produced chips, will build their own open-source software. Open-source AI software is typically written to run on many different types of chips.",

    "fullText": "The order follows a nine-month investigation and includes broad exemptions for datacenters and consumers\n\nDonald Trump on Wednesday imposed a 25% tariff on certain AI chips, such as the Nvidia H200 AI processor ​and a similar semiconductor from AMD called the MI325X, under a new national security order released by the White House.\n\nThe proclamation follows a nine-month investigation under ‌section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and targets a number of high-end semiconductors meeting certain performance benchmarks and devices containing them for import duties. The action is part of a broader effort to create incentives for chipmakers to produce more semiconductors in the US and decrease reliance on chip manufacturers in places such as Taiwan.\n\n“The United States currently fully manufactures only approximately 10 percent of the chips it requires, making it heavily reliant on foreign supply chains,” the proclamation said, adding that the reliance was a “significant economic and national ‌security risk”.\n\nThe White House said in a fact sheet that the tariffs would be narrowly focused and would not apply ​to chips and derivative devices imported for US datacenters – a huge consumer of AI chips – startups, non-datacenter consumer applications, non-datacenter civil industrial applications and US public sector applications.\n\nHoward Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, has broad discretion to apply further exemptions, according to the proclamation.\n\nShares of Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm traded slightly lower in after-hours trading.\n\nTrump ‍in December said he would slap tariffs on Chinese semiconductor imports over Beijing’s “unreasonable” pursuit of chip industry dominance, but delayed the action until June 2027.\n\nThat move followed a year-long “Section 301” unfair trade practices investigation into China’s exports of “legacy”, or older-technology chips to the US, launched by former president Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nQuestions had swirled about the universe of products containing chips that would be ⁠hit by the tariffs, the tariff rates, and whether any countries, products or companies would be exempt. Wednesday’s announcement, coupled with the news from December, suggests a ‍light touch from the administration on chip imports, for now.\n\nTrump last year announced he would allow Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China in exchange for a cut of the sales of ‌those chips. Legal ‌experts questioned whether such an arrangement would violate the US constitution’s ban on taxing exports.\n\nThe Trump administration this week required that China-bound chips make a detour from Taiwan, where they are made, through the United States for testing by a third-party lab. When the chips enter the United States, they are subject to the 25% tariff announced on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“We comply with all US export control laws and policies,” AMD said in a statement.\n\nTrump has deployed an ⁠array of tariffs aimed at bolstering ⁠US manufacturing, announcing in September sweeping ​new import tariffs, including 100% duties on branded drugs and 25% levies on heavy-duty trucks, triggering fresh trade uncertainty after a period of relative calm.\n\nIn April, the Trump administration announced investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of an effort to impose tariffs on them, arguing that extensive reliance on their foreign production poses a national security threat.\n\nWhile US companies ‍like Nvidia, AMD and Intel design many of the most widely used chips, most are made overseas, many by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the Semiconductor Industry Association also could not immediately be reached.\n\nTrump, in the near future, may also impose broader tariffs on imports of semiconductors and their derivative products to incentivize domestic manufacturing, according ​to the fact sheet.\n\nAn annex to the order clarifies that any 25% tariff imposed on semiconductors ‍under the order would not be stacked on top of the other tariffs imposed by the Trump administration under other section 232 orders. They would be exempt from duties on copper, aluminum and steel, auto ​and truck parts.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia has added high-profile names to its senior leadership and technical ranks over the past year, as the chipmaker reaches new levels of visibility and wealth.\n\nNvidia's latest major hire is its first chief marketing officer, Alison Wagonfeld, a veteran of Google Cloud. Over the past year, the company has also acqui-hired senior software leaders through startup deals, tapping its balance sheet to supercharge growth. It has also sought talent from outside the tech industry, including hires from government and academia.\n\nTaken together, they underscore Nvidia's position as an AI chip designer expanding its software products, with added cybersecurity and marketing muscle to engage governments and large enterprise customers, alongside software and research executives to build the programs that run on its hallmark GPUs.\n\nWhile 2024 saw the departure of key leaders, such as Keith Strier, Nvidia's former vice president of worldwide AI initiatives, and enterprise computing executive Manuvir Das, turnover at the top was more limited in 2025.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nKristin Major joined Nvidia as senior vice president of human resources last February, after spending over 13 years at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where she held roles across the company's legal and HR departments. At Nvidia, Major serves on CEO Jensen Huang's executive leadership team, according to the executive search firm ON Partners.\n\nJiantao Jiao announced he was joining Nvidia in June. He works on AI post-training, evaluation, agents, and building better infrastructure, with the aim of fostering collaboration between academia and industry. Previously, he was the CEO and cofounder of Nexusflow AI, and he is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nMark Weatherford serves as Nvidia's head of cybersecurity policy and strategic engagement. Prior to joining Nvidia, he held several roles across the public and private sectors, including serving as the nation's first deputy undersecretary for cybersecurity at the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration.\n\nRochan Sankar, the founder and CEO of AI startup Enfabrica, is joining Nvidia through a $900 million acqui-hire in September that also saw the chip giant license his startup's technology. Other employees at Enfabrica — which builds systems to cluster GPUs together for large AI workloads — also joined Nvidia as part of the deal.\n\nKrysta Svore joined Nvidia in November after nearly 20 years at Microsoft, where she served as VP of advanced quantum development. At Nvidia, she'll \"lead applied research and engineering across the quantum stack,\" according to a LinkedIn post.\n\nLate last year, Nvidia acquired Danny Auble's startup SchedMD, which creates the open-source workload management software Slurm. Nvidia said it will keep Slurm open-source and continue to invest in the software. Auble serves as Nvidia's senior director of system software.\n\nNvidia hired Groq founder Jonathan Ross and COO Sunny Madra in December, following a $20 billion deal to license its inferencing technology. The deal signaled a significant shift in the AI market from training to inference. Groq said in a press release that while some team members would join Nvidia, the company will continue to operate independently.\n\nAlison Wagonfeld, who served as Google Cloud's head of marketing for roughly a decade, joined Nvidia in January as its first-ever CMO. In \"moving from one AI leader to another,\" Wagonfeld wrote on LinkedIn that she would join Huang's leadership team and head up marketing and communications at the company through \"its next phase of growth.\"\n\nDieter Fox, Nvidia's former senior director of robotics research, left the company in June after roughly eight years to join Ai2, a nonprofit AI research institute. At the institute, Fox works on foundation models for robotics.\n\nMinwoo Park, a vice president at Nvidia who worked on autonomous vehicle research, left the company this month to join Hyundai. At the automaker, Park will serve as head of the advanced vehicle platform division and CEO of its self-driving arm, 42dot, working on software-defined vehicles and autonomous driving software.\n\nNvidia lost two board members in 2025. Ellen Ochoa, a veteran astronaut who served on the nominating and corporate governance committee, left for personal reasons in July, while Rob Burgess, a longtime tech executive, died in December.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Advanced Micro Devices' products are cheaper than Nvidia's.\n\nNvidia's supply problems could open the door for AMD.\n\nAMD expects huge data center growth over the next five years.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\n\nThe trillion-dollar stock club is a fairly exclusive group. There have only been 10 U.S.-listed stocks that have breached this valuation level, and there are a few more within striking distance.\n\nHowever, one stock that's a bit far away is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). AMD has a market cap of $330 billion, so it may not be on investors' radar for crossing into the $1 trillion valuation range. However, AMD's hardware is starting to become more popular in the artificial intelligence (AI) world, and it may get there faster than many think.\n\nHow quickly can AMD reach $1 trillion? Well, if its projections come true, it could be there in as little as four years.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the undisputed king of graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are well-suited for AI workloads, as they can process multiple calculations in parallel. At the start of the AI boom in 2023, Nvidia's GPUs, the controlling software, and other hardware that supports them were far superior to AMD's. As a result, Nvidia's products became the go-to option, while AMD's only became an alternative.\n\nHowever, those trends are shifting. AMD has made massive improvements in its control software, ROCm. It noted a 10 times increase in downloads year over year in November 2025. That's a big deal because it shows that developers are exploring their hardware. This could be a signal that AMD's products are starting to become a viable alternative, and may be ready to steal some market share away from Nvidia.\n\nThere is only so much money available to build data centers. Computing hardware can be nearly half of the cost to build them, and while Nvidia's products are the best, they aren't cheap.\n\nThere aren't readily available prices on flagship GPUs for data centers, and these numbers are estimates from reports. Nvidia's Blackwell B200 GPU can cost between $30,000 and $50,000 per chip, depending on options. Its AMD rival, the MI350, costs $25,000. This allows AI hyperscalers to get more bang for the buck for cloud GPUs, but it remains to be seen if this cheaper price tag is worth it from a performance side.\n\nHowever, AI hyperscalers may not have a choice on whether they want to use AMD's chips anymore. During Nvidia's Q3 results, the company announced that it was \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. While this may sound like a good problem to have, the bigger issue is that customers may turn to AMD's products as an alternative if they cannot get the computing power that they need from Nvidia. If AMD's products can deliver similar results at a lower price tag, this could create a scenario where more clients choose AMD's hardware in the future.",

    "fullText": "On Wednesday, Donald Trump moved ahead with a new 25% tariff on imports of some high-end computing chips, narrowly targeting hardware central to the AI boom while carving out exemptions meant to encourage more tech manufacturing in the US.\n\nAccording to a White House fact sheet, the tariff applies to \"certain advanced computing chips,\" including Nvidia's H200 processor and AMD's MI325X. Chips brought into the country to support the buildout of the US technology supply chain would be excluded, though the administration has not detailed how companies would qualify for that exemption.\n\nThe proclamation also targets \"imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products from any country.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.\n\nThe administration also signaled the move could be a first step. The Trump administration may expand tariffs to a wider range of semiconductors and related products in the future, according to the White House fact sheet.\n\nTrump cited national security concerns and invoked Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, per the White House fact sheet, which allows presidents to impose trade restrictions after determining imports pose a security risk.\n\nThe tariff aligns with Trump's broader agenda to reshore advanced manufacturing get stay ahead of the AI race. Nvidia, whose chips power the bulk of the data centers behind AI services, has been a focal point of that plan. Trump has previously said the company would be allowed to sell certain advanced chips to China, especially the H200, under the condition that the US government gets 25% of the proceeds.\n\nAMD and Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comments.\n\nThe tariff is not Trump's first attempt to use exemptions as a form of leverage. Last year, he floated tariffs as high as 100% on chips and semiconductors, while suggesting companies investing in US production could avoid them.",

    "description": "The tariffs will allow President Trump to take a cut of Nvidia’s chip sales to China while putting off a decision about imposing higher taxes on the chip industry.",
    "fullText": "President Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday to impose a 25 percent tariff on a narrow list of foreign semiconductors, providing a way for the government to earn revenue off the sale of lucrative chips used in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe tariff, which would take effect Thursday, is far more limited than what the president initially threatened. Last year, the administration began an investigation aimed at encouraging tech companies and chip makers to buy semiconductors made in America. But instead of approving sweeping tariffs that would affect the industry, Wednesday’s announcement showed the administration has settled for narrower levies that allow it to take a cut of artificial intelligence chips sold to China.\n\nA document released by the White House said a 25 percent tariff would be put on A.I. chips made by companies like Nvidia and AMD that are imported into the United States and then re-exported to other countries. The tariff would not apply to semiconductors that are brought into the country to be used domestically in data centers or in products for American consumers, industry or the government. But it would allow the U.S. government to collect revenue from the sale of A.I. chips to China, an idea Mr. Trump proposed last year.\n\nThe president may still impose broader tariffs on semiconductor imports and products containing them in the near future, the White House said, including a program that would provide tariff relief for companies that manufacture chips domestically.\n\nFor now, though, the arrangement will very likely be welcomed by major chip companies that have lobbied fiercely to limit the scope of any tariffs. Most chip companies manufacture the bulk of their products in Taiwan or East Asia, where many of the world’s electronics are made, and ship them into the United States only if they are to be used domestically.\n\nMr. Trump threatened last August to impose a 100 percent tariff on foreign semiconductors unless manufacturers committed to invest in the United States. But chip tariffs had the potential to rankle foreign governments, as well as many of the tech companies that have grown close with the president. The administration has been particularly cautious of disrupting a trade truce that it reached last year with China, a major manufacturer of semiconductors.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday avoided any such impacts, while also allowing Mr. Trump to realize his plans to take a 25 percent cut of the revenue that Nvidia, the A.I. chip giant, will make from selling advanced chips to China.\n\nMr. Trump first floated the plan in August but was forbidden by U.S. law to tax exports or export licenses. So administration officials proposed a circuitous solution where they would bring Nvidia chips manufactured in Asia into the United States and impose a 25 percent tariff on the imported chip, before re-exporting the products to China.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Commerce issued a rule to permit the sale of a more advanced A.I. chip made by Nvidia, the H200, to China. Mr. Trump had banned the sale of those chips last year out of national security concerns, but abruptly reversed himself after Nvidia argued that exporting the chips was important for American global technology leadership. Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, has become one of Mr. Trump’s closest allies in the tech world.\n\nMr. Trump started the chips inquiry under a national security-related law known as Section 232, which he has used to apply tariffs to other sectors, including a 50 percent tariff on all steel imports and a 25 percent tariff on all imported cars.\n\nThe White House also said Wednesday that it had concluded a Section 232 investigation into critical minerals, including lithium, gallium, germanium, cobalt and nickel. An executive order said the administration would refrain from putting tariffs on the sector for now.\n\nInstead, the order directed officials to negotiate trade agreements that would provide the United States more access to critical minerals, which are used in things ranging from cars to airplanes to A.I. data centers. The United States is heavily reliant on other countries — including China — for those minerals.\n\nSome analysts have questioned whether the Trump administration is backing away from heftier tariffs amid rising concerns among Americans about affordability. High prices were a key issue that helped propel Democrats to electoral wins in November. In an economic speech on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called affordability a “fake word by Democrats” but also detailed various steps his administration had taken to lower prices.\n\nBecause semiconductors are in almost everything with an on-off switch, chip companies had warned the administration that more expansive tariffs could lead to widespread price increases across the American economy.\n\nOthers have told the administration that a 25 percent surcharge on the machinery they need to manufacture chips, which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, would make semiconductor factories in the United States unviable.\n\nLast year, the United States imported roughly $45 billion in semiconductor chips, primarily from Taiwan and Malaysia, according to Bernstein Research.\n\nMr. Trump had said companies that have committed to building in the United States wouldn’t pay tariffs, and Commerce Department employees have been working on an arrangement that would offer tariff exemptions to companies that invest domestically. Last year, the chief executives of Apple, Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, pledged more than $1 trillion in U.S. investments as they sought to avoid fees.\n\nSemiconductor companies have been forced to accept uncertainty under Mr. Trump. Since returning to office, he has threatened to take away government grants, restricted chip sales to China, demanded investments and recommended that one company, Intel, fire its chief executive.\n\nThe intrusions have paralyzed an industry that less than a year earlier signed contracts with the Biden administration to release tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to build factories. Mr. Trump immediately put the industry on edge by criticizing those programs as wasteful, and had his staff ask firms for more investments before releasing the money.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has also seemed attuned to the concerns of tech C.E.O.s, particularly Mr. Huang and Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook. In April, the administration gave the technology industry a lucrative carve-out from its global tariffs, saying electronics would soon be subject to other tariffs under Section 232. No other industry has received such a broad exemption.",

    "description": "A \"nasty\" 15% sell-off could hit crowded trades this spring, says Tom Sosnoff.",
    "fullText": "The hottest AI trade on Wall Street has officially become \"boring.\"\n\n\"Nvidia would be a very boring idea ... because we all know the story,\" serial entrepreneur Tom Sosnoff told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nThe former founder of Thinkorswim and Tastytrade argued that despite Nvidia's technological dominance, the stock's story is too well-known and it may be priced for perfection.\n\nSosnoff isn't a tech skeptic. In fact, he's a fan of the product. He likened Nvidia's (NVDA) AI platforms to having a \"genius best friend\" with a 165 IQ available at all times.\n\nThe problem, he argued, is that Nvidia is now \"totally fully priced.\" When most analysts and retail traders are already on one side of the boat, that \"boring\" reality suggests there are very few surprise scenarios that can drive the price significantly higher from here.\n\n\"I look at Nvidia and I'm thinking to myself, how much more upside [is] in here and what kind of downside is there if this thing rolls over?\" Sosnoff said. \"It's not a function of ... Nvidia itself. It's just a function of price.\"\n\nThe warning comes at a time when market volatility is hovering at multi-year lows and stocks are sitting at record levels. In the past year, Nvidia's shares have risen roughly 40%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) recently closed at all-time highs this month.\n\nSosnoff isn't predicting a total market collapse, but he's bracing for a reality check. He anticipates a \"nasty sell-off\" in the range of 10% to 15% potentially hitting between March and May.\n\n\"The odds favor the downside in the market,\" said Sosnoff. He noted that while the equity market is partying, the bond market has remained eerily stagnant. If that volatility returns, the \"fully priced\" darlings like Nvidia are often the first to feel the gravity. Moreover, market fickleness could materialize when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\nAnother provocative take is that Nvidia's reign as the world's most valuable company is under threat. When asked if the AI giant would still have its crown at the end of the year, Sosnoff was skeptical.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be Nvidia,\" he said regarding the market cap race. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has recently edged out Apple (AAPL) to become the second-most-valuable company in the world, and it's within striking distance of Nvidia as it surges past $4 trillion.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said Nvidia is \"simply the purest play\" for an investor to bet against the AI boom.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says he's betting against Nvidia instead of Meta, Alphabet, or Microsoft because the chipmaker is particularly vulnerable to the AI boom ending in disaster.\n\nNvidia is \"simply the purest play,\" Burry wrote in a Substack post last weekend. The company has become \"entirely dependent on hyperscaler spending, and I do not see how that math works,\" he continued.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing online late last year, added that Nvidia is likely to \"sell $400 billion of its chips this year and there are less than $100 billion in application layer use cases.\"\n\n\"Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,\" Burry wrote. \"So shorting it is cheap.\"\n\nBurry also name-checked CoreWeave, a provider of cloud services built for AI and a strategic partner of Nvidia, calling it the graphics-processor giant's \"pet.\"\n\nNvidia's stock price has surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, making the graphics-chip maker the world's most valuable public company with a $4.5 trillion market capitalization.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBurry said that betting against Meta would mean he was \"also shorting its social media/advertising dominance,\" and placing a wager against Alphabet would mean he was \"shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc.\"\n\nHe added that being short Microsoft would be tantamount to \"shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,\" referring to the company's software-as-a-service tools, including Word and Excel.\n\nThose Big Tech titans aren't \"pure shorts on AI\" and have staying power, Burry wrote.\n\n\"They will realize they should not be spending so much, write off assets, and possibly restate earnings,\" he said. \"But they still are dominant companies globally away from the AI buildout.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Burry said he would short OpenAI if it were a public company. He highlighted the ChatGPT maker's $500 billion valuation in October, which exceeds the market values of Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, and Costco.\n\nBurry said he owns bearish put options on Oracle, and directly shorted the database company in the last six months.\n\n\"I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making,\" he wrote, adding that the company, cofounded by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, is making unnecessary, inexplicable moves and \"ego\" might be the driver.\n\nBurry is famous for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, an episode of his career that was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short.\"\n\nHe wrote on Substack that \"technological obsolescence is on the menu as Nvidia now seems to introduce a new chip solution every year or less.\"\n\nThat echoed a previous post in which he said Nvidia's Big Tech customers were overstating the lifespan of its chips to drag out their depreciation and flatter their short-term profits, raising the prospect of future writedowns.\n\nBurry also warned of trouble ahead, saying he's betting against AI stocks to \"have the exposure on the right side when the music stops.\"\n\nBurry spoke about AI more broadly in his post, drawing a parallel between its rise and the history of electricity.\n\nHe pointed out that building power plants and grids in the late 1980s and early 1990s required \"massive upfront capital outlays,\" technological advances meant equipment such as transformers became quickly outdated and assets rapidly depreciated, and \"cutthroat price warfare\" between suppliers meant many ran into financial difficulties and were forced to merge with rivals.\n\n\"What I see in electrification is very similar to what happened during the 2000 data transmission bubble and what I see happening with the AI bubble,\" he wrote.\n\nBurry said that electricity was as transformative to the modern world as a medicine that enables a patient to walk 10 feet, whereas AI \"might be the anabolic steroid that allows superhuman feats of strength and ability,\" but could ultimately prove \"more dangerous than anything.\"\n\nHe also repeated his caution that if the US tries to win the AI race by going all-in on increasingly power-hungry chips, it will lose as China is ramping up its power-generation capacity much more quickly.\n\n\"I see a big inventory problem in the AI buildout as a result of the current power generation setup,\" Burry said.",

    "fullText": "After Apple chose Gemini to power Siri, Alphabet surpassed Apple to become second-most valuable company in world\n\nGoogle’s parent company hit a major financial milestone on Monday, reaching a $4tn valuation for the first time and surpassing Apple to become the second-most valuable company in the world.\n\nAlphabet is the fourth company to hit the $4tn milestone after Nvidia, which later hit $5tn, Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe spike in share price comes after Apple announced it had chosen Google’s Gemini AI model to power a major overhaul of the iPhone maker’s digital assistant Siri, which comes installed in every iPhone. Neither company disclosed how much the deal was worth.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,” Apple said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nAs tech stocks continue a years-long meteoric rise, fears of a bubble in the stock market persist; however, Wall Street’s excitement for new avenues of investment in AI does as well. Alphabet’s milestones signal a remarkable change in investor sentiment for Alphabet, with its stock surging about 65% in 2025, outperforming its peers on Wall Street’s elite group of stocks, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”.\n\nThe tech giant has allayed investors’ doubts about its artificial intelligence strategy in recent months with a series of high-profile product launches, including the latest version of its flagship AI model, Gemini, and the popular Nano Banana image generator and editor. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and Google’s insurgent rival, left investors and consumers underwhelmed with the release of its latest model, GPT-5, which allowed Alphabet to surge ahead.\n\nGoogle, best known for making the world’s most popular search engine and browser, has also turned its once-overlooked cloud unit into a major growth engine, which drew a rare tech investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Google Cloud’s revenue jumped 34% in the third quarter, with a backlog of non-recognized sales contracts rising to $155bn. Renting out Google’s self-developed AI chips that were reserved for internal use to outside customers has also enabled the unit’s breakneck pace of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company’s dominant revenue generator – the advertising business, driven by Google Search and YouTube – has largely held steady in the face of economic uncertainty and intense competition.\n\nThe company has faced two landmark US antitrust suits as it has navigated its place in the AI boom. After Google lost the first case, a judge ruled in September against breaking up the company, allowing it to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.\n\nIn the second case, a judge ruled Google had illegally monopolized the online ad market last April. A trial over how to remedy the monopoly began in September, which could see the judge forcing Google to divest parts of its lucrative ads business to foster competition.",

Nvidia's engineers will work alongside Lilly's experts in biology, science, and medicine to generate large-scale data and build AI models to advance medicine development. The lab's work will begin early this year, the companies said.\n\nThe investment builds on Nvidia and Lilly's existing partnership. Lilly in October said it was building an AI factory with Nvidia's AI systems to speed up drug discovery timelines.\n\nLilly shares rose fractionally Monday and are up nearly 34% over the past year, surpassing the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 19% gain. The company became the first healthcare name to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization in November.\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, is the most valuable company in the world, becoming the first to cross $5 trillion in 2025. The AI chipmaker's project with Lilly is the latest in a string of investments and deals spanning the AI ecosystem — some of which have raised eyebrows on Wall Street and spurred fears of an AI bubble.\n\nIn the healthcare space, Nvidia has also invested in biotech firm Recursion and has inked partnerships with other industry leaders, including Lilly rival Novo Nordisk (NVO), the Mayo Clinic, Illumina, and IQVIA, to use AI in medical research and development.\n\n“AI is transforming every industry, and its most profound impact will be in life sciences,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a statement Monday.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

    "description": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that frequent warnings about AI are dissuading people from making investments in AI's improvement.",
    "fullText": "Jensen Huang is over AI doomerism.\n\nThe Nvidia CEO said one of his biggest takeaways from 2025 was \"the battle of narratives\" over the future of AI development between those who see doom on the horizon and the optimists. Huang said while \"it's too simplistic\" to dismiss either side entirely, some of the dismal outlooks are having real consequences.\n\n\"I think we've done a lot of damage with very well-respected people who have painted a doomer narrative, end of the world narrative, science fiction narrative,\" Huang said during a recent episode of the \"No Priors\" podcast. \"And I appreciate that many of us grew up and enjoyed science fiction, but it's not helpful. It's not helpful to people. It's not helpful to the industry. It's not helpful to society. It's not helpful to the governments.\"\n\nHuang didn't name the people in question, nor did he give a specific motivation for why people may be sharing their more dour outlook. Instead, he cited concerns about \"regulatory capture,\" arguing that no company should approach governments to request more regulation.\n\n\"Their intentions are clearly deeply conflicted, and their intentions are clearly not completely in the best interest of society,\" he said. \"I mean, they're obviously CEOs, they're obviously companies, and obviously they're advocating for themselves.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to elaborate on Huang's remarks. Previously, the Nvidia CEO took issue with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's prediction that AI could replace up to half of all white-collar entry-level jobs within five years. (Amodei later said that Huang distorted his views.)\n\nOverall, Huang said the sheer amount of negativity is distorting the conversation around AI.\n\n\"When 90% of the messaging is all around the end of the world and the pessimism, and I think we're scaring people from making the investments in AI that makes it safer, more functional, more productive, and more useful to society,\" he said.\n\nHuang isn't the only CEO who is hoping for a different AI narrative in 2026. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in his year-end note that he wanted that society needs to move beyond labeling content AI \"slop.\"\n\n\"We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication,\" Nadella wrote on his blog late last year, \"and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our 'theory of the mind' that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other.\"",

    "description": "Jensen Huang explains artificial intelligence as a multi-layered platform, arguing its true impact extends far beyond consumer-facing language models.",
    "fullText": "Bottom Line Up Front: Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, in his role as the leader of the primary company behind the ongoing technology movement, says that many people don’t realize just how big the AI revolution is. He says there are currently over 1.5 million AI models throughout the world, from healthcare and drug discovery to more commonly known names like Elon Musk’s Grok and Sam Altman’s ChatGPT.\n\nThe Details: Nvidia founder and chief executive Jensen Huang has consistently framed artificial intelligence as an infrastructure-scale transformation rather than a single technological breakthrough. In a fireside chat hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) with President and CEO Dr. John J. Hamre, Huang continued outlining his layered view of AI, emphasizing the systems, capital, and breadth of applications that underpin the technology’s long-term impact.\n\nJeff Bezos Launched a Secretive AI Startup in 2025 That Should Give Wall Street Chills\n\nThe Top-Rated Dividend King to Buy for 2026\n\nEvercore Analysts Love UnitedHealth Stock for 2026. Should You Buy UNH Here?\n\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. \n\nBuilding on earlier discussion of energy, chips, and systems, Huang described the current infrastructure buildout of AI as being multi-layered. The first layer is simple: energy. Huang frames electricity buildout as the most fundamental part of the entire AI revolution.\n\nThe next is Nvidia itself: Chips. Without chips, there’s nothing to use electricity and process the AI compute needed to run the AI models.\n\nHuang then highlights the third layer, which “includes financial services, because it takes an enormous amount of capital to do what we do.” His remarks highlight that AI development at scale is not only a technical challenge, but also a financial one, requiring sustained investment in data centers, networking, and long-lived computing assets.\n\nHuang then turned to the fourth layer that receives the most public attention: the models themselves. He acknowledged the prominence of well-known systems, describing how “this is where people largely focus on when they talk about AI,” citing examples such as ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and xAI’s Grok. However, he placed those systems in a much wider context, pointing out that “those are four of the one and a half million AI models in the world.” The statement reframes popular generative models as an incredibly small subset of a far larger and more diverse ecosystem. This statement diversifies the risk away from the larger, more broadly known AI models, and instead frames Nvidia as an infrastructure play amongst a technological revolution being implemented across every industry in the world.",

    "description": "Internal emails show Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang urging teams to to address DGX Spark backlash, highlighting its approach to responding to customers.",
    "fullText": "An internal Nvidia email chain revealed how senior executives at the chip giant — including founder and CEO Jensen Huang — mobilized in response to customer criticism of a key product launch late last year.\n\nThe thread offers a glimpse into how the company responds to public backlash as it expands products designed for individual developers and researchers.\n\nThe thread, which Business Insider has seen, centered on the launch of DGX Spark, a desktop AI system designed for developers and researchers to build AI products and work on apps for data science, medicine, and other fields.\n\nWhile much of Nvidia's business targets data center customers, Huang underscored Spark's significance in the thread, calling it the \"ultimate developer's platform — out of the box easy to run all NVIDIA.\"\n\nSpark drew criticism soon after its launch, with some citing software stability and performance issues, which garnered coverage in other tech outlets.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nAnshel Sag, a Moor Insights & Strategy analyst who has tracked Nvidia launches for 15 years and was an early DGX Spark tester, said the company's long experience releasing graphics cards in the gaming industry — where products are routinely scrutinized — has made it adept at handling public feedback, with Huang typically keeping a close eye on new releases.\n\nIn recent years, the company has become even more reactive, Sag said, due to increased internal resources and \"sensitivity about the stock price and how negative sentiment can draw that down.\"\n\nIn the fall of last year, AstraZeneca executive director Justin Johnson wrote in a LinkedIn post that while the DGX Spark met performance and speed claims, the software experience was buggy and unstable.\n\nAfter an Nvidia executive shared Johnson's post in an internal email thread, Huang entered the fray.\n\n\"Jump on x and say you will fix,\" he wrote.\n\nSubsequently, an Nvidia engineer replied that the company had reached out to Johnson to resolve most of the issues, which were related to a version mismatch of CUDA, Nvidia's software that allows developers to build AI apps powered by its GPUs.\n\nJohnson responded that he appreciated the outreach and was exploring setting up DGX Spark at the pharmaceutical company, the chain said.\n\nFollowing Johnson's criticism, Nvidia staffers saw other unfavorable responses online and set up a social listening campaign to flag complaints from other influential figures, as well as discussions on Nvidia forums and Reddit, the emails said.\n\nStaffers tracked complaints and engaged directly with key critics who raised concerns about DGX Spark's performance, heating issues, and pricing.\n\nAnother incident involved the researcher Christopher Kouzios, who wrote on LinkedIn that he'd purchased DGX Spark to conduct medical research after his daughter died from a rare brain tumor, with the goal of studying cancer risk in his sons.\n\nKouzios said software incompatibility had rendered the system unusable and that he'd only received an automated acknowledgment 38 hours after filing a support ticket.\n\nAfter an Nvidia executive flagged the post, team members said they were fixing the bug, according to the emails. The executive later circulated an updated post in which Kouzios lauded Nvidia's customer support.\n\n\"While the situation initially frustrated me, Nvidia's response time was exceptional,\" Kouzios told Business Insider. \"In more than 33 years working with large technology companies, I have never seen an organization respond that quickly to public technical feedback.\"\n\nIt's often standard for hardware to ship without fully finished software, Sag said, adding that Nvidia tends to be more \"high-touch\" than other tech companies in fielding complaints — an approach that flows down from an exceptionally \"hands-on\" CEO.\n\nNvidia has previously faced some launch hiccups and early criticism for new products, such as its Blackwell rollout, which encountered manufacturing challenges.\n\nWhile a CEO's involvement is notable and Nvidia's backchannel efforts appeared to placate critics, such an approach isn't without risks, another analyst said.\n\n\"C-suite engagement during product controversies has become more common in tech, particularly for founder-led companies,\" said Kate Holterhoff, a senior industry analyst at RedMonk. \"It can signal authenticity and accountability, but it also carries reputational risk if the response is perceived as defensive or dismissive.\"\n\nHave a tip?

Huang has repeatedly said that the US will not slow down China's AI advancements by curtailing the sales of advanced chips.\n\nHuang said on Tuesday that he was not expecting a formal announcement from Beijing approving the sales of H200 chips. China previously imposed its restrictions on such sales.\n\n\"We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,\" Huang said during a news conference on the sidelines of CES in Las Vegas. \"It's just going to be purchase orders.\"\n\nAs for the broader US-China relationship, Huang said that both nations ought to continue to invest in their own independence. Trump has deployed a combination of tariffs and incentives to encourage US-based companies to bring their manufacturing back to the US.\n\n\"When you depend too much on someone, the relationship becomes too emotional, as you know,\" Huang said. \"And so it's good to have some independence or there as much independence as either would like, but to recognize that there's a lot of coupling, a lot of dependence between the two countries. And I think there needs to be a nuanced strategy, a nuanced attitude about how to manage this relationship in a productive way for all of the people of two countries and for all of the people around the world.\"\n\nThe world needs both sides to figure it out, Huang said.\n\n\"Everybody depends on a productive, constructive relationship of the two most important nations and the single most important relationship for the next century,\" he said. \"And so we have to find that answer.\"",

    "description": "Nvidia's $20 billion Groq acquisition shows the AI industry moving from training to inference, with speed and efficiency now crucial.",
    "fullText": "For years, Nvidia's rise has been synonymous with one idea: GPUs are the engine of artificial intelligence. They powered the training boom that turned large language models from academic curiosities into trillion-dollar ambitions. But Nvidia's $20 billion deal with Groq is an admission that the next phase of AI won't be won by GPUs alone.\n\nGroq makes a very different type of AI chip called a Language Processing Unit, or LPU. To understand why Nvidia spent so much, and why it didn't simply build this technology itself, you have to look at where AI workloads are heading. The industry is moving from training models to running them in the real world. That shift has a name: inference.\n\nInference is what happens after a model is trained, when it answers questions, generates images, or carries on conversations with users. It's becoming the dominant task in AI computing, and could dwarf the training market in the future, according to estimates recently compiled by RBC Capital analysts.\n\nThis matters because inference has very different needs than training. Training is like building a brain: it requires massive amounts of raw computing power and flexibility. Inference is more like using that brain in real time. Speed, consistency, power efficiency, and cost per answer suddenly matter far more than brute force.\n\nThat's where Groq comes in. Founded by former Google engineers, Groq built its business around inference-only chips. Its LPUs are designed less like general-purpose factories and more like precision assembly lines. Every operation is planned in advance, executed in a fixed order, and repeated perfectly each time. That rigidity is a weakness for training, but a strength for inference, where predictability translates into lower latency and less wasted energy.\n\n\"The tectonic plates of the semiconductor industry just shifted again,\" Tony Fadell, creator of the iPod and an investor in Groq, wrote on LinkedIn recently. \"GPUs decisively won the first wave of AI data centers: training. But inference was always going to be the real volume game, and GPUs by design aren't optimized for it.\"\n\nFadell calls this new breed of AI chips \"IPUs,\" or Inference Processing Units.\n\nTD Cowen analysts noted this week that Nvidia's embrace of not just an inference-specific chip, but a whole new architecture, shows how large and mature the inference market has become.\n\nEarlier AI infrastructure investments were made based on training-first buying decisions. The adage used to be \"today's training chips are tomorrow's inference engines,\" which favored Nvidia's GPUs, but that's no longer the case, the analysts added.\n\nInstead, there will be an explosion of different chips inside future AI data centers, according to Chris Lattner, an industry visionary who helped develop the software for Google's TPU AI chips, which Groq founder Jonathan Ross co-designed.\n\nThis move beyond GPUs is being driven by two trends that have been reinforced by Nvidia's Groq deal, Lattner told me this week.\n\n\"The first is that 'AI' is not a single workload — there are lots of different workloads for inference and training,\" he said. \"The second is that hardware specialization leads to huge efficiency gains.\"\n\nIn a 2024 story (that aged very well), Business Insider warned readers that inference could be a vulnerability for Nvidia as rivals looked to fill this strategic gap. Cerebras built massive AI chips optimized for speed, claiming memory bandwidth thousands of times higher than Nvidia's flagship GPU offering at the time. Google's TPUs are designed to efficiently run bespoke AI workloads at blazing speeds. Amazon developed its own inference chip, Inferentia. Startups like Positron AI argued they could beat or match Nvidia's inference performance at a fraction of the cost.\n\nSo Nvidia's deal with Groq can be seen as a preemptive move. Rather than letting inference specialists chip away at its dominance, Nvidia chose to embrace a fundamentally different architecture.\n\nFadell described the deal as a \"humble move\" by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. \"Many companies miss inflection points like this due to 'Not Invented Here- driven egos,\" Fadell added. \"Jensen doesn't; he saw the threat and made it work to his advantage.\"\n\nThe economics are compelling. Inference is where AI products make money. It's the phase that proves whether hundreds of billions of dollars spent on data centers will ever pay off. As AWS CEO Matt Garman put it in 2024, if inference doesn't dominate, \"all this investment in these big models isn't really going to pay off.\"\n\nImportantly, Nvidia isn't betting on a single winner. GPUs will still handle training and flexible workloads. Specialized chips like Groq's will handle fast, real-time inference. Nvidia's advantage lies in owning the connective tissue — the software, networking, and developer ecosystem that lets these components work together.\n\n\"AI datacenters are becoming hybrid environments where GPUs and custom ASICs operate side-by-side, each optimized for different workload types,\" RBC analysts wrote in a recent note, referring to Application-Specific Integrated Circuits such as Groq's LPUs.\n\nSome competitors argue the deal proves GPUs are ill-suited for high-speed inference. Others see it as validation of a more fragmented future, where different chips serve different needs. Nvidia's Huang appears firmly in the second camp. By licensing Groq's technology and bringing its team inside the tent, Nvidia ensures it can offer customers both the shovels and the assembly lines of AI.\n\nIndeed, Nvidia has developed an NVLink Fusion technology that lets other custom chips connect directly to its GPUs, reinforcing this mixed-hardware future, the RBC Capital analysts noted.\n\n\"GPUs are phenomenal accelerators,\" Andrew Feldman, CEO of Cerebras, wrote recently. \"They've gotten us far in AI. They're just not the right machine for high-speed inference. And there are other architectures that are. And Nvidia has just spent $20B to corroborate this.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "AI company’s chatbot faces criticism over its generation of sexualized, nonconsensual images of women and girls\n\nElon Musk’s artificial intelligence company has raised $20bn in its latest funding round, the startup announced Tuesday, even as its marquee chatbot Grok faces backlash over generating sexualized, nonconsensual images of women and underage girls.\n\nxAI’s Series E funding round featured big-name investors, including Nvidia, Fidelity Management and Resource Company, Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, and Valor Equity Partners – the private investment firm of Musk’s longtime friend and former Doge member Antonio Gracias. The funding round exceeded its initial $15bn target, according to xAI’s press release. The company touted Grok’s image-generation abilities in the announcement of its latest funding round.\n\nxAI lacks the prominence of its rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and has continually drawn criticism for generating misinformation, antisemitic content and now potentially illegal sexual material. Nonetheless, the company has been able to win government contracts and billions of dollars in investment amid the AI boom. xAI’s latest funding round comes during some of the fiercest pushback against the company yet, with lawmakers in multiple countries demanding answers regarding Grok’s output.\n\nOver the past week, Grok has responded to tens of thousands of prompts from users on X requesting the chatbot remove women’s clothing in images or pose them in sexualized ways. Many of the prompts have included images of women who have not given their consent to be digitally undressed, including Ashley St Clair, the estranged mother of one of Musk’s children.\n\n“I felt horrified, I felt violated, especially seeing my toddler’s backpack in the back of it,” St Clair told the Guardian, adding that her complaints to X did not go anywhere. The Guardian’s request for comment from xAI resulted in an automated response stating “Legacy Media Lies”.\n\nSome of Grok’s images included a photo of a 12-year-old girl, which the chatbot manipulated to remove the child’s actual clothing and depict her instead in a bikini. Other suggestive images have featured children as young as 10 years old. The chatbot posted an apology on Friday that stated lapses in its safeguards led to generating images of minors, but continued to generate sexualized images of children in the ensuing days.\n\nxAI has been seeking investment for months as it works to increase its AI models’ capabilities and build out enormous data centers in Memphis, Tennessee. The company claimed the new funding would help its core mission of “Understanding the Universe”.\n\nFrench ministers reported Grok’s output to prosecutors on Friday and referred the episode to media regulators to decide whether the images violate the European Union’s Digital Services Act. Liz Kendall, the UK’s technology secretary, also condemned Grok’s deepfakes on Tuesday as “appalling and unacceptable”, calling on the British regulator Ofcom to take action. Ofcom posted on X that it had made contact with xAI to determine whether an investigation is warranted. Lawmakers in the US, where xAI is headquartered, have remained comparatively mum.\n\nThe company made a similar funding announcement in July of last year during another controversy over Grok. A week after the chatbot began posting antisemitic content and pro-Nazi ideology, including describing itself as “MechaHitler”, xAI announced it had secured a contract with the US Pentagon worth nearly $200m.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang seems like he's not losing sleep over California's proposed wealth tax.\n\nWhen Bloomberg TV's Ed Ludlow asked Huang about California's proposed 5% billionaire wealth tax in an interview that aired on Tuesday, Huang said that the potential levy hasn't crossed his mind once and that he is \"trying to build the future of AI.\"\n\n\"I've got to tell you, I have not even thought about it once,\" Huang told Ludlow. \"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it. I'm perfectly fine with it.\"\n\n\"We work in Silicon Valley because that's where the talent pool is,\" Huang added.\n\nHuang is the eighth-wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes, which estimated his net worth at approximately $162.6 billion as of January 6. Most of Huang's wealth comes from his around 3% stake in Nvidia, which just showed off its new Vera Rubin chips at the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nBased on his net worth as reported by Forbes, a 5% tax on his total wealth would amount to more than $8 billion, to be paid over five years, according to the proposed plan.\n\nThe California wealth tax was proposed by the SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West in order to offset anticipated budget cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance.\n\nA wealth tax is different from an income tax and is a levy on an individual's entire net worth instead of annual income. The union estimates that the one-time tax will bring in $100 billion over five years for the state and apply to the around 200 billionaires who are residents of California.\n\nThe proposal is still very far from reality and would need 870,000 signatures to even make it to the ballot in November 2026, where it would then be voted on or rejected by California voters.\n\nBillionaires from Palmer Luckey to David Sacks have already voiced their full-throated disapproval.\n\nAccording to filings viewed by Business Insider, Larry Page, the Google cofounder, converted many of his assets from California to Delaware in December to derisk them from the potential wealth tax. His departure meets an end-of-2025 deadline, since the tax, if passed, would only apply to billionaires who are still residents of California on January 1, 2026.\n\nCelebrity attorney Alex Spiro wrote a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of his wealthy clients and warned that they would \"permanently relocate\" if the California billionaire tax comes to pass.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "The companies behind some of tech's least glamorous products — hard drives and storage — are powering a sharp rally on Wall Street.\n\nThe surge comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at CES 2026 on Monday that the AI boom isn't just about chips, but about where vast amounts of data live.\n\nSanDisk, the flash-memory company spun out of Western Digital last year, has been the standout. Its shares surged about 28% on Tuesday, marking their strongest intraday performance since February. The stock is already up more than 40% just days into January, making SanDisk the top performer in the S&P 500 on Tuesday.\n\nWestern Digital and Seagate Technology, two of the world's largest makers of hard-disk drives, are also seeing a boost. Western Digital's shares jumped about 17% on Tuesday, while Seagate rose about 14%.\n\nHuang described the memory storage market as a \"completely unserved market today.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts on Monday.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nMemory prices have been rising. Korea Economic Daily reported on Monday that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are pushing for server DRAM price increases of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter.\n\nMarket analysis firm Counterpoint said last week that memory prices could rise by 40% through the second quarter of 2026, as AI-driven demand continues to strain supply.\n\nThe AI race has largely been about chips, data centers, and power. But data storage is coming into focus as a key bottleneck.\n\nDriven largely by AI workloads, the volume of stored global data was expected to top 200 zettabytes in 2025 — the equivalent of 200 billion terabytes.\n\nAnalysts have predicted that demand for data storage could run ahead of supply.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\n\"For an industry that has long been characterized by boom-and-bust cycles, this time is different,\" the analyst said, citing the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure and workloads as a shift that is straining the memory ecosystem.\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Nvidia's Updated DLSS Makes Games Run Worse on Older GPUs",
    "description": "The most commonly uses Nvidia graphics cards are starting to get left in the dust.",
    "fullText": "Unless you run an AI data center, Nvidia's announcements this CES have been more on the quiet end. There were updates to GeForce Now cloud streaming and its DLSS upscaling tech, but no new graphic cards. That's fine—it's normal for Nvidia to have a quiet year on consumer tech every now and then, and the RTX 50-series GPUs just came out last year. Unfortunately, it turns out those DLSS updates are actually making games run worse on older GPUs.\n\nThe new version of DLSS, called DLSS 4.5, is pretty great when it works. It already makes lighting appear far more realistic even when ray tracing or HDR isn't being used, and in the spring, it will introduce dynamic frame generation, which can adjust how many AI frames are inserted into your game on the fly, so that it doesn't waste compute producing more frames than necessary, or than your monitor can produce. I saw examples of both of these use cases in person at CES, and as someone who mostly plays without upscaling when I can, I was impressed enough that I might want to get a new GPU and make the swap.\n\nAnd I stress that \"new GPU\" part. Unfortunately, DLSS 4.5 only seems to work best on Nvidia's newest cards. It released in beta for all Nvidia GeForce RTX cards yesterday, but gamers on older RTX 3000-series cards are already reporting issues. According to a report from X user Mostly Positive Reviews (via Tom's Hardware), users on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU could see up to a 24% dip in performance in Cyberpunk 2077, and a 14% drop in The Last of Us Part 2. Those are just a few examples, but others in the comments posted their own headaches, as did users on Reddit.\n\nThat's not a small issue. The RTX 3080 Ti might be a few generations behind, but it was near the top of the line when it was current. More importantly, according to Steam's own data, the RTX 3060 is currently the most common graphics card on Steam, and it's weaker than the RTX 3080 Ti. And technically, DLSS 4.5 is available for the even weaker RTX 2000-series, which are bound to run into even more severe problems.\n\nSo where's this massive performance loss coming from, and what can you do about it? Likely, it has to do with the new AI transformer model powering DLSS, which Nvidia said was built with RTX 40-series and RTX 50-series cards in mind. While you can use DLSS 4.5 with an older GPU, it doesn't seem like it's intended.\n\nThankfully, if you decided to try out DLSS 4.5 on an older card and you don't like what you're seeing, you're not stuck with it. Currently, public DLSS 4.5 implementation is in beta, and needs to be applied to games by choosing either the \"Model M\" or \"Model L\" preset in the Nvidia app (under \"Latest\" and \"Custom,\" respectively). Choosing another model, like Model K, should get you back to normal. When DLSS 4.5 gets a full release on January 13, I assume this will get even simpler.\n\nStill, it's not a great look that most Nvidia gamers can't use its exciting new feature. Because it can be reversed, it doesn't break anything, but it also shows that Nvidia is starting to leave all but its most loyal GPU customers behind. And as someone who mostly only uses upscaling while on weaker hardware like the Steam Deck, what I find especially weird is that upscaling is already all about using software to improve performance when you're lacking raw power. That should theoretically make gamers with weaker cards the target audience.\n\nBut it's not all doom-and-gloom for my fellow cheap gamers. Alongside DLSS 4.5, Nvidia also announced a native Linux client for Nvidia GeForce Now, alongside a native Amazon Fire TV app. That extends the cloud gaming platform to even more users, and because GeForce Now has a free tier, it's a pretty sweet deal. Play it right, say by getting a Fire TV on sale and loading up a free game, and you could game using Nvidia's latest GPUs on the big screen while spending less than $20. Sure, you might have to deal with some latency and video compression while doing it—as is the tradeoff with cloud gaming—but as DLSS 4.5 shows, even using local hardware comes with its own problems.",

    "title": "\"Nvidia's New Vera Rubin Chips Are in 'Full Production'\"",
    "description": "The chip giant says Vera Rubin will sharply cut the cost of training and running AI models, strengthening the appeal of its integrated computing platform.",
    "fullText": "Huang says that the company’s next-generation AI superchip platform, Vera Rubin, is on schedule to begin arriving to customers later this year. “Today, I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production,” Huang said during a press event on Monday at the annual CES technology trade show in Las Vegas.\n\nRubin will cut the cost of running AI models to about one-tenth of Nvidia’s current leading chip system, Blackwell, the company told analysts and journalists during a call on Sunday. Nvidia also said Rubin can train certain large models using roughly one-fourth as many chips as Blackwell requires. Taken together, those gains could make advanced AI systems significantly cheaper to operate and make it harder for Nvidia’s customers to justify moving away from its hardware.\n\nNvidia said on the call that two of its existing partners, Microsoft and CoreWeave, will be among the first companies to begin offering services powered by Rubin chips later this year. Two major AI data centers that Microsoft is currently building in Georgia and Wisconsin will eventually include thousands of Rubin chips, Nvidia added. Some of Nvidia’s partners have started running their next-generation AI models on early Rubin systems, the company said.\n\nThe semiconductor giant also said it’s working with Red Hat, which makes open source enterprise software for banks, automakers, airlines, and government agencies, to offer more products that will run on the new Rubin chip system.\n\nNvidia’s latest chip platform is named after Vera Rubin, an American astronomer who reshaped how scientists understand the properties of galaxies. The system includes six different chips, including the Rubin GPU and a Vera CPU, both of which are built using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s 3-nanometer fabrication process and the most advanced bandwidth memory technology available. Nvidia’s sixth-generation interconnect and switching technologies link the various chips together.\n\nEach part of this chip system is “completely revolutionary and the best of its kind,” Huang proclaimed during the company’s CES press conference.\n\nNvidia has been developing the Rubin system for years, and Huang first announced the chips were coming during a keynote speech in 2024. Last year, the company said that systems built on Rubin would begin arriving in the second half of 2026.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly what Nvidia means by saying that Vera Rubin is in “full production.” Typically, production for chips this advanced—which Nvidia is building with its longtime partner TSMC—starts at low volume while the chips go through testing and validation and ramps up at a later stage.\n\n“This CES announcement around Rubin is to tell investors, ‘We’re on track,’” says Austin Lyons, an analyst at Creative Strategists and author of the semiconductor industry newsletter Chipstrat. There were rumors on Wall Street that the Rubin GPU was running behind schedule, Lyons says, so Nvidia is now pushing back by saying it has cleared key development and testing steps, and it’s confident Rubin is still on course to begin scaling up production in the second half of 2026.\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia had to delay delivery of its then-new Blackwell chips due to a design flaw that caused them to overheat when they were connected together in server racks. Shipments for Blackwell were back on schedule by the middle of 2025.\n\nAs the AI industry rapidly expands, software companies and cloud service providers have had to fiercely compete for access to Nvidia’s newest GPUs. Demand will likely be just as high for Rubin. But some firms are also hedging their bets by investing in their own custom chip designs. OpenAI, for example, has said it is working with Broadcom to build bespoke silicon for its next generation of AI models. These partnerships highlight a longer-term risk for Nvidia: Customers that design their own chips can gain a level of control over their hardware that the company doesn’t offer.\n\nBut Lyons says today’s announcements demonstrate how Nvidia is evolving beyond merely offering GPUs to becoming a “full AI system architect, spanning compute, networking, memory hierarchy, storage, and software orchestration.” Even as hyperscalers pour money into custom silicon, he adds, Nvidia’s tightly integrated platform “is getting harder to displace.”",

    "fullText": "Jensen Huang also announces at CES new, more powerful Vera Rubin chips that will arrive later this year\n\nThe billionaire boss of the chipmaker Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has unveiled new AI technology that he says will help self-driving cars think like humans to navigate more complex situations.\n\nThe world’s most valuable company is to roll out the new technology, Alpamayo, which is designed to help self-driving cars handle tricky situations such as sudden roadworks or unusual driver behaviour on the road, rather than just reacting to previous patterns.\n\nNvidia claims Alpamayo will bring chain-of-thought reasoning to self-driving vehicles, combining what the car sees with language-like reasoning.\n\nIn a speech at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Nvidia founder and chief executive said: “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here, when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world. Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.\n\n“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nNvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.\n\n“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”\n\nHuang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n\nHe revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.\n\nThe Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.\n\nHuang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.\n\nTo get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.\n\nWhile Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.",

    "description": "A reputable leaker has indicated that NVIDIA plans on bringing the RTX 3060 back to market. This would be marketed toward PC gamers as an alternative to the newer GPUs that are being gobbled up by AI.",
    "fullText": "A reputable leaker has indicated that NVIDIA plans on bringing the RTX 3060 back to market, according to reports by Kotaku and WFCCTech. It first released the GPU at the beginning of 2021. The leaker Hongxing2020 indicates that NVIDIA will resume production of the 3060 sometime in the next few months.\n\nWhy is the world's most valuable company reportedly bringing back such an antiquated graphics card? You know the answer. It's the endless gaping maw known as AI. Tech companies have been hoovering up PC parts for AI applications with reckless abandon. It has become a legitimate challenge for a regular person to buy RAM and graphics cards, which has led to price increases across the board and companies like Crucial closing up shop.\n\n01.05update\nrtx3060 Q1 come back… 🥲\n\n— hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) January 5, 2026\n\nIt's particularly difficult to get ahold of GDDR7 RAM, which is needed for the newer RTX 5060 cards. So NVIDIA's solution looks to be a hop in the time machine to 2021. Gamers will need something, after all, and the 3060 technically gets the job done. Any downgrade in graphics and performance will be worth it once you watch an AI-generated video of Kurt Cobain singing in heaven with Albert Einstein, am I right? It's hilarious because they never got to meet in real life.\n\nThe RTX 3060 is still pretty popular, despite NVIDIA phasing out the card back in 2024. We don't know how much the company plans on charging for this trip down memory lane. The GPU originally cost around $329.\n\nOne would think that five-year-old technology could easily hit a much lower price point, but NVIDIA has us in a chokehold here and it can pretty much charge whatever it wants. Again, no price is too high when considering the magical wonders of generative AI. You can watch Tupac hang out with Mr. Rogers for five seconds.",

    "description": "Here are the highlights from the world's largest technology trade show happening in Las Vegas, including a new Nvidia chip architecture.",
    "fullText": "The tech scene is starting the year off strong.\n\nOn January 6, the Consumer Electronics Show, the largest and most influential technology trade show, is set to kick off in Las Vegas.\n\nA CES keynote presentation of a new chip from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang already got the show started.\n\nBased on early announcements, the audience can expect novelties this year like the Sweekar AI pet that physically grows, robots that can bend backwards, and a wallpaper TV that is only 0.35 inches thick. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee is also on the scene to report on the latest autonomous vehicle technologies.\n\nFollow this post over the rest of the week to keep up with the most groundbreaking tech at the 2026 CES.\n\nOn Monday, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show, Huang officially introduced the Vera Rubin architecture, which is now in production and expected to ramp up in volume in the second half of the year. This move follows a blockbuster year for its Blackwell chip, as demand for AI infrastructure continued to surge.\n\nIn a press briefing ahead of Huang's keynote, Dion Harris, Nvidia's senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as \"six chips that make one AI supercomputer.\"\n\n\"Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing,\" Huang told the audience during a presentation at the CES.\n\nHuang added that compared to the Blackwell model, Rubin marks a leap in performance, with more than triple the speed, could run inference five times faster, and can deliver significantly more inference compute per watt of energy.\n\nRubin was first announced in 2024 and has been slated to replace Blackwell ever since. The early debut comes months ahead of the late-2026 timeline Nvidia had previously projected.\n\nNamed after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered the existence of dark matter, Nvidia said in a press release that the architecture is designed to support more complex, agent-style AI workloads, as well as more networking and data movement.\n\nThe Rubin systems are already lined up for deployment across much of the cloud industry. Nvidia said partners, including Amazon Web Services, OpenAI, Anthropic, alongside the upcoming Doudna system at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, all plan to use the new platform.\n\nThe accelerated launch comes shortly after Nvidia reported record data center revenue, up 66% from a year earlier, driven largely by demand for Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Those chips have become a benchmark for the current AI boom are widely seen as a test of whether spending on AI infrastructure is sustainable.\n\nHuang has previously estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion could be spent globally on AI infrastructure over the next five years. Nvidia said products and services built on the Rubin platform will begin rolling out from partners in the second half of 2026.\n\nNvidia's Huang also used his presentation to unveil Alpamayo, a new open AI model and toolset designed to bring reasoning to autonomous vehicles.\n\nHuang said that Mercedes-Benz cars powered by the system are already expected to hit the road in the first quarter of 2026.\n\n\"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" said Huang.\n\nAlpamayo is Nvidia's first full-stack push into self-driving technology, with the goal of using vision-language-action models to handle rare and unfamiliar driving scenarios.\n\nMercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said during the presentation that he recently tested the Nvidia-powered system on public roads and drove for more than an hour through heavy traffic.\n\n\"It feels that the car is on rails. You're just driving, and it does everything,\" Källenius said. \"If you're moving an object that weighs 4,000 pounds at 50 miles an hour, sorry is not going to cut it.\"\n\nBoston Dynamics is teaming up with Google DeepMind to integrate the Gemini AI into its humanoid robot, Atlas, and its robot dog called Spot. Unveiled with Boston Dynamics's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, at CES on Monday, the partnership aims to let Atlas understand natural-language commands, adapt on the fly, and interact more naturally with people, with the goal of pushing the machine from lab demos into real-world work.\n\nExecutives of Boston Dynamics said in a press release that by embedding a foundation model, Atlas could move beyond preprogrammed actions to navigating unfamiliar environments and identifying and manipulating objects, all of which are core skills for manual labor.\n\n\"Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works,\" said CEO Robert Playter in the press release, \"And it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children—useful robots that can walk into our homes and help make our lives safer, more productive, and more fulfilling.\"",

    "fullText": "CES—NVIDIA today kickstarted the next generation of AI with the launch of the NVIDIA Rubin platform, comprising six new chips designed to deliver one incredible AI supercomputer. NVIDIA Rubin sets a new standard for building, deploying and securing the world’s largest and most advanced AI systems at the lowest cost to accelerate mainstream AI adoption.\n\nThe Rubin platform uses extreme codesign across the six chips — the NVIDIA Vera CPU, NVIDIA Rubin GPU, NVIDIA NVLink™ 6 Switch, NVIDIA ConnectX®-9 SuperNIC, NVIDIA BlueField®-4 DPU and NVIDIA Spectrum™-6 Ethernet Switch — to slash training time and inference token costs.\n\n“Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment, as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI.”\n\nNamed for Vera Florence Cooper Rubin — the trailblazing American astronomer whose discoveries transformed humanity’s understanding of the universe — the Rubin platform features the NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL72 rack-scale solution and the NVIDIA HGX Rubin NVL8 system.\n\nThe Rubin platform introduces five innovations, including the latest generations of NVIDIA NVLink interconnect technology, Transformer Engine, Confidential Computing and RAS Engine, as well as the NVIDIA Vera CPU. These breakthroughs will accelerate agentic AI, advanced reasoning and massive-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) model inference at up to 10x lower cost per token of the NVIDIA Blackwell platform. Compared with its predecessor, the NVIDIA Rubin platform trains MoE models with 4x fewer GPUs to accelerate AI adoption.\n\nBroad Ecosystem Support\n\nAmong the world’s leading AI labs, cloud service providers, computer makers and startups expected to adopt Rubin are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Anthropic, Black Forest Labs, Cisco, Cohere, CoreWeave, Cursor, Dell Technologies, Google, Harvey, HPE, Lambda, Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Nebius, Nscale, OpenAI, OpenEvidence, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Perplexity, Runway, Supermicro, Thinking Machines Lab and xAI.\n\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI: “Intelligence scales with compute. When we add more compute, models get more capable, solve harder problems and make a bigger impact for people. The NVIDIA Rubin platform helps us keep scaling this progress so advanced intelligence benefits everyone.”\n\nDario Amodei, cofounder and CEO of Anthropic: “The efficiency gains in the NVIDIA Rubin platform represent the kind of infrastructure progress that enables longer memory, better reasoning and more reliable outputs. Our collaboration with NVIDIA helps power our safety research and our frontier models.”\n\nMark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Meta: “NVIDIA’s Rubin platform promises to deliver the step-change in performance and efficiency required to deploy the most advanced models to billions of people.”\n\nElon Musk, founder and CEO of xAI: “💚🎉🚀 🤖NVIDIA Rubin will be a rocket engine for AI. If you want to train and deploy frontier models at scale, this is the infrastructure you use — and Rubin will remind the world that NVIDIA is the gold standard.💚🎉🚀 🤖”\n\nSatya Nadella, executive chairman and CEO of Microsoft: “We are building the world’s most powerful AI superfactories to serve any workload, anywhere, with maximum performance and efficiency. With the addition of NVIDIA Vera Rubin GPUs, we will empower developers and organizations to create, reason and scale in entirely new ways.”\n\nMike Intrator, cofounder and CEO of CoreWeave: “We built CoreWeave to help pioneers accelerate their innovations with the unmatched performance of our purpose-built AI platform, matching the right technology to the right workloads as they evolve. The NVIDIA Rubin platform represents an important advancement for reasoning, agentic and large-scale inference workloads, and we’re excited to add it to our platform. With CoreWeave Mission Control as the operating standard, we can integrate new capabilities quickly and run them reliably at production scale, working in close partnership with NVIDIA.”\n\nMatt Garman, CEO of AWS: “AWS and NVIDIA have been driving cloud AI innovation together for more than 15 years. The NVIDIA Rubin platform on AWS represents our continued commitment to delivering cutting-edge AI infrastructure that gives customers unmatched choice and flexibility. By combining NVIDIA’s advanced AI technology with AWS’s proven scale, security and comprehensive AI services, customers can build, train and deploy their most demanding AI applications faster and more cost effectively — accelerating their path from experimentation to production at any scale.”\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet: “We are proud of our deep and long-standing relationship with NVIDIA. To meet the substantial customer demand we see for NVIDIA GPUs, we are focused on providing the best possible environment for their hardware on Google Cloud.

Multistep problem-solving requires models to process, reason and act across long sequences of tokens. Designed to serve the demands of complex AI workloads, the Rubin platform’s five groundbreaking technologies include:\n\nAI-Native Storage and Secure, Software-Defined Infrastructure\n\nNVIDIA Rubin introduces NVIDIA Inference Context Memory Storage Platform, a new class of AI-native storage infrastructure designed to scale inference context at gigascale.\n\nAs AI factories increasingly adopt bare-metal and multi-tenant deployment models, maintaining strong infrastructure control and isolation becomes essential.\n\nBlueField-4 also introduces Advanced Secure Trusted Resource Architecture, or ASTRA, a system-level trust architecture that gives AI infrastructure builders a single, trusted control point to securely provision, isolate and operate large-scale AI environments without compromising performance.\n\nWith AI applications evolving toward multi-turn agentic reasoning, AI-native organizations must manage and share far larger volumes of inference context across users, sessions and services.\n\nDifferent Forms for Different Workloads\n\nNVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL72 offers a unified, secure system that combines 72 NVIDIA Rubin GPUs, 36 NVIDIA Vera CPUs, NVIDIA NVLink 6, NVIDIA ConnectX-9 SuperNICs and NVIDIA BlueField-4 DPUs.\n\nNVIDIA will also offer the NVIDIA HGX Rubin NVL8 platform, a server board that links eight Rubin GPUs through NVLink to support x86-based generative AI platforms. The HGX Rubin NVL8 platform accelerates training, inference and scientific computing for AI and high-performance computing workloads.\n\nNVIDIA DGX SuperPOD™ serves as a reference for deploying Rubin-based systems at scale, integrating either NVIDIA DGX Vera Rubin NVL72 or DGX Rubin NVL8 systems with NVIDIA BlueField-4 DPUs, NVIDIA ConnectX-9 SuperNICs, NVIDIA InfiniBand networking and NVIDIA Mission Control™ software.\n\nNext-Generation Ethernet Networking\n\nAdvanced Ethernet networking and storage are components of AI infrastructure critical to keeping data centers running at full speed, improving performance and efficiency, and lowering costs.\n\nNVIDIA Spectrum-6 Ethernet is the next generation of Ethernet for AI networking, built to scale Rubin-based AI factories with higher efficiency and greater resilience, and enabled by 200G SerDes communication circuitry, co-packaged optics and AI-optimized fabrics.\n\nBuilt on the Spectrum-6 architecture, Spectrum-X Ethernet Photonics co-packaged optical switch systems deliver 10x greater reliability and 5x longer uptime for AI applications while achieving 5x better power efficiency, maximizing performance per watt compared with traditional methods. Spectrum-XGS Ethernet technology, part of the Spectrum-X Ethernet platform, enables facilities separated by hundreds of kilometers and more to function as a single AI environment.\n\nTogether, these innovations define the next generation of the NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet platform, engineered with extreme codesign for Rubin to enable massive-scale AI factories and pave the way for future million-GPU environments.\n\nRubin Readiness\n\nNVIDIA Rubin is in full production, and Rubin-based products will be available from partners the second half of 2026.\n\nAmong the first cloud providers to deploy Vera Rubin-based instances in 2026 will be AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft and OCI, as well as NVIDIA Cloud Partners CoreWeave, Lambda, Nebius and Nscale.\n\nMicrosoft will deploy NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL72 rack-scale systems as part of next-generation AI data centers, including future Fairwater AI superfactory sites.\n\nDesigned to deliver unprecedented efficiency and performance for training and inference workloads, the Rubin platform will provide the foundation for Microsoft’s next-generation cloud AI capabilities. Microsoft Azure will offer a tightly optimized platform enabling customers to accelerate innovation across enterprise, research and consumer applications.\n\nCoreWeave will integrate NVIDIA Rubin-based systems into its AI cloud platform beginning in the second half of 2026. CoreWeave is built to operate multiple architectures side by side, enabling customers to bring Rubin into their environments, where it will deliver the greatest impact across training, inference and agentic workloads.\n\nTogether with NVIDIA, CoreWeave will help AI pioneers take advantage of Rubin’s advancements in reasoning and MoE models, while continuing to deliver the performance, operational reliability and scale required for production AI across the full lifecycle with CoreWeave Mission Control.\n\nIn addition, Cisco, Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro are expected to deliver a wide range of servers based on Rubin products.\n\nAI labs including Anthropic, Black Forest, Cohere, Cursor, Harvey, Meta, Mistral AI, OpenAI, OpenEvidence, Perplexity, Runway, Thinking Machines Lab and xAI are looking to the NVIDIA Rubin platform to train larger, more capable models and to serve long-context, multimodal systems at lower latency and cost than with prior GPU generations.\n\nInfrastructure software and storage partners AIC, Canonical, Cloudian, DDN, Dell, HPE, Hitachi Vantara, IBM, NetApp, Nutanix, Pure Storage, Supermicro, SUSE, VAST Data and WEKA are working with NVIDIA to design next-generation platforms for Rubin infrastructure.\n\nThe Rubin platform marks NVIDIA’s third-generation rack-scale architecture, with more than 80 NVIDIA MGX™ ecosystem partners.\n\nTo unlock this density, Red Hat today announced an expanded collaboration with NVIDIA to deliver a complete AI stack optimized for the NVIDIA Rubin platform with Red Hat’s hybrid cloud portfolio, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat AI. These solutions are used by the vast majority of Fortune Global 500 companies.\n\nLearn more by watching NVIDIA Live at CES and reading the “Inside Vera Rubin” technical blog.",

    "description": "At the CES conference, Jensen Huang, the company’s chief executive, said the more efficient and powerful chip would begin shipping later this year.",
    "fullText": "Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip-making giant Nvidia, put his company at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom by making semiconductors more powerful than any of his rivals’. This year, he’s promising to do it again.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Huang said the company would begin shipping a new A.I. chip later this year, one that can do more computing with less power than previous generations of chips could. Known as the Vera Rubin, the chip has been in development for three years and is designed to fulfill A.I. requests more quickly and cheaply than its predecessors.\n\nMr. Huang, who spoke during CES, an annual tech conference in Las Vegas, also discussed Nvidia’s surprisingly ambitious work around autonomous vehicles. This year, Mercedes-Benz will begin shipping cars equipped with Nvidia self-driving technology comparable to Tesla’s Autopilot.\n\nNvidia’s new Rubin chips are being manufactured and will be shipped to customers, including Microsoft and Amazon, in the second half of the year, fulfilling a promise Mr. Huang made last March when he first described the chip at the company’s annual conference in San Jose, Calif.\n\nCompanies will be able to train A.I. models with one-quarter as many Rubin chips as its predecessor, the Blackwell. It can provide information for chatbots and other A.I. products for one-tenth of the cost. They will also be able to install the chips in data centers more quickly, courtesy of redesigned supercomputers that feature fewer cables.\n\nIf the new chips live up to their promise, they could allow companies to develop A.I. at a lower cost and at least begin to respond to the soaring electrical demands of data centers being built around the world.\n\n“This is how we’re going to get everybody to the next frontier and push A.I. to the next level and, of course, to build these data centers energy efficiently and cost efficiently as well,” Mr. Huang said.\n\nThe Rubin chips are named for the astronomer Vera Rubin, who did groundbreaking research on dark matter. The new chips are key to maintaining Nvidia’s dominance of the A.I. industry and its perch as the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia’s A.I. chips, which account for more than 90 percent of the market, are highly coveted by businesses and governments around the world. It sells them for about $30,000 each, with nearly three-quarters of that being pure profit.\n\nBut the company is facing increased competition from chip makers and even some customers who are eager to seize a slice of the lucrative A.I. industry. Last year, Advanced Micro Devices, known as AMD, and Google, which buys Nvidia chips but also makes its own chips, struck deals to provide their technology to OpenAI, one of the world’s largest users of A.I. chips.\n\nThe rising threat contributed to Nvidia’s deal last month to license technology from the chip start-up Groq. The agreement is expected to help Nvidia develop chips that allow A.I. to more efficiently fulfill requests through a process known as inference.\n\nBecause more people are using A.I., chip makers are trying to make delivering it less expensive and less power hungry, said Daniel Newman, the chief executive of Futurum Group, a tech research firm. “That’s the name of the game because utilization is very early,” he said.\n\nThe competitive challenges have buffeted Nvidia alongside a series of geopolitical headaches. Mr. Huang spent much of last year lobbying President Trump to allow Nvidia to sell its A.I. chips to China. At the same time, he was trying to fend off efforts by Beijing to discourage Chinese companies from buying Nvidia’s chips because of security concerns.\n\nIn December, Mr. Trump granted the company permission to sell its second-most-powerful chip to China. But Beijing has not decided whether it will allow its companies to buy Nvidia products.\n\nDemand for Nvidia’s chips has turned Mr. Huang, 62, into a globe-trotting salesman and diplomat. He traveled with Mr. Trump to the Middle East and Britain, where he played a key role in technology deals between nations.\n\nNvidia’s business has flourished during the A.I. boom of the past three years. In November, the company reported a quarterly profit of $31.9 billion, a 65 percent increase from a year earlier and 245 percent from the year before that. It expects about $500 billion in sales through the end of this year.\n\nStill, Mr. Huang has been eager to diversify Nvidia’s business and expand its roster of customers. He has been pushing the company to become a major player in robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n\nOn Monday, he said Nvidia had developed new A.I. software that would allow customers like Uber and Lucid to develop cars that navigate roads autonomously. It will share the system, called Alpamayo, to spread its influence and the appeal of Nvidia’s chip technology.\n\nSince 2020, Nvidia has been working with Mercedes to develop a class of self-driving cars. They will begin shipping an early example of their collaboration when Mercedes CLA cars become available in the first half of the year in Europe and the United States.\n\nMr. Huang said the company started working on self-driving technology eight years ago. It has more than a thousand people working on the project.\n\n“Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,” Mr. Huang said.",

    "description": "Nvidia showed off its latest physical AI technologies at CES 2026.",
    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS — Nvidia (NVDA) is touting its latest robotics advancements at CES 2026 as the broader tech industry begins a large-scale effort to bring humanoid robots to life.\n\nDuring the company's keynote on Monday, CEO Jensen Huang revealed that firms ranging from Boston Dynamics and Caterpillar (CAT) to LG Electronics and NEURA Robotics are using Nvidia's robotics technologies to develop and power their various bots.\n\nNvidia has claimed that physical AI could revolutionize the $50 trillion manufacturing and logistics industries, and the company wants to be at the center of it all.\n\nDuring CES, Nvidia revealed a variety of new AI models to help train robots to interact with the world around them, as well as the hardware necessary to power their digital brains.\n\nIn addition to humanoid bots, Nvidia showed off a new family of models for self-driving cars called Alpamayo. According to the company, Alpamayo uses a chain-of-thought reasoning-based vision language action (VLA) model.\n\nThat's a lot to take in, but essentially the models can recognize unique driving situations that might not otherwise happen during a regular drive and come up with the proper way to move forward.\n\nFor instance, the model could see that a traffic light is out when a vehicle is approaching an intersection, recognize the problem, and try to figure out what to do next.\n\nNvidia said the models are meant to serve as \"large-scale teacher models that developers can fine-tune and distill into the backbones of their complete [self-driving] stacks.\"\n\nIn other words, Alpamayo is meant to help developers improve their self-driving vehicle technologies over time.\n\nNvidia said companies including Lucid (LCID), Uber (UBER), and Berkeley DeepDrive have shown interest in Alpamayo.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles are hitting roads around the world, with Google's Waymo leading the way, but they're still not perfect. Some cars have caused traffic jams and have gotten confused in certain situations.\n\nNvidia sees virtual training as a helpful solution for the continued development of the technology, allowing developers to teach their AI models without having to necessarily put cars on the road at all times.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

    "description": "Come for the Liberation Day stock-market crash. Stay for Nvidia's ascent to a $5 trillion valuation.",
    "fullText": "2025 was a wild year for markets of all kinds.\n\nEverything from stocks to crypto to commodities experienced a rollercoaster ride that amounted to what felt like an especially volatile year.\n\nSome of the key events feel like ages ago. (Remember when China's DeepSeek AI model spurred a panic across US tech?) Others are more recent. (It's been hard to miss the record-setting rallies in metals.)\n\nAll in all, it ended up another solidly green year for stocks and commodities, while bitcoin ultimately fell. Here's the final scorecard for some of the most high-profile parts of the market:\n\nWith that in mind, detailed below — in rough chronological order — are the wildest moments that defined the year for investors:\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his wife unveiled their own crypto tokens the day leading up to the presidential inauguration.\n\nThe move, which was unprecedented for a US president and raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest within the new administration, also kicked off a flurry of interest in meme coins.\n\nPerformance-wise, the Trump-branded tokens have floundered throughout the year. $Trump, which soared to around $45 the night leading up to the inauguration, has plummeted 90% from its peak. $Melania, which climbed to $8.48 in late January, has endured a 98% plunge.\n\nAI stocks were shaken by the launch of DeepSeek in January, the Chinese AI chatbot that appeared to rival ChatGPT's abilities despite using cheaper and inferior Nvidia chips. In a single day, fears around DeepSeek wiped away around $1 trillion in value, largely in the US tech sector.\n\nThe LLM was one of the first catalysts to spark concern about the billions mega-cap tech firms in the US are spending on AI, and whether the investment would be worth it from an ROI perspective. It also sparked fear that the US could be losing its dominance in the artificial intelligence space.\n\nCrypto suffered a brutal sell-off in the months following Trump's inauguration, undoing much of the rally that sent tokens rocketing higher after the self-branded \"crypto president\" first won the election in November.\n\nBitcoin, the OG cryptocurrency, rallied to a peak of around $106,000 in late January before tumbling 28% to $75,000 in early April.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto token, plunged around 60% from its peak in December through mid-April.\n\nCrypto markets got a big boost when Trump first secured his second term in office, with investors being excited by the prospect of a more crypto-friendly administration. That optimism has fluctuated at various points throughout the year, tied to factors like concerns about Fed rate cuts and broader risk sentiment in the market.\n\nWho could forget the stock market crash that ensued when Trump unveiled his Liberation Day tariffs?\n\nThe president, who had teased April 2 as \"Liberation Day\" for the US in posts on Truth Social, followed through with his threats to impose sweeping tariffs on the US's top trading partners, which included a 10% universal tariff and reciprocal tariffs on more than 50 nations.\n\nInvestors immediately panicked over the economic implications of tariffs and whether they could stoke higher prices, burdening an already slowing US economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 plunged 12% from its closing price on April 2 through the following Tuesday. At its low, the index was down 19% from its peak in mid-February, on the cusp of bear-market territory.\n\nPresident Trump intensified his attacks on the Fed Chair at various points throughout the year.\n\nTrump, who appointed Jerome Powell to the role during his first term, has long pressured Powell to lower rates at his whim. But his feud with the central bank chief appeared to reach a new level this year as he called on rates to be lowered ASAP and referred to Powell as \"stupid,\" \"Too Late,\" and other names on Truth Social.\n\nIn April, Trump said that Powell leaving the Fed couldn't come soon enough, leading US stocks to drop sharply.\n\nStocks sold off again in July when Bloomberg reported that Trump could fire Powell soon. The 10-year US Treasury yield, a reflection of long-term rates in the economy, also rose in these instances.\n\nThe comments from Trump's administration are considered by many to be unprecedented, given that most past presidents have let the Fed operate independently. They've also sparked fear that inflation could rise if the president were to intervene in monetary policy, which could raise rates in the long run.\n\nIn April, Trump clarified that he had no intention of firing Powell from his post. But the president still appeared to flirt with the idea as a hypothetical when speaking to reporters at the Mar-a-Lago this week.\n\nTesla staged a massive turnaround this year after plummeting over the first four months of 2025.\n\nShares of the EV maker were down more than 50% from their peak in December 2024, driven largely by declining Tesla sales, concerns about tariffs, and CEO Elon Musk's presence on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe stock is now up more than 100% from its April low, driven by a handful of catalysts.\n\nMusk, who has long frustrated Tesla investors with his many side-projects and growing involvement in US politics, appeared to ignite the rebound in April when he said he would step back from the Department of Government Efficiency on Tesla's first quarter earnings call.\n\nThe stock moved higher in the coming months as the Tesla board approved a pay package with ambitious targets for Musk, and Musk signaled his commitment to the company by purchasing another $1 billion worth of Tesla stock.\n\nThe US struck a series of trade agreements with China, which helped stocks grind higher to new records this summer. Here's the timeline of what happened:\n\nThe long-running rift between the US and China on trade has been one of the biggest issues weighing on investors this year, particularly within the context of Trump's latest tariffs. When trade tensions were at their peak, the US was threatening to slap a 145% tariff on goods imported from the nation, and China was threatening to impose a 125% tariff on US goods.\n\nTesla shares swung in June as Elon Musk and Donald Trump had a massive falling out online.\n\nThe two billionaires began to spar on their respective social media platforms after Musk published a post criticizing the Republicans' tax and spending bill. Tesla shares plunged 17% in the two days following June 3, when Musk first posted about the bill.\n\nIn the heat of the conflict, Trump threatened to slash government contracts with Musk's sprawling empire of companies. The White House also said Trump was considering giving away or selling the Tesla he purchased earlier in the year to support Musk.\n\nOn X the following week, Musk said that he believed his posts about Trump \"went too far.\" In an interview with The New York Post on the same day, Trump said he thought the gesture from Musk was \"very nice,\" which appeared to alleviate the selling pressure on Tesla.\n\nThe stock ended up climbing 6% to end the week.\n\nNvidia, the world's most valuable company by market cap, became the first-ever to hit a $4 trillion valuation in July. It was also the first to hit the $5 trillion milestone in October.\n\nShares of the chipmaker are up 35% year-to-date and up 1,338% over the last five years, speaking to the enormous hype surrounding AI hardware.\n\nGold, silver, and copper each rallied to all-time highs as investors sought out alternative investments that could hedge against risk and took interest in metals related to the AI trade.\n\nAll of the metals are also facing a supply-demand imbalance, another factor that's pushed up prices.\n\nHere's how each performed in 2025:\n\nGold and silver are on track for their best year since 1979. Copper, meanwhile, is on track for its best performance since the Great Financial Crisis.",

    "fullText": "At CES 2025, NVIDIA spent the bulk of its presentation touting (what else) its leading position in the artificial intelligence arena. But it also spent time talking up new hardware, including its RTX 5000-series GPUs and Project Digits desktop supercomputer (later redubbed Spark). This year, the company's website says it's \"lighting up CES 2026 with the power of AI.\" To that end, NVIDIA is pulling out all the stops at its Vegas installation, promising hands-on demos in its booth at the Fontainebleau, replete with the \"latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.\"\n\nBut don't worry if you're not on the ground in Vegas. Here's how you can watch the livestream of the company's January 5 press conference, and what to expect from NVIDIA at CES this year.\n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a 90-minute keynote at CES 2026. The event will be livestreamed on January 5 at 4PM ET via NVIDIA's website (and likely on YouTube as well). We'll embed the link here once it's available.\n\nNVIDIA's game plan for CES is suitably vague so far, including \"cutting-edge AI, robotics, simulation, gaming and content creation at the NVIDIA Showcase.\" It also notes there will be more than 20 demos. Although we're unsure if all of these will be shown during the keynote, we can at least expect to see them throughout the week of CES.\n\nGiven NVIDIA's sky-high valuation and the fact that the health of the US and global economy seems increasingly linked to infrastructure spending on AI data centers – largely powered by chips from NVIDIA and its competitors — expect Huang's remarks to be as closely followed by Wall Street investors as technology acolytes, if not more so. Will we get any insight on a successor to the company's Blackwell chip? A more detailed look at how NVIDIA's partners are applying AI to real-world robotics? Time will tell, but you might want to keep your stock portfolio in a split screen while taking in Huang's presentation.",

    "description": "Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang rose from his first job at Denny's, where the idea for his company was born, to leading a chipmaking giant.",
    "fullText": "The AI arms race has been good business for Nvidia, which supplies the highly in-demand chips used by many Big Tech giants and startups alike to train AI models.\n\nThat's also been good news for Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang. In 2024, he shot into Forbes' list of the world's 10 wealthiest people as business boomed for Nvidia.\n\nHuang and fellow Nvidia founders Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky planted the seed for Nvidia at a Denny's in northern California in 1993. Today, it's a household name in the AI industry, and Huang is the billionaire businessman leading it.\n\nHere's a look at Jensen Huang's career rise and background.\n\nHuang was born in Taiwan in 1963. He spent some of his childhood there and in Thailand before his parents sent Huang and his brother to the US to live with an uncle in Tacoma, Washington.\n\nHis uncle sent him to Oneida Baptist Institute in Kentucky, but after Huang's parents immigrated to the US, the family lived in Oregon. He graduated from high school at age 16 before going to college. Huang got his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University and his master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University.\n\nHuang got his first job at 15. He washed dishes and bussed and waited tables at a Denny's in Portland.\n\nBefore founding Nvidia, Huang worked at computer chip manufacturer LSI Logic from 1985 to 1993 and at semiconductor company AMD, or Advanced Micro Devices, from 1984 to 1985.\n\nAt a Denny's in 1993, Huang and his Nvidia co-founders, Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky, came up with the idea that would eventually lead to Nvidia's creation.\n\nIn 1999, the company released the GeForce 256, which it called the first graphics processing unit, or GPU.\n\nToday, Nvidia is instrumental in the generative AI industry, supplying the coveted chips that tech companies use to train AI models.\n\nInterest in Nvidia's chips amid the AI boom has pushed the company to new heights.\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia joined the handful of companies at the time with a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nHuang's net worth is $165.4 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHuang's management and leadership style sees him skipping 1-on-1 meetings, managing around 60 direct reports as CEO, giving feedback publicly, and sending his staff hundreds of emails a day.\n\nCurrent and former Nvidia employees previously told BI that Huang is a hands-on boss with high expectations and meticulous attention to detail who values owning up to your mistakes.\n\nHuang has said he has workaholic tendencies, logging 14-hour days and working on holidays.\n\nHe has a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his shoulder, which he agreed to get when the company's stock price hit $100 per share.\n\nHuang's black leather jacket has also become a famous part of his wardrobe — a staple piece he often wears when giving keynotes or showing off a new product.\n\nNvidia's other founders, meanwhile, have stayed further out of the spotlight than Huang.\n\nPriem was Nvidia's chief technical officer from 1993 to 2003, and Malachowsky is a senior technology executive at Nvidia.\n\nAfter Nvidia went public in 1999, Priem put more than three-quarters of his Nvidia shares into his Priem Family Foundation and by 2006, he'd sold the rest of his shares. He was left with a fortune of roughly $30 million, Forbes estimated in 2023.\n\nHuang met his now-wife, Lori, while still attending Oregon State University. The couple share two children: Madison Huang is a director of product and technical marketing at Nvidia, and Spencer Huang is a product line manager at the company.\n\nHuang and Lisa Su, CEO of Nvidia's rival chip giant AMD, are distant cousins.\n\nHe has a home in Silicon Valley, as Nvidia is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.\n\nHuang has been president, CEO, and a member of Nvidia's board of directors since the company's creation. He and Nvidia haven't said much about succession planning.\n\nHe was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2024 and has received the Semiconductor Industry Association's highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award.\n\nIn past years, The Economist has named Huang the world's best CEO, Fortune has dubbed him its Businessperson of the Year, and TIME has included him in its yearly list of the world's 100 most influential people.\n\nAs of June 2025, Huang owned roughly 3.77% of the company's outstanding shares, according to a proxy statement. He is Nvidia's largest individual shareholder.\n\nHuang led Nvidia through a record-breaking, blockbuster year in 2025 as the AI boom saw no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe chipmaker became the first company in the world to cross the $5-trillion market cap valuation on October 29, 2025.\n\nAt the same time, the CEO steered the company through increased competition as AI hyperscalers explore alternative chips, regulatory headwinds, and growing concerns of an AI bubble.\n\nHuang acknowledged, in an internal meeting, the challenges of running a company faced with sky-high expectations after Nvidia delivered a better-than-expected quarter in November 2025.\n\n\"If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there's an AI bubble,\" he said in the meeting. \"If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble.\"",

    "fullText": "New research from Bank of America has thrown cold water on the growing narrative, and instead focuses on the upside the firm sees in chipmakers.\n\nThe firm recently laid out its forecast for the coming year in a note to clients, predicting that the AI market will experience some volatility but ultimately finish the year strong as data center buildouts continue and companies double down on manufacturing and equipment spending.\n\nThe analysts view the AI market as being roughly halfway through an eight- to 10-year evolution, for which 2026 marks the midpoint. During its second half, they expect to see tech companies continue to upgrade IT infrastructure and continue accelerating AI workloads.\n\nBofA sees a particular opportunity in large-cap companies that are also high-quality sector leaders. It highlighted six chip stocks it says are particularly well-positioned to benefit from AI-capex spending that could reach $1.2 trillion by 2030.\n\nHere are the firms top six picks in that group:\n\nNvidia: +41% year-to-date.\nBroadcom: +52% year-to-date.\nLam Research: 146% year-to-date.\nKLA Corporation: +103% year-to-date.\nAnalog Devices: +30% year-to-date. \nCadence Design Systems: +6% year-to-date.\n\nWhile Broadcom, Lam and KLA significantly outperformed Nvidia it in 2026, BofA analysts maintain that they see the dominant chipmaker as the undisputed industry leader, noting that it currently trades at half its growth rate and highlighting its promising pipeline of likely catalysts.\n\nThat said, BofA values Broadcom at 33 times its anticipated earnings for 2026, predicting that it can go as high as $500 per share in the coming year, due to its high profitability among semiconductor producers and impressive free cash flow.\n\nAnalysts see Lam Research as being in an excellent position overall, due to the equipment it produces on which chip fabs are highly dependent. While it notes that the company may be subject to some tariff and inflation-related pain, BofA still sees it as a strategic play on a key corner of the AI manufacturing market.\n\nAdditionally, BofA notes KLA's leading profit margin among chipmakers, highlighting it as one of the industry's most stable names, which it believes justifies as a higher multiple. It names Cadence Design Systems as its top pick for Electronic Design Automation, but also highlights the risk posed by trade tensions with China.\n\nWhile it acknowledge's Analog's high free cash flow, it notes the possibility of economic downturn negatively impacting the chipmaker if automotive and industrial customers scale back their high-performance chip spending.\n\nDespite these concerns, though, BofA remains highly bullish on this chip stocks as well as some of their smaller cap peers.\n\n\"We remain constructive on chip stocks heading into 2026,\" BofA says. \"While debates around the pace and profitability of AI investments will continue, we believe consensus under-appreciates the mission critical, oﬀensive and defensive nature of capex investments being done by the largest and best funded tech companies.\"",

    "fullText": "The chipmaker’s sprawling partnerships are driving extraordinary growth but also bank its future on the AI boom paying off quickly\n\nNvidia is, in crucial ways, nothing like Enron – the Houston energy giant that imploded through multibillion-dollar accounting fraud in 2001. Nor is it similar to companies such as Lucent or Worldcom that folded during the dotcom bubble.\n\nBut the fact that it needs to reiterate this to its investors is less than ideal.\n\nNow worth more than $4tn (£3tn), Nvidia makes the specialised technology that powers the world’s AI surge: silicon chips and software packages that train and host systems such as ChatGPT. Its products fill datacentres from Norway to New Jersey.\n\nThis year has been an exceptional one for the company: it has struck at least $125bn in deals, ranging from a $5bn investment into Intel – to facilitate its access to the PC market – to $100bn invested in OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT.\n\nBut even as those deals have fuelled surging stock prices and paved the way for chief executive Jensen Huang’s energetic world tour, doubts have emerged about how Nvidia does business, especially as it has become increasingly central to the health of the global economy.\n\nThe start of these concerns has been the circular nature of many of its deals. These arrangements resemble vendor financing: Nvidia lending money to customers so they can buy its products.\n\nThe largest of these is its deal with OpenAI, which involves Nvidia investing $10bn into the company each year for the next 10 years – most of which will go to buying Nvidia’s chips. Another is its arrangement with CoreWeave, a company that provides on-demand computing capacity to big AI firms, essentially leasing out Nvidia’s chips.\n\nThe circularity of these deals has drawn comparisons with Lucent Technologies, a telecoms company that also aggressively lent money to its customers, only to overextend itself and unravel in the early 2000s. Nvidia has aggressively rebutted suggestions of any similarity, saying in a leaked recent memo that it “does not rely on vendor financing arrangements to grow revenue”.\n\nJames Anderson, a renowned tech investor, describes himself as a “huge admirer” of Nvidia, but said this year that the OpenAI deal presented “more reason to be concerned there than before”.\n\nHe added: “I have to say the words ‘vendor financing’ do not carry nice reflections to somebody of my age. It’s not quite like what many of the telecom suppliers were up to in 1999-2000, but it has certain rhymes to it. I don’t think it makes me feel entirely comfortable from that point of view.”\n\nOther high-profile recent deals include the tech firm Oracle spending $300bn on datacentres for OpenAI in the US – with the ChatGPT developer then paying back roughly the same amount to use those datacentres. In October, OpenAI and the chipmaker AMD signed a multibillion-dollar chip deal that also gave OpenAI the option to buy a stake in the Nvidia rival.\n\nThere is also a deal with CoreWeave where, along with a commitment to buying $22bn of data centre capacity from the cloud provider, OpenAI is receiving $350m in CoreWeave stock. Asked this month about circularity in the AI industry, the chief executive of CoreWeave, Michael Intrator, said: “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand. You do that by working together.”\n\nAll these moves form part of OpenAI’s $1.4tn bet on computing capacity to build and operate models that, it argues, will transform economies – and make back that expenditure. OpenAI argues that, while the Nvidia and AMD deals have an investment component, it only kicks in once the chips have been bought and deployed, while the investments themselves create aligned incentives to build out AI infrastructure at huge scale.\n\nNvidia has also used structures called special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) in financing deals. The best-known example is the SPV linked to Elon Musk’s xAI: an entity into which Nvidia invested $2bn, money that will be used to buy Nvidia’s chips.\n\nThis drew comparisons with Enron, which used SPVs to keep debts and toxic assets off its balance sheets, convincing investors and creditors that it was stable while concealing ballooning liabilities.\n\nNvidia has also strongly denied that it is like Enron: in the same leaked memo where it discussed Lucent, it said its reporting was “complete and transparent” and “unlike Enron” it “does not use special-purpose entities to hide debt and inflate revenue”.\n\nThe journalist Ed Zitron, a noted sceptic of the AI boom, agrees that Nvidia is not like either company. Unlike Lucent, it does not appear to be taking on a great deal of debt to finance its circular deals, he says, and most of the customers it is supporting are not as obviously risky as Lucent’s dotcom bubble partners. And it isn’t like Enron, Zitron argues, because it’s being fairly transparent about its own complex, off-balance sheet deals.\n\nSo what could warrant a comparison? Nvidia “is not hiding debt, but it is leaning heavily on vendor-financed demand, which creates exposure if AI growth slows,” says Charlie Dai, an analyst at the research firm Forrester. “The concern is about sustainability, not legality.”\n\nEssentially, whether Nvidia is able to stick the landing depends on whether AI really takes off, generating billions for its corporate users and putting companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and CoreWeave – Nvidia’s customers – firmly in the black, and able to keep buying its systems. That possibility alone is debatable. If this does not happen, says Dai, Nvidia “could face write-downs on equity stakes and unpaid receivables”: meaning, it could lose a lot of money and its stock price could then tank.\n\nApproached for comment, an Nvidia spokesperson referred the Guardian to remarks its chief financial officer, Colette Kress, made to investors in early December. Kress said they were not seeing an AI bubble, instead gesturing at trillions of dollars of business that lie ahead for Nvidia in the next decade.\n\nIn particular, Kress argued that Nvidia’s recent – massive – deals are just the start for the company, and the real money will be made in the coming years, largely through replacing almost all the chips in existing datacentres with its products.\n\nThere is another complexity, which is that Nvidia’s health – and therefore the health of the entire global economy – also depends on whether AI takes off in time for Nvidia and its customers to service the debt from their huge datacentre buildouts and significant capital expenditures.\n\nAdd to this a final category of concern: recent, big-ticket deals with countries such as South Korea and Saudi Arabia, worth multiple billions of dollars, whose terms are opaque. In October, Nvidia said that it would supply 260,000 of its Blackwell chips to South Korea’s government and South Korean companies. The value of this deal was not disclosed, but is estimated to be in the billions.\n\nLikewise with Saudi Arabia. Its government-owned AI startup, Humain, has committed to deploying up to 600,000 Nvidia chips: when that deployment will involve actual purchases, and at what price, is again undisclosed. Nvidia has a number of other strategic partnerships like this – with Italy, with the French AI champion Mistral and with Deutsche Telekom, for example – all involving thousands of chips and unknown sums.\n\nGovernments are likely to pay. There’s nothing circular about a sovereign partnership with Germany. But the deals mean more – quite large – uncertainties nested within a straining web of commitments that require massive capital outlay, and rely on ambitious assumptions about the economy undergoing a revolution in the next years.\n\n“They concentrate risk in a few big customers,” says Dai. “If execution delays occur, Nvidia’s revenue recognition and cashflow could be affected.”",

    "fullText": "Nvidia recently struck a $20 billion deal to acquire the brains of a fierce rival, marking its biggest move to date in the AI arms race. However, the massive chip manufacturer may soon have to respond to more difficult inquiries about the future of its chips.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang offered further detail in an internal email obtained by CNBC.\n\nThe move comes as Nvidia is getting more attention in Asia. Megaspeed International, a fast-growing Singapore-based importer of Nvidia chips, is being looked into for possibly smuggling banned H100 and H200 chips into China, according to a recent Bloomberg report.\n\nThe world's most valuable chipmaker is now stuck between two extremes: It has to deal with rising geopolitical threats and regulatory difficulties in one of its hottest regions while still dominating AI infrastructure around the world.\n\nGroq, a nine-year-old firm started by former Google TPU engineers, was never for sale — at least not in public. But Nvidia came in with a $20 billion deal that includes licensing Groq's cutting-edge AI inference technology and bringing on its top leaders, such as CEO Jonathan Ross.\n\nSources informed CNBC that Nvidia is really buying all of Groq's assets, except for a small GroqCloud firm, even though Groq called the purchase a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement.\"\n\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\n\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\n\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\n\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\n\nThis is Nvidia's biggest deal ever in terms of money. The price of $20 billion is over three times what Groq was worth in its most recent investment round, which was $6.9 billion.\n\nIt also beats Nvidia's previous record, the $7 billion purchase of Mellanox in 2019, by a wide margin.\n\nNvidia now controls Groq’s high-speed inference chip designs, allowing tighter integration into its broader AI platform.\n\nGroq’s leadership, including Ross and president Sunny Madra, will join Nvidia’s leadership team.\n\nThe remaining GroqCloud unit will continue operating independently, led by its CFO.\n\nThis aggressive move is like Nvidia's smaller but similar AI acquisition in September, when it spent $900 million for chip IP and key staff from Enfabrica.\n\nAs Nvidia continues to lead in AI, it is being caught up in the sticky politics of the semiconductor supply chain.\n\nMegaspeed International, which used to be a small part of a Chinese gaming company, is now Nvidia's biggest customer in Southeast Asia. But U.S. investigators are now looking into the company because it may have smuggled prohibited AI chips into China.",

    "description": "While Nvidia and Broadcom dominate, Bank of America's Vivek Arya says some specialized small- and mid-caps are essential for the next $1 trillion chip surge",
    "fullText": "While players like Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) are at the forefront of investors’ minds, smaller specialized players are grabbing a slice of the AI spending behind the scenes.\n\nIn a recent report, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya named a handful of small- to mid-cap companies as the unsung heroes of the semiconductor surge.\n\n\"We mentioned a few companies on the smid-cap side, Credo, MKS, Advanced Energy, MACOM, and Teradyne,\" Arya told reporters on a Dec. 19 call.\n\nWhile these companies lack the massive margins of Nvidia, Arya suggests they are currently benefitting from being the primary providers of essential technologies.\n\nThe scale of the unsung opportunity is staggering. BofA predicts the total addressable market for AI data center systems will exceed $1.2 trillion by 2030, fueled by a 38% compound annual growth rate. Within that, AI accelerators will grab around $900 billion, but that leaves a massive $300 billion slice — one that depends on secondary technologies like networking, cables, and power systems.\n\nArya breaks down how the pie is divided. For every $100 spent on AI hardware, $15 to $20 goes into networking. A third flows directly into interconnects — the wires and optical components that let GPUs talk to each other. As AI clusters expand, these bits and bolts of the trillion-dollar build-out are seeing a direct benefit.\n\nArya highlights Credo (CRDO) for its leadership in active electrical cables. As data centers prioritize \"performance per watt,\" Credo's niche technology is critical. \"They want to make sure that all these GPUs talk to each other, very effectively,\" he said.\n\nHe also pointed to Astera Labs (ALAB) and its robust high-speed connectivity efforts via PCIe 6.0, the standard for moving data between a computer's motherboard and its hardware.\n\n\"They were the ones who invested in specific technologies ... nobody cared about these categories,\" he said. \"So now, they are benefitting from being the only people standing in those specific niche technologies.\"\n\nOther key players, such as MKS Instruments (MKSI) and Advanced Energy (AEIS), provide the precision power and vacuum systems needed to actually build chips. If Nvidia is the architect, these companies provide the machinery and high-voltage power to keep the site running.\n\nMeanwhile, MACOM (MTSI) provides high-speed analog and optical components that let these \"brains\" interact, while Teradyne (TER) serves as a final checkpoint. The company's automated testing equipment ensures these expensive components actually work before they are shipped.",

    "fullText": "The market for AI computing devices is massive and growing.\n\nNvidia is sold out of cloud GPUs.\n\nNvidia's stock price tag is actually quite reasonable.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) buildout has been ongoing since 2023, but it's far from over.\n\nThe AI hyperscalers have nearly completed their record-setting capital expenditures for 2025, but they've already informed their investors that 2026 will be a year of even greater spending. While some investors are growing worried over those figures, some of the smartest people in the world think we need more AI computing power, and going against that trend likely isn't a smart move for investors.\n\nInvestors need to find the companies that are slated to cash in on these massive data center buildouts, and there are a handful of companies that can. One of the best to own over the past three years has been Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). It has delivered investors excellent returns, and seems poised to do so again in 2026.\n\nWhile I can't say for certain if Nvidia will be the best AI stock for 2026, I'm fairly confident it will be one of the best AI stocks, and it is also an attractive bet that it will outperform the market. These two projections combine to make Nvidia an excellent buy right now, and I can think of few better stocks to scoop up in the last few days of 2025.\n\nNvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) and the technology stack that supports them. Combined, Nvidia's technology is the most flexible and easiest to use, and has some of the best performance available. This has made it the go-to computing unit of choice since the AI race began, but investors are worried that the company's dominance is slipping.\n\nHeadlines are filled with rising competition from AMD or how Broadcom has signed another client to spec out a custom AI chip. There are also innovative companies like Amazon that designed their own chip for their cloud computing platform. All of those headlines make it seem like Nvidia's grasp on the market is slipping, but that couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nIn its FY 2026 third quarter (ended Oct. 26) earnings release, CEO Jensen Huang noted that the company was \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. Although Nvidia is ramping up production as fast as it can, it is unable to meet the current computing demands of the market. As a result, clients are starting to look elsewhere to meet their massive computing demands. While they may prefer Nvidia hardware, some computing power is better than none.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia is forging ahead with another bet on the AI boom, agreeing to a licensing deal with AI hardware startup Groq.\n\nGroq said Wednesday that some of its executives, including its founder and CEO, will join Nvidia as part of the deal. Groq is expected to continue operating independently following what it described as a non-exclusive licensing deal.\n\nGroq is known for its Language Processing Unit, which is a custom chip designed for AI inference, namely, the process by which a trained AI model makes predictions or decisions. The startup was valued at about $6.9 billion as of three months ago and raised around $750 million in its latest funding round.\n\nJonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other members of its team are expected to join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market cap north of $4.5 trillion.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told Business Insider on Wednesday that Nvidia is not acquiring the chip startup.\n\nNeither Nvidia nor Groq disclosed financial terms of the agreement.\n\nRoss and Douglas Wightman were engineers at Google who started the project that became Google's first TPU chips, before leaving to found Groq. The TPUs are custom-made to accelerate large-scale machine-learning tasks designed to handle AI workloads, and are a major rival to Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nThe deal between the two companies comes as a new type of dealmaking is on the rise in Silicon Valley. Whereas traditional startups either aim to go public or be acquired, new acqui-hire deals could leave some startup employees behind, only benefiting a small percentage of staff members with desirable AI skills and the founders.\n\nFor instance, in 2024, Google agreed to pay $2.5 billion to license Character.AI's technology but only hired its two superstar cofounders and 20% of the startup's employees. In the same year, AI developers Adept and Inflection also made similar deals with Amazon and Microsoft, respectively.\n\nMore recently, Meta's acqui-hire of Scale AI became one of the biggest bets on talent after the company agreed to invest roughly $14 billion for a 49% stake and to bring its CEO, Alexandr Wang, into the fold to lead the Meta Superintelligence Labs.\n\nThese acqui-hires don't always end well. Windsurf employees were left in limbo after the AI coding startup was nearly aquired by OpenAI for $3 billion, only for the deal to fall apart and the company to be split. Google spent billions to hire Windsurf's CEO and top engineers, while the remaining hundreds of employees were acquired by another startup, Cognition.",

    "description": "The Nemotron 3 family of open models — in Nano, Super and Ultra sizes — introduces the most efficient family of open models with leading accuracy for building agentic AI applications.",
    "fullText": "NVIDIA today announced the NVIDIA Nemotron™ 3 family of open models, data and libraries designed to power transparent, efficient and specialized agentic AI development across industries.\n\nThe Nemotron 3 models — with Nano, Super and Ultra sizes — introduce a breakthrough hybrid latent mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture that helps developers build and deploy reliable multi-agent systems at scale.\n\nAs organizations shift from single-model chatbots to collaborative multi-agent AI systems, developers face mounting challenges, including communication overhead, context drift and high inference costs. In addition, developers require transparency to trust the models that will automate their complex workflows. Nemotron 3 directly addresses these challenges, delivering the performance and openness customers need to build specialized, agentic AI.\n\n“Open innovation is the foundation of AI progress,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With Nemotron, we’re transforming advanced AI into an open platform that gives developers the transparency and efficiency they need to build agentic systems at scale.”\n\nNVIDIA Nemotron supports NVIDIA’s broader sovereign AI efforts, with organizations from Europe to South Korea adopting open, transparent and efficient models that allow them to build AI systems aligned to their own data, regulations and values.\n\nEarly adopters, including Accenture, Cadence, CrowdStrike, Cursor, Deloitte, EY, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Palantir, Perplexity, ServiceNow, Siemens, Synopsys and Zoom, are integrating models from the Nemotron family to power AI workflows across manufacturing, cybersecurity, software development, media, communications and other industries.\n\n“NVIDIA and ServiceNow have been shaping the future of AI for years, and the best is yet to come,” Bill McDermott, chairman and CEO of ServiceNow. “Today, we’re taking a major step forward in empowering leaders across all industries to fast-track their agentic AI strategy. ServiceNow’s intelligent workflow automation combined with NVIDIA Nemotron 3 will continue to define the standard with unmatched efficiency, speed and accuracy.”\n\nAs multi-agent AI systems expand, developers are increasingly relying on proprietary models for state-of-the-art reasoning while using more efficient and customizable open models to drive down costs. Routing tasks between frontier-level models and Nemotron in a single workflow gives agents the most intelligence while optimizing tokenomics.\n\n\"Perplexity is built on the idea that human curiosity will be amplified by accurate AI built into exceptional tools, like AI assistants,\" said Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity. “With our agent router, we can direct workloads to the best fine-tuned open models, like Nemotron 3 Ultra, or leverage leading proprietary models when tasks benefit from their unique capabilities — ensuring our AI assistants operate with exceptional speed, efficiency and scale.”\n\nThe open Nemotron 3 models enable startups to build and iterate faster on AI agents and accelerate innovation from prototype to enterprise deployment. General Catalyst, Mayfield and Sierra Ventures’ portfolio companies are exploring Nemotron 3 to build AI teammates that support human-AI collaboration.\n\n“NVIDIA’s open model stack and the NVIDIA Inception program give early-stage companies the models, tools and a cost-effective infrastructure to experiment, differentiate and scale fast,” said Navin Chaddha, managing partner at Mayfield. “Nemotron 3 gives founders a running start on building agentic AI applications and AI teammates, and helps them tap into NVIDIA’s massive installed base.”\n\nNemotron 3 Reinvents Multi-Agent AI With Efficiency and Accuracy \n\nThe Nemotron 3 family of MoE models includes three sizes:\n\nAvailable today, Nemotron 3 Nano is the most compute-cost-efficient model, optimized for tasks such as software debugging, content summarization, AI assistant workflows and information retrieval at low inference costs. The model uses a unique hybrid MoE architecture to deliver gains in efficiency and scalability.\n\nThis design achieves up to 4x higher token throughput compared with Nemotron 2 Nano and reduces reasoning-token generation by up to 60%, significantly lowering inference costs. With a 1-million-token context window, Nemotron 3 Nano remembers more, making it more accurate and better capable of connecting information over long, multistep tasks.\n\nArtificial Analysis, an independent organization that benchmarks AI, ranked the model as the most open and efficient among models of the same size, with leading accuracy.\n\nNemotron 3 Super excels at applications that require many collaborating agents to achieve complex tasks with low latency. Nemotron 3 Ultra serves as an advanced reasoning engine for AI workflows that demand deep research and strategic planning.\n\nNemotron 3 Super and Ultra use NVIDIA’s ultraefficient 4-bit NVFP4 training format on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, significantly cutting memory requirements and speeding up training. This efficiency allows larger models to be trained on existing infrastructure without compromising accuracy relative to higher-precision formats.\n\nWith the Nemotron 3 family of models, developers can choose the open model that is right-sized for their specific workloads, scaling from dozens to hundreds of agents while benefiting from faster, more accurate long-horizon reasoning for complex workflows.\n\nNew Open Tools and Data for AI Agent Customization\n\nNVIDIA also released a collection of training datasets and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning libraries available to anyone building specialized AI agents.\n\nThree trillion tokens of new Nemotron pretraining, post-training and reinforcement learning datasets supply the rich reasoning, coding and multistep workflow examples needed to create highly capable, domain-specialized agents. The Nemotron Agentic Safety Dataset provides real-world telemetry to help teams evaluate and strengthen the safety of complex agent systems.\n\nTo accelerate development, NVIDIA released the NeMo Gym and NeMo RL open-source libraries, which provide the training environments and post-training foundation for Nemotron models, along with NeMo Evaluator to validate model safety and performance. All tools and datasets are now available on GitHub and Hugging Face.\n\nNemotron 3 is supported by LM Studio, llama.cpp, SGLang and vLLM. In addition, Prime Intellect and Unsloth are integrating NeMo Gym’s ready-to-use training environments directly into their workflows, giving teams faster, easier access to powerful reinforcement learning training.\n\nGet Started With NVIDIA Open Models\n\nNemotron 3 Nano is available today on Hugging Face and through inference service providers including Baseten, DeepInfra, Fireworks, FriendliAI, OpenRouter and Together AI.\n\nNemotron is offered on enterprise AI and data infrastructure platforms, including Couchbase, DataRobot, H2O.ai, JFrog, Lambda and UiPath. For customers on public clouds, Nemotron 3 Nano will be available on AWS via Amazon Bedrock (serverless) as well as supported on Google Cloud, CoreWeave, Crusoe, Microsoft Foundry, Nebius, Nscale and Yotta soon.\n\nNemotron 3 Nano is available as an NVIDIA NIM™ microservice for secure, scalable deployment anywhere on NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure for maximum privacy and control.\n\nNemotron 3 Super and Ultra are expected to be available in the first half of 2026.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said the US needs to shift away from \"power-hungry\" chips, but Nvidia has a \"death grip\" on the sector.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Nvidia is pushing the idea that building graphics chips that consume more and more power is the best path to advancing AI — and the result could be the US losing the AI race to China.\n\n\"Exactly and sadly,\" Burry wrote on X late Saturday, responding to another user's comment that called Nvidia the \"gangster of the AI neighborhood\" as it has \"shut down any narrative that even hints at reducing GPU demand.\"\n\nIn another post over the weekend, Burry shared a chart showing China has more than double America's electric generation capacity, and is expanding its energy infrastructure at a much faster rate.\n\nWhy China will win AI in one chart. \n\nPower hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward for the U.S. \n\nIt is not just the total power advantage. It is the slope. pic.twitter.com/qNXh1e4lZj\n\nNvidia has framed AI innovation as \"just figuring out how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon,\" Burry said. But China's huge lead in building out power sources means companies in the US are \"plowing capital into a race it is structurally positioned to lose.\"\n\nBurry said the US needs to shift its focus from developing more and more \"power hungry\" chips toward advancing \"AI-tuned ASICs\" — application-specific integrated circuits that are designed to do a particular task quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut he said Nvidia has a \"death grip on development\" thanks to its deals with many key players in the AI industry.\n\nNvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Business Insider about Burry's posts.\n\nNvidia stock has surged more than 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.\n\nThe chipmaker raked in about $148 billion of revenue and $77 billion of net income in the first nine months of this year. \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the third-quarter earnings release.\n\nBurry, whose contrarian bet against the US housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack.\n\nHe has made the case to his readers that Nvidia and other AI companies are inflating a historic tech bubble. He has said that Nvidia's customers have exaggerated the lifespan of its chips to drag out depreciation and boost short-term earnings.\n\nBurry has also called out the \"give-and-take\" deals between Nvidia and chip buyers such as OpenAI and Oracle, and criticized Nvidia's stock-based compensation as excessive.\n\nNvidia previously responded to his critiques in a memo to Wall Street analysts that was quickly leaked. Burry fired back that the document featured \"one straw man after another\" and he stood by his analysis.\n\nReplying to a subsequent comment on his Substack, Burry wrote that Nvidia had \"become too much of a focus.\" While the company's response did make him \"think to look a little deeper,\" he said it was a \"relatively small short\" for him.\n\n\"I believe it will fall, and is a pure play on my overall thesis, but it is not the worst out there.\"",

    "description": "This tech giant's early entry into the AI space has helped it build a substantial revenue backlog that could propel its shares higher in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft's stock needs to appreciate by 41% from current levels to achieve a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nThe company's AI tools are gaining terrific traction in the productivity space, while its cloud business is also booming.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush expects Microsoft to become a $5 trillion company next year, and it won't be surprising to see the company indeed hitting that milestone.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly became the first company to cross a $5 trillion market cap just a couple of months ago, driven by the company's remarkable revenue and earnings growth on account of its dominance of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\n\nHowever, the share price of the chip giant has pulled back since then, even though it continues to maintain terrific growth despite its massive size. Concerns about the AI boom becoming a bubble and the sustainability of the heavy infrastructure spending that has driven Nvidia's phenomenal growth over the past three years have begun to weigh on the stock.\n\nBut there's another company -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- that's making the most of the proliferation of AI. One analyst believes that this \"Magnificent Seven\" company could hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2026. Let's take a closer look at Microsoft's prospects and why it could hit the $5 trillion market cap milestone in the new year.\n\nThere is no denying that Nvidia's chips have played a crucial role in the widespread adoption of AI technology. However, the computing power provided by its chips is eventually harnessed to create customer-facing solutions. For example, training OpenAI's ChatGPT wouldn't have been possible without Nvidia's chips, but the chatbot became popular because of what it was doing for users.\n\nFrom helping users write emails to creating images to drafting documents and writing code, ChatGPT's versatility and productivity have been the key reasons behind its raging success. Not surprisingly, ChatGPT parent OpenAI points out that it now has more than 1 million paying enterprise customers, while more than 800 million users use ChatGPT every week.\n\nMicrosoft made a smart move in 2019 by investing in OpenAI. It still holds a 27% stake in OpenAI, a company reportedly worth $500 billion. However, more than the financial aspect, OpenAI provided Microsoft with access to large language models (LLMs) and applications, enabling it to build a wide portfolio of AI-powered tools and deploy them across its offerings.",

    "description": "Several AWS customers have complained about rising cloud costs in the AI era. Capital One is the latest, and one of the biggest.",
    "fullText": "Capital One is concerned about AI costs rising via its cloud-computing relationship with Amazon and may be looking for alternatives, according to an internal Nvidia document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nIn the document, an Nvidia employee wrote that the chip giant talked with Capital One about AI infrastructure alternatives to Amazon Web Services, as the bank was \"looking to control costs.\"\n\nThe Nvidia staffer was recapping discussions with Capital One in an internal email after meeting representatives from the bank at a recent tech conference.\n\n\"They see their need for GPUs and reasoning models growing and the costs in AWS will soon get out of hand,\" the Nvidia employee wrote, referring to Capital One.\n\nNvidia and Capital One discussed \"AI factory and neo-clouds,\" according to the email. An AI factory is an in-house data center that a company can build to train and run AI models as an alternative to renting compute from a third party. Financial institutions can use this infrastructure for tasks such as fraud detection, customer support, and algorithmic trading, according to Nvidia.\n\nNeoclouds are upstart cloud providers, often powered by Nvidia hardware, that focus on AI workloads, whereas AWS supports a much broader range of computing needs. Top neocloud players include CoreWeave, Lambda, Crusoe, and Nebius. Nvidia has been working closely with several of these players, in part to reduce its reliance on established cloud giants as customers.\n\nThe Capital One situation underscores a key dynamic in the AI boom. Companies are racing to adopt generative AI but also trying to mitigate rising cloud costs. This new technology has great promise, but developing and running AI models and AI applications can be expensive.\n\nLarge companies also regularly assess their cloud spending, including varying setups that increasingly incorporate multiple providers. Forty-three percent of companies use more than two public cloud providers, according to a recent RBC Capital report.\n\n\"We continue to be committed to AWS as our predominant strategic cloud partner,\" a Capital One spokesperson wrote in a statement. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\n\"Our pricing philosophy is to work relentlessly to take cost out of our own cost structure and to pass those savings back to our AWS customers in the form of lower prices,\" an AWS spokesperson said. \"It's easy to lower prices, it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices, and at AWS we work really hard at that.\"\n\nCapital One isn't the only company taking issue with AWS costs. Business Insider's Eugene Kim reported in October that AI startups are increasingly delaying traditional AWS spend in favor of AI model and developer tools, according to internal Amazon documents from March and July.\n\nThe documents said that 90% of startups in Radical Ventures' portfolio were building primarily on rival clouds due to AWS costs. Amazon also noted internally that there was increasing demand from customers for neocloud providers, which let them rent GPU power in small chunks and only pay for what they use.\n\nWhen that story published in October, an AWS spokesperson said Business Insider was \"using old data to reach outdated conclusions,\" noting that \"AWS remains the top choice for startups to build because we offer the best core services as well as the most innovative and powerful generative AI offerings.\"\n\nHave a tip?

The stock ended the trading session at 829.9 yuan, up 693%.\n\n\"It's another IPO tale in China that turns a crow into ‌a phoenix,\" said fund manager Yang Tingwu at Tongheng Investment.\n\nThe price surge \"creates huge arbitrage opportunities\" for pre-IPO investors, Yang said, and \"we're likely witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years\".\n\nMakers of artificial intelligence (AI) chips are rushing to sell shares in China to capitalise on interest generated by a government drive to boost local production in competition with the U.S.\n\n\"AI and semiconductors are key areas of competition in the Sino-U.S. tech rivalry,\" Guotai Haitong Securities said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing. \"Against the backdrop of geopolitical tension, AI chipmaking has huge growth potential,\" as China seeks to achieve self-sufficiency.\n\nResearcher ⁠Frost & Sullivan forecast China AI chip sales to top $189 billion ‌by 2029 versus $54 billion in 2026.\n\nMetaX, which makes graphics processing units (GPUs), raised 4.2 billion yuan ($596 million) last week in a share sale that was more than 4,000 times oversubscribed by retail investors.\n\nThe IPO - China's sixth biggest so far this year, according to KPMG - priced the money-losing ‍startup at 50 times its 2024 sales. That compared with a multiple of 34 for Nvidia and 14 for AMD, MetaX said in a pre-listing statement.\n\nMetaX's debut catapulted the value of the five-year-old startup to more than 300 billion yuan ($42.58 billion) and boosted the wealth of founder and major shareholder Chen Weiliang, 49.\n\nAfter working for AMD Shanghai for 13 years, Chen founded MetaX with a mission to \"contribute to China's rejuvenation ​and national prosperity.\" The founding team also included Peng Li and Yang Jian, both former AMD engineers.\n\n\"The company is a leading GPU maker in China thanks to its AMD gene,\" ‌Li Hui, analyst at Huajin Securities, said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing.",

In front of a huge Nvidia logo, he urged the venture capitalists before him to herald “a new industrial revolution”, announced billions of pounds in AI investments and, like Willy Wonka handing out golden tickets, singled out some lucky recipients in the room.\n\n“If you want to get rich, this is where you want to be,” he declared.\n\nBut his biggest party trick was a surprise guest waiting in the wings. At Huang’s cue, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, walked out as the crowd whooped at Huang’s pulling power.\n\nStarmer, looking slightly dazed, saluted his host’s “absolutely phenomenal” presentation, told the audience about how he had been “texting away” with Huang and effusively thanked one of the world’s richest men for his “confidence in what we are doing, in your investment, your foresight”. Huang sent him away with a gift: an inscribed AI processing unit.\n\nNot done, Huang called on to the stage Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, followed by Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for business. The parade of British cabinet ministers at this private Nvidia event spoke volumes about how successfully US tech oligarchs have pulled British politicians – serving and former – into their orbit.\n\nThis week, they landed another big fish. The $500bn Chat GPT maker Open AI hired the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne, prompting him to gush he was joining “the most exciting and promising company in the world”.\n\nHe was just the latest senior figure to pass through the revolving door between Westminster and Silicon Valley. In October, the former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals, and with Microsoft, which has invested heavily in both AI startups. Liam Booth-Smith, Sunak’s chief of staff, who sits in the House of Lords, also this summer took a senior role at Anthropic after it signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government.\n\nThey followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook. Clegg is now an AI investor who last week predicted “we will move from staring at the internet to living in the internet”. He made tens of millions of dollars at Meta. Some reports said as much as $100m. He would not confirm that but said he was paid “extremely well”.\n\nMeanwhile, Tony Blair, prime minister for a decade until 2007, is becoming increasingly influential on technology policy, lobbying successfully, through his Tony Blair Institute (TBI), for the UK to introduce a digital ID.\n\nTBI is part-funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle. A former TBI policy expert, Kirsty Innes, recently became a special adviser to Kendall.\n\nThe Commons science, innovation and technology select committee is monitoring the revolving door situation. Alex Sobel MP, a member of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which is currently investigating AI, said: “I am deeply concerned tech companies may be using their huge buying power to water down much-needed regulation by hiring those who have served at the highest level of previous governments.”\n\nJobs with the biggest US AI companies can be a good fit for frontline politicians because they also require comfort with risk-taking, said one tech company insider. Another advantage is that tech leaders do not tend to demand polished management skills. Meanwhile, their value is growing as AI companies increasingly target their products at government clients as well as businesses and consumers. Osborne’s task appears to be to wedge his foot in the door of governments to help OpenAI to inject its technology into the bloodstream of public systems. It already has government-level arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Germany, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Kazakhstan, but it wants more.\n\nSelling state-level AI is competitive. Palantir, which hosted Starmer at its Washington base in February and signed a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Defence in September, is pushing its systems into health trusts, police forces and local councils in Britain. The company’s UK communications are being led by a former head of strategic communications at Downing Street.\n\nBritain is an important place for AI firms to gain influence: regulations on AI development remain looser than in the EU, its universities foster important innovations, and the UK also has one of the world’s most respected AI safety institutes.\n\nThe revolving door also spins the other way, sending tech industry people into positions of public influence. The UK government last month appointed Raia Hadsell, the vice-president of research at Google DeepMind, as an “AI ambassador”, alongside Tom Blomfield the founder of the online bank Monzo. Blomfield is also a partner at Y Combinator, the San Francisco start-up incubator that used to be led by Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.\n\nCivil servants from the government’s digital service set up a consultancy called Public Digital, which has since won millions of pounds worth of public contracts. One of its partners, Emily Middleton, last year took a senior director general role in the government’s digital service.",

The HBM3E bandwidth advantage over MI300X is impressive but what really caught my eye is how the 126MB L2 cache almost completely offsets the cross-die latency penalty. Ran some FluidX3D variants last quarter and bandwidth-bound workloads like that absolutley benefit more from raw HBM throughput than extra L3 capacity. Dunno if this stays true for transformer inference where the attention mechanism can exploit larger caches, but for traditional HPC the B200's aproach seems optimal.Expand full commentReplyShareNo postsReady for more?",

    "description": "Google's TPU business is ramping up. Here's everything you need to know about Google's AI chips, and what they mean for Nvidia's dominance.",
    "fullText": "Google has been in the AI chip game for more than a decade. Now its custom hardware is moving markets.\n\nShares of Nvidia and other chipmakers tumbled last month following a report that Meta — one of Nvidia's largest customers — was exploring a deal to use Google's AI chips, known as Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs.\n\nGoogle has primarily used its TPUs for internal use, but it also leases them to external customers through the cloud. Nvidia, meanwhile, has become the dominant provider of AI chips with its graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nGoogle has a potential blockbuster business to unlock. In a research note sent December 2, Morgan Stanley projected that 5 million of Google's TPUs will be purchased in 2027 and about 7 million in 2028, significantly increasing its prior projections.\n\nHere's a breakdown of everything you need to know about TPUs, what they're used for, and when they might become a more prominent threat to Nvidia's chip dominance.\n\nOver a decade ago, Google needed more powerful and specialized compute power for the type of AI work it wanted to do. A team led by the now-CEO of Groq, Jonathan Ross, designed a new chip based on a specific type of integrated circuit for machine learning. The TPU was born.\n\nGoogle has continued to improve and refine its TPUs over the years, making them more effective at both training models and inference, the process where a trained model answers a question or performs a task. As large language models have grown in size, Google has also increased the memory bandwidth of later TPUs to handle these bigger workloads.\n\nGoogle says its latest \"Ironwood\" TPU, which the company is making widely available, is more than four times better than its predecessor for both training and inference.\n\nNvidia's GPU cards, which launched in 1999, were originally designed for gaming, not AI. When researchers later discovered that the chips were useful for tasks such as training neural networks, Nvidia doubled down on the AI market.\n\nGoogle's TPUs, on the other hand, were designed for AI from the get-go. Being more specialized means they're more efficient than Nvidia's chips at some tasks, and faster for running select AI models. They have something called a systolic array, which lets a more constant stream of data pass through the chip, rather than having to keep fetching more from memory.\n\nWhere Google's TPUs have a big edge is in cost at scale. It's possible to have thousands of TPUs working in tandem in a single \"pod.\" Because they are faster at some calculations than GPUs, running many TPUs at once can sometimes be more cost-efficient.\n\nThat may become more important as companies increase investments at the inference stage, which Google says its latest TPU is especially good at. That could save companies money.\n\nOne advantage that Nvidia has over Google is its CUDA software, which makes it possible for regular applications to use GPUs for general computing tasks — not just for graphics. CUDA also only works with Nvidia chips, one of the biggest points of friction stopping companies from switching to Google's chips.\n\nGoogle is trying to change that. For example, there is a lot of industry demand to have TPUs better support Pytorch, a popular tool for building AI applications that was created inside Meta. Google is allocating more resources and attention to better supporting Pytorch, which data suggests is seeing much more demand than Google's own Tensorflow software, according to Google employees and industry experts.\n\nWhen it comes to TPUs, Google remains its own biggest customer. It uses the chips across the company to power products like Search and Maps. Its latest Gemini 3 model was trained on TPUs.\n\nWhile Google has prioritized its own needs, it has leased its TPUs to other customers. Apple used TPUs to train its in-house AI model, Business Insider previously reported. In October, Anthropic announced a blockbuster deal with Google that it says will see it using up to 1 million TPUs. Broadcom, which helps build the TPU chips for Google, revealed in its Q4 earnings call this week that it has received a total of $21 billion in orders from Anthropic for Google's Ironwood TPUs.\n\nMeta is also in early testing of Google's TPUs, according to a person familiar with the matter, although it's not clear if it will result in a long-term deal.\n\nGoogle's TPU business could be poised to explode in the coming years. In a research note this month, Morgan Stanley wrote that every 500,000 TPU chips sold could potentially add around $13 billion in revenue to Google's balance sheet in 2027.\n\nHaving TPUs isn't just a potential revenue boost for Google. It also gets a feedback loop in using TPUs to run and train its AI models, learning from them, and changing how it develops its next chips to be better at the things Google needs.\n\nNvidia's GPU is still very much the chip du jour, but other tech giants are increasingly pouring resources into their own custom chips. Amazon just announced its new Trainium3 custom AI chip, which the company says can cut the cost of training and powering AI models in half compared with a GPU.\n\nMany TPU buyers are also Nvidia customers, and some industry insiders told Business Insider that it's more likely that the rise of more specialized chips will see companies and labs diversify the chips they use, rather than going all in on one provider.\n\nThat could still hurt Nvidia, which could lose pricing power as a result of a more diverse market.\n\nHowever, even if Google's TPU business finds more momentum, it doesn't mean Nvidia will suddenly crumble overnight. Jordan Nanos, member of technical staff of research firm SemiAnalysis, said his firm believes companies, including Nvidia, Google, and Amazon, will all \"sell lots\" of chips in the future.\n\n\"We don't see TPU as a significant threat to Nvidia's business, but it has been a real player in the market for many years,\" said Nanos. \"It is possible that Google sells TPU servers externally in the future, to many more customers. Right now, they are very selective.\"\n\nHave something to share? Contact this reporter via email at hlangley@businessinsider.com or Signal at hughlangley.01.

    "fullText": "Warren Buffett has frequently recommended that non-professional investors periodically buy shares of an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers easy exposure to many of the most influential companies in the world, including Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nThe S&P 500 advanced 1,810% during the last three decades, which is equivalent to 10.3% annually, a pace that would turn $400 per month into $835,000 over three decades.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ›\n\nWarren Buffett, who took control of Berkshire Hathaway six decades ago, has earned a reputation as one of the greatest investors in American history. He has consistently given the same advice: Buy an index fund that tracks the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)\n\n\"In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 index fund,\" Buffett told attendees at Berkshire's annual meeting in 2021. He has suggested the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).\n\nHere's how that advice could turn $400 invested monthly into $835,000 over 30 years.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 measures the performance of the S&P 500, which tracks 500 large U.S. companies. It includes value stocks and growth stocks from all 11 stock market sectors, and covers about 80% of domestic equities and 40% of global equities by market value.\n\nThe index fund provides exposure to many of the most influential businesses in the world. The top 10 positions are listed by weight below:\n\nOne risk associated with owning an S&P 500 index fund is the extraordinary concentration of the underlying index. The top 10 companies account for 41% of the S&P 500 by market-cap weight, which means a large decline in two or three of those stocks could really drag on the entire index.\n\nHowever, the top 10 companies also account for approximately 33% of the S&P 500's earnings, so the statistic is not as alarming as many pundits make it out to be. Their price-to-earnings multiples are above average, but their strong competitive positions warrant premium valuations.\n\nThere is a simple reason Warren Buffett believes an S&P 500 index fund is the best way for the average investor to get stock market exposure: Buying individual stocks requires more work than most people are willing to take on, and beating the S&P 500 is challenging even for professional money managers.",

    "fullText": "Young tech talent hoping to land a job in the private sector has a new way in: the public sector.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration announced the launch of the United States Tech Force on Monday, a two-year program that offers participants federal government jobs and eventual recruitment opportunities for private sector roles.\n\nThe government is partnering with at least 28 tech companies on the program, including Apple, Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Dell, Box, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, Palantir, Oracle, Uber, and xAI, among others.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management is spearheading the early-career program in partnership with other agencies. Participants will be placed at agencies across the government to work on modernization projects and, in part, implement AI, according to the Tech Force website.\n\nTech Force plans to hire around 1,000 applicants to start, according to the site, and is looking for people \"highly skilled in the areas of software engineering, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data analytics, or technical project management.\"\n\nApplicants will submit an application, complete a technical assessment, have interviews with agency leaders, and undergo a background test. OPM will do the initial resume review and technical assessment before passing the hiring decisions off to individual agencies, OPM Director Scott Kupor said during a call before the announcement.\n\nPrivate sector partners can provide training resources and mentorship opportunities, and have committed to considering Tech Force participants for employment after the two years, according to the site. Kupor said on Monday's call that there will also be a speaker series featuring company CEOs. The program, he added, will end with public- and private-sector job fairs.\n\nCompanies haven't made any firm hiring commitments, Kupor said on the call.\n\n\"It wouldn't be appropriate for us to ask companies to hire people without knowing who those people are,\" Kupor said. He added that he'll \"be certainly disappointed\" if the program doesn't lead to hiring by the private-sector partners.\n\nSalaries will likely range from around $130,000 to $195,000, Kupor said. There are no specific degree or experience requirements for the positions, which will be posted on USA Jobs. Those interested are encouraged \"to apply as soon as possible\" on the site. Kupor said he hopes to get everybody hired by the end of March.\n\nThe roles are largely based in Washington, DC, and remote work options will depend on the agency and role, according to the site. They're non-partisan positions and are entirely distinct from the US DOGE Service.\n\nThough the Tech Force is primarily an early-career program, the government is also seeking \"experienced engineering managers from private sector partners,\" the site says.

    "fullText": "TAIPEI/SINGAPORE, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Taiwan's tech-heavy stocks show few signs of slowing a rally even as AI bubble worries cast a shadow over global markets, underscoring home-grown confidence in the structural advantages in AI that foreign investors may have overlooked.\n\nTaiwan's benchmark index is poised to breach ​a record 30,000 points in 2026, investors say, extending a three-year surge that has seen the stock market nearly double as the island rides a wave of demand ‌for chips that power artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile foreign money worries about stretched AI valuations, Taiwanese investors have enthusiastically ploughed into the market.\n\nAnalysts say domestic investors are betting on Taiwan's unique position as the lynchpin of an AI supply chain, where ‌even increasing competition in the sector would only benefit Taiwanese firms, including TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.\n\nOne major focus of anxiety around AI comes from uncertainty about Nvidia's ability to sustain its market dominance, with Google's tensor processing units (TPUs) emerging as a potentially more cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nBut it's a win-win scenario for Taiwan because the island is essential to supply chains of both the GPU and TPU, the building blocks of AI computing power.\n\n\"Taiwan is a major beneficiary of the AI market,\" said Piter Yang, a fund manager of Fuh Hwa Securities Investment Trust Co, citing the ⁠advantage of Taiwan being the world's semiconductor hub.\n\nAnd for now, as ‌a promising future fuels optimism, Taiwan markets and local investors seem relatively unfazed by the AI bubble fears, just as they remain calm in the face of rising geopolitical tensions with Beijing that have often spooked foreign investors.\n\nGains in Taiwan's market have also been underpinned ‍by earnings growth, leaving it with a reasonably steady price-to-earnings ratio of 21, below that of the Nasdaq and the Nikkei, meaning the rally has not made stocks more expensive.\n\n\"We are not worried about an AI bubble,\" said Li Fang-kuo, chairman of the securities investment arm of food conglomerate Uni-President. \"We are comfortable with where the valuations stand.\"\n\nLi pointed out that several of the magnificent seven companies in the U.S. have gross ​margins of as much as 70% or higher. \"So it's not comparable to the dot-com bubble, when companies were not generating meaningful earnings.\"",

    "description": "Jensen Huang biography author Stephen Witt explains why Google's self-developed AI model, Gemini, could pose a threat to Nvidia's AI dominance",
    "fullText": "Nvidia's (NVDA) AI turf could take a blow if Google (GOOGL, GOOG) keeps firing on all cylinders.\n\n\"The biggest risk right now obviously is Google,\" said Stephen Witt, author of \"The Thinking Machine,\" a Jensen Huang biography.\n\nThat risk, he told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid, is largely tied to Google's Gemini model. Witt described it as the \"best AI right now in the benchmarks outside the Nvidia stack.\"\n\nWitt explained that Gemini was trained entirely on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). If Google proves it can sustain world-leading AI development using only its homegrown chip stack, it sets a potent precedent for other tech giants to follow suit.\n\n\"That's a huge risk,\" Witt said. \"If Google ends up winning this AI race ... Nvidia will be in trouble.\"\n\nThis risk, coupled with competition from rivals like Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), is why \"it's very easy to imagine a world\" where Nvidia's high-flying stock declines. The AI chipmaker's shares are up over 1,270% in the past five years.\n\nTo mitigate the core risk of rivals like Google winning the chip war, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is already looking past generative AI. Witt said a significant amount of the CEO's personal effort is being poured into the next great computing wave: robotics.\n\nIf Huang can dominate the robotics wave, he said, \"that will mean several trillion dollars in market capitalization for this company.\"\n\nHowever, Nvidia has another issue: the lack of any clear succession plan.\n\n\"It's just Jensen at the top,\" Witt said. \"There's no second in command. There's no obvious successor.\" He noted that the board has been silent, and Huang has offered no advice on a succession strategy.\n\nThat suggests Nvidia's $4 trillion valuation — which accounts for over 8% of the entire S&P 500 (^GSPC) — is, in many ways, resting solely on Huang's vision.\n\nWitt described Huang as a \"world-class engineer\" who could \"design these microchips himself,\" a skill that whoever takes the helm must also possess. He noted that neither of Huang's two children, who work at the company, has a technical background, making them noncontenders for the top spot.\n\nWitt also provided a look behind the polished stage persona of Huang, known for his trademark leather jacket. Beneath the showmanship is a highly intense, \"almost totally neurotic\" leader who is driven not by optimism, but by fear.\n\n\"He's driven by negative emotions, things like fear of failure, guilt, even shame are what make Jensen get up in the morning and work so hard to make Nvidia succeed,\" Witt explained.",

    "description": "An internal memo, obtained by Business Insider, assessed Microsoft's deployment of cutting-edge GPUs.",
    "fullText": "As Nvidia works to install some of its newest chips in Microsoft data centers, an employee at the GPU giant observed in early fall that Microsoft's cooling approach at one facility seemed \"wasteful.\"\n\nNvidia has been deploying its GB200 Blackwell architecture at Microsoft and other tech giants as demand for compute to train and run AI models surges.\n\nBlackwell, announced in March 2024, is roughly twice as powerful as its predecessor, Hopper, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at launch. GB200 is part of an earlier wave of Blackwell deployments, with the GB300 generation now available.\n\nIn early fall, an internal email sent by a staffer on the Nvidia Infrastructure Specialists (NVIS) team described one Blackwell installation of server racks for OpenAI, which Microsoft supports as its cloud partner and largest investor.\n\nThe email described the setup of two GB200 NVL72 racks, each of which houses 72 Nvidia GPUs. The setup uses liquid cooling technology, given the heat generated by multiple GPUs operating closely in tandem.\n\nThe staffer wrote that Microsoft's \"cooling system and data center cooling approach for their GB200 deployment seems wasteful due to the size and lack of facility water use, but does provide a lot of flexibility and fault tolerance,\" according to the memo.\n\nWhile liquid cooling is used for the servers, data centers also use a second, building-level system to expel heat from the facility, according to Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California.\n\nThe Nvidia employee may have been referring to a building-level system that uses air-cooling instead of water, explained Ren, who studies how data centers use water and other resources.\n\n\"This type of cooling system tends to be using more energy,\" he said, \"but it doesn't use water.\"\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson described a cooling setup consistent with Ren's two-phase explanation.\n\n\"Microsoft's liquid cooling heat exchanger unit is a closed-loop system that we deploy in existing air-cooled data centers to enhance cooling capacity on first and third-party platforms,\" the Microsoft spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.\n\n\"These systems ensure we maximize our existing global data center footprint for scale while promoting efficient heat dissipation and optimizing power delivery to meet the demands of AI and hyperscale systems,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nAs AI infrastructure expands, energy and water use in data-center cooling have become flashpoints globally, prompting pushback in some regions where new facilities are being built.\n\nRen noted that because data centers can use air cooling, water cooling, or a hybrid system at the building level, \"there's a trade-off\" between resources.\n\nAir cooling requires more energy, but can \"address some of the public concerns with water consumption — because water is something people can really see,\" he said.\n\n\"These companies are profit-driven,\" he added, \"they weigh in the water cost, the energy cost, and also the publicity cost.\"\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, said it intends to be \"carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste\" by 2030.\n\n\"We've also announced a zero water cooling design for our next-generation data centers and breakthroughs in on-chip cooling,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe internal email from the Nvidia staffer described some logistical hiccups that occurred during the Blackwell installation in early fall, which can be typical in the early deployment of new data center hardware.\n\n\"Onsite support for this activity was a necessity,\" the staffer wrote. \"Many hours were spent creating the validation process documentation as well as vetting the steps worked and made sense to those less familiar with how cluster and system validation is usually performed.\"\n\nAdditionally, the handover processes between Nvidia and Microsoft \"required a lot more solidification than what was performed before arrival.\"\n\nStill, the memo suggested Blackwell's production hardware quality had improved compared to early samples.\n\nThe email said GB200 NVL72 production hardware \"has good quality\" compared to the qualified samples sent to customers for early testing. Both racks had a 100% pass rate on certain compute performance tests.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider that its Blackwell systems \"deliver exceptional performance, reliability, and energy efficiency for a wide variety of computing applications.\"\n\n\"Our customers, including Microsoft, have successfully deployed hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GB200 and GB300 NVL72 systems to meet the world's growing need for artificial intelligence,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "description": "AI spending is front and center again for investors. Oracle plunged Thursday, with top hardware makers including Nvidia and Broadcom also dropping.",
    "fullText": "Oracle just raised a fresh red flag for investors worried that tech companies are getting ahead of themselves when it comes it their massive capex spending.\n\nOracle stock plunged 14% on Thursday after the tech giant reported an earnings beat but delivered revenue that was below Wall Street estimates, posting $16.06 billion compared to $16.21 billion expected by analysts. Cloud sales rose 34% from the previous quarter but also fell short of estimates.\n\nImportantly, Oracle also pledged to spend about $15 billion more next year than previously forecast, sparking fresh concerns about aggressive capex among the biggest tech firms.\n\nThe tech titan's stock drop was enough to weigh on other AI names and drag markets lower in Thursday's session.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood at the 9:30 a.m. ET opening bell on Thursday:\n\n• Nasdaq 100: 25,563.72, down 0.8%\n\nOracle stock has been highly volatile lately, dropping almost 20% in the last month after a huge surge following a blockbuster revenue forecast issued in September.\n\nIt's flurry of deals cemented the company as an AI power player, announcing a $300 billion contract with OpenAI, new partnership commitments with both Nvidia and Meta Platforms, and plans to expand its AI and cloud computing infrastructure in booming international markets.\n\nNow Oracle's lackluster earnings are prompting speculation that its big plans in the space are going to take awhile to payoff, and that it's spending plans are too ambitious. Morgan Stanley described the results as a moment when investors might resume their disbelief about the AI trade.\n\n\"Cloud growth at the low-end of the guide with building pressure on gross margins and op margins may further sap investor confidence in ORCL's ability to execute efficiently against a large and growing book of GPUaaS business, leaving the shares lacking a clear catalyst,\" analysts at the bank wrote on Thursday.\n\nSeveral other high-growth AI stocks were pulled down by Oracle's earnings report, dragging down the entire S&P 500 index, which fell 0.31% in premarket hours, while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite index rose slightly.\n\nHere are some of the biggest losers on Thursday:\n\nFor many investors, it is likely concerning that a company like Oracle could manage to fall short of analyst estimates after doing so much to position itself as an AI infrastructure leader this year. The key takeaway is likely that the company overpromised on what it could deliver.\n\n\"Oracle faces its own mounting scrutiny over a debt-fueled data center build-out and concentration risk amid questions over the outcome of AI spending uncertainty,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne. \"This revenue miss will likely exacerbate concerns among already cautious investors about its OpenAI deal and its aggressive AI spending.\n\nThe concerns aren't limited to Oracle. While some have recently argued that the biggest AI fears may be overblown, it's possible that if one major tech player overspent on AI in 2025, others may have done the same. This could weigh on investor sentiment around AI as the market heads into 2026.",

    "description": "Chris Lattner helped build the software behind Google TPUs. Now he's coming after Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, where bold technical bets abound, few bets look bolder than trying to break the grip of Nvidia's CUDA, a software stack that's quietly become the operating system of the AI boom.\n\nThat's what Modular, a startup founded by software gurus from Apple and Google, is trying to do.\n\nCofounders Chris Lattner and Tim Davis have spent decades building the software plumbing that sits beneath the modern tech industry. Lattner is famous for creating Apple's Swift programming language. He also built the software underpinning Google's TPU AI chips, with Modular cofounder Tim Davis.\n\nThey're now aiming that expertise at CUDA itself. The attempt borders on madness, but it's the kind of audacious project that could transform the AI industry.\n\n\"It's seen by a lot of people as somewhat crazy,\" said Kylan Gibbs, CEO of startup Inworld AI and a former product manager at Google DeepMind. \"That's where Chris has the advantage: He's smart enough to actually know how to do it, and somewhat crazy enough to set out to do it.\"\n\nCUDA began life almost 20 years ago as a way to make graphics chips programmable. Today, it has grown into a multilayered software ecosystem — language, libraries, compilers, inference systems — that most AI companies rely on.\n\nThat success comes at a cost: Most of the industry is now optimized around a single vendor's hardware. CUDA binds AI workloads to Nvidia GPUs. That is great for Nvidia, but deeply limiting for everyone else.\n\nOn the surface, there seems to be a ton of competition: AMD sells GPUs. Google has TPUs. Amazon created Trainium AI chips, and a host of startups are building similar hardware.\n\nThe problem is that each chip comes with its own software stack optimized just for that component. That means an endless reinvention of the wheel. Most of the time, it's simpler to just stick with CUDA — and Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nAnd yet, AI developers crave portability: Being able to use any combination of GPUs from multiple providers without juggling different software stacks.\n\n\"Nobody is building portable stuff, because why would anyone work on software for more than one chip when the chip projects themselves are doing the software?\" Lattner, Modular's CEO, told me in an interview.\n\nNvidia could extend CUDA to run well on rival AI chips. But doing so would undermine Nvidia's greatest moat: the closed-loop bond between its software and its chips. \"Obviously, they don't want portability,\" he said.\n\nFor Lattner, this paradox presents a big opportunity.\n\n\"We realized there's nobody in the industry that's actually incentivized to do this. It's very expensive, very hard,\" he said. \"And at the same time, everybody wants it.\"\n\nThat's what inspired Lattner and Davis to leave Google and start Modular in 2022, the year ChatGPT took the world by storm.\n\nSince then, Modular has raised $380 million from investors including Greylock, General Catalyst, and GV, Google's venture capital arm. The latest financing in September valued the startup at $1.6 billion. Modular isn't the only effort to break the CUDA lock-in. There has been ZLUDA, an open-source project that was funded by AMD, and more recently, the startup Spectral Compute, which has raised $6 million.\n\nLattner has used some of this money to hire talented programmers from Google, Apple, and other tech companies. They spent three years working in relative obscurity to create the building blocks of a new AI software stack.\n\nThe foundation starts with a brand-new programming language, called Mojo, that offers deep controls for making AI chips run as efficiently as possible.\n\nModular designed this to work similarly to Python, a popular and easy-to-use programming language. But Mojo also has the speed and power of other, more complex languages, such as C++, that are essential for AI development. Mojo also works well with PyTorch, an open-source framework that is often used when building AI models and applications.\n\nI first heard about Modular earlier this year when interviewing Carles Gelada, a former OpenAI researcher. \"There are several interesting projects to create GPU-agnostic frameworks and platforms, and challenge CUDA,\" he said at the time. \"Mojo is the most interesting one.\"\n\nMAX is the next major layer of Modular's new software stack. It powers AI inference, which is how models are run. This part of the system works with Nvidia GPUs, AMD GPUs, and similar chips from Apple. Modular hopes to add more AI chips in the future.\n\nOn top of that is another layer called Mammoth, which helps AI developers manage GPU clusters.\n\nIn late September, Modular announced that it got top performance out of Nvidia's new Blackwell B200 GPUs and AMD's latest MI355X GPUs — crucially on the same software platform.\n\nLattner said Modular got these AMD GPUs to perform roughly 50% better than when these chips run on AMD's own software.\n\nMore importantly, the ability to run different GPUs on the same software stack now supports the tantalizing opportunity to compare Nvidia's offerings with rival AI chips on a more level playing field.\n\n\"The obvious question is: can MI355X compete with Blackwell?\" Modular wrote in a blog announcing the results. \"Early signs point to yes.\"\n\nGibbs, the CEO of Inworld AI, has been putting Modular's software through its paces in the real world.\n\nInworld builds high-speed, real-time conversational AI technology that supports offerings from big companies, including Disney, NBCUniversal, and Niantic Labs.\n\nEarlier this year, when the startup designed a new text-to-speech AI model and got early access to Nvidia B200 GPUs, they issued Modular a challenge: Cut our costs by 60% and reduce our latency by 40% and we'll work with you.\n\n\"Within about four weeks, we were able to get this incredible performance,\" said Gibbs, who signed a partnership deal with Modular soon after. \"I've bet with my wallet.\"\n\nWhile Inworld was mostly lured by Modular's performance gains on Nvidia's latest GPUs, Gibbs likes the flexibility of using different AI chips more easily in the future, if needed.\n\n\"The promise is that we'd be able to move to new hardware,\" he said. \"Let's say AMD takes off, let's say TPUs take off for Google, or there could be other new hardware that comes online. So it's nice to have that optionality.\"\n\nIn fact, Google's TPUs are suddenly having a moment. The internet giant released a new AI model called Gemini 3 to rave reviews recently. That was trained and run using TPUs, and some other AI companies have signed deals to use these chips instead of, or alongside of, Nvidia GPUs.\n\nThat's put Nvidia on the defensive. A project like Modular, with its promise of portability across different AI hardware, adds to this pressure.\n\n\"Nvidia could kill this in a day,\" said Gibbs of the Modular project. \"Nvidia could basically say, 'okay, we don't really care that you run just on Nvidia hardware. Here's a CUDA option that runs on AMD GPUs as well.' It'd be a bit crazy for them to do that, but it's something they could do and that would of course be somewhat bad.\"\n\nFor all Lattner's critique of the industry, he says Modular is not trying to kill Nvidia. In fact, he argues that Nvidia will continue to thrive, even if Modular succeeds spectacularly.\n\n\"We're trying to build something like Android, but for AI hardware,\" he told me, referring to Google's mobile operating system that powers most of the world's smartphones.\n\nDespite billions of people using Android devices, this success didn't kill iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. iPhones still rule in the US, for example.\n\nLattner thinks something similar will happen in AI as Modular's software makes other hardware more competitive, giving developers more freedom, and chipping away at the industry's single-vendor monoculture.\n\n\"So Nvidia doesn't have to die, but we do want more competition. We do want more innovation,\" he said. \"I think that's good for the world.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Export-controlled technology worth US$30 million with fake brand labels was allegedly addressed to a facility near Toronto’s Pearson airport",
    "fullText": "A Chinese-born Canadian citizen who lives in Mississauga, Ont., was arrested in Virginia by the FBI and charged with trying to smuggle restricted high-tech Nvidia computer chips used in AI processing to China\n\nU.S. authorities seized export-controlled technology worth about $30 million that was addressed to an air freight facility in Mississauga, close to Toronto Pearson International Airport, according to allegations filed in court.\n\nNvidia labels on the components had been removed and replaced with labels for a fake company, authorities said.\n\nThe arrest of Benlin Yuan, of Mississauga, immediately west of Toronto, and the large shipment destined for Toronto are part of Operation Gatekeeper, described by U.S. authorities as targeting “a sophisticated illicit procurement conspiracy and smuggling network that orchestrates buying and exporting controlled high-tech computer chips to China.”\n\nYuan is described in U.S. prosecution documents as president of an information technology company based in Virginia that provides data centre services and IT support and consulting in Canada and the United States. The documents say it is a subsidiary of a Chinese company based in Beijing.\n\nHe was arrested in Sterling, Virginia, on Nov. 28 and charged with conspiring to violate export control acts.\n\nThe network is accused of purchasing at least US$50 million worth of GPUs from a large U.S. technology company.\n\nThe computer products Yuan is alleged to be involved in exporting are Nvidia A100, H100, and H200 Tensor Core graphic processing units, known as GPUs, and HGX baseboards. The equipment is used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications and in high-performance computing. The chips can handle huge amounts of data that is needed in AI applications, an exploding field that is revolutionizing technology.\n\nThe GPUs can perform calculations at higher speeds than most previous computers.\n\nSince about November 2023, a Chinese company has worked to import these chips from the United States, prosecutors allege. The entire plot is alleged to have involved US$160 million in tech goods.\n\nYuan is accused of joining the conspiracy this spring.\n\nIn a criminal complaint sworn by a special agent in the U.S. Department of Commerce, Yuan helped buy the technology using straw purchasers and intermediaries, meaning in the name of a person or company that is not the real end buyer.\n\nThe buyers allegedly declared the goods were for use by customers within the United States or in countries that do not require an export licence, including Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nAt various U.S. warehouses, Nvidia labels were allegedly removed from the computer circuits and relabeled with a fake manufacturing brand of SANDKYAN, according to the criminal complaint against Yuan.\n\nWhen preparing the items for export, the shipping paperwork misclassified the products as harmless and unrestricted pieces of tech: “adapters,” “adapter modules,” and “computer controllers,” authorities claim.\n\nThey were then shipped, directly or indirectly, to China.\n\nInvestigators received a tip about pallets of suspicious GPUs at a New Jersey warehouse that were addressed to companies in China.\n\nAn undercover agent was sent inside, where he spent an hour.\n\nThe agent allegedly saw two engineers who appeared to be of Chinese origin unboxing Nvidia components. One of the engineers spoke to the undercover agent in Mandarin, documents say. The engineers said they had to cover up all of the Nvidia branding on the equipment for “export purposes,” court filings allege.\n\nThe agent watched Nvidia labels being pulled off and new ones for the fake firm put in their place. The next day the agent returned and found the boxes had been resealed. The products were now labeled as having been “Made in Taiwan.”\n\nNot only were those packages addressed for shipping to Toronto, but warehouse employees told agents they recently had several similar tech exports to Canada.\n\nThe packages were removed and secured in a government warehouse. That sparked a flow of complaint calls and demand letters about the missing GPUs. The people expecting the goods believed the undercover officer had stolen the products and started negotiating to have them returned, authorities allege.\n\nThey offered $1 million to get their packages back, but insisted the equipment be inspected before payment was made.\n\nYuan is accused of organizing the “inspection.”\n\nHe is accused of recruiting and arranging the group of inspectors and of being one of the six who arrived to examine the packages, about two weeks after the seizure, court filings allege.\n\nThe inspection arrangements were allegedly planned in a group chat using an encrypted communication app and confirmed later over a video conferencing app.\n\nYuan was told by a high-level representative of the buyer in China to make sure no one said the items were destined for China, according to the criminal complaint. He is accused of helping them develop an elaborate “compliance backstory” to justify the products based on false information.\n\nThey also allegedly discussed how to make the million-dollar payment and Yuan was told to send copies of the driver’s licences of everyone on the inspection team. Three trucks were arranged for the pick up.\n\nHe is also accused of handling the storage of a different shipment of Nvidia products destined for China. A cooperating witness for U.S. prosecutors alleged that Yuan told him not to put fake labels on this one as he thought they looked suspicious; he would rather the Nvidia labels just be removed.\n\nAlexander Blanchard, a Virginia-based lawyer for Yuan, declined to comment about Yuan or the case when asked by National Post.\n\n“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said Nicholas Ganjei, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.\n\n“These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control AI technology; the country that controls AI technology will control the future.”\n\nU.S. regulation restricts the export of items that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of other nations or could be detrimental to the foreign policy or national security of the United States.\n\nAdvanced computing integrated circuits, including certain Nvidia-manufactured GPUs were added to the export restriction list in 2022. Some of the latest Nvidia chips have been classed by the U.S. as “critical technologies” that China could use to “modernize its military capabilities in ways that threaten the national security interests of the United States and its allies,” according to export regulations.\n\nThe chips require a special licence to export to China.\n\nOn Monday, the same day Operation Gatekeeper was announced, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States will allow Nvidia’s H200 processors to be exported to China with a 25 per cent fee.\n\nAlan Hao Hsu, also known as Haochun Hsu, 43, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company both pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities in October as part of Operation Gatekeeper.\n\nNewly unsealed court documents say Hsu received more than US$50 million in wire transfers from China to help fund the scheme. He is scheduled for sentencing in February.\n\nFanyue Gong, also known as Tom Gong, 43, a citizen of China who lives in Brooklyn, New York, was also charged in the probe. He is described as the owner of a New York technology company. He was arrested in New York on Dec. 3, and charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the United States.\n\nFive unnamed co-conspirators are linked to IT companies based in Hong Kong or Shenzhen, a city on the Pearl River that acts as a bridge between Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\n• Email: ahumphreys@postmedia.com | X: AD_Humphreys\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

    "fullText": "Ever heard of a chipmaker called \"SANDKYAN?\"\n\nNo? That's because it doesn't exist — it was the fake company name involved in what US authorities are saying was a \"sophisticated\" AI chip-smuggling operation.\n\nOn Monday, prosecutors announced they have arrested several parties in connection with an operation that involved smuggling Nvidia's most advanced AI chips to China and Hong Kong in violation of US export control laws.\n\nAmong those are Fanyue \"Tom\" Gong, a 43-year-old tech-company owner in New York, and Benlin Yuan, a 58-year-old Canadian executive. They were arrested on December 3 and November 28, respectively, after investigators linked them to the trafficking network, the Department of Justice said in a press release published Monday.\n\nThe Nvidia chips, known as GPUs, are used to train cutting-edge AI models and high-performance computing systems. They are tightly restricted due to their potential military applications.\n\n\"These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications,\" said US Attorney Nicholas Ganjei for the Southern District of Texas, adding that the smuggling operation threatened national security.\n\nYuan's lawyer told Business Insider he had no comment about the cases. A representative for Gong could not immediately be identified.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider that the export system is \"rigorous and comprehensive\" and that it will \"continue to work with the government and our customers to ensure that second-hand smuggling does not occur.\"\n\nIt comes as President Donald Trump on Monday announced his approval for Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China under a plan that includes a 25% payment to the US.\n\nProsecutors said the smuggling operation relied on falsified paperwork, shell companies, and covert relabeling.\n\nThe people involved purchased GPUs through straw buyers and intermediaries who claimed the hardware was destined for US customers or countries that don't require export licenses, prosecutors said.\n\nOnce the chips reached US warehouses, the DOJ said, workers under Gong's direction removed Nvidia labels and then rebranded the GPUs as \"SANDKYAN,\" a fake company name.\n\nShipping documents were also rewritten to classify the GPUs as generic computer parts, the DOJ said.\n\nThe mislabeled GPUs were then exported covertly to China, Hong Kong, and other restricted destinations, often routed through a Hong Kong logistics firm and a China-based AI company.\n\nYuan, who ran the US arm of a Beijing IT company, recruited inspectors and instructed them not to disclose the GPUs' true destination, Ganjei said.\n\nProsecutors said Yuan also helped craft false explanations when federal authorities detained certain shipments.\n\nThe arrests are part of \"Operation Gatekeeper,\" a wider crackdown that earlier led Texas businessman Alan Hao Hsu and his company to plead guilty to smuggling offenses. According to court documents unsealed on December 8, Hsu exported or attempted to export $160 million worth of Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips to China, Hong Kong, and other prohibited countries.\n\nProsecutors said they seized more than $50 million in GPUs and cash from Hsu's operation. The activity took place between October 2024 and May 2025, the DOJ said.\n\nGong and Yuan remain in custody pending further proceedings. Yuan was charged with conspiring to violate the Export Control Reform Act, while Gong was charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the US. If convicted, Yuan faces up to 20 years in prison. Gong faces up to 10 years.",

    "fullText": "Commerce department finalising deal to allow H200 chips to be sold to China as strict Biden-era restrictions relaxed\n\nDonald Trump has cleared the way for Nvidia to begin selling its powerful AI computer chips to China, marking a win for the chip maker and its CEO, Jensen Huang, who has spent months lobbying the White House to open up sales in the country.\n\nBefore Monday’s announcement, the US had prohibited sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips to China over national security concerns.\n\nTrump posted to Truth Social on Monday: “I have informed President Xi, of China, that the United States will allow NVIDIA to ship its H200 products to approved customers in China, and other Countries, under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security. President Xi responded positively!”\n\nTrump said the Department of Commerce was finalising the details and that he was planning to make the same offer to other chip companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel. Nvidia’s H200 chips are the company’s second most powerful, and far more advanced than the H20, which was originally designed as a lower-powered model for the Chinese market that would not breach restrictions, but which the US banned anyway in April.\n\nThe president said the US would receive 25% of the proceeds, more than the 15% previously agreed to with Nvidia in an earlier deal to lift restrictions, and following similar unorthodox plans for the federal government to take a financial cut from private business dealings.\n\nIn August, Trump said the US would receive a 10% stake in the tech company Intel. Some lawmakers have questioned the legality of such arrangements.\n\nAccording to the Hill, the Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andy Kim of New Jersey sent letters to the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, last week outlining their concerns over selling these chips to China and saying it risked powering the country’s “surveillance, censorship and military applications”.\n\nThey wrote: “I urge you to stop ignoring the input of bipartisan members of Congress and your own experts in order to cut deals that trade away America’s national security.”\n\nOn social media, Warren called for Huang to appear before Congress to testify under oath.\n\nHuang has worked closely with Trump since the inauguration and has made several trips to the White House. The CEO attended the president’s AI summit in July, met Trump as recently as last week and was even a guest at the White House dinner for the Saudi crown price, Mohammed bin Salman. Huang has pledged to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years.\n\nHuang has visited China several times, meeting officials and Chinese tech executives, as US bans were variously lifted and reintroduced. Earlier this year, China imposed its own controls on the imports of Nvidia chips, with top tech firms reportedly instructed to cancel orders, citing national security concerns and confidence in China’s domestic chip development.\n\nIn October, Huang said Nvidia has gone from having 95% of the Chinese market to having none, and called the bans a “strategic mistake”.\n\nSelling chips to China, the world’s second largest economy, could now mean a windfall worth billions of dollars for Nvidia, which is already valued at $4.5tn.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said: “We applaud President Trump’s decision.” He said offering the H200 chips “to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America”.\n\nThe Nvidia spokesperson and Trump said the move would support US jobs and manufacturing.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump condemned the Biden administration’s policies, which imposed strict export controls on powerful chips. The Biden administration had said withholding such technology from China bolstered US competition, protected national security and hampered AI development in China.\n\n“That Era is OVER!” Trump wrote. “My Administration will always put America FIRST.”\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry said it had noted the reports. “China has always adhered to the principle that China and the United States can achieve mutual benefit and win-win results through cooperation,” the spokesperson said.\n\nMa Jihua, a telecom industry analyst, told the state media outlet the Global Times that years of US curbs on AI exports had “provided a rare chance of China’s domestic chip industry to grow and catch up”.",
