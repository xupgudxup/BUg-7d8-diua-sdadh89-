    "description": "Andrew Left says SanDisk is vulnerable to competition from Samsung, which has the power to flood the market with cheaper memory capacity.",
    "fullText": "Andrew Left thinks he sees a big mismatch between investor perception and reality when it comes to SanDisk stock.\n\nSanDisk has been on a tear, surging more than 1,200% in six months as the market eyes a shortage of memory capacity that's driving up pricing power for companies in the space. Yet, Left thinks the stock is highly overvalued, laying out in an X post why his firm, Citron Research, is shorting the shares.\n\nLeft has expressed skepticism that certain tech stocks can continue to rally, citing fellow AI standout Palantir as another example of an overhyped and overvalued name. He used a different company to illustrate the problem he sees with SanDisk, though.\n\n\"The market is pricing SanDisk like it's $NVDA,\" Left wrote. \n\"There's one problem: NVIDIA has a moat. SanDisk sells a commodity. We've seen this movie before 2008, 2012, 2018. It's never different this time. Memory is a cycle, and cycles peak.\"\n\nSanDisk, Left says, is particularly vulnerable to competition from Samsung, which he calls the \"800-pound gorilla\" that's been in the space for 30 years.\n\nLeft's post comes as markets reprice certain AI trades, with a brutal sell-off in recent weeks hammering many tech sectors.\n\nBut in his view, the bigger problem isn't new companies disrupting the space, but a bigger incumbent muscling into SanDisk's territory. Left thinks Samsung will ultimately flood the industry with lower-cost memory chips, leaving SanDisk unable to compete.\n\n\"They're not just the capacity gorilla anymore,\" Left said, of Samsung. \"They're going after SanDisk's best customers with cheaper, newer technology. And the only thing keeping supply tight right now? Samsung's temporary yield problems in another product line. \nThat bottleneck has an expiration date.\"\n\nWhen it reaches that inflection point, Left expects SanDisk stock to start trading at lower levels, though he has not specified a price target.\n\n\"Shorting [SNDK] is skating to where the puck is going,\" he wrote. \"By the time the cycle normalizes, this stock will already be much lower.\n\nLeft isn't the only finance pro who sees it as an effective short play. Former JPMorgan quant chief Marko Kolanovic posted on Monday that bets against memory chip stocks are likely to pay off, naming SanDisk as a specific example.",

In December, it decided to allow Chinese firms to buy the second most advanced AI chips, though these shipments have stalled.\n\nA new twist came earlier this week, when Reuters reported that Chinese AI lab DeepSeek had trained its newest model on Nvidia's top-tier Blackwell chips at a data center, likely in Inner Mongolia. While Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has continued to advocate for expanded access to the Chinese market, the latest development underscores how China remains one of Nvidia's biggest geopolitical flashpoints heading into earnings.\n\nNvidia has led the AI boom thanks to demand for its GPUs to train large language models. But, as my colleague Ali Barr recently pointed out, the game is changing from training models to actually running them — a task known as inference.\n\nIn December, Nvidia acquired Groq, an inference-focused chipmaker, sending a big signal that it's shifting with the times. However, there's still an opportunity for rivals to take advantage of this transition. Investors will want reassurance that Nvidia's crown isn't about to slip as inference takes off.\n\nEven if Nvidia beats earnings estimates, the chipmaker's numbers are more likely to be \"heavily scrutinized\" by investors after a report from Citrini Research went viral earlier in the week, according to Hardika Singh, an economic strategist at Fundstrat Research.\n\nIn the report, written as a hypothetical look back from 2028, the research firm outlined a scenario in which the AI boom leads to a white-collar recession and a stock market crash sometime in the next two years.\n\nEven if Nvidia beats earnings estimates, the chipmaker's numbers are more likely to be \"heavily scrutinized\" by investors after a report from Citrini Research went viral earlier in the week, according to Hardika Singh, an economic strategist at Fundstrat Research.\n\nIn the report, written as a hypothetical look back from 2028, the research firm outlined a scenario in which the AI boom leads to a white-collar recession and a stock market crash sometime in the next two years.\n\n\"I don't expect too many fireworks this time around,\" Singh wrote in a client note, pointing to Nvidia's historical performance after reporting earnings. \"Investors are already on edge about the AI trade, given how a simple hypothetical scenario in a Substack article caused a selloff in shares of everything from DoorDash to Mastercard.\"\n\n\"The timing particularly sucks for Nvidia, which just can't seem to catch a break,\" she added.\n\nThe bar is high for Nvidia, even more so this quarter as investors rethink parts of the AI trade.

We see hyperscaler capex as the clearest real-time indicator of AI demand,\" said Lauren Goodwin, the chief market strategist at New York Life Investments, in an email on Tuesday. \"As long as companies continue to deploy capital aggressively into AI infrastructure, we do not see evidence of a rollover in this theme.

Any hint of negativity could mean trouble for the stock and the rest of the AI trade.\n\n\"They're going to have to say that they're seeing year-to-year growth, and that number has to be healthy. It doesn't have to be as healthy as how it's been growing here, but staying steady and growing at that year-to-year clip is what's going to be important,\" Rahbari wrote. \"If they mention any type of slowdown, if they say that year-to-year growth is going to be significantly lower, or if they pull back on investing in some of their own customers, that's going to signal that demand for the chips is lower.\"",

    "description": "DGX Spark is a desktop AI supercomputer that packs 128GB of unified memory and 1 PFLOP-class Grace Blackwell (GB10) performance into a palm-sized box. However, its internal GPU belongs to the SM12x series, distinct from the data center-grade Blackwell (SM100). This creates a subtle architectural gap: the latest LLM stacks, heavily reliant on MLA·DSA-specific kernels like GLM-5, \"Blackwell support\" alone doesn't guarantee immediate compatibility. This creates a subtle architectural gap requiring separate code management for Hopper, data center Blackwell, and consumer Blackwell. The engineering team examines Spark, which is based on Blackwell but features a slightly different architecture.",
    "fullText": "Scaling the Blackwell Architecture, © NVIDIA\n\nIn October 2025, NVIDIA released the DGX Spark, a compact AI supercomputer designed to bring datacenter-class AI performance to a desktop form factor. Built on the Grace Blackwell architecture, the DGX Spark packs 128GB of unified memory and 1 PFLOP of AI compute into a 150mm x 150mm chassis, enough to run and fine-tune large language models up to 200B parameters locally. At Lablup, we bought 20 units shortly after launch and have been running them in-house since.\n\nDifferent KV caching techniques, © [liorsinai.github.io](https://liorsinai.github.io/machine-learning/2025/02/22/mla.html)\n\nOur engineering team recently tried running GLM-5 inference on DGX Spark. GLM-5 uses two techniques together: MLA (Multi-head Latent Attention) and DSA (DeepSeek Sparse Attention). When a large language model generates text, it stores Key and Value vectors from previously processed tokens in a memory region called the KV cache,1 and this cache grows rapidly as models get bigger and inputs get longer. MLA compresses the cache into lower-dimensional vectors to save memory, while DSA reduces compute by dynamically selecting only the important tokens for attention calculation instead of attending to every token. MLA was first introduced in DeepSeek-V2 and later adopted by DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-5. GLM-5 adds DSA on top of that, improving both long-context performance and deployment cost. Running these techniques efficiently on GPUs requires specialized kernels,2 and the two most prominent implementations today are DeepSeek's FlashMLA and FlashInfer.\n\nBoth projects explicitly list Blackwell support, so we expected them to work on DGX Spark. They did not. FlashMLA ships two backends: one for SM100 (datacenter Blackwell) and one for SM90 (Hopper). The DGX Spark GPU reports as SM12x (compute capability 12.1), which is compatible with neither. The SM100 kernel requires the tcgen05 instruction and TMEM, a dedicated hardware memory for tensor operations. The SM90 kernel requires WGMMA. SM12x has none of these. FlashAttention had the same problem: SM12x is absent from the supported architecture list, and the runtime printed \"FlashAttention only supports Ampere GPUs or newer.\" FlashAttention 4 (FA4), the Blackwell-specific version under development, only supports SM100.\n\nDGX Spark is Blackwell. The kernels claim to support Blackwell. So why don't they work? Answering that question required looking more carefully at what's inside GB10.\n\nNVIDIA DGX Spark: Powered by the GB10 Superchip, © NVIDIA\n\nGB10 is a multi-die SoC co-designed by NVIDIA and MediaTek. A TSMC 3nm ARM CPU die (ten Cortex-X925 cores plus ten Cortex-A725 cores) connects to a Blackwell GPU die via NVLink C2C, and 128GB of LPDDR5X memory is shared between the CPU and GPU at 273 GB/s bandwidth. The GPU side has 48 SMs,3 6,144 CUDA cores, and delivers 1 PFLOP at sparse FP4. In terms of raw scale, it sits between the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti. Run nvidia-smi and the architecture field reads 'Blackwell.' NVIDIA calls GB10 a \"Grace Blackwell Superchip.\" There is no reason not to call it Blackwell.\n\nBut check the compute capability,4 and a different picture starts to emerge.\n\nCUDA's compute capability numbering reveals that Blackwell is not a single architecture. Datacenter and consumer/edge parts carry different compute capabilities.\n\nRTX 5090 is SM120, DGX Spark is SM121. I'll refer to both as SM12x throughout this post.\n\nThe compute capability numbers split into 10.x and 12.x, and this is not like the Ampere situation where 8.0 and 8.6 diverged within the same major version. The major numbers themselves are different, and 11.x is entirely vacant. Looking back across Pascal (6.0/6.1), Ampere (8.0/8.6), and Hopper/Ada (9.0/8.9), no generation has produced this wide a gap. CUTLASS build flags reflect the split too: datacenter targets use sm100a (architecture-accelerated) while consumer targets use sm120f (family-level), with different suffix conventions.\n\nTensor cores are the dedicated hardware that GPUs use to accelerate matrix multiplication, the core operation of deep learning. The instruction set (ISA6) that drives these tensor cores has changed with each generation.\n\nEficient, pipelined mainloop body used in CUTLASS GEMMs, © [NVIDIA](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/2.11/media/docs/efficient_gemm.md)\n\nMatrix multiplication works by chopping large matrices into small tiles and computing them iteratively. Each tile's intermediate result (the accumulator) needs to be stored somewhere temporarily. From Volta through Hopper, these intermediate results lived in the register file,7 where CUDA cores and tensor cores had to share the same limited space. Datacenter Blackwell (SM100) added TMEM, a dedicated 256KB-per-SM hardware memory sitting next to the tensor cores, along with the tcgen05 instruction to control it. Tensor cores can now operate independently from CUDA cores without competing for register file bandwidth. That is the single biggest architectural change in SM100.\n\nSM12x lacks the TMEM hardware entirely, and therefore does not support the tcgen05 instruction that controls it. The same goes for Hopper's WGMMA: compiling WGMMA code targeting SM12x produces ptxas error: Instruction 'wgmma.fence' not supported on .target 'sm_120'. The tensor core instruction that SM12x actually uses is an extended version of mma.sync, the same instruction family that dates back to Ampere. It adds support for new numeric formats like FP4 and FP6, but the programming model itself is the oldest one available. Looking at the last column of the table, SM100 writes intermediate results to dedicated memory (TMEM), while SM12x reads from and writes to registers, exactly like Ampere. Datacenter Blackwell turned the tensor core into an autonomous compute unit; consumer Blackwell put new data types on top of the oldest programming model.\n\nBecause SM90 kernels use WGMMA, SM100 kernels use tcgen05, and SM12x kernels use extended mma.sync, there is no kernel compatibility among the three architectures. Developers have to maintain three separate code paths.\n\nPorting existing kernels to SM12x is not straightforward, either. A 64x64 matrix tile that SM100 processes in one operation must be broken into 16x8 chunks requiring 32 separate mma.sync calls. Memory load patterns, inter-thread synchronization, and thread organization all need to be redesigned.\n\nNVIDIA shipping different microarchitectures under the same generation name is not new to Blackwell. In the Ampere generation (2020), the datacenter GA100 (A100) was manufactured on TSMC 7nm with 64 FP32 cores per SM and HBM2 memory. The consumer GA102 (RTX 3090), released the same September, used Samsung 8nm, had 128 FP32 cores per SM, and shipped with GDDR6X. GA102 repurposed the Turing-era INT32 datapath to also handle FP32 operations, doubling the shader count per SM, while GA100 skipped that change to focus on FP64 compute and HBM bandwidth. Different fabs, different SM designs, different memory interfaces, same \"Ampere\" branding.\n\nWith Hopper/Ada Lovelace (2022), NVIDIA separated the names outright. Datacenter Hopper (H100, SM90) was announced in March 2022; consumer Ada Lovelace (RTX 4090, SM89) followed in September as a distinct architecture. Compute capabilities were different too: 9.0 for Hopper, 8.9 for Ada Lovelace.\n\nIn Pascal (2016), GP100 (Tesla P100) had NVLink and HBM2; GP102 (GTX 1080 Ti) had neither.\n\nDatacenter chips and consumer chips allocate their transistor budgets differently. Datacenter parts spend die area on FP64 compute, HBM memory bandwidth, NVLink/NVSwitch, and MIG partitioning. Consumer parts spend on RT cores, display outputs, and power efficiency. The entire GB10 SoC runs at 140W; a single B200 GPU draws 1,000W.\n\nSM100's TMEM, tcgen05, and 2-SM cooperative MMA are designed for datacenter environments where thousands of GPUs process massive matrix operations. Models like GLM-5 and DeepSeek-V3 use MoE8 architectures that activate only a subset of the model's parameters (expert subnets) per input token, so instead of running one large matrix multiply for a long time, they rapidly switch between many smaller ones. TMEM absorbs the accumulator storage pressure during these switches, and tcgen05's asynchronous execution allows prefetching the next expert's weights while the current expert is still computing. On a DGX Spark, where LPDDR5X provides 273 GB/s of memory bandwidth, the bottleneck is getting data from memory to the compute units, not tensor core throughput. Investing die area in TMEM and tcgen05 would yield little practical benefit under those conditions. SM12x keeping the proven mma.sync approach while adding FP4/FP6 support, 5th-gen tensor cores, and RT cores reflects this tradeoff. At Hot Chips 2025, NVIDIA disclosed that GB10 worked on TSMC 3nm A0 (first silicon) without revision, because it was assembled from validated IP blocks rather than designed from scratch.\n\nFlashMLA's sparse decoding kernel internally uses FP8 KV cache together with either WGMMA- or tcgen05-based matrix multiply. Neither is available on SM12x, so an SM12x backend would need to be written from the ground up. FlashInfer is in the same situation. FlashAttention's supported architecture list includes only Ampere, Ada Lovelace, and Hopper, and the runtime does not recognize SM12x as \"newer than Ampere.\" FlashAttention 4 (FA4) supports SM100 only. In the vLLM and SGLang ecosystems, SM12x-related issues keep surfacing. The most common: FP8 block-scaled GEMM kernels written for SM100 fail to run on RTX 5090 (SM120). SGLang's published DeepSeek-V3 serving configurations include H200 (SM90) and B200 (SM100) setups, but nothing for SM12x.\n\nTriton treats SM12x as SM80 (Ampere), disabling all Blackwell-related optimizations, and vLLM requires the --enforce-eager flag. Running attention kernels on SM12x is not entirely impossible: some developers have reported re-implementing FlashAttention in CUDA C++ using Ampere-era instructions (mma.sync, cp.async) or falling back to cuDNN's SDPA backend. These workarounds only support standard dense attention, though. MLA-specific kernels, sparse attention, and FP8 KV cache are out of reach, which makes it difficult to get full performance from models like GLM-5 or DeepSeek-V3.\n\nOne thing DGX Spark does offer that conventional desktops cannot: its 128GB of memory is shared between CPU and GPU without partitioning. A discrete GPU setup physically cannot do this. The bandwidth is lower than HBM, but being able to fit an entire 200B-parameter model in memory on a desktop machine is a rare capability. Once SM12x-native kernels materialize, the practical value of that memory pool changes considerably.\n\nGB10 is Blackwell. It has 5th-gen tensor cores, supports FP4/FP6 arithmetic, and includes RT cores. What it does not share with datacenter Blackwell is the instruction set. SM12x's tensor core programming model is closer to Ampere's mma.sync than to datacenter Blackwell's tcgen05, and for kernel developers, that means maintaining three separate code paths: Hopper, datacenter Blackwell, and consumer Blackwell.\n\nThis kind of datacenter-versus-consumer architectural split has recurred in every generation since Pascal, and the gap is wider in Blackwell because datacenter-only features like TMEM and tcgen05 are larger in scope than anything that came before. While a $4,000 desktop device cannot possibly contain the full instruction set of a $30,000+ data center GPU, the existence of instruction-level branching under the same 'Blackwell' name is an engineering detail worth noting for developers writing or relying on CUDA kernels.\n\nTry Backend.AI GO on DGX Spark.

    "description": "AI token processing has soared recently on OpenRouter, while Nvidia GPU rental prices have jumped.",
    "fullText": "AI demand has surged in recent weeks, according to new data that could support tech giants' decisions to dramatically ramp up investment in this area.\n\nOpenRouter, which helps developers access different AI models, has seen activity roughly double in the first weeks of 2026.\n\nThis is measured by the number of AI tokens OpenRouter processes. AI models break down words and other inputs into numerical tokens to make them easier to process and understand. One token is about ¾ of a word.\n\nOpenRouter handled 13 trillion AI tokens in the week that ended February 9. That's up from 6.4 trillion during the first week of January.\n\nSeen over a year, this recent surge is even more striking. AI models that OpenRouter taps into include Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, xAI's Grok, OpenAI's GPT range, and a host of open-source offerings from DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and others.\n\nThis data excludes AI tokens processed directly by the major AI companies, so it represents a small fraction of total activity. For instance, Google was processing 1.3 quadrillion tokens a month this past summer. However, the recent rate of change in OpenRouter's data is a valuable signal.\n\nAnand Iyer, a partner at VC firm Lightspeed, said the recent surge has been driven by an explosion in AI agent activity and especially the rapid emergence of OpenClaw, an open-source agentic system.\n\nThat's sparked an exponential increase in inference, which is how models, agents, and other AI services are run in the cloud.\n\n\"The demand for AI inference right now is coming from agentic platforms, especially OpenClaw,\" Iyer told Business Insider this week. \"We moved from simple chatbot experiences to agentic automation and execution, which has driven exponential growth of OpenClaw installations and OpenRouter usage.\"\n\nThere are other signs of rising AI use. Data compiled by Bloomberg suggests demand for Nvidia AI chips has increased lately. The chart below shows the cost to rent Nvidia H100 GPUs. As you can see, prices have rebounded strongly since early December, which implies robust AI demand.\n\nOpenClaw launched in November 2025. That coincides with the H100 rebound here.\n\nA third data point comes from Barclays analysts, who recently looked at online traffic to vibe coding services, including Lovable, Replit, and Wix's Base44.\n\nThe consumer website-based vibe coding services Barclays tracks saw traffic jump 17% month over month in January.\n\n\"This was the strongest growth since April 2025,\" the analysts wrote in a note to investors this week. \"The uptick in interest here was driven largely by frontier model improvements in late 2025 that made these platforms more effective.\"\n\nThe debate still rages over whether AI will be used enough to justify all the heavy investments being made. Big Tech companies recently increased capital expenditure plans to eye-watering levels, raising new concerns about a potential AI bubble.\n\nThis new AI usage data may suggest that demand could be strong enough to support such heavy spending.\n\n\"AI capex today, as we know it today, is largely driven by training requirements from large frontier labs,\" Iyer said.\n\nTraining is a data- and energy-intensive process in which AI models are created in massive data centers. Inference comes after models are run.\n\n\"The sustainability is warranted as long as the revenue produced by inference (which is growing exponentially) will justify the output from the training,\" Iyer said. \"Which seems to be working so far.\"\n\nOpenClaw is part of a broader evolution of generative AI. The era kicked off with a bang when OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022, and the chatbot became the fastest-growing tech product in history.\n\nMore recently, AI models have begun to support autonomous digital agents and similar tools that can use computers independently to accomplish complex tasks.\n\nOpenClaw's open-source technology supports agents that help users automate coding and other workflows by accessing computer files, email, calendars, and messaging services.\n\nIn January, Anthropic unveiled Claude Cowork, an AI agent that handles tasks such as document generation and file management.\n\nThe startup rolled out Claude Sonnet 4.6, its latest AI model, this week. It's gotten better at what Anthropic calls \"computer use,\" where AI models and agents use computers in similar ways to humans to get tasks done.\n\n\"The model sees the computer and interacts with it in much the same way a person would: clicking a (virtual) mouse and typing on a (virtual) keyboard,\" Anthropic wrote in a blog on Tuesday.\n\nThis type of machine-to-machine activity is behind a lot of the surge in AI token use lately. It makes sense: most people can use a computer for seven or eight hours a day. Then, they need a break or a nap. AI models never sleep and can hack away at a task uninterrupted until it's done.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Meta is deepening its ties to Nvidia in a move that could further pressure Intel and AMD, even as AI demand remains strong.",
    "fullText": "Meta is doubling down on its relationship with Nvidia in what the AI chip giant called a \"multigenerational\" deal.\n\nThe agreement, announced Tuesday, calls for Meta to build data centers powered by millions of Nvidia's current and next-generation chips for AI training and inference.\n\nThe move underscores how Meta is deepening its reliance on Nvidia, even as the social networking giant develops its own in-house chips and works with competing suppliers like AMD. Reports also suggested Meta has explored using TPUs — chips designed by its rival, Google.\n\nThe Nvidia deal could cool speculation around Meta's purported TPU talks, said Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy — though Big Tech companies often test several suppliers at the same time.\n\nThe deal arrives amid increased competition in AI infrastructure. While Nvidia leads the market, rivals including Google, AMD, and Broadcom are working to chip away at its dominance.\n\nCrucially, the partnership will see Meta deploy not only Nvidia's GPUs, but also CPUs.\n\nCPUs, long dominated by Intel and AMD, are the central processors that work with GPUs inside data centers. They're used for general computing tasks and are core to essentially all modern computing systems, whereas GPUs are used in specialized cases that require more compute power, such as AI training and graphics in gaming. By supplying both, Nvidia stands to capture even more spend and deepen its role within Meta's AI stack.\n\nWhile that increases competitive pressure, Moorhead said the demand for infrastructure has become so high that Nvidia's rivals will unlikely see outright declines in the near term.\n\nNvidia has been making its CPU ambitions more explicit, Moorhead said, including marketing its forthcoming Vera CPU as a stand-alone product. This emphasis reflects how CPUs play a larger role as AI workloads move beyond model training and toward inference.\n\n\"CPUs tend to be cheaper and a bit more power-efficient for inference,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at Enderle Group.\n\nBoth Moorhead and Enderle said that Meta's decision to source both GPUs and CPUs from a single vendor can also reduce complexity, with chief information officers often favoring a \"one-throat-to-choke\" approach to problem resolution.\n\nIn addition to GPUs and CPUs, Meta will use Nvidia's networking equipment inside data centers as part of the deal, as well as its confidential computing technology to run AI features within WhatsApp.\n\nThe companies will also work together to deploy Nvidia's next-generation Vera CPUs beyond the current Grace CPU model, Nvidia said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "As Sylendran Arunagiri considered moving from India to the US to pursue a master's degree, some friends and mentors advised him to delay his move. They warned that the US tech job market had become too challenging.\n\nArunagiri's goal was to move to the US in late 2023, begin a master's program in product management at Carnegie Mellon University, and land a Big Tech internship for the summer of 2024. He hoped this would be a stepping stone toward landing an AI-related role, ideally at Nvidia, his \"dream company\" because of its central role in the AI technologies he'd long wanted to work on.\n\nHowever, there were several things working against him. For one, the US tech hiring landscape was already creating headaches for job seekers. Openings had plummeted from highs reached a year earlier, and industry layoffs were increasing competition for available roles.\n\nAdditionally, Arunagiri had grown accustomed to the job market in India, where he earned a bachelor's degree and an MBA from top institutions that he said relied on structured campus placement programs to funnel many students directly into jobs. But from what he'd heard, the US was very different. Job fairs were often more like networking events than recruiting opportunities.\n\n\"You're completely on your own,\" said the 30-year-old, who now lives in San Jose.\n\nArunagiri is among the many job seekers who have struggled to navigate a US hiring landscape that's become more challenging in recent years. Amid economic uncertainty, the early effects of generative AI adoption, and a broader push to streamline operations, US businesses are now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.\n\nStill, some people have managed to break through in a challenging market. Arunagiri shared how he pursued his goal of working at Nvidia — a company he described as his dream employer — and offered his top advice for other job seekers.\n\nMany of the tech companies Arunagiri was targeting had conducted summer internship interviews the previous fall, so he began applying before moving to the US. After sending out many applications, he landed an interview with Nvidia in November 2023.\n\nArunagiri said the interview process went so well that he stopped applying to other internships. But after moving to the US and completing his final interview in February, he learned that he wouldn't be getting the role — which left him scrambling to find another internship.\n\n\"I had to start from scratch, but by then many of the applications had dried out,\" he said\n\nArunagiri was able to land an AI product manager internship based in India at the tech company Informatica. However, that summer, he found it difficult to stop thinking about what went wrong during his interview process with Nvidia — and began setting his sights on eventually landing a full-time role with the company.\n\nUpon reflection, Arunagiri suspected that his final Nvidia interview may have doomed him. He said he was lower energy than usual because he was feeling sick that day, and that he'd been hesitant to postpone it out of fear that the opportunity would be filled in the meantime. In hindsight, he said that decision was likely a mistake.\n\n\"I came off as a dull candidate, but I'm usually energetic and conversational,\" he said. \"I should have probably postponed it to a day that I was feeling better.\"\n\nArunagiri decided to reach out to an HR professional from Nvidia to get insight into where he fell short, and they agreed to jump on a call with him. While they didn't provide specific insights into his candidacy, he said they recommended he try to connect with people at Nvidia in current roles, including hiring managers and interns, to get insight into the kinds of projects they were working on and how he could better align his profile.\n\nHe eventually connected with about five Nvidia interns, who he said provided valuable insights. Those conversations helped shape the personal AI-related projects he began pursuing and sharing on LinkedIn in hopes of standing out.\n\nAfter the summer, Arunagiri dove back into the job search, eager to land a role before he graduated in December 2024. He knew that if he didn't land a job within 90 days after graduation, his F-1 visa restrictions would force him to return to India.\n\nIn September 2024, he submitted a cold application for a technical product marketing role in agentic AI at Nvidia —a role he described as his \"dream AI role\" at his dream company. He was asked to interview starting in October, and around the same time, he was also invited to interview for a more junior product management role at Microsoft.\n\nIn December, with his graduation looming later that month, Arunagiri received offers from Nvidia and Microsoft within days of each other. Given that Nvidia was his dream employer, the role checked a lot of his boxes, and the pay was higher than Microsoft's, he said the decision was fairly easy — and he accepted Nvidia's offer. He said that so far, working at Nvidia has been \"everything that I've dreamed of.\"\n\nArunagiri believes that his LinkedIn presence helped him stand out. During the interview process, he said, the hiring manager told him that he'd reviewed his LinkedIn profile and noticed the projects he'd been working on, including small experiments with new generative AI tools and models he'd shared publicly.\n\nHe has a few pieces of advice for job seekers. First, he said, time management is key, particularly because applying for jobs and connecting with people can be time-consuming. Second, he said, never compare your job search journey to anyone else's, since a variety of factors can influence how it plays out.\n\nRather than quietly applying and networking, he recommends sharing tangible projects publicly — such as posting about AI tools you've explored and linking to projects on LinkedIn or a personal website — so hiring managers can see your work.\n\n\"You need to find something that sets you apart from others,\" he said.",

    "title": "Nvidia: A complete guide to the hardware company behind the AI boom",
    "description": "Nvidia is one of the world's most valuable companies. Read about its history, leadership, and financials.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia has been around for over three decades, but the chipmaker became a household name only in the past few years.\n\nIn October 2025, the AI chipmaker became the first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nNvidia was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, \"with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets.\"\n\nThe boom in AI technology has made it one of the most valuable companies in the world as companies scramble to buy its graphics processing units. Here's what you need to know about Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's origin story began at a Denny's during a meeting between Huang — who once worked for the chain — Malachowsky, and Priem.\n\nPersonal computing was on the cusp of taking off, and the trio sought a way to capitalize on it. Huang said in a 2010 interview with Stanford University's engineering school that they \"wondered whether starting a graphics company would be a good idea.\"\n\n\"We brainstormed and fantasized about what kind of company it would be and the world we could help,\" he said. \"It was fun.\"\n\nTheir goal was to improve the experience of gaming on a PC.\n\nIn 2006, it released CUDA, a general-purpose programming interface that would expand its business far beyond gaming.\n\nOn Sequoia Capital's \"Crucible Moments\" podcast, Andrew Ng, a Stanford professor who founded Google Brain, recalled his students telling him, \"Hey, Andrew, there's this thing called CUDA — not that easy to program, but it's letting people use GPUs for something different.\"\n\n\"We started to see 10x or even 100x speedups training neural networks on GPUs because we could do 1,000 or 10,000 things in parallel rather than one step after another,\" he added.\n\nNvidia's GPUs were used to train AlexNet, an image classification system unveiled in 2012 that significantly influenced the field of deep learning.\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 ushered Nvidia into a new era. The chipmaker's shares surged by more than 1,000% from 2022 to early 2026.\n\nMuch of that growth came from the success of Nvidia's H100 chip, which it released in March 2022. The $40,000 chip, named for the computer scientist Grace Hopper, has played a crucial role in providing the computing power for large language models.\n\nSince the launch of Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which are twice as fast as its Hopper chips, customers including SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft have also flocked to the company.\n\nNvidia's success may be best personified by its CEO, Jensen Huang.\n\nA 61-year-old bona fide tech mogul, Huang has a net worth of about $165 billion, according to Forbes. While some execs sport chains or Patagonia vests, Huang is often spotted in a leather jacket. Business Insider identified at least six versions he's worn over the years, including a nearly $9,000 lizard-embossed coat from Tom Ford he wore at the company's global AI conference, GTC, in 2024. He commemorated Nvidia's stock price hitting $100 with a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his arm.\n\nHuang's early years were tumultuous. He was born in Taiwan, and he spent time there and in Thailand before his parents sent him to the United States because of social unrest in the region.\n\nHe attended a reform school in Kentucky. He later moved to Oregon, where he was reunited with his parents. In high school, he became a nationally ranked table tennis champion.\n\nHuang graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in electrical engineering in 1984.\n\nDuring his freshman year, Huang met Lori Mills, his future wife. In an interview at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, he said he won her over by offering to help her with her homework. They married five years after meeting and now have two children.\n\nJensen Huang later earned a master's in electrical engineering from Stanford, and he worked at the chip companies LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices before launching Nvidia.\n\nHuang sold about 1.3 million shares of Nvidia when the company hit a $3 trillion market cap in June 2024, but he retains a more than 3% stake in the company.\n\nNvidia's business is built around GPUs, which can handle tasks simultaneously, as opposed to central processing units, or CPUs, which are in standard computers.\n\nNvidia's GPUs have become a mainstay of the AI revolution because they provide the computing power needed to run massive large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's Llama 3.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's H100 chips, built on its Hopper architecture, has been so high in late 2023 and 2024 that tech execs like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have bragged about how many units they're training new technology on. ByteDance has found workarounds to the US export bans on the chips to China. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have bought up thousands of units to fuel their AI ambitions, while venture capitalists have bought Nvidia GPUs as backup units for their startups.\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell chips, which it says are twice as fast as its Hopper chips and have attracted customers including SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft. The recent frenzy around the Chinese company DeepSeek's models has fueled demand for Nvidia's H200 chips.\n\nIn January 2025, Huang also unveiled new chips targeting the gaming, robotics, and autonomous vehicle industries, as well as partnerships with Toyota and Microsoft.\n\nAt the January 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Huang unveiled the new Vera Rubin architecture that will succeed Blackwell. During his presentation, Huang said Vera Rubin is built to confront the core problem of a surge in computing demand.\n\nCompared with Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, Huang said Rubin delivers more than three times the performance, can run inference up to five times faster, and offers significantly higher inference compute per watt.\n\nA key to Nvidia's success is also CUDA, a software layer that can link GPUs to almost any AI application a developer wants to run. It's a critical component of the competitive advantage, or moat, that Nvidia has built up over the years.\n\nStill, AMD, Nvidia's main competitor, is quietly catching up. In October 2025, AMD announced a major multi-year strategic partnership with OpenAI under which OpenAI will deploy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs for its AI infrastructure starting in the second half of 2026. The deal is expected to bring tens of billions of dollars in revenue to AMD over time.\n\nNvidia's other competitors include Intel and IBM. Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have also released their own AI chips.\n\nNvidia overtook Apple and Microsoft for the title of the most valuable company in the world when it hit a historic $5 trillion in market capitalization in October 2025.\n\nAfter a tumultuous start to 2025 over chip export restrictions to China that would have cost billions in losses for Nvidia, Nvidia is heading into 2026 with confidence that demand for its AI chips is far from peaking.\n\nIn 2025, the chipmaker's blockbuster third-quarter results brought in $57 billion in revenue, including $51 billion from its data center business alone, beating Wall Street expectations. Nvidia raised its fourth-quarter forecast to $65 billion in sales, helping revive AI and semiconductor stocks after a brief slump. Shares of Nvidia and peers rallied on the upbeat outlook.\n\nHuang repeatedly dismissed fears of an AI bubble, arguing that the shift from CPUs to GPUs, the rise of agentic AI, and monetization through advertising all point to sustained growth. Nvidia also expanded its influence through major partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and hyperscalers such as Meta.\n\nLooking to 2026, Nvidia is betting big on next-generation chips like Blackwell Ultra, massive AI infrastructure projects, and growth areas including robotics and automotive. While US export restrictions on China remain a headwind, Nvidia expects hyperscalers and global AI investment to keep demand strong into next year.\n\nNvidia is based in Santa Clara, California. Nvidia's headquarters, known as Voyager, was designed by the architectural firm Gensler and is about 750,000 square feet.\n\nIt has parks, \"treehouses\" for gatherings, and places designed to help employees focus. However, the overall design is intended to facilitate Nvidia's flat organizational structure.\n\n\"When you're moving that fast, you want to make sure that that information is flowing through the company as quickly as possible,\" Huang told the Harvard Business Review in 2023.\n\nIt's also a way to create more harmony between leadership and workers. Huang, who in 2023 oversaw 50 direct reports, has said that CEOs \"by definition\" should have the most direct reports at a company.\n\nHuang has earned a reputation among those who work with him as a demanding boss. Meetings with Huang can get heated, and senior employees have described his tough questions as a \"Jensen grilling.\"\n\nNvidia's top executives include Ian Buck, a vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing; Colette Kress, the chief financial officer; and Bryan Catanzaro, a vice president of applied deep learning research.\n\nLanding a job at Nvidia isn't easy, but Lindsey Duran, a VP of recruitment, told BI that Nvidia applicants should express an interest in generative AI, tap into their professional network for referrals, and aim to do an internship.",

    "description": "A defense-tech founder built an AI \"council\" of 15 agents to help him run his company, using ChatGPT and Nvidia tools to replace traditional roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aaron Sneed, a 40-year-old defense-tech solo founder based in Florida. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started my business, as a solopreneur, I realized I didn't have the money to pay lawyers, HR reps, and a bunch of other companies. So, using AI, I created what I call 'The Council.'\n\nThe council, which is compiled of all AI agents, helps me save around 20 hours a week, and that's a very conservative estimate. Every kind of general corporate chair, HR, legal, and finance AI agent has a seat on the council.\n\nHere's how I use around 15 custom agents, including a chief of staff agent, to manage my workload.\n\nI've worked on autonomous platforms that make decisions independently for at least 10 years. That made me latch onto commercial large language models and AI tools very quickly when they came out.\n\nI primarily use Nvidia's platform as my underlying hardware for technical prototyping and experimentation. I use their GPUs, and they provide free access to their AI software since I purchased their hardware. Additionally, my council is built on OpenAI's ChatGPT business platform using custom GPTs and projects.\n\nAltogether, my AI council consists of the following:\n\nMy chief of staff agent is important because it's the voice that sets priority based on parameters like risks, issues, and opportunities.\n\nI told my chief of staff which models have priority when making decisions. For example, anything legal, compliance, or security-related will be given a higher priority. So, I tell the chief of staff to listen to these models over everyone else.\n\nI don't want a bunch of yes agents. I trained them purposefully to give me pushback because I've learned that they naturally want to agree with me. I want them to test my theories to help me with what I'm trying to accomplish.\n\nI have a roundtable set up with all my AI agents, where I can put something like a request-for-proposal document in the chat, and all the agents will weigh in at the same time. I use this roundtable as a level of prevention for hallucinations and knowledge gaps.\n\nThe training never really stops, because if I don't continuously train the models, I won't get the outputs I want or need. It takes me about two weeks to train my agents to the level of experience they need to be at for me to feel confident in them. Early on, it took me longer to produce a deliverable than if I'd just done it myself because I hadn't focused properly on training.\n\nThe models have gotten better, and my prompting has, too. I have a better understanding of what information should be in an agent, like having a governance structure for priorities. I have a set of files that put those requirements in place to mitigate the risk of hallucination and false or bad information.\n\nAll of the AI companies have different prompt engineering guides. I recommend taking the time to look at them because there's a lot of user error that causes things to slow down when working with AI.\n\nIt takes time to get the agents to a good place. A lot of companies are going to try to jump into using AI too quickly for too much without understanding how to use it properly, and these companies could hurt themselves in the long run.\n\nI'm ill-equipped to handle a lot of these roles and responsibilities, but I'm also forced to do it because I'm bootstrapped.\n\nWith my legal agent in particular, I've learned the bounds of putting AI tools into real-world practice. I have a lawyer, and I use my legal agent to try to do some upfront work before handing documents off to my lawyer for a patent or dispute case, or anything like that.\n\nWhen I was training my model to help me use facts and data to plot a case, I had a lot of information laid out, and I thought what my legal agent created sounded good to me as a non-lawyer. Then I presented all that information to my lawyer, and he said that it was technically and factually correct, but we don't want to express that information because it shows our cards going in.\n\nHis legal skillset helped me realize that, even though I thought my agent was correct and ideal to use, it still won't replace a lawyer with that human context, experience, and skills.\n\nIdeally, I would have an HR person, a legal person, and so on, and each would have their own chief of staff AI agent who would help them out. That's what I think the future will look like.",

    "description": "AI's next phase will shift from Nvidia and cloud leaders to large incumbent companies adopting the technology to boost profits and cut costs.",
    "fullText": "Investors are growing jittery about a potential bubble in artificial intelligence stocks, but the real payoff may be just beginning — and it could extend well beyond Silicon Valley's usual winners, a $19 billion hedge fund investor said.\n\n\"This is a generational platform shift. We are in probably the third or fourth inning of the actual build out,\" David Craver, the co-chief investment officer of Lone Pine Capital, said on Goldman Sachs' \"Exchanges\" podcast published Thursday.\n\nCraver added that while he understands concerns surrounding the vast sums of money being spent on AI, the underlying signals — improving models, tight capacity, and real-world business impact — suggest the cycle still has room to run.\n\nHe points to three signals that keep him bullish on AI infrastructure.\n\nFirst, the models are still improving as more computing power is thrown at them. \"They are absolutely getting better,\" and have more uses, he said.\n\nSecond, demand continues to outstrip supply as hyperscalers and inference providers still lack sufficient capacity, he said.\n\nThird — and most important — companies are already seeing dramatic returns from deploying AI internally.\n\nHe said founders and digital-first CEOs are describing \"mind-blowing\" productivity gains, from automated coding to replacing manual workflows with AI agents.\n\n\"We have had numerous CEOs say to us, 'I think I can triple or more the revenues in my business. And I'm never going to have to hire another human being,'\" Craver said.\n\nStill, not every company is seeing those kinds of returns on investment. According to PwC's latest Global CEO Survey, released last month, 56% of the 4,454 chief executives surveyed said AI has yet to deliver revenue or cost benefits for their businesses.\n\nEarly AI gains have gone primarily to infrastructure leaders like Nvidia and cloud providers. Craver thinks the next phase will be defined by adoption across large, incumbent companies.\n\n\"I have a theme that I call 'revenge of the dinosaurs,' which is, larger companies are going to adopt this technology and take cost out of their business in a huge way over the next two and three and four years,\" he said.\n\nHe said the impact would show up clearly in corporate earnings.\n\n\"I think we're going to get on conference calls in 2027, and CFOs are going to say, 'I just took half a billion dollars out of my spending on an annual basis because we're implementing this new technology,'\" he said.\n\nThat dynamic, in his view, is \"super bullish for the market.\"\n\nCraver's comments come at a fragile moment for AI-linked stocks, as investors grow more nervous after a blistering multi-year run.\n\nThis week, software stocks sold off as investors weighed the disruptive impact of AI against concerns about elevated valuations, aggressive capital spending, and whether the buildout has outpaced fundamentals.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms — sectors seen as exposed to AI disruption — have fallen sharply.\n\nDespite the volatility, Craver said Lone Pine remains \"quite bullish on that overall bet\" on AI.\n\n\"It's not a bubble when everybody thinks it's a bubble,\" he said. \"It's going to be a bubble when we get to the other side of this.\"",

    "fullText": "Apparent collapse of Nvidia–OpenAI tie-up raises questions about circular funding and who will bear the cost of AI’s expansion\n\nDid the circular AI economy just wobble? Last week it was reported that a much-discussed $100bn deal – announced last September – between Nvidia and OpenAI might not be happening at all.\n\nThis was a circular arrangement through which the chipmaker would supply the ChatGPT developer with huge sums of money that would largely go towards the purchase of its own chips.\n\nIt is this type of deal that has alarmed some market watchers, who detect a whiff of the 1999-2000 dotcom bubble in these transactions.\n\nNow it seems that Nvidia was not as solid on this investment as had been widely believed, according to the Wall Street Journal. Negotiations had not progressed, with Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, privately emphasising that the deal was “non-binding” and “not finalised”. Huang appeared to confirm this in Taipei on Saturday, telling reporters that Nvidia would make a “huge” investment into OpenAI’s next funding round, but “nothing like” $100bn.\n\nA report from Reuters soon suggested that the feeling was mutual: OpenAI was “unsatisfied” with Nvidia’s advanced AI chips, it said, and seeking alternatives. Nvidia’s stock has taken a 10% hit so far this week, a flurry of headlines have ensued and both companies have stepped into damage control.\n\n“We love working with Nvidia and they make the best AI chips in the world,” wrote Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, on X. “We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time.”\n\nEven Oracle appears to be shaken: the software company, which is counting on a $300bn cloud computing deal with OpenAI, said it still expects the startup to be good for its commitment even if it does not receive the full amount from Nvidia. In total, OpenAI has committed to compute deals – the infrastructure for building and powering its AI tools – worth more than $1tn.\n\n“The Nvidia-OpenAI deal has zero impact on our financial relationship with OpenAI,” Oracle posted on X. “We remain highly confident in OpenAI’s ability to raise funds and meet its commitments.”\n\nThat a $100bn deal between two of the most crucial players in AI appears to have evaporated over a weekend is unsettling. But there are solid business reasons behind the apparent shake-up, said Alvin Nguyen, analyst at research firm Forrester.\n\nOpenAI’s ambitious growth trajectory means it will be difficult for the company to stick with a single vendor, especially as it plans new, computationally demanding AI models, he said. “They need chips. They need as many as possible.”\n\nAs for Nvidia, its commitment to the $100bn may have been loose in the first place, even as it was widely reported. “They will not discourage people from overhyping. Why say something and immediately sucker punch your own share price?”\n\nFor a giant startup like OpenAI, manoeuvring in and out of deals – for example, with chipmakers – may just be business as usual, said Nguyen: “You know [Altman’s] background as a startup person, and you know the manoeuvres he’s doing make sense from a startup perspective.”\n\nFor Nvidia, meanwhile, AI hype is part of selling chips. “You don’t know what’s going to happen,” said Nguyen. “And so you let other people put numbers out there for you and let that drive the hype.”\n\nThe issue is, of course, that investors and other companies like Oracle may have taken widely reported $100bn commitments seriously.\n\nIn response to a query from the Guardian, an OpenAI spokesperson referred to Altman’s X post, and to remarks Huang made to CNBC on Tuesday, including: “There is no drama.”\n\nThe spokesperson added: “Our teams are actively working through details of our partnership. Nvidia technology has underpinned our breakthroughs from the start, powers our systems today, and will remain central as we scale what comes next.”\n\nNvidia and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThis is all taking place against the backdrop of a changing investment landscape for AI, where hype is giving way to realities about what aspects of the technology are actually going to earn money.\n\nWhile investors ponder whether OpenAI is going to be able to pay for a $1.4tn compute deal, reality is biting further down the AI food chain. This week has seen a massive sell-off in certain software stocks, prompted in part by the launch of a new Anthropic AI tool that can carry out a number of professional services, which has led to fears that business models exposed to competition from AI products will be disrupted .\n\nThis is the flip-side of “jagged AI”, which is the term for advanced AI tools having uneven talents, such as being good at sifting through documents but less good at solving complex maths problems. If advanced systems are good at automating legal work, then legacy companies in service industries will suffer. The losers are beginning to emerge and are being picked up by investors.\n\nAt the top of the AI pyramid the competitive effects are also biting. OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, is losing ground to competitors. Data released on Tuesday show its market share has eroded from 69% to 45% owing to the rise of Google’s Gemini, xAI’s Grok and Anthropic’s Claude. OpenAI appears to have retreated from soaring talk of super-intelligence in the past months, focusing instead on profitable mundanities such as adverts and adult content.\n\nThe apparent evaporation of a $100bn deal may be of a piece with last year’s sci-fi rhetoric meeting this year’s practicalities. The question is, who might be left holding the bill?\n\n“I think there will be knock-on effects,” said Nguyen. “I mean, it’s that statement: the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”",

    "fullText": "Nvidia employees may soon notice less traffic in their inboxes.\n\nThe chip giant has implemented a change to its internal email strategy known as T5Ts, or \"Top 5 Things.\"\n\nT5Ts are regular emails that Nvidia employees are expected to send, outlining what they're working on or thinking about, or where they're running into challenges. The messages are sent across teams and to Nvidia's executive staff — including CEO Jensen Huang, who is often known to respond.\n\nIn January, Nvidia substantially reduced T5T distribution within its vast Worldwide Field Operations organization, the team responsible for selling Nvidia's AI technology and helping customers deploy it in the field.\n\nWWFO employees previously shared their T5T emails broadly across the organization. The new policy limits distribution to a \"much smaller group,\" according to internal communications seen by Business Insider.\n\nThis group includes Huang, members of Nvidia's executive staff, and other senior leaders. Nvidia also directed employees to copy the managers responsible for their customer accounts and the industries in which those customers operate. It could not be learned if the change in T5T distribution is companywide.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nT5Ts have been core to Nvidia's culture for decades, designed to flatten its organizational hierarchy and give leadership visibility into day-to-day operations, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing Tae Kim's book \"The Nvidia Way.\"\n\nThe move comes as Nvidia's workforce has expanded rapidly during the AI boom and as more attention has focused on the company and its operations.\n\nWhile top executives will continue to receive T5Ts, the narrowed distribution could signal a shift from Nvidia's culture of open communication and public feedback. The change could also limit how easily employees spot overlapping issues across teams.\n\nBusiness Insider has previously reported how T5Ts enable leaders to intervene when issues arise. Top executives like Huang and vice president Ian Buck have stepped in to mobilize responses amid customer complaints about product launches and AI deployment hurdles.\n\nHuang, known for his demanding pace and for favoring concise communication, has implemented other strategies to reduce hierarchy at Nvidia.\n\nHuang maintains a large number of direct reports, Business Insider previously reported. He also eschews one-on-one meetings to aid in the flow of information and prefers to work in conference rooms rather than private offices, The Journal reported.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Sam Altman, Jensen Huang, and Oracle want to make one thing clear: They're not fighting.\n\nThe OpenAI CEO, Nvidia CEO, and software company all stepped forward this week to swat down rumors of tension over Nvidia's planned multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, after a string of reports suggesting tension between the parties.\n\n\"We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world,\" wrote Altman in a post on X on Tuesday.\n\n\"We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don't get where all this insanity is coming from,\" he added.\n\nThe pushback came after reports on a deal Nvidia disclosed in September, when it said it planned to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. The move would give the chipmaker a stake in the startup while helping OpenAI secure the vast computing power it needs to train and run its models.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that some Nvidia executives had raised internal concerns about the deal, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nSeparately, Reuters reported on Tuesday that OpenAI had been dissatisfied with some of Nvidia's newer AI chips and had explored alternatives since last year, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Taipei on Saturday, Huang said the idea that he would be unhappy with OpenAI is \"nonsense.\" He also reaffirmed his support for the startup's work and Altman's leadership.\n\n\"I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible,\" the Nvidia CEO said, adding that OpenAI is \"one of the most consequential companies of our time.\"\n\n\"We will invest a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we've ever made,\" he added.\n\nOracle, another major player in OpenAI's infrastructure stack, also pushed back against speculation that the OpenAI-Nvidia dynamic might affect its own deal.\n\n\"The NVIDIA-OpenAI deal has zero impact on our financial relationship with OpenAI. We remain highly confident in OpenAI's ability to raise funds and meet its commitments,\" the company said in a post on X on Tuesday.\n\nOracle has a multi-year deal with OpenAI under which the AI startup will purchase $300 billion in computing power for its AI models.\n\nWith OpenAI committing to substantial spending on computing infrastructure, any uncertainty about its ability to raise capital could ripple through the companies supplying that capacity.\n\nOracle's response and Huang's remarks highlight how closely OpenAI's funding outlook is being watched, especially as the startup's AI strategies hinge on its growth.\n\nInvestors have raised concerns about OpenAI's trillion-dollar-plus compute commitments, including \"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry, who questioned whether a still-private company can realistically finance such spending.\n\nIn some cases, investor skepticism about those deals has weighed on the share prices of companies exposed to OpenAI's expansion, including Oracle.\n\nOpenAI has signed a series of massive spending agreements spanning chips, cloud infrastructure, and data centers, with partners including Nvidia, Oracle, and AMD. Some of them are worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nAltman said in a podcast episode on \"Bg2 Pod\" published in November that he has had \"enough\" of having to justify how OpenAI will pay for its spending commitments.\n\n\"If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer,\" he said.",

    "description": "Nvidia still reigns, but a structural shift toward custom silicon is creating a new hierarchy of winners and laggards, and analysts are split.",
    "fullText": "The AI chip race isn't just a one-horse sprint led by Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAs hyperscalers like Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) race to lower the eye-watering costs of running massive AI models, a second front is opening in the custom silicon wars, with Broadcom (AVGO) as its primary architect.\n\nWhat challenges do custom chip companies face currently?\n\nWhat advantages do custom ASICs offer over Nvidia GPUs?\n\nHow is Broadcom competing with Nvidia in AI chips?\n\nWhy is TSMC crucial to the AI chip market?\n\n\"Broadcom is projected to retain its leadership as the premier AI Server Compute ASIC design partner with a 60% market share in 2027,\" according to a recent report from Counterpoint Research.\n\nThis dominance is underpinned by a symbiotic relationship with the world's most advanced foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), which remains the \"dominant foundry choice ... with close to 99% wafer fabrication share for the top 10 players' AI Server Compute and ASIC shipments.\"\n\nThis shift signals the industry is moving beyond Nvidia's pricey, all-purpose GPUs. While Nvidia provides a powerful all-purpose AI tool, tech giants are increasingly designing their own Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICS) tailored to their unique workloads.\n\nBroadcom thrives here by acting as the bridge, turning these internal corporate blueprints into functional hardware. By hitching its wagon to the internal capital expenditures of the world's wealthiest companies, Broadcom has seen its stock climb roughly 55% over the last year.\n\nThe cost-saving incentive for these giants is massive. Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider noted that the Google-Broadcom TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) is rapidly closing the performance gap with Nvidia, estimating a staggering 70% reduction in \"cost-per-token\" as the technology evolves from the TPU v6 to the v7.\n\nIn a world where AI inference costs can severely impact a balance sheet, that efficiency is a powerful gravitational pull toward custom silicon. Google famously trained its Gemini 3 entirely on its TPUs.\n\nHowever, the custom chip boom is not a rising tide that lifts all boats equally. Marvell Technology (MRVL), often cited as Broadcom's primary challenger, is currently navigating \"design win headwinds.\" Counterpoint's analysis suggests Marvell's design service share could slide to 8% by 2027, even as its total shipment volumes grow.\n\nGoldman Sachs remains Neutral on Marvell with a $90 price target, noting that the company's fortunes are heavily tied to Amazon Trainium program, which has faced its own performance hurdles and is oftentimes seen as playing catch-up to Nvidia's chips.\n\nWhile some on Wall Street, like Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold, remain bullish on Marvell as a long-term \"share gainer,\" the immediate data favors Broadcom's grip on high-volume contracts. The firm issued a Strong Buy rating on Marvell with a $121 price target, while giving Broadcom a $420 target.",

He added that he believed that China was still finalising the licence. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment on DeepSeek's approval.\n\nChina's industry and commerce ministries ⁠have granted approvals for all ‌four companies, but have stipulated that they will impose conditions that are still being finalised, the sources said. These conditions are being decided by ‍China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), according to one of the people.\n\nWhat congressional scrutiny could DeepSeek chip purchases face?\n\nWhat regulatory conditions apply to DeepSeek's H200 approval?\n\nWhat makes DeepSeek significant in the AI industry?\n\nHow does this fit into broader U.S.-China relations?\n\nChina's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Ministry of Commerce and NDRC did not answer requests for comment.\n\nDeepSeek, which rattled ​the global tech sector early last year by rolling out AI models that cost ‌a fraction of those being developed by U.S. rivals such as OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), did not answer a request for comment.\n\nThe H200, Nvidia's second most powerful AI chip, has emerged as a major flashpoint in U.S.-China relations. Despite strong demand from Chinese firms and U.S. approval for exports, Beijing's hesitation to allow imports has been the main barrier to shipments.\n\nThe U.S. earlier this month formally ⁠cleared the way for Nvidia to sell the H200 ​to China, where the company is seeing strong appetite. ​However, Chinese authorities have the final say on whether they would allow it to be shipped in.\n\nAny purchases of H200 chips by DeepSeek could draw ‍scrutiny by U.S lawmakers. ⁠Reuters reported on Wednesday that a senior U.S lawmaker had alleged that Nvidia had helped DeepSeek hone artificial intelligence models that were later used by the Chinese military, ⁠according to a letter sent to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nDeepSeek is expected to launch its next-generation AI ‌model V4, featuring strong coding capabilities, in mid-February, The Information reported earlier this ‌month.",

    "fullText": "Redwood Materials has landed Google as a new investor, capping an upsized funding round that values the battery recycling and energy storage company at more than $6 billion.\n\nThe development underscores rising Big Tech interest in power infrastructure for the AI era.\n\nThe Nevada-based startup said Wednesday it completed the final close of its Series E financing, bringing the total raised to $425 million.\n\nThe round was increased from a previously announced $350 million amid strong investor demand. Google joined the final closing of the round alongside existing backers, including Capricorn and Goldman Sachs.\n\nGoogle's participation adds another tech giant to Redwood's cap table, following Nvidia's investment earlier in the round through its venture arm NVentures.\n\nThe growing interest reflects a bet that Redwood's energy storage business — which repurposes used electric-vehicle batteries to store power — could become critical infrastructure as electricity demand surges from AI, data centers, and broader electrification.\n\nFounded by Tesla cofounder JB Straubel, Redwood Materials originally built its business on recycling lithium-ion batteries and recovering key metals, including lithium, nickel, and cobalt. More recently, it has expanded into grid-scale energy storage through a new unit called Redwood Energy, which uses second-life EV batteries to stabilize power supply and support energy-hungry data centers.\n\nThe company has argued that energy storage is no longer optional but essential as AI workloads strain existing grids. Redwood says the new capital will help it scale its energy storage platform while continuing to invest in recycling and critical minerals processing in the US.\n\nWith Google now on board, Redwood is positioning itself at the intersection of AI infrastructure, energy security, and domestic supply chains — a combination investors increasingly see as strategic as the power demands of the AI economy accelerate.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

Despite strong demand from Chinese firms and U.S. approval for exports, Beijing's hesitation to allow imports has been ‍the main barrier to shipments.\n\nThe U.S. earlier this month formally cleared the way for Nvidia to sell the H200 to China, where the company is seeing strong appetite. However, Chinese authorities have the final say on whether they would allow it to be ​shipped in.\n\nIt was unclear in recent weeks whether Beijing would grant approval as the government wants to balance ‌meeting surging domestic demand for advanced AI chips and nurturing its domestic semiconductor industry.\n\nChinese customs authorities told agents that the H200 chips were not permitted to enter China, Reuters reported earlier this month.\n\nBut Chinese technology firms have placed orders for more than two million H200 chips, far exceeding Nvidia's available inventory, Reuters reported last month.\n\nIt remains uncertain how many additional companies will receive approval in subsequent batches or what criteria Beijing is using to determine eligibility.\n\nHuang arrived ⁠in Shanghai last Friday for routine annual celebrations with Nvidia's China ​employees and has since travelled to Beijing and other cities, Reuters ​reported last week.\n\nThe approvals of H200 suggest Beijing is prioritising the needs of major Chinese internet companies, which are spending billions of dollars to build data centres needed to develop AI ‍services and compete with U.S. ⁠rivals, including OpenAI.\n\nWhile Chinese companies such as Huawei now have products that rival the performance of Nvidia's H20 chip, previously the most advanced AI chip it was allowed to sell to China, they still ⁠lag far behind the H200.",

    "description": "Internal emails show Bank of America having difficulties with Nvidia's AI Factory, showing the challenges of integrating AI in regulated industries.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia ran into some resistance as one of the world's biggest banks struggled to adopt its AI enterprise software, signaling how hard it can be for massive, highly regulated companies to put cutting-edge technology to use.\n\nNvidia sales executives recapped conversations with key customers — including Bank of America — following a conference late last year, according to an internal email thread from November viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe chip giant has been selling its \"AI Factory\" — a full setup of chips and software designed to build, train, and run large-scale AI systems — to large businesses.\n\nBank of America told Nvidia it was struggling with deployment, according to the email thread. The exchange reveals that while companies rush to purchase AI infrastructure, operational and regulatory hurdles make deploying it far harder — a key challenge for Nvidia as it expands from selling chips into enterprise software. On the thread, Nvidia executives also discussed how they can better work with customers in using its AI products.\n\n\"You sold us a Formula 1 race car,\" an Nvidia executive reported the bank said, comparing the AI Factory to the race car, \"and now you have to help us as local car mechanics drive the race car!\"\n\nBank of America declined to comment. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nA second executive later responded that Nvidia \"can't just sell\" AI Factory hardware but needs to provide a software solution to help business customers succeed.\n\nThe gap between buying infrastructure and actually deploying AI is common across industries, said Rumman Chowdhury, who advises companies on responsible AI.\n\n\"Buying GPUs or signing a cloud contract is a business decision; deploying AI is an institutional change,\" she told Business Insider. \"It's much easier to approve a budget line item than to re‑architect workflows, retrain teams, and rewrite governance processes.\"\n\nRecapping its meeting with Bank of America, the first Nvidia executive said the bank lacked \"the MLOps skills in house.\" MLOps refers to machine learning operations, or the processes for implementing AI models in real-world use cases.\n\nThat executive added that Bank of America did not think Nvidia's AI enterprise software was \"ready for their highly regulated banking industry.\"\n\nThe executive also pointed to other concerns, including Bank of America's security and governance requirements, such as documentation and support for air gapping — isolating systems from other networks to improve security. They noted the challenges the bank faced in supporting multiple AI models and software systems to meet different needs.\n\nNvidia vice president Ian Buck subsequently jumped into the thread, signalling how senior leaders at the chip giant can step in when customer concerns surface.\n\n\"Looks like they need help and/or our product is coming up short,\" Buck wrote.\n\nThe struggles at Bank of America echo earlier issues with Nvidia's enterprise software efforts, including a need to educate prospective clients on what it is and isn't.\n\nAI deployment obstacles aren't exclusive to banking; they are prevalent across sectors. While banks have a long history of using AI for tasks like credit decisioning, they may be the first to run into issues because of the scale of their data and customers, said Tom Davenport, an information technology and management professor at Babson College.\n\n\"The technology's out way ahead of what individual banks or most companies actually can implement quickly,\" he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is done with the questions about circular financing.\n\nHuang called it \"ridiculous\" to suggest that Nvidia's latest deal, a $2 billion investment in CoreWeave, is the latest circular deal between AI chipmakers and tech companies, a trend that has sparked some concern among some investors.\n\n\"These are generational companies — the investments that we make is confidence in them,\" Huang told Bloomberg News. \"But it's a small percentage of the amount of money that they ultimately have to go raise, and so the idea that it is circular is — it's ridiculous.\"\n\nAs part of the arrangement, Nvidia is expanding its previous investment in the cloud company by buying $2 billion worth of its shares. According to a joint statement, the money will assist CoreWeave's \"procurement of land, power, and shell to build AI factories.\" The future AI factories will then be powered by Nvidia's chips.\n\nHuang portrayed the latest deal and past arrangements with the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Elon Musk's xAI as just a small portion of what the companies need to raise to finance their massive AI expansion plans. For example, OpenAI is committed to spending roughly $1.4 trillion over the next eight years, largely on data centers.\n\n\"Whatever we decide to invest is a small percentage, very small percentage of the overall amount of infrastructure, capital they're going to have to raise,\" Huang told CNBC in a separate interview.\n\nThis is far from the first time Nvidia has bristled at concerns about its deals.\n\nIn November, the world's largest company by market cap sent a letter to Wall Street analysts in response to investor Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame, who has questioned whether Nvidia was on solid financial footing.\n\n\"Nvidia's underlying business is economically sound, our reporting is complete and transparent, and we care about our reputation for integrity,\" the memo said.\n\nBurry has said he stands behind his analysis of the company, comparing it to one of Silicon Valley's giants before the Dotcom crash.\n\n\"I am not claiming Nvidia is Enron,\" he wrote on his Substack. \"It is clearly Cisco.\"",

CoreWeave is targeting to build more than 5 gigawatts in AI data center ‍capacity by 2030.\n\nNvidia will invest in CoreWeave at a purchase price of $87.20 per share, the companies said. That represents an addition of roughly 23 million shares, nearly doubling ​Nvidia's stake in the firm, according to Reuters calculations based on data ‌compiled by LSEG.\n\nNvidia was CoreWeave's third largest shareholder with a 6.3% stake, or 24.3 million shares, in the company.\n\nThe chip giant has drawn scrutiny for pouring billions of dollars into AI firms including ChatGPT maker OpenAI and neoclouds, raising investor concerns about potential circular financing.\n\nA CoreWeave spokesperson told Reuters that the ⁠cash from the new investment will not ​be used to purchase Nvidia processors, but directed ​toward accelerating other data center investments, research and development, and scaling its workforce.\n\nOnce a cryptocurrency miner, CoreWeave has pivoted to capitalize ‍on the AI ⁠boom by repurposing its infrastructure to lease Nvidia GPUs to tech and AI firms.\n\n\"Nvidia is the leading and most requested computing platform at every ⁠phase of AI ...

    "description": "Microsoft announced its new Maia 200 AI chip, taking aim at Amazon, Google, and Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft (MSFT) is taking aim at cloud rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) with the debut of its next-generation custom AI chip.\n\nCalled Maia 200, the chip will run in Microsoft’s own data centers before the company eventually makes it available to its wider customer base.\n\nLike Google’s TPUs and Amazon’s Trainium processors, Microsoft’s second AI chip is meant to give the Windows maker more flexibility when it comes to how it powers its AI services. By using its own internally developed chips, the company ensures it doesn’t have to rely solely on processors developed by Nvidia (NVDA) or AMD (AMD).\n\nGoogle and Amazon have been using their own custom chips for years, while Microsoft has been slower to adopt in-house AI silicon.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the Maia 200 will be built using TSMC’s 3-nanometer process and is designed to run large-scale AI workloads, while “delivering efficient performance per dollar.”\n\nThe Maia 200 will be built into large server racks with trays housing four chips each. Microsoft is also touting how quickly it can deploy the new chips into data centers, saying chips are installed and running AI models within days of parts arriving.\n\nGetting AI servers up and running quickly is an important aspect of the broader data center business. It’s not just a matter of keeping construction costs down, either. The longer a chip goes unused, the less cash it can generate for the company by running AI apps.\n\nThe Maia 200 adds to the growing competition Nvidia is facing from both AMD and its own customers. Microsoft’s Maia 100 already powers both the company’s and OpenAI’s (OPAI.PVT) AI models, while Google and Amazon both power their respective models and Anthropic’s (ANTH.PVT) models.\n\nAnd in November, The Information reported that Meta was talking to Google about using the search giant’s TPUs in its own data centers to power its AI services. That sent Nvidia stock down at the time, as Wall Street raised fears that the company was in danger of losing market share.\n\nNvidia’s stock price is up less than 1% since the start of the year.\n\nDespite the incursions into Nvidia’s lane, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are unlikely to pose a serious threat to the AI leader. Experts say that while the cloud company’s AI chips may function well for their own services, that’s not likely to translate to smaller third-party customers as easily.\n\nNvidia’s chips are also highly coveted because they are designed to be multipurpose, allowing companies to use them for a litany of applications and services.\n\nAs for performance, the Maia 200 won’t unseat Nvidia, but Microsoft claims it outpaces both Google’s latest TPU and Amazon’s newest Trainium chip in a number of categories. The Maia 200 also packs more high-bandwidth memory than Google’s or Amazon’s offerings, which is key to running high-powered AI applications.",

    "description": "Derek Fulton left Nvidia to launch Carolina Cloud, a North Carolina cloud startup offering affordable compute services.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Derek Fulton, 31, a former Nvidia software engineer who quit to found the North Carolina-based cloud startup Carolina Cloud with his wife. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment about its work culture. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been messing around with computers since I got my first MacBook in 2006 at age 11. From building potato cannons to flying drones, I always wanted to solve problems and build things.\n\nAfter college, I worked in data science at a European bank and as a quantitative analyst at a hedge fund specializing in mortgage investments.\n\nWhen a friend from college who worked at Nvidia posted on LinkedIn about a software engineering opportunity, I knew I had to apply. I've always been a technologist at heart, and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to see what all the fuss was about.\n\nWhen I first joined, I felt like I was learning a good bit. It was the first time I was on a team where software was the final product and not just an internal tool — where getting the last mile right really mattered.\n\nBut after a few months, I felt like I wasn't learning anymore. There was a top-down management style and a nitpicky, boxed-in way of working. I worked on a lot of bugs and features, and when I asked to work on different projects that I wasn't familiar with, I was told no.\n\nPeople assume that if you work at Nvidia, you make a lot of money. My package was in the low six figures, and the wide disparities in pay between older and newer employees impacted the culture because we were all playing different games.\n\nThe way I view a job is I want to either be learning or earning. I joined late enough that the money wasn't life-changing, and I felt I could get another job that paid roughly the same amount if it ever came to that. Also, our cost of living is reasonable in the Raleigh-Durham area, and my wife and I are both pretty fiscally shrewd.\n\nI always knew I would launch my own company one day. One of my ambitions was to command my own time by the age of 30 and to have kids who could grow up seeing me do that every day.\n\nMy wife and I invested about $20,000 to found our family-owned cloud provider, Carolina Cloud. We're bootstrapping for now, but aren't opposed to raising a small round down the line if we fill our current server fleet.\n\nCarolina Cloud does offer GPUs, but we're focused on CPUs because we believe they absolutely aren't going anywhere: they're less finicky, use less power, are cheaper, and last for years.\n\nAt previous jobs where we'd rented cloud, the prices were so high compared to what I knew it would cost to actually build one of the computers, so I saw an opportunity to create a provider that delivered value while still making money.\n\nCarolina Cloud is focused on on-demand, high-performance compute. Some of our early customers are hedge funds and genomics companies, particularly in the Research Triangle. We differentiate from hyperscalers with lower pricing, no egress fees, and high-touch support.\n\nQuitting my job at Nvidia has turned out to be a boon for my mental health. After a couple of weeks, I started sleeping better, chatting with strangers in public, spontaneously running errands I'd forgotten about, and calling people I hadn't thought about in years.\n\nI've also been working really hard, but on my own terms, which has allowed me to reconnect with my love for technology.\n\nWhile it takes time to get a business off the ground, I told myself that if we didn't turn a profit in 18 months, I could go back to a traditional job. But right now, early interest has gone as expected and indicates that we should be able to stay the course.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "The AI boom is threatening white-collar entry jobs—but it’s creating a booming six-figure opportunity for electricians, plumbers, and construction workers.",
    "fullText": "The job market has been a tough sell for many Gen Z graduates, with tariffs, economic uncertainty, and artificial intelligence reshaping hiring plans across corporate America. But according to Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, the next wave of six-figure opportunities won’t be found in a Wall Street cubicle or Silicon Valley Slack channel. Instead, high-paying careers will partially come by picking up a wrench—literally.\n\nAs tech giants race to build sprawling data centers—totaling $7 trillion in global capital outlays by the end of the decade—Huang believes the world is on the cusp of what he calls the “largest infrastructure buildout in human history,” which will create “a lot of jobs.”\n\n“It’s wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft, and we’re going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers,” he said in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe hands-on skills needed to construct what he described as chip, computer, and AI factories are already facing shortages—even though many roles pay over $100,000 without requiring a college degree. One McKinsey report estimated that between 2023 and 2030, there will be a need for an additional 130,000 trained electricians—as well as 240,000 construction laborers and 150,000 construction supervisors—in the U.S. alone.\n\n“Everybody should be able to make a great living,” Huang said. “You don’t need to have a Ph.D. in computer science to do so.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Huang has expressed his optimistic outlook on new career paths emerging alongside AI.\n\n“The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom,” he told Channel 4 News in the U.K. last year. “You’re going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year.”\n\nThat optimism stands in contrast to warnings from leaders like Ford CEO Jim Farley, who has repeatedly cautioned that AI is hollowing out traditional white-collar entry points—just as the education system continues to funnel students toward four-year degrees.\n\n“There’s more than one way to the American Dream, but our whole education system is focused on four-year [college] education,” Farley said at the Aspen Ideas Festival last year. “Hiring an entry worker at a tech company has fallen 50% since 2019. Is that really where we want all of our kids to go? Artificial intelligence is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.”",

    "fullText": "Is AI coming for your job? If you work in construction or plumbing, that's perhaps not a question you need to worry about.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it was a great time to be a tradesperson because the AI boom is creating demand for manual labor to build data centers.\n\n\"It's wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft and we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers,\" he said in a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nHuang described the AI boom as the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history\" that would create \"a lot of jobs.\"\n\nAI's impact on the labor market has been a hot topic at Davos this year. Huang has long argued that AI won't be the mass job killer some believe it will be. He has given radiology as an example: while AI has automated some of the tasks radiologists do, the number of jobs in the field has actually increased.\n\nAI \"Godfather\" Geoffrey Hinton previously said he also believes manual labor is safer from AI, though for a different reason: it will take longer for AI to have the dexterity to take on more physical jobs.\n\nAt Davos on Wednesday, Huang said the US was seeing a \"significant boom\" in demand for manual jobs helping build AI infrastructure, with salaries nearly doubling in some cases.\n\n\"So we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories, and we have a great shortage in that,\" said Huang.\n\nHe added: \"Everybody should be able to make a great living.

    "description": "Sid Pardeshi, a former Nvidia engineer-turned founder, said Jensen Huang inspired him to launch an AI company, and taught him about leadership.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sid Pardeshi, 32, the co-founder and CTO of a generative AI software platform. He is from India and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI thought I'd stay at Nvidia forever.\n\nThe pay, learning opportunities, and benefits made it a delight to work there. I had no reason to leave.\n\nBut Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, inspired me, and I realized I wanted to be a founder, too.\n\nIn 2022, I made the extremely hard decision to leave Nvidia and pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. I resigned months before ChatGPT was released, and I believe that choice cost me double-digit millions worth of unvested company stock.\n\nI co-founded the AI company Blitzy in 2023, which has raised $4.4 million. Working under Huang for over six years taught me valuable lessons that have been instrumental to my success.\n\nI got an internship with Nvidia in India through my university, where I studied electrical and electronics engineering.\n\nWhen I started in January 2016, Nvidia wasn't a FAANG company, the acronym for the most prestigious Big Tech firms of the time: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. But as a gamer, I was familiar with the company's graphics chips, so I was deeply passionate about working there.\n\nAt the end of my six-month internship, I started a full-time position as a junior engineer at Nvidia in Pune. By 2018, I was a senior system software engineer.\n\nI didn't interact with Jensen much, but he would lead quarterly all-hands meetings, which I would attend remotely from India. He spoke about things where he was ahead of his time, like AI and virtual worlds. I was fascinated by him because I shared his love of technology.\n\nOnce, when Jensen visited staff in India, I asked him after an all-hands meeting what to focus on if I wanted to make a meaningful contribution to Nvidia and the tech space at large.\n\nHe suggested choosing one area of expertise and committing to it deeply, rather than spreading myself out across many interests. I took his guidance to heart and went deep into AI as it related to gaming.\n\nAs time passed, my ambitions evolved. I saw a lot of opportunities emerging in AI, and I wanted to become a founder like Jensen.\n\nIn 2022, at age 28, I quit my job and moved to Massachusetts with my wife and children to join an MSc and MBA program at Harvard.\n\nWhile studying, I worked for Nvidia as an intern from May 2023 to April 2024. They offered me a job that could start after I completed my master's, but starting a business was my primary goal.\n\nIn 2023, a classmate at Harvard and I founded Blitzy, which I work on full-time as the CTO. We're working on using AI to significantly automate software development work for enterprises.\n\nAt Nvidia, I noticed that Jensen nurtured and valued talent. When I was an intern in the US, he made time to meet with us. His assistant kept telling him that a very important client was calling him during the meeting. \"Let them wait,\" Jensen said. \"I'm talking to the future of Nvidia.\"\n\nLike Jensen, I want to keep the spark alive among employees, regardless of their rank. Every day, I allocate two hours to listening to team members and helping them solve problems.\n\nJensen would also follow his convictions. For example, he bet on the accelerated computing platform CUDA in the 2000s, when no one saw its true potential. Now, it's the backbone of AI training processes.\n\nSimilarly, when we first pitched to investors that we intended to use AI to build software autonomously, many didn't believe AI was advanced enough yet. But because I've been reading papers in the AI space every week for years, I trusted my convictions and that we could automate coding at Blitzy.\n\nAnother page I'm taking from his book is never ruling out the prospect of going out of business. Jensen was always concerned about the survival of Nvidia, despite it being a trillion-dollar company. I remember once a fellow intern in the US asked Jensen whether he watched movies. He said that even in the theater, he's thinking about Nvidia.\n\nAs Blitzy's CTO, I want to anticipate every challenge ahead of time. I focus on solving important technical problems and delegate everything else. I want to let people with more knowledge about other aspects of the company handle issues in their space.\n\nSimilarly, it's thought that Jensen's signature outfit, the black pants, shirt, and leather jacket, helps him minimize decision fatigue. I do wear different outfits every day, but my wife, who loves fashion, picks them out for me.\n\nAt one point, I wondered if I was being selfish by leaving Nvidia. I had a family, and needed to make the right choice, both for my career and for them.\n\nI moved to the US on a student visa, which meant my wife was my dependent and not allowed to work. She put her career on the line.\n\nYet, my wife, and my mom, encouraged me to pursue my dreams, and it would be too late now if I hadn't done it then. Once ChatGPT came out, everyone was thinking about bringing AI solutions to the market. I'm glad I already had deep knowledge and experience with AI and was ready to take advantage of the moment.\n\nFinancially, quitting Nvidia wasn't a smart decision because, based on my calculations around my compensation package, my unvested stock would be worth double-digit millions because of how the company's value has grown.\n\nI knew AI technology would progress significantly over the next few years, although I couldn't have anticipated ChatGPT coming out so fast in November 2022 — just months after I resigned. I was leaving right on the cusp of a big moment in the industry, before I was able to harvest the returns.\n\nBut I'm glad I quit when I did. If my family has what they need, working on cutting-edge stuff is more important to me than money.\n\nI got to watch as Nvidia grew from a relatively insignificant company to a trillion-dollar business, and I'm applying everything I learned to Blitzy. My mission is for Blitzy to be on the same trajectory as Nvidia, one day becoming a trillion-dollar company.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment.",

Also, Tesla has lined up Samsung Electronics for U.S.-based chip manufacturing.\n\nIt’s pretty easy to get lost in the AI jargon, so it’s important to be clear about things at each step about what’s happening.\n\nThe A15 and A16 move is essentially about “inference at the edge”. That’s basically running Tesla’s Full Self-Driving neural nets inside the car, instead of relying on a third-party compute stack.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame relayed a Warren Buffett story to warn of wasteful tech spending, and took aim at Nvidia and Palantir again.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry raised the alarm on an AI bubble in a recent Substack exchange, calling out market darlings and warning that a prolonged slump is coming.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame took aim at the tech boom in a written debate with Anthropic cofounder Jack Clark and podcaster Dwarkesh Patel.\n\nBurry cautioned that so-called hyperscalers, including Microsoft and Alphabet, are wasting huge sums on microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete, to power AI tools such as chatbots that will become commoditized.\n\nHe drew a parallel to a Baltimore department store briefly owned by Warren Buffett in the 1960s: Hochschild-Kohn.\n\n\"When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too,\" Burry wrote. \"In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out.\"\n\nWhen one of the local department stores upgraded its window displays or debuted a new cash-register system, \"the others had to follow suit,\" author Alice Schroeder wrote in \"The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life.\"\n\nBuffett and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, compared the situation to \"standing on tiptoe at a parade,\" she added. \"Once anybody did it, everybody had to do it.\"\n\nBurry wrote on Substack: \"This is why trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning. Most will not benefit, because their competitors will benefit to the same extent, and neither will have a competitive advantage because of it.\"\n\nBased on how previous capital-spending booms have played out, Burry wrote that we're now \"past the point where stocks will reward investors for further buildout, and getting into the period where the true costs and the lack of revenue will start to show themselves.\"\n\nLooking forward, he predicted that tech industry employment will \"be lower, or not much higher, because I think we are headed for a very long downturn.\"\n\nBurry shot to fame after his contrarian bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short,\" and actor Christian Bale portrayed him in the movie adaptation.\n\nHe pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack late last year. Several of his early posts have taken aim at high-flying AI stocks, warning they're overvalued and destined to tumble.\n\n\"I think the market is most wrong about the two poster children for AI: Nvidia and Palantir,\" he told Clark and Patel.\n\nThe chipmaker and data-analysis specialist are \"two of the luckiest companies\" because their products were inadvertently well-suited to AI from the get-go, he added.\n\n\"Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach,\" Burry wrote.\n\nHe also said Palantir CEO Alex Karp criticizing him for being short the stock showed he's \"not a confident CEO.\"\n\n\"He's marketing as hard as he can to keep this going, but it will slip,\" Burry added.\n\nPalantir and Nvidia didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe value investor shared three things that have surprised him about the AI boom. The first was that Google \"fumbled it and gave an opening to competitors with far less going for them,\" he said. \"Google playing catch-up to a startup in AI: that is mind-blowing.\"\n\nThe second was that ChatGPT, OpenAI's chatbot, \"kicked off a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure race.\"\n\n\"It's like someone built a prototype robot and every business in the world started investing for a robot future,\" he wrote.\n\nThe third was Nvidia's continued dominance when he expected more power-efficient chips to have taken off by now.\n\nSpeaking about AI's real-world impacts, Burry cast doubt on the idea that trade careers are an \"AI-proof choice.\"\n\n\"If I'm middle class and am facing an $800 plumber or electrician call, I might just use Claude,\" he said, referring to Anthropic's AI chatbot.\n\n\"I love that I can take a picture and figure out everything I need to do to fix it,\" he added.\n\nBurry also raised the prospect that AI chatbots will \"make people dumber,\" such as doctors who overuse them and start to forget their medical knowledge.",

The most prized employees today are \"player-coaches,\" people who ship work themselves while also guiding projects, mentoring peers, and shaping strategy. AI makes that hybrid role even more potent, allowing a single strong contributor to amplify their output, and their influence, without managing a large team, Musa wrote this week.\n\nThe result is a revival of the individual contributor track. You no longer have to become a full-time people manager to earn top-tier pay. At companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, senior ICs can now match (or beat) the compensation of managers simply by delivering outsized results, he noted.\n\nFor ambitious employees, the takeaway is simple: in the AI era, execution compounds.

AGI, a theoretical state of AI where systems gain human levels of intelligence across an array of tasks and are able to replace humans in white-collar jobs such as accountancy and law, is a keystone of this financial promise.\n\nIt offers the prospect of computer systems carrying out profitable work without the associated cost of human labour – a hugely lucrative scenario for companies developing the technology and the customers who deploy it.\n\nThere will be consequences if AI companies fall short: US stock markets, boosted heavily by the performance of tech stocks, could fall and cause damage to people’s personal wealth; debt markets wrapped up in the datacentre boom could suffer a jolt that ripples elsewhere; GDP growth in the US, which has benefited from the AI infrastructure, could falter, which would have knock-on effects for interlinked economies.\n\nDavid Cahn, a partner at one leading Silicon Valley investment firm, Sequoia Capital, says tech companies now have to deliver on AGI.\n\n“Nothing short of AGI will be enough to justify the investments now being proposed for the coming decade,” he wrote in a blog published in October.\n\nIt means there is a lot hanging on progress towards advanced AI, and the trillions being poured into infrastructure and R&D to achieve it. One of the “godfathers” of modern AI, Yoshua Bengio, says the progress of AGI could stall and the outcome would be bad for investors.\n\n“There is a clear possibility that we will hit a wall, that there’s some difficulty that we don’t foresee right now, and we don’t find any solution quickly,” he says. “And that could be a real [financial] crash. A lot of the people who are putting trillions right now into AI are also expecting the advances to continue fairly regularly at the current pace.”\n\nBut Bengio, a prominent voice on the safety implications of AGI, is clear that continued progress towards a highly advanced state of AI is the more likely endgame.\n\n“Advances stalling is a minority scenario, like it’s an unlikely scenario. The more likely scenario is we continue to move forward,” he says.\n\nThe pessimistic view is that investors are backing an unrealistic outcome – that AGI will not happen without further breakthroughs.\n\nDavid Bader, the director of the institute for data science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, says trillions of dollars are being spent on scaling up – tech jargon for growing something quickly – the underlying technology for chatbots, known as transformers, in the expectation that increasing the amount of computing power behind current AI systems, by building more datacentres, will suffice.\n\n“If AGI requires a fundamentally different approach, perhaps something we haven’t yet conceived, then we’re optimising an architecture that can’t get us there no matter how large we make it. It’s like trying to reach the moon by building taller ladders,” he says.\n\nNonetheless, big US tech companies such as Google’s parent Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are ploughing ahead with datacentre plans with the financial cushion of being able to fund their AGI ambitions through the cash generated by their hugely profitable day-to-day businesses. This at least gives them some protection if the wall outlined by Bengio and Bader comes into view.\n\nBut there are other more worrying aspects to the boom. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, estimate that $2.9tn will be spent on datacentres between now and 2028, with half of that covered by the cashflow from “hyperscalers” such as Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nThe rest will have to be covered by alternative sources such as private credit, a corner of the shadow banking sector that is activating alarm bells at the Bank of England and elsewhere. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, has borrowed $29bn from the private credit market to finance a datacentre in Louisiana.\n\nAI-related sectors account for approximately 15% of investment grade debt in the US, which is even bigger than the banking sector, according to the investment bank JP Morgan.\n\nOracle, which has signed a $300bn datacentre deal with OpenAI, has had an increase in credit default swaps, which are a form of insurance on a company defaulting on its debts. High-yield, or “junk debt”, which represents the higher-risk end of the borrowing market, is also appearing in the AI sector via datacentre operators CoreWeave and TeraWulf. Growth is also being funded by asset-backed securities – a form of debt underpinned by assets such as loans or credit card debt, but in this case rent paid by tech companies to datacentre owners – in a form of financing that has risen sharply in recent years.\n\nIt is no wonder that JP Morgan says the AI infrastructure boom will require a contribution from all corners of the credit market.\n\nBader says: “If AGI doesn’t materialise on expected timelines, we could see contagion across multiple debt markets simultaneously – investment-grade bonds, high-yield junk debt, private credit and securitised products – all of which are being tapped to fund this buildout.”\n\nShare prices linked to AI and tech are also playing an outsized role in US stock markets. The so-called “magnificent 7” of US tech stocks – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia – account for more than a third of the value of the S&P 500 index, the biggest stock market index in the US, compared with 20% at the start of the decade.\n\nIn October the Bank of England warned of “the risk of a sharp correction” in US and UK markets due to giddy valuations of AI-linked tech companies. Central bankers are concerned stock markets could slump if AI fails to reach the transformative heights investors are hoping for. At the same time the International Monetary Fund said valuations were heading towards dotcom bubble-levels.\n\nEven tech execs whose companies are benefiting from the boom are acknowledging the speculative nature of the frenzy. In November Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, said there are “elements of irrationality” in the boom and that “no company is going to be immune” if the bubble bursts, while Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has said the AI industry is in a “kind of industrial bubble”, and OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, has said “there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.”\n\nAll three, to be clear, are AI optimists and expect the technology to keep improving and benefit society.\n\nBut when the numbers get this big there are obvious risks in a bubble bursting, as Pichai admits. Pension funds and anyone invested in the stock market will be affected by a share price collapse, while the debt markets will also take a hit. There is also a web of “circular” deals, such as OpenAI paying Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares. If these transactions unravel due to a lack of take-up of AI, or that wall being hit, then it could be messy.\n\nThere are also optimists who argue that generative AI, the catch-all term for tools such as chatbots and video generators, will transform whole industries and justify the expenditure. Benedict Evans, a technology analyst, says the expenditure numbers are not outrageous in the context of other industries, such as oil and gas extraction which runs at $600bn a year.\n\n“These AI capex figures are a lot of money but it’s not an impossible amount of money,” he says.\n\nEvans adds: “You don’t have to believe in AGI to believe that generative AI is a big thing. And most of what is happening here is not, ‘oh wow they’re going to create God’. It’s ‘this is going to completely change how advertising, search, software and social networks – and everything else our business is based on – is going to work’. It’s going to be a huge opportunity.”\n\nNonetheless, there is a multitrillion dollar expectation that AGI will be achieved. For many experts, the consequences of getting there are alarming. The cost of not getting there could also be significant.",

    "description": "Apple once set the bar for suppliers including TSMC. Now it's being unseated by Nvidia and AI cloud giants.",
    "fullText": "For over a decade, Apple sat at the center of the tech supply chain. Its enormous scale let it dictate pricing, lock up capacity, and steer the roadmaps of suppliers that made everything from chips and memory to substrates and packaging. That era is ending.\n\n\"Apple is no longer the gravitational center of the hardware universe,\" said Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology, who tracks the industry's supply chain.\n\n\"Apple still moves huge volumes and has unmatched brand strength. But the company is no longer the anchor client for fabs, substrate makers, or key component suppliers. That's a fundamental change.\"\n\nThis is important because the tech companies that control the supply chain are more likely to win. When you can order the largest amount of a key component, you get better pricing and a more reliable supply. That results in better-priced products that are available sooner than your rivals. This power is now shifting toward AI giants, including Nvidia and huge cloud players such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (aka \"AMG\").\n\nThe most visible sign is at TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker. It's famous for churning out cutting-edge iPhone chips, which gave Apple a huge advantage over other consumer hardware players.\n\nWhen TSMC reported results this week, it became very clear that its smartphone business is no longer its most important segment. High-performance computing — a category dominated by AI chips for companies like Nvidia and hyperscale cloud providers — now accounts for roughly 58% of TSMC's revenue, far surpassing smartphone processors.\n\nTSMC makes chips for Nvidia's AI servers, which are being snapped up in huge volumes by the cloud giants. They pack this gear into huge data centers that train and run AI models to power new services such as ChatGPT. Is that a better business than making iPhone chips?\n\nTSMC's CEO C.C. Wei answered that. He's been talking to these AI giants a lot lately. Here's what he said on this week's earnings call:\n\n\"They show me the evidence that the AI really helps their business. So they grow their business successfully and see the financial return. So I also double-checked their financial status. They are very rich.\"\n\nSuppliers go where the money is. Increasingly, the biggest Benjamins are coming from AI and cloud giants, not Apple.\n\nThis shift is rippling through the rest of the supply chain. Memory chip makers are reallocating capacity away from phones and PCs to feed AI data centers hungry for DRAM, dynamic random access memory. This is a common type of memory chip that's used in AI servers and iPhones.\n\nMemory prices have surged lately, and that's likely to push up smartphone costs and potentially squeeze margins. Nvidia has locked in long-term memory supply, leaving smartphone makers with less negotiating power.\n\n\"For the past 15 years, Apple's scale let it dictate component supply, pricing, and roadmaps,\" Gastwirth said. \"That leverage diminishes when suppliers earn higher margins and higher growth from AI customers than from smartphones.\"\n\nBottlenecks are emerging in unexpected places, too. A shortage of high-end glass cloth, a critical input for chip substrates, has suppliers prioritizing AI customers who pre-pay and sign multi-year contracts.\n\nApple, which uses these substrates across nearly all its products, is now competing with AI chipmakers for limited supply and even sending engineers to help smaller suppliers qualify alternative materials, according to a report this week from Nikkei.\n\nManufacturing partners are also re-prioritizing. Foxconn, once synonymous with iPhone assembly, now generates more revenue from AI servers than from consumer electronics. Its fastest-growing customers are hyperscalers and Nvidia, not Apple.\n\nNone of this makes Apple irrelevant. The company remains one of the world's largest buyers of components. However, in a supply chain increasingly shaped by AI, pricing, allocation, and capacity planning are being set elsewhere — and Apple is learning what it's like to be just another very large customer.\n\n\"In the 2010s, Apple set the pace for the supply chain,\" Gastwirth said. \"In the late 2020s, Nvidia, hyperscalers, and AI infrastructure now dictate pricing, allocation, and long‑term capacity planning.\"\n\nApple didn't respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang thinks privileged Gen Z grads should lower their expectations if they want success.",
    "fullText": "Orianna Rosa Royle is the Success associate editor at Fortune, overseeing careers, leadership, and company culture coverage. She was previously the senior reporter at Management Today, Britain's longest-running publication for CEOs.\n\nWe are often told that setting the bar high is key to success. After all, if you shoot for the moon and miss, at least you’ll land with the stars. But Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang wants privileged Gen Z grads to lower their expectations.\n\n“People with very high expectations have very low resilience—and unfortunately, resilience matters in success,” Huang said during an interview with the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “One of my great advantages is that I have very low expectations.”\n\nIndeed, as the billionaire boss pointed out, those at elite institutions like Stanford probably have higher expectations for their future than your average Joe.\n\nThe university is one of the most selective in the United States—it ranks third best in the country, according to the QS World University Rankings, and the few students who get picked to study there are charged more than $68,000 in tuition fees for the premium, compared to the average $38,270 per annum cost.\n\nBut, unfortunately for those saddled with student debt, not even the best universities in the world can teach you resilience.\n\n“I don’t know how to teach it to you except for I hope suffering happens to you,” Huang added.\n\nHuang’s advice for America’s next-gen elite comes from a place of experience: His life now is a world away from his childhood, which was, by his own admission, steeped in adversity.\n\nThe tech genius—who with a net worth of $155 billion is one of the world’s wealthiest people—was born in Taiwan in 1963 and spent the bulk of his early life in Thailand, before moving to the U.S. at 9 years old.\n\nHis serendipitous Stateside move came after his dad, who worked for an air conditioner manufacturer, did some training in the country and set his sights on the American Dream.\n\n“I was fortunate that I grew up with my parents providing a condition for us to be successful on the one hand,” he said. “But there were plenty of opportunities for setbacks and suffering.”\n\nOne example of Huang’s hardship was his daily high school experience: The teenager had to cross a dangerous footbridge with missing planks over a river to get to his public school in Kentucky, where he was then relentlessly tormented.\n\n“The way you described Chinese people back then was ‘Ch-nks,’ ” Huang previously told the New Yorker, adding that bullies even tried to toss him off the bridge.\n\nIn the Stanford interview, he also credited his success and work ethic with his first job at Denny’s, where he was the “best dishwasher” before getting promoted to busboy and giving that his “best” also.\n\n“I never left the station empty-handed. I never came back empty-handed. I was very efficient,” Huang added. “Anyways, eventually I became a CEO. I’m still working on being a good CEO.”\n\nCoincidentally, it was at Denny’s where he cooked up the idea for a company that specialized in computer chips to render graphics, over a Super Bird sandwich with his friends Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. The trio went on to cofound Nvidia, and the rest is history.\n\nFor those fortunate enough to never have personally experienced hardship growing up, Huang doesn’t have any advice on how to welcome more of it into your life now. But he did have some advice on embracing tough times.\n\n“I don’t know how to do it [but] for all of you Stanford students, I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering,” Huang said. “Greatness comes from character and character isn’t formed out of smart people—it’s formed out of people who suffered.”\n\nIt’s why despite Nvidia’s success—the company has a $2 trillion market cap—Huang would still welcome hardship at his organization.\n\n“To this day I use the phrase ‘pain and suffering’ inside our company with great glee,” he added. “I mean that in a happy way because you want to refine the character of your company.”\n\nEssentially, if you want your workforce to always be on their A game, don’t let them rest on their laurels.\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on March 13, 2024.",

    "title": "'Task' versus 'purpose': Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang explains why AI won't kill jobs.",
    "description": "AI may automate tasks, but your job's purpose may be immune from AI disruption. This applies to radiology, law, coding, and even waiting tables.",
    "fullText": "Hospitals, law firms, and tech companies are getting a preview of how AI is likely to reshape work: by automating tasks without eliminating the underlying jobs.\n\nThat's the core message Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasized in a recent appearance on the No Priors podcast.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, he argued that fears of mass job destruction often confuse the \"tasks\" involved in a job with the broader \"purpose\" of the role. AI, in his view, changes how tasks get done, but the purpose remains the same. And that means, the technology probably won't destroy jobs and could even increase demand for the people responsible for outcomes at work.\n\nHuang's framing is straightforward: Most jobs contain repeatable tasks that technology can compress, and a broader purpose that remains human-led. He highlighted radiology as a real-world example.\n\nYears ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted that AI would eradicate many radiology jobs and advised students to avoid the field. The opposite happened. While AI is automating many radiology tasks, there are actually more radiologists employed now than when Hinton made his prediction in 2016.\n\nHere are the killer stats, shared in this 2025 blog post that describes why radiologists are still in huge demand: In 2025, American diagnostic radiology residency programs offered a record 1,208 positions, a 4% increase from 2024, and the field's vacancy rates are at all-time highs. Also, in 2025, radiology was the second-highest-paid medical specialty in the country, with an average income of $520,000, over 48% percent higher than the average radiologist salary in 2015 (the year before Hinton's prediction).\n\nHow did this happen? Huang argued that the job's purpose isn't \"reading scans.\" Those are tasks that AI has automated. The true purpose of a radiologist is to diagnose disease, guide treatment, and support those efforts with research. When AI helps clinicians evaluate more images with higher confidence, hospitals can serve more patients, generate more revenue, and justify hiring more specialists.\n\nThe same logic, he said, applies across the economy.\n\n\"I spend most of my day typing,\" Huang noted, describing typing as a task, not his job's purpose. Tools that automate writing don't eliminate the need for executives; they often expand the amount of work leaders and other employees can take on, he said.\n\n\"The fact that somebody could use AI to automate a lot of my typing — I really appreciate that, and it helps a lot,\" he said. \"It hasn't really made me, if you will, less busy. In a lot of ways, I become more busy because I'm able to do more work.\"\n\nThis \"task versus purpose\" framework is increasingly visible in knowledge work, where AI tools are speeding up and automating tasks such as drafting, summarizing, and generating code.\n\nHuang pointed to software engineering as a case where AI can reduce time spent on a core task (writing code) while raising demand for the job's purpose: solving problems and identifying new ones worth solving.\n\nNvidia, he said, is hiring aggressively even as AI coding tools such as Cursor spread through the company's engineering teams, because productivity gains allow companies to pursue more ideas. That can boost revenue, leaving more money to hire new staff.\n\nLaw is another example he cited. Reading and drafting contracts are tasks, while the purpose of a lawyer is to protect clients and resolve disputes. AI can accelerate document-heavy work, but the role's true value relies on judgment, strategy, and accountability — and you need experienced, trustworthy human attorneys for that.\n\nThis even applies to waiters working in a restaurant. Their task is taking food orders, but their purpose is to ensure guests have a great time, Huang said.\n\n\"If some AI is taking the order or even delivering the food, their job is still helping us have a great experience,\" the CEO added. \"They would reshape their jobs accordingly.\"\n\nHuang's argument isn't that AI won't disrupt roles — it will. But he contends the early evidence points less toward a wholesale collapse of employment and more toward job redesign.\n\nFor workers, the implication is pragmatic: if your role is defined primarily by a repeatable task, AI is a direct threat. If it's anchored in outcomes — diagnosis, customer experience, problem-solving, conflict resolution — AI may be less a replacement than a lever, changing what you spend time on while keeping your job's purpose intact.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Nvidia could face the risk of ceding its software edge if it loses the China market.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia's (NVDA) China business continues to face geopolitical hurdles, which could pose longer-term competitive risks for the AI chipmaker.\n\nOngoing US-China tensions have upended Nvidia’s sales in what was one of its largest markets. In the company’s most recent quarter, revenue from China, which includes Hong Kong, dropped 45% from a year ago to about $3 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nAnd while the Trump administration green-lighted the sale of Nvidia’s H200 chip to China this week, albeit with a 25% tax, Reuters reported that China is barring imports of the GPUs except in special cases.\n\nSo far, Nvidia's dominant position in the chip market doesn't appear to have suffered much after the company initially lost access to the Chinese AI market in 2025. It became the first company with a $5 trillion valuation last fall. Despite a decline in China sales, its third quarter revenue overall soared more than 60% during the period to about $57 billion.\n\nBut over the long term, the Chinese commercial sector’s development and use of domestic chips could narrow Nvidia’s lead on the global stage, Wall Street analysts told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThey said Nvidia's dominance in AI software could suffer if Chinese tech developers begin making advances in open source alternatives, which would hurt its leadership in hardware as well.\n\n“That's the real nightmare scenario,” Seaport analyst Jay Goldberg said.\n\nMuch of Nvidia’s competitive edge comes from its software stack. Developers using its AI systems rely on the company’s CUDA platform, which includes a library of proprietary tools that lets them program its GPUs efficiently and reinforces the company’s dominance in the chip market.\n\nAs companies build on CUDA, the cost of switching to a new software platform becomes disadvantageous, and they end up sticking with Nvidia’s offerings, which are only available if developers are programming on Nvidia's GPUs. Hence, the preference for Nvidia's software is key to maintaining its lead in the hardware space.\n\nWhile China’s chip suppliers — from tech giants Huawei and Alibaba (BABA) to newly public players such as Moore Threads and MetaX — lag Nvidia in the performance capabilities of their chips, there’s a risk that the country’s AI developers, forced to use those inferior, domestically-produced chips, will build their own open-source software. Open-source AI software is typically written to run on many different types of chips.",

    "fullText": "The order follows a nine-month investigation and includes broad exemptions for datacenters and consumers\n\nDonald Trump on Wednesday imposed a 25% tariff on certain AI chips, such as the Nvidia H200 AI processor ​and a similar semiconductor from AMD called the MI325X, under a new national security order released by the White House.\n\nThe proclamation follows a nine-month investigation under ‌section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and targets a number of high-end semiconductors meeting certain performance benchmarks and devices containing them for import duties. The action is part of a broader effort to create incentives for chipmakers to produce more semiconductors in the US and decrease reliance on chip manufacturers in places such as Taiwan.\n\n“The United States currently fully manufactures only approximately 10 percent of the chips it requires, making it heavily reliant on foreign supply chains,” the proclamation said, adding that the reliance was a “significant economic and national ‌security risk”.\n\nThe White House said in a fact sheet that the tariffs would be narrowly focused and would not apply ​to chips and derivative devices imported for US datacenters – a huge consumer of AI chips – startups, non-datacenter consumer applications, non-datacenter civil industrial applications and US public sector applications.\n\nHoward Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, has broad discretion to apply further exemptions, according to the proclamation.\n\nShares of Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm traded slightly lower in after-hours trading.\n\nTrump ‍in December said he would slap tariffs on Chinese semiconductor imports over Beijing’s “unreasonable” pursuit of chip industry dominance, but delayed the action until June 2027.\n\nThat move followed a year-long “Section 301” unfair trade practices investigation into China’s exports of “legacy”, or older-technology chips to the US, launched by former president Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nQuestions had swirled about the universe of products containing chips that would be ⁠hit by the tariffs, the tariff rates, and whether any countries, products or companies would be exempt. Wednesday’s announcement, coupled with the news from December, suggests a ‍light touch from the administration on chip imports, for now.\n\nTrump last year announced he would allow Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China in exchange for a cut of the sales of ‌those chips. Legal ‌experts questioned whether such an arrangement would violate the US constitution’s ban on taxing exports.\n\nThe Trump administration this week required that China-bound chips make a detour from Taiwan, where they are made, through the United States for testing by a third-party lab. When the chips enter the United States, they are subject to the 25% tariff announced on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“We comply with all US export control laws and policies,” AMD said in a statement.\n\nTrump has deployed an ⁠array of tariffs aimed at bolstering ⁠US manufacturing, announcing in September sweeping ​new import tariffs, including 100% duties on branded drugs and 25% levies on heavy-duty trucks, triggering fresh trade uncertainty after a period of relative calm.\n\nIn April, the Trump administration announced investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of an effort to impose tariffs on them, arguing that extensive reliance on their foreign production poses a national security threat.\n\nWhile US companies ‍like Nvidia, AMD and Intel design many of the most widely used chips, most are made overseas, many by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the Semiconductor Industry Association also could not immediately be reached.\n\nTrump, in the near future, may also impose broader tariffs on imports of semiconductors and their derivative products to incentivize domestic manufacturing, according ​to the fact sheet.\n\nAn annex to the order clarifies that any 25% tariff imposed on semiconductors ‍under the order would not be stacked on top of the other tariffs imposed by the Trump administration under other section 232 orders. They would be exempt from duties on copper, aluminum and steel, auto ​and truck parts.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia has added high-profile names to its senior leadership and technical ranks over the past year, as the chipmaker reaches new levels of visibility and wealth.\n\nNvidia's latest major hire is its first chief marketing officer, Alison Wagonfeld, a veteran of Google Cloud. Over the past year, the company has also acqui-hired senior software leaders through startup deals, tapping its balance sheet to supercharge growth. It has also sought talent from outside the tech industry, including hires from government and academia.\n\nTaken together, they underscore Nvidia's position as an AI chip designer expanding its software products, with added cybersecurity and marketing muscle to engage governments and large enterprise customers, alongside software and research executives to build the programs that run on its hallmark GPUs.\n\nWhile 2024 saw the departure of key leaders, such as Keith Strier, Nvidia's former vice president of worldwide AI initiatives, and enterprise computing executive Manuvir Das, turnover at the top was more limited in 2025.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nKristin Major joined Nvidia as senior vice president of human resources last February, after spending over 13 years at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where she held roles across the company's legal and HR departments. At Nvidia, Major serves on CEO Jensen Huang's executive leadership team, according to the executive search firm ON Partners.\n\nJiantao Jiao announced he was joining Nvidia in June. He works on AI post-training, evaluation, agents, and building better infrastructure, with the aim of fostering collaboration between academia and industry. Previously, he was the CEO and cofounder of Nexusflow AI, and he is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nMark Weatherford serves as Nvidia's head of cybersecurity policy and strategic engagement. Prior to joining Nvidia, he held several roles across the public and private sectors, including serving as the nation's first deputy undersecretary for cybersecurity at the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration.\n\nRochan Sankar, the founder and CEO of AI startup Enfabrica, is joining Nvidia through a $900 million acqui-hire in September that also saw the chip giant license his startup's technology. Other employees at Enfabrica — which builds systems to cluster GPUs together for large AI workloads — also joined Nvidia as part of the deal.\n\nKrysta Svore joined Nvidia in November after nearly 20 years at Microsoft, where she served as VP of advanced quantum development. At Nvidia, she'll \"lead applied research and engineering across the quantum stack,\" according to a LinkedIn post.\n\nLate last year, Nvidia acquired Danny Auble's startup SchedMD, which creates the open-source workload management software Slurm. Nvidia said it will keep Slurm open-source and continue to invest in the software. Auble serves as Nvidia's senior director of system software.\n\nNvidia hired Groq founder Jonathan Ross and COO Sunny Madra in December, following a $20 billion deal to license its inferencing technology. The deal signaled a significant shift in the AI market from training to inference. Groq said in a press release that while some team members would join Nvidia, the company will continue to operate independently.\n\nAlison Wagonfeld, who served as Google Cloud's head of marketing for roughly a decade, joined Nvidia in January as its first-ever CMO. In \"moving from one AI leader to another,\" Wagonfeld wrote on LinkedIn that she would join Huang's leadership team and head up marketing and communications at the company through \"its next phase of growth.\"\n\nDieter Fox, Nvidia's former senior director of robotics research, left the company in June after roughly eight years to join Ai2, a nonprofit AI research institute. At the institute, Fox works on foundation models for robotics.\n\nMinwoo Park, a vice president at Nvidia who worked on autonomous vehicle research, left the company this month to join Hyundai. At the automaker, Park will serve as head of the advanced vehicle platform division and CEO of its self-driving arm, 42dot, working on software-defined vehicles and autonomous driving software.\n\nNvidia lost two board members in 2025. Ellen Ochoa, a veteran astronaut who served on the nominating and corporate governance committee, left for personal reasons in July, while Rob Burgess, a longtime tech executive, died in December.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Advanced Micro Devices' products are cheaper than Nvidia's.\n\nNvidia's supply problems could open the door for AMD.\n\nAMD expects huge data center growth over the next five years.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\n\nThe trillion-dollar stock club is a fairly exclusive group. There have only been 10 U.S.-listed stocks that have breached this valuation level, and there are a few more within striking distance.\n\nHowever, one stock that's a bit far away is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). AMD has a market cap of $330 billion, so it may not be on investors' radar for crossing into the $1 trillion valuation range. However, AMD's hardware is starting to become more popular in the artificial intelligence (AI) world, and it may get there faster than many think.\n\nHow quickly can AMD reach $1 trillion? Well, if its projections come true, it could be there in as little as four years.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the undisputed king of graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are well-suited for AI workloads, as they can process multiple calculations in parallel. At the start of the AI boom in 2023, Nvidia's GPUs, the controlling software, and other hardware that supports them were far superior to AMD's. As a result, Nvidia's products became the go-to option, while AMD's only became an alternative.\n\nHowever, those trends are shifting. AMD has made massive improvements in its control software, ROCm. It noted a 10 times increase in downloads year over year in November 2025. That's a big deal because it shows that developers are exploring their hardware. This could be a signal that AMD's products are starting to become a viable alternative, and may be ready to steal some market share away from Nvidia.\n\nThere is only so much money available to build data centers. Computing hardware can be nearly half of the cost to build them, and while Nvidia's products are the best, they aren't cheap.\n\nThere aren't readily available prices on flagship GPUs for data centers, and these numbers are estimates from reports. Nvidia's Blackwell B200 GPU can cost between $30,000 and $50,000 per chip, depending on options. Its AMD rival, the MI350, costs $25,000. This allows AI hyperscalers to get more bang for the buck for cloud GPUs, but it remains to be seen if this cheaper price tag is worth it from a performance side.\n\nHowever, AI hyperscalers may not have a choice on whether they want to use AMD's chips anymore. During Nvidia's Q3 results, the company announced that it was \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. While this may sound like a good problem to have, the bigger issue is that customers may turn to AMD's products as an alternative if they cannot get the computing power that they need from Nvidia. If AMD's products can deliver similar results at a lower price tag, this could create a scenario where more clients choose AMD's hardware in the future.",

The Trump administration may expand tariffs to a wider range of semiconductors and related products in the future, according to the White House fact sheet.\n\nTrump cited national security concerns and invoked Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, per the White House fact sheet, which allows presidents to impose trade restrictions after determining imports pose a security risk.\n\nThe tariff aligns with Trump's broader agenda to reshore advanced manufacturing get stay ahead of the AI race.

    "description": "The tariffs will allow President Trump to take a cut of Nvidia’s chip sales to China while putting off a decision about imposing higher taxes on the chip industry.",
    "fullText": "President Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday to impose a 25 percent tariff on a narrow list of foreign semiconductors, providing a way for the government to earn revenue off the sale of lucrative chips used in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe tariff, which would take effect Thursday, is far more limited than what the president initially threatened. Last year, the administration began an investigation aimed at encouraging tech companies and chip makers to buy semiconductors made in America. But instead of approving sweeping tariffs that would affect the industry, Wednesday’s announcement showed the administration has settled for narrower levies that allow it to take a cut of artificial intelligence chips sold to China.\n\nA document released by the White House said a 25 percent tariff would be put on A.I. chips made by companies like Nvidia and AMD that are imported into the United States and then re-exported to other countries. The tariff would not apply to semiconductors that are brought into the country to be used domestically in data centers or in products for American consumers, industry or the government. But it would allow the U.S. government to collect revenue from the sale of A.I. chips to China, an idea Mr. Trump proposed last year.\n\nThe president may still impose broader tariffs on semiconductor imports and products containing them in the near future, the White House said, including a program that would provide tariff relief for companies that manufacture chips domestically.\n\nFor now, though, the arrangement will very likely be welcomed by major chip companies that have lobbied fiercely to limit the scope of any tariffs. Most chip companies manufacture the bulk of their products in Taiwan or East Asia, where many of the world’s electronics are made, and ship them into the United States only if they are to be used domestically.\n\nMr. Trump threatened last August to impose a 100 percent tariff on foreign semiconductors unless manufacturers committed to invest in the United States. But chip tariffs had the potential to rankle foreign governments, as well as many of the tech companies that have grown close with the president. The administration has been particularly cautious of disrupting a trade truce that it reached last year with China, a major manufacturer of semiconductors.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday avoided any such impacts, while also allowing Mr. Trump to realize his plans to take a 25 percent cut of the revenue that Nvidia, the A.I. chip giant, will make from selling advanced chips to China.\n\nMr. Trump first floated the plan in August but was forbidden by U.S. law to tax exports or export licenses. So administration officials proposed a circuitous solution where they would bring Nvidia chips manufactured in Asia into the United States and impose a 25 percent tariff on the imported chip, before re-exporting the products to China.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Commerce issued a rule to permit the sale of a more advanced A.I. chip made by Nvidia, the H200, to China. Mr. Trump had banned the sale of those chips last year out of national security concerns, but abruptly reversed himself after Nvidia argued that exporting the chips was important for American global technology leadership. Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, has become one of Mr. Trump’s closest allies in the tech world.\n\nMr. Trump started the chips inquiry under a national security-related law known as Section 232, which he has used to apply tariffs to other sectors, including a 50 percent tariff on all steel imports and a 25 percent tariff on all imported cars.\n\nThe White House also said Wednesday that it had concluded a Section 232 investigation into critical minerals, including lithium, gallium, germanium, cobalt and nickel. An executive order said the administration would refrain from putting tariffs on the sector for now.\n\nInstead, the order directed officials to negotiate trade agreements that would provide the United States more access to critical minerals, which are used in things ranging from cars to airplanes to A.I. data centers. The United States is heavily reliant on other countries — including China — for those minerals.\n\nSome analysts have questioned whether the Trump administration is backing away from heftier tariffs amid rising concerns among Americans about affordability. High prices were a key issue that helped propel Democrats to electoral wins in November. In an economic speech on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called affordability a “fake word by Democrats” but also detailed various steps his administration had taken to lower prices.\n\nBecause semiconductors are in almost everything with an on-off switch, chip companies had warned the administration that more expansive tariffs could lead to widespread price increases across the American economy.\n\nOthers have told the administration that a 25 percent surcharge on the machinery they need to manufacture chips, which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, would make semiconductor factories in the United States unviable.\n\nLast year, the United States imported roughly $45 billion in semiconductor chips, primarily from Taiwan and Malaysia, according to Bernstein Research.\n\nMr. Trump had said companies that have committed to building in the United States wouldn’t pay tariffs, and Commerce Department employees have been working on an arrangement that would offer tariff exemptions to companies that invest domestically. Last year, the chief executives of Apple, Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, pledged more than $1 trillion in U.S. investments as they sought to avoid fees.\n\nSemiconductor companies have been forced to accept uncertainty under Mr. Trump. Since returning to office, he has threatened to take away government grants, restricted chip sales to China, demanded investments and recommended that one company, Intel, fire its chief executive.\n\nThe intrusions have paralyzed an industry that less than a year earlier signed contracts with the Biden administration to release tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to build factories. Mr. Trump immediately put the industry on edge by criticizing those programs as wasteful, and had his staff ask firms for more investments before releasing the money.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has also seemed attuned to the concerns of tech C.E.O.s, particularly Mr. Huang and Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook. In April, the administration gave the technology industry a lucrative carve-out from its global tariffs, saying electronics would soon be subject to other tariffs under Section 232. No other industry has received such a broad exemption.",

    "description": "A \"nasty\" 15% sell-off could hit crowded trades this spring, says Tom Sosnoff.",
    "fullText": "The hottest AI trade on Wall Street has officially become \"boring.\"\n\n\"Nvidia would be a very boring idea ... because we all know the story,\" serial entrepreneur Tom Sosnoff told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nThe former founder of Thinkorswim and Tastytrade argued that despite Nvidia's technological dominance, the stock's story is too well-known and it may be priced for perfection.\n\nSosnoff isn't a tech skeptic. In fact, he's a fan of the product. He likened Nvidia's (NVDA) AI platforms to having a \"genius best friend\" with a 165 IQ available at all times.\n\nThe problem, he argued, is that Nvidia is now \"totally fully priced.\" When most analysts and retail traders are already on one side of the boat, that \"boring\" reality suggests there are very few surprise scenarios that can drive the price significantly higher from here.\n\n\"I look at Nvidia and I'm thinking to myself, how much more upside [is] in here and what kind of downside is there if this thing rolls over?\" Sosnoff said. \"It's not a function of ... Nvidia itself. It's just a function of price.\"\n\nThe warning comes at a time when market volatility is hovering at multi-year lows and stocks are sitting at record levels. In the past year, Nvidia's shares have risen roughly 40%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) recently closed at all-time highs this month.\n\nSosnoff isn't predicting a total market collapse, but he's bracing for a reality check. He anticipates a \"nasty sell-off\" in the range of 10% to 15% potentially hitting between March and May.\n\n\"The odds favor the downside in the market,\" said Sosnoff. He noted that while the equity market is partying, the bond market has remained eerily stagnant. If that volatility returns, the \"fully priced\" darlings like Nvidia are often the first to feel the gravity. Moreover, market fickleness could materialize when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\nAnother provocative take is that Nvidia's reign as the world's most valuable company is under threat. When asked if the AI giant would still have its crown at the end of the year, Sosnoff was skeptical.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be Nvidia,\" he said regarding the market cap race. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has recently edged out Apple (AAPL) to become the second-most-valuable company in the world, and it's within striking distance of Nvidia as it surges past $4 trillion.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said Nvidia is \"simply the purest play\" for an investor to bet against the AI boom.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says he's betting against Nvidia instead of Meta, Alphabet, or Microsoft because the chipmaker is particularly vulnerable to the AI boom ending in disaster.\n\nNvidia is \"simply the purest play,\" Burry wrote in a Substack post last weekend. The company has become \"entirely dependent on hyperscaler spending, and I do not see how that math works,\" he continued.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing online late last year, added that Nvidia is likely to \"sell $400 billion of its chips this year and there are less than $100 billion in application layer use cases.\"\n\n\"Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,\" Burry wrote. \"So shorting it is cheap.\"\n\nBurry also name-checked CoreWeave, a provider of cloud services built for AI and a strategic partner of Nvidia, calling it the graphics-processor giant's \"pet.\"\n\nNvidia's stock price has surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, making the graphics-chip maker the world's most valuable public company with a $4.5 trillion market capitalization.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBurry said that betting against Meta would mean he was \"also shorting its social media/advertising dominance,\" and placing a wager against Alphabet would mean he was \"shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc.\"\n\nHe added that being short Microsoft would be tantamount to \"shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,\" referring to the company's software-as-a-service tools, including Word and Excel.\n\nThose Big Tech titans aren't \"pure shorts on AI\" and have staying power, Burry wrote.\n\n\"They will realize they should not be spending so much, write off assets, and possibly restate earnings,\" he said. \"But they still are dominant companies globally away from the AI buildout.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Burry said he would short OpenAI if it were a public company. He highlighted the ChatGPT maker's $500 billion valuation in October, which exceeds the market values of Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, and Costco.\n\nBurry said he owns bearish put options on Oracle, and directly shorted the database company in the last six months.\n\n\"I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making,\" he wrote, adding that the company, cofounded by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, is making unnecessary, inexplicable moves and \"ego\" might be the driver.\n\nBurry is famous for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, an episode of his career that was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short.\"\n\nHe wrote on Substack that \"technological obsolescence is on the menu as Nvidia now seems to introduce a new chip solution every year or less.\"\n\nThat echoed a previous post in which he said Nvidia's Big Tech customers were overstating the lifespan of its chips to drag out their depreciation and flatter their short-term profits, raising the prospect of future writedowns.\n\nBurry also warned of trouble ahead, saying he's betting against AI stocks to \"have the exposure on the right side when the music stops.\"\n\nBurry spoke about AI more broadly in his post, drawing a parallel between its rise and the history of electricity.\n\nHe pointed out that building power plants and grids in the late 1980s and early 1990s required \"massive upfront capital outlays,\" technological advances meant equipment such as transformers became quickly outdated and assets rapidly depreciated, and \"cutthroat price warfare\" between suppliers meant many ran into financial difficulties and were forced to merge with rivals.\n\n\"What I see in electrification is very similar to what happened during the 2000 data transmission bubble and what I see happening with the AI bubble,\" he wrote.\n\nBurry said that electricity was as transformative to the modern world as a medicine that enables a patient to walk 10 feet, whereas AI \"might be the anabolic steroid that allows superhuman feats of strength and ability,\" but could ultimately prove \"more dangerous than anything.\"\n\nHe also repeated his caution that if the US tries to win the AI race by going all-in on increasingly power-hungry chips, it will lose as China is ramping up its power-generation capacity much more quickly.\n\n\"I see a big inventory problem in the AI buildout as a result of the current power generation setup,\" Burry said.",

    "fullText": "After Apple chose Gemini to power Siri, Alphabet surpassed Apple to become second-most valuable company in world\n\nGoogle’s parent company hit a major financial milestone on Monday, reaching a $4tn valuation for the first time and surpassing Apple to become the second-most valuable company in the world.\n\nAlphabet is the fourth company to hit the $4tn milestone after Nvidia, which later hit $5tn, Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe spike in share price comes after Apple announced it had chosen Google’s Gemini AI model to power a major overhaul of the iPhone maker’s digital assistant Siri, which comes installed in every iPhone. Neither company disclosed how much the deal was worth.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,” Apple said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nAs tech stocks continue a years-long meteoric rise, fears of a bubble in the stock market persist; however, Wall Street’s excitement for new avenues of investment in AI does as well. Alphabet’s milestones signal a remarkable change in investor sentiment for Alphabet, with its stock surging about 65% in 2025, outperforming its peers on Wall Street’s elite group of stocks, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”.\n\nThe tech giant has allayed investors’ doubts about its artificial intelligence strategy in recent months with a series of high-profile product launches, including the latest version of its flagship AI model, Gemini, and the popular Nano Banana image generator and editor. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and Google’s insurgent rival, left investors and consumers underwhelmed with the release of its latest model, GPT-5, which allowed Alphabet to surge ahead.\n\nGoogle, best known for making the world’s most popular search engine and browser, has also turned its once-overlooked cloud unit into a major growth engine, which drew a rare tech investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Google Cloud’s revenue jumped 34% in the third quarter, with a backlog of non-recognized sales contracts rising to $155bn. Renting out Google’s self-developed AI chips that were reserved for internal use to outside customers has also enabled the unit’s breakneck pace of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company’s dominant revenue generator – the advertising business, driven by Google Search and YouTube – has largely held steady in the face of economic uncertainty and intense competition.\n\nThe company has faced two landmark US antitrust suits as it has navigated its place in the AI boom. After Google lost the first case, a judge ruled in September against breaking up the company, allowing it to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.\n\nIn the second case, a judge ruled Google had illegally monopolized the online ad market last April. A trial over how to remedy the monopoly began in September, which could see the judge forcing Google to divest parts of its lucrative ads business to foster competition.",

    "fullText": "AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (LLY) on Monday announced that the two companies would jointly invest $1 billion to create a lab in San Francisco focused on using AI to accelerate drug discovery.\n\n“Combining our volumes of data and scientific knowledge with NVIDIA’s computational power and model-building expertise could reinvent drug discovery as we know it,\" said Lilly CEO David Ricks.\n\nThe $1 billion investment will be spent over five years on infrastructure, compute, and talent for the lab. Nvidia's engineers will work alongside Lilly's experts in biology, science, and medicine to generate large-scale data and build AI models to advance medicine development. The lab's work will begin early this year, the companies said.\n\nThe investment builds on Nvidia and Lilly's existing partnership. Lilly in October said it was building an AI factory with Nvidia's AI systems to speed up drug discovery timelines.\n\nLilly shares rose fractionally Monday and are up nearly 34% over the past year, surpassing the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 19% gain. The company became the first healthcare name to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization in November.\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, is the most valuable company in the world, becoming the first to cross $5 trillion in 2025. The AI chipmaker's project with Lilly is the latest in a string of investments and deals spanning the AI ecosystem — some of which have raised eyebrows on Wall Street and spurred fears of an AI bubble.\n\nIn the healthcare space, Nvidia has also invested in biotech firm Recursion and has inked partnerships with other industry leaders, including Lilly rival Novo Nordisk (NVO), the Mayo Clinic, Illumina, and IQVIA, to use AI in medical research and development.\n\n“AI is transforming every industry, and its most profound impact will be in life sciences,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a statement Monday.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

    "fullText": "Jensen Huang is over AI doomerism.\n\nThe Nvidia CEO said one of his biggest takeaways from 2025 was \"the battle of narratives\" over the future of AI development between those who see doom on the horizon and the optimists. Huang said while \"it's too simplistic\" to dismiss either side entirely, some of the dismal outlooks are having real consequences.\n\n\"I think we've done a lot of damage with very well-respected people who have painted a doomer narrative, end of the world narrative, science fiction narrative,\" Huang said during a recent episode of the \"No Priors\" podcast. \"And I appreciate that many of us grew up and enjoyed science fiction, but it's not helpful. It's not helpful to people. It's not helpful to the industry. It's not helpful to society. It's not helpful to the governments.\"\n\nHuang didn't name the people in question, nor did he give a specific motivation for why people may be sharing their more dour outlook. Instead, he cited concerns about \"regulatory capture,\" arguing that no company should approach governments to request more regulation.\n\n\"Their intentions are clearly deeply conflicted, and their intentions are clearly not completely in the best interest of society,\" he said. \"I mean, they're obviously CEOs, they're obviously companies, and obviously they're advocating for themselves.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to elaborate on Huang's remarks. Previously, the Nvidia CEO took issue with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's prediction that AI could replace up to half of all white-collar entry-level jobs within five years. (Amodei later said that Huang distorted his views.)\n\nOverall, Huang said the sheer amount of negativity is distorting the conversation around AI.\n\n\"When 90% of the messaging is all around the end of the world and the pessimism, and I think we're scaring people from making the investments in AI that makes it safer, more functional, more productive, and more useful to society,\" he said.\n\nHuang isn't the only CEO who is hoping for a different AI narrative in 2026. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in his year-end note that he wanted that society needs to move beyond labeling content AI \"slop.\"\n\n\"We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication,\" Nadella wrote on his blog late last year, \"and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our 'theory of the mind' that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other.\"",

    "description": "Jensen Huang explains artificial intelligence as a multi-layered platform, arguing its true impact extends far beyond consumer-facing language models.",
    "fullText": "Bottom Line Up Front: Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, in his role as the leader of the primary company behind the ongoing technology movement, says that many people don’t realize just how big the AI revolution is. He says there are currently over 1.5 million AI models throughout the world, from healthcare and drug discovery to more commonly known names like Elon Musk’s Grok and Sam Altman’s ChatGPT.\n\nThe Details: Nvidia founder and chief executive Jensen Huang has consistently framed artificial intelligence as an infrastructure-scale transformation rather than a single technological breakthrough. In a fireside chat hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) with President and CEO Dr. John J. Hamre, Huang continued outlining his layered view of AI, emphasizing the systems, capital, and breadth of applications that underpin the technology’s long-term impact.\n\nJeff Bezos Launched a Secretive AI Startup in 2025 That Should Give Wall Street Chills\n\nThe Top-Rated Dividend King to Buy for 2026\n\nEvercore Analysts Love UnitedHealth Stock for 2026. Should You Buy UNH Here?\n\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. \n\nBuilding on earlier discussion of energy, chips, and systems, Huang described the current infrastructure buildout of AI as being multi-layered. The first layer is simple: energy. Huang frames electricity buildout as the most fundamental part of the entire AI revolution.\n\nThe next is Nvidia itself: Chips. Without chips, there’s nothing to use electricity and process the AI compute needed to run the AI models.\n\nHuang then highlights the third layer, which “includes financial services, because it takes an enormous amount of capital to do what we do.” His remarks highlight that AI development at scale is not only a technical challenge, but also a financial one, requiring sustained investment in data centers, networking, and long-lived computing assets.\n\nHuang then turned to the fourth layer that receives the most public attention: the models themselves. He acknowledged the prominence of well-known systems, describing how “this is where people largely focus on when they talk about AI,” citing examples such as ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and xAI’s Grok. However, he placed those systems in a much wider context, pointing out that “those are four of the one and a half million AI models in the world.” The statement reframes popular generative models as an incredibly small subset of a far larger and more diverse ecosystem. This statement diversifies the risk away from the larger, more broadly known AI models, and instead frames Nvidia as an infrastructure play amongst a technological revolution being implemented across every industry in the world.",

    "fullText": "An internal Nvidia email chain revealed how senior executives at the chip giant — including founder and CEO Jensen Huang — mobilized in response to customer criticism of a key product launch late last year.\n\nThe thread offers a glimpse into how the company responds to public backlash as it expands products designed for individual developers and researchers.\n\nThe thread, which Business Insider has seen, centered on the launch of DGX Spark, a desktop AI system designed for developers and researchers to build AI products and work on apps for data science, medicine, and other fields.\n\nWhile much of Nvidia's business targets data center customers, Huang underscored Spark's significance in the thread, calling it the \"ultimate developer's platform — out of the box easy to run all NVIDIA.\"\n\nSpark drew criticism soon after its launch, with some citing software stability and performance issues, which garnered coverage in other tech outlets.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nAnshel Sag, a Moor Insights & Strategy analyst who has tracked Nvidia launches for 15 years and was an early DGX Spark tester, said the company's long experience releasing graphics cards in the gaming industry — where products are routinely scrutinized — has made it adept at handling public feedback, with Huang typically keeping a close eye on new releases.\n\nIn recent years, the company has become even more reactive, Sag said, due to increased internal resources and \"sensitivity about the stock price and how negative sentiment can draw that down.\"\n\nIn the fall of last year, AstraZeneca executive director Justin Johnson wrote in a LinkedIn post that while the DGX Spark met performance and speed claims, the software experience was buggy and unstable.\n\nAfter an Nvidia executive shared Johnson's post in an internal email thread, Huang entered the fray.\n\n\"Jump on x and say you will fix,\" he wrote.\n\nSubsequently, an Nvidia engineer replied that the company had reached out to Johnson to resolve most of the issues, which were related to a version mismatch of CUDA, Nvidia's software that allows developers to build AI apps powered by its GPUs.\n\nJohnson responded that he appreciated the outreach and was exploring setting up DGX Spark at the pharmaceutical company, the chain said.\n\nFollowing Johnson's criticism, Nvidia staffers saw other unfavorable responses online and set up a social listening campaign to flag complaints from other influential figures, as well as discussions on Nvidia forums and Reddit, the emails said.\n\nStaffers tracked complaints and engaged directly with key critics who raised concerns about DGX Spark's performance, heating issues, and pricing.\n\nAnother incident involved the researcher Christopher Kouzios, who wrote on LinkedIn that he'd purchased DGX Spark to conduct medical research after his daughter died from a rare brain tumor, with the goal of studying cancer risk in his sons.\n\nKouzios said software incompatibility had rendered the system unusable and that he'd only received an automated acknowledgment 38 hours after filing a support ticket.\n\nAfter an Nvidia executive flagged the post, team members said they were fixing the bug, according to the emails. The executive later circulated an updated post in which Kouzios lauded Nvidia's customer support.\n\n\"While the situation initially frustrated me, Nvidia's response time was exceptional,\" Kouzios told Business Insider. \"In more than 33 years working with large technology companies, I have never seen an organization respond that quickly to public technical feedback.\"\n\nIt's often standard for hardware to ship without fully finished software, Sag said, adding that Nvidia tends to be more \"high-touch\" than other tech companies in fielding complaints — an approach that flows down from an exceptionally \"hands-on\" CEO.\n\nNvidia has previously faced some launch hiccups and early criticism for new products, such as its Blackwell rollout, which encountered manufacturing challenges.\n\nWhile a CEO's involvement is notable and Nvidia's backchannel efforts appeared to placate critics, such an approach isn't without risks, another analyst said.\n\n\"C-suite engagement during product controversies has become more common in tech, particularly for founder-led companies,\" said Kate Holterhoff, a senior industry analyst at RedMonk. \"It can signal authenticity and accountability, but it also carries reputational risk if the response is perceived as defensive or dismissive.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it's \"naive\" to think the US will shift away from China.\n\n\"The idea of decoupling for whatever reason, philosophical reasons or national security reasons, it's not based on any common sense,\" Huang said during an episode of the \"No Priors\" podcast posted on Thursday.\n\nHuang, whose company is eagerly awaiting the ability to sell advanced chips in China again, praised President Donald Trump's approach to navigating the relationship between the world's two largest economies.\n\n\"I am optimistic that our relationship with China will improve, that President Trump and the administration has a really, really grounded and common-sense attitude and philosophy around how to think about China, that they're an adversary, but they're also a partner in many ways, and that the idea of decoupling is naive.\"\n\nNvidia may soon be returning to the lucrative Chinese market, which Huang once estimated could be worth $50 billion a year.\n\nBloomberg reported on Thursday that China planned to approve some sales of Nvidia's H200 chips \"as soon as this quarter.\" In December, Trump lifted a Biden-era policy that effectively banned Nvidia from selling its older H200 in China, provided the US government gets a 25% cut on future sales. Huang has repeatedly said that the US will not slow down China's AI advancements by curtailing the sales of advanced chips.\n\nHuang said on Tuesday that he was not expecting a formal announcement from Beijing approving the sales of H200 chips. China previously imposed its restrictions on such sales.\n\n\"We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,\" Huang said during a news conference on the sidelines of CES in Las Vegas. \"It's just going to be purchase orders.\"\n\nAs for the broader US-China relationship, Huang said that both nations ought to continue to invest in their own independence. Trump has deployed a combination of tariffs and incentives to encourage US-based companies to bring their manufacturing back to the US.\n\n\"When you depend too much on someone, the relationship becomes too emotional, as you know,\" Huang said. \"And so it's good to have some independence or there as much independence as either would like, but to recognize that there's a lot of coupling, a lot of dependence between the two countries. And I think there needs to be a nuanced strategy, a nuanced attitude about how to manage this relationship in a productive way for all of the people of two countries and for all of the people around the world.\"\n\nThe world needs both sides to figure it out, Huang said.\n\n\"Everybody depends on a productive, constructive relationship of the two most important nations and the single most important relationship for the next century,\" he said. \"And so we have to find that answer.\"",

    "description": "Nvidia's $20 billion Groq acquisition shows the AI industry moving from training to inference, with speed and efficiency now crucial.",
    "fullText": "For years, Nvidia's rise has been synonymous with one idea: GPUs are the engine of artificial intelligence. They powered the training boom that turned large language models from academic curiosities into trillion-dollar ambitions. But Nvidia's $20 billion deal with Groq is an admission that the next phase of AI won't be won by GPUs alone.\n\nGroq makes a very different type of AI chip called a Language Processing Unit, or LPU. To understand why Nvidia spent so much, and why it didn't simply build this technology itself, you have to look at where AI workloads are heading. The industry is moving from training models to running them in the real world. That shift has a name: inference.\n\nInference is what happens after a model is trained, when it answers questions, generates images, or carries on conversations with users. It's becoming the dominant task in AI computing, and could dwarf the training market in the future, according to estimates recently compiled by RBC Capital analysts.\n\nThis matters because inference has very different needs than training. Training is like building a brain: it requires massive amounts of raw computing power and flexibility. Inference is more like using that brain in real time. Speed, consistency, power efficiency, and cost per answer suddenly matter far more than brute force.\n\nThat's where Groq comes in. Founded by former Google engineers, Groq built its business around inference-only chips. Its LPUs are designed less like general-purpose factories and more like precision assembly lines. Every operation is planned in advance, executed in a fixed order, and repeated perfectly each time. That rigidity is a weakness for training, but a strength for inference, where predictability translates into lower latency and less wasted energy.\n\n\"The tectonic plates of the semiconductor industry just shifted again,\" Tony Fadell, creator of the iPod and an investor in Groq, wrote on LinkedIn recently. \"GPUs decisively won the first wave of AI data centers: training. But inference was always going to be the real volume game, and GPUs by design aren't optimized for it.\"\n\nFadell calls this new breed of AI chips \"IPUs,\" or Inference Processing Units.\n\nTD Cowen analysts noted this week that Nvidia's embrace of not just an inference-specific chip, but a whole new architecture, shows how large and mature the inference market has become.\n\nEarlier AI infrastructure investments were made based on training-first buying decisions. The adage used to be \"today's training chips are tomorrow's inference engines,\" which favored Nvidia's GPUs, but that's no longer the case, the analysts added.\n\nInstead, there will be an explosion of different chips inside future AI data centers, according to Chris Lattner, an industry visionary who helped develop the software for Google's TPU AI chips, which Groq founder Jonathan Ross co-designed.\n\nThis move beyond GPUs is being driven by two trends that have been reinforced by Nvidia's Groq deal, Lattner told me this week.\n\n\"The first is that 'AI' is not a single workload — there are lots of different workloads for inference and training,\" he said. \"The second is that hardware specialization leads to huge efficiency gains.\"\n\nIn a 2024 story (that aged very well), Business Insider warned readers that inference could be a vulnerability for Nvidia as rivals looked to fill this strategic gap. Cerebras built massive AI chips optimized for speed, claiming memory bandwidth thousands of times higher than Nvidia's flagship GPU offering at the time. Google's TPUs are designed to efficiently run bespoke AI workloads at blazing speeds. Amazon developed its own inference chip, Inferentia. Startups like Positron AI argued they could beat or match Nvidia's inference performance at a fraction of the cost.\n\nSo Nvidia's deal with Groq can be seen as a preemptive move. Rather than letting inference specialists chip away at its dominance, Nvidia chose to embrace a fundamentally different architecture.\n\nFadell described the deal as a \"humble move\" by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. \"Many companies miss inflection points like this due to 'Not Invented Here- driven egos,\" Fadell added. \"Jensen doesn't; he saw the threat and made it work to his advantage.\"\n\nThe economics are compelling. Inference is where AI products make money. It's the phase that proves whether hundreds of billions of dollars spent on data centers will ever pay off. As AWS CEO Matt Garman put it in 2024, if inference doesn't dominate, \"all this investment in these big models isn't really going to pay off.\"\n\nImportantly, Nvidia isn't betting on a single winner. GPUs will still handle training and flexible workloads. Specialized chips like Groq's will handle fast, real-time inference. Nvidia's advantage lies in owning the connective tissue — the software, networking, and developer ecosystem that lets these components work together.\n\n\"AI datacenters are becoming hybrid environments where GPUs and custom ASICs operate side-by-side, each optimized for different workload types,\" RBC analysts wrote in a recent note, referring to Application-Specific Integrated Circuits such as Groq's LPUs.\n\nSome competitors argue the deal proves GPUs are ill-suited for high-speed inference. Others see it as validation of a more fragmented future, where different chips serve different needs. Nvidia's Huang appears firmly in the second camp. By licensing Groq's technology and bringing its team inside the tent, Nvidia ensures it can offer customers both the shovels and the assembly lines of AI.\n\nIndeed, Nvidia has developed an NVLink Fusion technology that lets other custom chips connect directly to its GPUs, reinforcing this mixed-hardware future, the RBC Capital analysts noted.\n\n\"GPUs are phenomenal accelerators,\" Andrew Feldman, CEO of Cerebras, wrote recently. \"They've gotten us far in AI. They're just not the right machine for high-speed inference. And there are other architectures that are. And Nvidia has just spent $20B to corroborate this.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "AI company’s chatbot faces criticism over its generation of sexualized, nonconsensual images of women and girls\n\nElon Musk’s artificial intelligence company has raised $20bn in its latest funding round, the startup announced Tuesday, even as its marquee chatbot Grok faces backlash over generating sexualized, nonconsensual images of women and underage girls.\n\nxAI’s Series E funding round featured big-name investors, including Nvidia, Fidelity Management and Resource Company, Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, and Valor Equity Partners – the private investment firm of Musk’s longtime friend and former Doge member Antonio Gracias. The funding round exceeded its initial $15bn target, according to xAI’s press release. The company touted Grok’s image-generation abilities in the announcement of its latest funding round.\n\nxAI lacks the prominence of its rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and has continually drawn criticism for generating misinformation, antisemitic content and now potentially illegal sexual material. Nonetheless, the company has been able to win government contracts and billions of dollars in investment amid the AI boom. xAI’s latest funding round comes during some of the fiercest pushback against the company yet, with lawmakers in multiple countries demanding answers regarding Grok’s output.\n\nOver the past week, Grok has responded to tens of thousands of prompts from users on X requesting the chatbot remove women’s clothing in images or pose them in sexualized ways. Many of the prompts have included images of women who have not given their consent to be digitally undressed, including Ashley St Clair, the estranged mother of one of Musk’s children.\n\n“I felt horrified, I felt violated, especially seeing my toddler’s backpack in the back of it,” St Clair told the Guardian, adding that her complaints to X did not go anywhere. The Guardian’s request for comment from xAI resulted in an automated response stating “Legacy Media Lies”.\n\nSome of Grok’s images included a photo of a 12-year-old girl, which the chatbot manipulated to remove the child’s actual clothing and depict her instead in a bikini. Other suggestive images have featured children as young as 10 years old. The chatbot posted an apology on Friday that stated lapses in its safeguards led to generating images of minors, but continued to generate sexualized images of children in the ensuing days.\n\nxAI has been seeking investment for months as it works to increase its AI models’ capabilities and build out enormous data centers in Memphis, Tennessee. The company claimed the new funding would help its core mission of “Understanding the Universe”.\n\nFrench ministers reported Grok’s output to prosecutors on Friday and referred the episode to media regulators to decide whether the images violate the European Union’s Digital Services Act. Liz Kendall, the UK’s technology secretary, also condemned Grok’s deepfakes on Tuesday as “appalling and unacceptable”, calling on the British regulator Ofcom to take action. Ofcom posted on X that it had made contact with xAI to determine whether an investigation is warranted. Lawmakers in the US, where xAI is headquartered, have remained comparatively mum.\n\nThe company made a similar funding announcement in July of last year during another controversy over Grok. A week after the chatbot began posting antisemitic content and pro-Nazi ideology, including describing itself as “MechaHitler”, xAI announced it had secured a contract with the US Pentagon worth nearly $200m.",

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. heating, ventilation and air conditioning-related companies dropped on Tuesday after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ​said that the company's upcoming chips could significantly reduce cooling ‌requirements in data centers.\n\nJohnson Controls International dropped 7.5% to $112.40 and Trane Technologies lost 5.3% to $370.40. ‌Both stocks hit multi-month lows and were among the biggest percentage decliners on the S&P 500.\n\nSpeaking at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on Monday, Huang said Nvidia's next generation of chips is in \"full production.\" ⁠The Vera Rubin platform, ‌made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year.\n\nWhen talking about the cooling ‍requirements, Huang said that \"no water chillers are necessary for data centres.\"\n\nBarclays analysts said in a note led by Julian Mitchell that \"given the primacy of Nvidia to ​the whole AI ecosystem, one should not take their comments lightly, ‌although they seem rather dramatic at first glance.\"\n\nThe analysts said the companies that could be most affected include Johnson Controls International, Trane Technologies and Carrier Global.\n\nThey estimate that data centers represent a low-double-digit percentage of total sales for Johnson Controls and data centers account for about 10% ⁠and 5% of sales for Trane Technologies ​and Carrier Global, respectively.\n\nCarrier Global shares ​fell 1.1%.\n\nThe analysts also highlighted nVent Electric could benefit from these developments as it has \"no presence in space cooling/chillers/air handling\" ‍but has a \"decent ⁠position in data center liquid cooling.\"\n\nData center power equipment maker Vertiv Holdings could also benefit due to its \"strong historical position in ⁠precision air cooling\" and \"strong position in liquid cooling,\" the analysts said.\n\nVertiv shares were down ‌2.1%, while nVent shares edged 0.5% higher.",

If the purchase ‌orders come, it's because they're able to place purchase orders,\" Huang said during a press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump last year reversed a longstanding ban on shipping advanced artificial intelligence chips to China, saying he would allow Nvidia to sell the H200, which was the predecessor to its current flagship \"Blackwell\" chips.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday in an interview with a JPMorgan analyst, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress ⁠said that the U.S. government is \"working feverishly\" ‌on license applications for Nvidia to ship its H200 chips to China, but that the company still does not know when they will be approved.\n\n\"We're going to wait and see what will happen,\" Kress said ‍of the applications.\n\nAt the press conference, Huang said that Nvidia is ramping up H200 chips for Chinese firms.\n\n\"The customer demand is high - quite high,\" Huang said. \"We've fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line.\"\n\nOn Monday, Nvidia showed a sextet of new chips that it said are in ​full production to form the next \"Vera Rubin\" generation of its AI computing systems. Kress declined to say whether Nvidia was facing any ‌specific bottlenecks as it ramps up production but said \"we feel very solid\" about the state of its supply chain.\n\nNvidia has called for $500 billion in sales from its current \"Blackwell\" generation as well as the forthcoming Vera Rubin chips by the end of this year. Kress said there have \"already been discussions\" about data center buildouts with customers for 2027 but did not give sales guidance.\n\nHuang said demand is high for Nvidia products across the board.\n\n\"I'm fully expecting a really giant year for our business with TSMC,\" Huang said, referring to Taiwan Semiconductor ⁠Manufacturing Co, which makes most of Nvidia's chips.\n\nHuang also said that he plans ​a visit soon to Israel, where the company has 5,000 employees and is ​looking to double its workforce. Local media reported last month that Nvidia is in talks to buy Israeli firm AI21 Labs.",

    "description": "The Nvidia CEO is the eighth-wealthiest person in the world and could see an $8 billion levy should the 5% California wealth tax come to pass.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang seems like he's not losing sleep over California's proposed wealth tax.\n\nWhen Bloomberg TV's Ed Ludlow asked Huang about California's proposed 5% billionaire wealth tax in an interview that aired on Tuesday, Huang said that the potential levy hasn't crossed his mind once and that he is \"trying to build the future of AI.\"\n\n\"I've got to tell you, I have not even thought about it once,\" Huang told Ludlow. \"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it. I'm perfectly fine with it.\"\n\n\"We work in Silicon Valley because that's where the talent pool is,\" Huang added.\n\nHuang is the eighth-wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes, which estimated his net worth at approximately $162.6 billion as of January 6. Most of Huang's wealth comes from his around 3% stake in Nvidia, which just showed off its new Vera Rubin chips at the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nBased on his net worth as reported by Forbes, a 5% tax on his total wealth would amount to more than $8 billion, to be paid over five years, according to the proposed plan.\n\nThe California wealth tax was proposed by the SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West in order to offset anticipated budget cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance.\n\nA wealth tax is different from an income tax and is a levy on an individual's entire net worth instead of annual income. The union estimates that the one-time tax will bring in $100 billion over five years for the state and apply to the around 200 billionaires who are residents of California.\n\nThe proposal is still very far from reality and would need 870,000 signatures to even make it to the ballot in November 2026, where it would then be voted on or rejected by California voters.\n\nBillionaires from Palmer Luckey to David Sacks have already voiced their full-throated disapproval.\n\nAccording to filings viewed by Business Insider, Larry Page, the Google cofounder, converted many of his assets from California to Delaware in December to derisk them from the potential wealth tax. His departure meets an end-of-2025 deadline, since the tax, if passed, would only apply to billionaires who are still residents of California on January 1, 2026.\n\nCelebrity attorney Alex Spiro wrote a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of his wealthy clients and warned that they would \"permanently relocate\" if the California billionaire tax comes to pass.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "Hard-drive and storage stocks surged after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted data storage as a key AI bottleneck at CES.",
    "fullText": "The companies behind some of tech's least glamorous products — hard drives and storage — are powering a sharp rally on Wall Street.\n\nThe surge comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at CES 2026 on Monday that the AI boom isn't just about chips, but about where vast amounts of data live.\n\nSanDisk, the flash-memory company spun out of Western Digital last year, has been the standout. Its shares surged about 28% on Tuesday, marking their strongest intraday performance since February. The stock is already up more than 40% just days into January, making SanDisk the top performer in the S&P 500 on Tuesday.\n\nWestern Digital and Seagate Technology, two of the world's largest makers of hard-disk drives, are also seeing a boost. Western Digital's shares jumped about 17% on Tuesday, while Seagate rose about 14%.\n\nHuang described the memory storage market as a \"completely unserved market today.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts on Monday.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nMemory prices have been rising. Korea Economic Daily reported on Monday that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are pushing for server DRAM price increases of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter.\n\nMarket analysis firm Counterpoint said last week that memory prices could rise by 40% through the second quarter of 2026, as AI-driven demand continues to strain supply.\n\nThe AI race has largely been about chips, data centers, and power. But data storage is coming into focus as a key bottleneck.\n\nDriven largely by AI workloads, the volume of stored global data was expected to top 200 zettabytes in 2025 — the equivalent of 200 billion terabytes.\n\nAnalysts have predicted that demand for data storage could run ahead of supply.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\n\"For an industry that has long been characterized by boom-and-bust cycles, this time is different,\" the analyst said, citing the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure and workloads as a shift that is straining the memory ecosystem.\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",
