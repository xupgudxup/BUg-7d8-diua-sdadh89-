    "fullText": "At CES 2025, NVIDIA spent the bulk of its presentation touting (what else) its leading position in the artificial intelligence arena. But it also spent time talking up new hardware, including its RTX 5000-series GPUs and Project Digits desktop supercomputer (later redubbed Spark). This year, the company's website says it's \"lighting up CES 2026 with the power of AI.\" To that end, NVIDIA is pulling out all the stops at its Vegas installation, promising hands-on demos in its booth at the Fontainebleau, replete with the \"latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.\"\n\nBut don't worry if you're not on the ground in Vegas. Here's how you can watch the livestream of the company's January 5 press conference, and what to expect from NVIDIA at CES this year.\n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a 90-minute keynote at CES 2026. The event will be livestreamed on January 5 at 4PM ET via NVIDIA's website (and likely on YouTube as well). We'll embed the link here once it's available.\n\nNVIDIA's game plan for CES is suitably vague so far, including \"cutting-edge AI, robotics, simulation, gaming and content creation at the NVIDIA Showcase.\" It also notes there will be more than 20 demos. Although we're unsure if all of these will be shown during the keynote, we can at least expect to see them throughout the week of CES.\n\nGiven NVIDIA's sky-high valuation and the fact that the health of the US and global economy seems increasingly linked to infrastructure spending on AI data centers – largely powered by chips from NVIDIA and its competitors — expect Huang's remarks to be as closely followed by Wall Street investors as technology acolytes, if not more so. Will we get any insight on a successor to the company's Blackwell chip? A more detailed look at how NVIDIA's partners are applying AI to real-world robotics? Time will tell, but you might want to keep your stock portfolio in a split screen while taking in Huang's presentation.",

    "description": "Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang rose from his first job at Denny's, where the idea for his company was born, to leading a chipmaking giant.",
    "fullText": "The AI arms race has been good business for Nvidia, which supplies the highly in-demand chips used by many Big Tech giants and startups alike to train AI models.\n\nThat's also been good news for Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang. In 2024, he shot into Forbes' list of the world's 10 wealthiest people as business boomed for Nvidia.\n\nHuang and fellow Nvidia founders Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky planted the seed for Nvidia at a Denny's in northern California in 1993. Today, it's a household name in the AI industry, and Huang is the billionaire businessman leading it.\n\nHere's a look at Jensen Huang's career rise and background.\n\nHuang was born in Taiwan in 1963. He spent some of his childhood there and in Thailand before his parents sent Huang and his brother to the US to live with an uncle in Tacoma, Washington.\n\nHis uncle sent him to Oneida Baptist Institute in Kentucky, but after Huang's parents immigrated to the US, the family lived in Oregon. He graduated from high school at age 16 before going to college. Huang got his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University and his master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University.\n\nHuang got his first job at 15. He washed dishes and bussed and waited tables at a Denny's in Portland.\n\nBefore founding Nvidia, Huang worked at computer chip manufacturer LSI Logic from 1985 to 1993 and at semiconductor company AMD, or Advanced Micro Devices, from 1984 to 1985.\n\nAt a Denny's in 1993, Huang and his Nvidia co-founders, Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky, came up with the idea that would eventually lead to Nvidia's creation.\n\nIn 1999, the company released the GeForce 256, which it called the first graphics processing unit, or GPU.\n\nToday, Nvidia is instrumental in the generative AI industry, supplying the coveted chips that tech companies use to train AI models.\n\nInterest in Nvidia's chips amid the AI boom has pushed the company to new heights.\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia joined the handful of companies at the time with a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nHuang's net worth is $165.4 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHuang's management and leadership style sees him skipping 1-on-1 meetings, managing around 60 direct reports as CEO, giving feedback publicly, and sending his staff hundreds of emails a day.\n\nCurrent and former Nvidia employees previously told BI that Huang is a hands-on boss with high expectations and meticulous attention to detail who values owning up to your mistakes.\n\nHuang has said he has workaholic tendencies, logging 14-hour days and working on holidays.\n\nHe has a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his shoulder, which he agreed to get when the company's stock price hit $100 per share.\n\nHuang's black leather jacket has also become a famous part of his wardrobe — a staple piece he often wears when giving keynotes or showing off a new product.\n\nNvidia's other founders, meanwhile, have stayed further out of the spotlight than Huang.\n\nPriem was Nvidia's chief technical officer from 1993 to 2003, and Malachowsky is a senior technology executive at Nvidia.\n\nAfter Nvidia went public in 1999, Priem put more than three-quarters of his Nvidia shares into his Priem Family Foundation and by 2006, he'd sold the rest of his shares. He was left with a fortune of roughly $30 million, Forbes estimated in 2023.\n\nHuang met his now-wife, Lori, while still attending Oregon State University. The couple share two children: Madison Huang is a director of product and technical marketing at Nvidia, and Spencer Huang is a product line manager at the company.\n\nHuang and Lisa Su, CEO of Nvidia's rival chip giant AMD, are distant cousins.\n\nHe has a home in Silicon Valley, as Nvidia is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.\n\nHuang has been president, CEO, and a member of Nvidia's board of directors since the company's creation. He and Nvidia haven't said much about succession planning.\n\nHe was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2024 and has received the Semiconductor Industry Association's highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award.\n\nIn past years, The Economist has named Huang the world's best CEO, Fortune has dubbed him its Businessperson of the Year, and TIME has included him in its yearly list of the world's 100 most influential people.\n\nAs of June 2025, Huang owned roughly 3.77% of the company's outstanding shares, according to a proxy statement. He is Nvidia's largest individual shareholder.\n\nHuang led Nvidia through a record-breaking, blockbuster year in 2025 as the AI boom saw no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe chipmaker became the first company in the world to cross the $5-trillion market cap valuation on October 29, 2025.\n\nAt the same time, the CEO steered the company through increased competition as AI hyperscalers explore alternative chips, regulatory headwinds, and growing concerns of an AI bubble.\n\nHuang acknowledged, in an internal meeting, the challenges of running a company faced with sky-high expectations after Nvidia delivered a better-than-expected quarter in November 2025.\n\n\"If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there's an AI bubble,\" he said in the meeting. \"If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble.\"",

    "description": "The usual suspects like Nvidia and Broadcom are on BofA's list. But the firm is also bullish on some less popular names.",
    "fullText": "New research from Bank of America has thrown cold water on the growing narrative, and instead focuses on the upside the firm sees in chipmakers.\n\nThe firm recently laid out its forecast for the coming year in a note to clients, predicting that the AI market will experience some volatility but ultimately finish the year strong as data center buildouts continue and companies double down on manufacturing and equipment spending.\n\nThe analysts view the AI market as being roughly halfway through an eight- to 10-year evolution, for which 2026 marks the midpoint. During its second half, they expect to see tech companies continue to upgrade IT infrastructure and continue accelerating AI workloads.\n\nBofA sees a particular opportunity in large-cap companies that are also high-quality sector leaders. It highlighted six chip stocks it says are particularly well-positioned to benefit from AI-capex spending that could reach $1.2 trillion by 2030.\n\nHere are the firms top six picks in that group:\n\nNvidia: +41% year-to-date.\nBroadcom: +52% year-to-date.\nLam Research: 146% year-to-date.\nKLA Corporation: +103% year-to-date.\nAnalog Devices: +30% year-to-date. \nCadence Design Systems: +6% year-to-date.\n\nWhile Broadcom, Lam and KLA significantly outperformed Nvidia it in 2026, BofA analysts maintain that they see the dominant chipmaker as the undisputed industry leader, noting that it currently trades at half its growth rate and highlighting its promising pipeline of likely catalysts.\n\nThat said, BofA values Broadcom at 33 times its anticipated earnings for 2026, predicting that it can go as high as $500 per share in the coming year, due to its high profitability among semiconductor producers and impressive free cash flow.\n\nAnalysts see Lam Research as being in an excellent position overall, due to the equipment it produces on which chip fabs are highly dependent. While it notes that the company may be subject to some tariff and inflation-related pain, BofA still sees it as a strategic play on a key corner of the AI manufacturing market.\n\nAdditionally, BofA notes KLA's leading profit margin among chipmakers, highlighting it as one of the industry's most stable names, which it believes justifies as a higher multiple. It names Cadence Design Systems as its top pick for Electronic Design Automation, but also highlights the risk posed by trade tensions with China.\n\nWhile it acknowledge's Analog's high free cash flow, it notes the possibility of economic downturn negatively impacting the chipmaker if automotive and industrial customers scale back their high-performance chip spending.\n\nDespite these concerns, though, BofA remains highly bullish on this chip stocks as well as some of their smaller cap peers.\n\n\"We remain constructive on chip stocks heading into 2026,\" BofA says. \"While debates around the pace and profitability of AI investments will continue, we believe consensus under-appreciates the mission critical, oﬀensive and defensive nature of capex investments being done by the largest and best funded tech companies.\"",

    "fullText": "The chipmaker’s sprawling partnerships are driving extraordinary growth but also bank its future on the AI boom paying off quickly\n\nNvidia is, in crucial ways, nothing like Enron – the Houston energy giant that imploded through multibillion-dollar accounting fraud in 2001. Nor is it similar to companies such as Lucent or Worldcom that folded during the dotcom bubble.\n\nBut the fact that it needs to reiterate this to its investors is less than ideal.\n\nNow worth more than $4tn (£3tn), Nvidia makes the specialised technology that powers the world’s AI surge: silicon chips and software packages that train and host systems such as ChatGPT. Its products fill datacentres from Norway to New Jersey.\n\nThis year has been an exceptional one for the company: it has struck at least $125bn in deals, ranging from a $5bn investment into Intel – to facilitate its access to the PC market – to $100bn invested in OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT.\n\nBut even as those deals have fuelled surging stock prices and paved the way for chief executive Jensen Huang’s energetic world tour, doubts have emerged about how Nvidia does business, especially as it has become increasingly central to the health of the global economy.\n\nThe start of these concerns has been the circular nature of many of its deals. These arrangements resemble vendor financing: Nvidia lending money to customers so they can buy its products.\n\nThe largest of these is its deal with OpenAI, which involves Nvidia investing $10bn into the company each year for the next 10 years – most of which will go to buying Nvidia’s chips. Another is its arrangement with CoreWeave, a company that provides on-demand computing capacity to big AI firms, essentially leasing out Nvidia’s chips.\n\nThe circularity of these deals has drawn comparisons with Lucent Technologies, a telecoms company that also aggressively lent money to its customers, only to overextend itself and unravel in the early 2000s. Nvidia has aggressively rebutted suggestions of any similarity, saying in a leaked recent memo that it “does not rely on vendor financing arrangements to grow revenue”.\n\nJames Anderson, a renowned tech investor, describes himself as a “huge admirer” of Nvidia, but said this year that the OpenAI deal presented “more reason to be concerned there than before”.\n\nHe added: “I have to say the words ‘vendor financing’ do not carry nice reflections to somebody of my age. It’s not quite like what many of the telecom suppliers were up to in 1999-2000, but it has certain rhymes to it. I don’t think it makes me feel entirely comfortable from that point of view.”\n\nOther high-profile recent deals include the tech firm Oracle spending $300bn on datacentres for OpenAI in the US – with the ChatGPT developer then paying back roughly the same amount to use those datacentres. In October, OpenAI and the chipmaker AMD signed a multibillion-dollar chip deal that also gave OpenAI the option to buy a stake in the Nvidia rival.\n\nThere is also a deal with CoreWeave where, along with a commitment to buying $22bn of data centre capacity from the cloud provider, OpenAI is receiving $350m in CoreWeave stock. Asked this month about circularity in the AI industry, the chief executive of CoreWeave, Michael Intrator, said: “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand. You do that by working together.”\n\nAll these moves form part of OpenAI’s $1.4tn bet on computing capacity to build and operate models that, it argues, will transform economies – and make back that expenditure. OpenAI argues that, while the Nvidia and AMD deals have an investment component, it only kicks in once the chips have been bought and deployed, while the investments themselves create aligned incentives to build out AI infrastructure at huge scale.\n\nNvidia has also used structures called special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) in financing deals. The best-known example is the SPV linked to Elon Musk’s xAI: an entity into which Nvidia invested $2bn, money that will be used to buy Nvidia’s chips.\n\nThis drew comparisons with Enron, which used SPVs to keep debts and toxic assets off its balance sheets, convincing investors and creditors that it was stable while concealing ballooning liabilities.\n\nNvidia has also strongly denied that it is like Enron: in the same leaked memo where it discussed Lucent, it said its reporting was “complete and transparent” and “unlike Enron” it “does not use special-purpose entities to hide debt and inflate revenue”.\n\nThe journalist Ed Zitron, a noted sceptic of the AI boom, agrees that Nvidia is not like either company. Unlike Lucent, it does not appear to be taking on a great deal of debt to finance its circular deals, he says, and most of the customers it is supporting are not as obviously risky as Lucent’s dotcom bubble partners. And it isn’t like Enron, Zitron argues, because it’s being fairly transparent about its own complex, off-balance sheet deals.\n\nSo what could warrant a comparison? Nvidia “is not hiding debt, but it is leaning heavily on vendor-financed demand, which creates exposure if AI growth slows,” says Charlie Dai, an analyst at the research firm Forrester. “The concern is about sustainability, not legality.”\n\nEssentially, whether Nvidia is able to stick the landing depends on whether AI really takes off, generating billions for its corporate users and putting companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and CoreWeave – Nvidia’s customers – firmly in the black, and able to keep buying its systems. That possibility alone is debatable. If this does not happen, says Dai, Nvidia “could face write-downs on equity stakes and unpaid receivables”: meaning, it could lose a lot of money and its stock price could then tank.\n\nApproached for comment, an Nvidia spokesperson referred the Guardian to remarks its chief financial officer, Colette Kress, made to investors in early December. Kress said they were not seeing an AI bubble, instead gesturing at trillions of dollars of business that lie ahead for Nvidia in the next decade.\n\nIn particular, Kress argued that Nvidia’s recent – massive – deals are just the start for the company, and the real money will be made in the coming years, largely through replacing almost all the chips in existing datacentres with its products.\n\nThere is another complexity, which is that Nvidia’s health – and therefore the health of the entire global economy – also depends on whether AI takes off in time for Nvidia and its customers to service the debt from their huge datacentre buildouts and significant capital expenditures.\n\nAdd to this a final category of concern: recent, big-ticket deals with countries such as South Korea and Saudi Arabia, worth multiple billions of dollars, whose terms are opaque. In October, Nvidia said that it would supply 260,000 of its Blackwell chips to South Korea’s government and South Korean companies. The value of this deal was not disclosed, but is estimated to be in the billions.\n\nLikewise with Saudi Arabia. Its government-owned AI startup, Humain, has committed to deploying up to 600,000 Nvidia chips: when that deployment will involve actual purchases, and at what price, is again undisclosed. Nvidia has a number of other strategic partnerships like this – with Italy, with the French AI champion Mistral and with Deutsche Telekom, for example – all involving thousands of chips and unknown sums.\n\nGovernments are likely to pay. There’s nothing circular about a sovereign partnership with Germany. But the deals mean more – quite large – uncertainties nested within a straining web of commitments that require massive capital outlay, and rely on ambitious assumptions about the economy undergoing a revolution in the next years.\n\n“They concentrate risk in a few big customers,” says Dai. “If execution delays occur, Nvidia’s revenue recognition and cashflow could be affected.”",

    "fullText": "Nvidia recently struck a $20 billion deal to acquire the brains of a fierce rival, marking its biggest move to date in the AI arms race. However, the massive chip manufacturer may soon have to respond to more difficult inquiries about the future of its chips.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang offered further detail in an internal email obtained by CNBC.\n\nThe move comes as Nvidia is getting more attention in Asia. Megaspeed International, a fast-growing Singapore-based importer of Nvidia chips, is being looked into for possibly smuggling banned H100 and H200 chips into China, according to a recent Bloomberg report.\n\nThe world's most valuable chipmaker is now stuck between two extremes: It has to deal with rising geopolitical threats and regulatory difficulties in one of its hottest regions while still dominating AI infrastructure around the world.\n\nGroq, a nine-year-old firm started by former Google TPU engineers, was never for sale — at least not in public. But Nvidia came in with a $20 billion deal that includes licensing Groq's cutting-edge AI inference technology and bringing on its top leaders, such as CEO Jonathan Ross.\n\nSources informed CNBC that Nvidia is really buying all of Groq's assets, except for a small GroqCloud firm, even though Groq called the purchase a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement.\"\n\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\n\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\n\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\n\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\n\nThis is Nvidia's biggest deal ever in terms of money. The price of $20 billion is over three times what Groq was worth in its most recent investment round, which was $6.9 billion.\n\nIt also beats Nvidia's previous record, the $7 billion purchase of Mellanox in 2019, by a wide margin.\n\nNvidia now controls Groq’s high-speed inference chip designs, allowing tighter integration into its broader AI platform.\n\nGroq’s leadership, including Ross and president Sunny Madra, will join Nvidia’s leadership team.\n\nThe remaining GroqCloud unit will continue operating independently, led by its CFO.\n\nThis aggressive move is like Nvidia's smaller but similar AI acquisition in September, when it spent $900 million for chip IP and key staff from Enfabrica.\n\nAs Nvidia continues to lead in AI, it is being caught up in the sticky politics of the semiconductor supply chain.\n\nMegaspeed International, which used to be a small part of a Chinese gaming company, is now Nvidia's biggest customer in Southeast Asia. But U.S. investigators are now looking into the company because it may have smuggled prohibited AI chips into China.",

    "description": "While Nvidia and Broadcom dominate, Bank of America's Vivek Arya says some specialized small- and mid-caps are essential for the next $1 trillion chip surge",
    "fullText": "While players like Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) are at the forefront of investors’ minds, smaller specialized players are grabbing a slice of the AI spending behind the scenes.\n\nIn a recent report, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya named a handful of small- to mid-cap companies as the unsung heroes of the semiconductor surge.\n\n\"We mentioned a few companies on the smid-cap side, Credo, MKS, Advanced Energy, MACOM, and Teradyne,\" Arya told reporters on a Dec. 19 call.\n\nWhile these companies lack the massive margins of Nvidia, Arya suggests they are currently benefitting from being the primary providers of essential technologies.\n\nThe scale of the unsung opportunity is staggering. BofA predicts the total addressable market for AI data center systems will exceed $1.2 trillion by 2030, fueled by a 38% compound annual growth rate. Within that, AI accelerators will grab around $900 billion, but that leaves a massive $300 billion slice — one that depends on secondary technologies like networking, cables, and power systems.\n\nArya breaks down how the pie is divided. For every $100 spent on AI hardware, $15 to $20 goes into networking. A third flows directly into interconnects — the wires and optical components that let GPUs talk to each other. As AI clusters expand, these bits and bolts of the trillion-dollar build-out are seeing a direct benefit.\n\nArya highlights Credo (CRDO) for its leadership in active electrical cables. As data centers prioritize \"performance per watt,\" Credo's niche technology is critical. \"They want to make sure that all these GPUs talk to each other, very effectively,\" he said.\n\nHe also pointed to Astera Labs (ALAB) and its robust high-speed connectivity efforts via PCIe 6.0, the standard for moving data between a computer's motherboard and its hardware.\n\n\"They were the ones who invested in specific technologies ... nobody cared about these categories,\" he said. \"So now, they are benefitting from being the only people standing in those specific niche technologies.\"\n\nOther key players, such as MKS Instruments (MKSI) and Advanced Energy (AEIS), provide the precision power and vacuum systems needed to actually build chips. If Nvidia is the architect, these companies provide the machinery and high-voltage power to keep the site running.\n\nMeanwhile, MACOM (MTSI) provides high-speed analog and optical components that let these \"brains\" interact, while Teradyne (TER) serves as a final checkpoint. The company's automated testing equipment ensures these expensive components actually work before they are shipped.",

    "fullText": "The market for AI computing devices is massive and growing.\n\nNvidia is sold out of cloud GPUs.\n\nNvidia's stock price tag is actually quite reasonable.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) buildout has been ongoing since 2023, but it's far from over.\n\nThe AI hyperscalers have nearly completed their record-setting capital expenditures for 2025, but they've already informed their investors that 2026 will be a year of even greater spending. While some investors are growing worried over those figures, some of the smartest people in the world think we need more AI computing power, and going against that trend likely isn't a smart move for investors.\n\nInvestors need to find the companies that are slated to cash in on these massive data center buildouts, and there are a handful of companies that can. One of the best to own over the past three years has been Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). It has delivered investors excellent returns, and seems poised to do so again in 2026.\n\nWhile I can't say for certain if Nvidia will be the best AI stock for 2026, I'm fairly confident it will be one of the best AI stocks, and it is also an attractive bet that it will outperform the market. These two projections combine to make Nvidia an excellent buy right now, and I can think of few better stocks to scoop up in the last few days of 2025.\n\nNvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) and the technology stack that supports them. Combined, Nvidia's technology is the most flexible and easiest to use, and has some of the best performance available. This has made it the go-to computing unit of choice since the AI race began, but investors are worried that the company's dominance is slipping.\n\nHeadlines are filled with rising competition from AMD or how Broadcom has signed another client to spec out a custom AI chip. There are also innovative companies like Amazon that designed their own chip for their cloud computing platform. All of those headlines make it seem like Nvidia's grasp on the market is slipping, but that couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nIn its FY 2026 third quarter (ended Oct. 26) earnings release, CEO Jensen Huang noted that the company was \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. Although Nvidia is ramping up production as fast as it can, it is unable to meet the current computing demands of the market. As a result, clients are starting to look elsewhere to meet their massive computing demands. While they may prefer Nvidia hardware, some computing power is better than none.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia is forging ahead with another bet on the AI boom, agreeing to a licensing deal with AI hardware startup Groq.\n\nGroq said Wednesday that some of its executives, including its founder and CEO, will join Nvidia as part of the deal. Groq is expected to continue operating independently following what it described as a non-exclusive licensing deal.\n\nGroq is known for its Language Processing Unit, which is a custom chip designed for AI inference, namely, the process by which a trained AI model makes predictions or decisions. The startup was valued at about $6.9 billion as of three months ago and raised around $750 million in its latest funding round.\n\nJonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other members of its team are expected to join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market cap north of $4.5 trillion.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told Business Insider on Wednesday that Nvidia is not acquiring the chip startup.\n\nNeither Nvidia nor Groq disclosed financial terms of the agreement.\n\nRoss and Douglas Wightman were engineers at Google who started the project that became Google's first TPU chips, before leaving to found Groq. The TPUs are custom-made to accelerate large-scale machine-learning tasks designed to handle AI workloads, and are a major rival to Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nThe deal between the two companies comes as a new type of dealmaking is on the rise in Silicon Valley. Whereas traditional startups either aim to go public or be acquired, new acqui-hire deals could leave some startup employees behind, only benefiting a small percentage of staff members with desirable AI skills and the founders.\n\nFor instance, in 2024, Google agreed to pay $2.5 billion to license Character.AI's technology but only hired its two superstar cofounders and 20% of the startup's employees. In the same year, AI developers Adept and Inflection also made similar deals with Amazon and Microsoft, respectively.\n\nMore recently, Meta's acqui-hire of Scale AI became one of the biggest bets on talent after the company agreed to invest roughly $14 billion for a 49% stake and to bring its CEO, Alexandr Wang, into the fold to lead the Meta Superintelligence Labs.\n\nThese acqui-hires don't always end well. Windsurf employees were left in limbo after the AI coding startup was nearly aquired by OpenAI for $3 billion, only for the deal to fall apart and the company to be split. Google spent billions to hire Windsurf's CEO and top engineers, while the remaining hundreds of employees were acquired by another startup, Cognition.",

    "description": "The Nemotron 3 family of open models — in Nano, Super and Ultra sizes — introduces the most efficient family of open models with leading accuracy for building agentic AI applications.",
    "fullText": "NVIDIA today announced the NVIDIA Nemotron™ 3 family of open models, data and libraries designed to power transparent, efficient and specialized agentic AI development across industries.\n\nThe Nemotron 3 models — with Nano, Super and Ultra sizes — introduce a breakthrough hybrid latent mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture that helps developers build and deploy reliable multi-agent systems at scale.\n\nAs organizations shift from single-model chatbots to collaborative multi-agent AI systems, developers face mounting challenges, including communication overhead, context drift and high inference costs. In addition, developers require transparency to trust the models that will automate their complex workflows. Nemotron 3 directly addresses these challenges, delivering the performance and openness customers need to build specialized, agentic AI.\n\n“Open innovation is the foundation of AI progress,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With Nemotron, we’re transforming advanced AI into an open platform that gives developers the transparency and efficiency they need to build agentic systems at scale.”\n\nNVIDIA Nemotron supports NVIDIA’s broader sovereign AI efforts, with organizations from Europe to South Korea adopting open, transparent and efficient models that allow them to build AI systems aligned to their own data, regulations and values.\n\nEarly adopters, including Accenture, Cadence, CrowdStrike, Cursor, Deloitte, EY, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Palantir, Perplexity, ServiceNow, Siemens, Synopsys and Zoom, are integrating models from the Nemotron family to power AI workflows across manufacturing, cybersecurity, software development, media, communications and other industries.\n\n“NVIDIA and ServiceNow have been shaping the future of AI for years, and the best is yet to come,” Bill McDermott, chairman and CEO of ServiceNow. “Today, we’re taking a major step forward in empowering leaders across all industries to fast-track their agentic AI strategy. ServiceNow’s intelligent workflow automation combined with NVIDIA Nemotron 3 will continue to define the standard with unmatched efficiency, speed and accuracy.”\n\nAs multi-agent AI systems expand, developers are increasingly relying on proprietary models for state-of-the-art reasoning while using more efficient and customizable open models to drive down costs. Routing tasks between frontier-level models and Nemotron in a single workflow gives agents the most intelligence while optimizing tokenomics.\n\n\"Perplexity is built on the idea that human curiosity will be amplified by accurate AI built into exceptional tools, like AI assistants,\" said Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity. “With our agent router, we can direct workloads to the best fine-tuned open models, like Nemotron 3 Ultra, or leverage leading proprietary models when tasks benefit from their unique capabilities — ensuring our AI assistants operate with exceptional speed, efficiency and scale.”\n\nThe open Nemotron 3 models enable startups to build and iterate faster on AI agents and accelerate innovation from prototype to enterprise deployment. General Catalyst, Mayfield and Sierra Ventures’ portfolio companies are exploring Nemotron 3 to build AI teammates that support human-AI collaboration.\n\n“NVIDIA’s open model stack and the NVIDIA Inception program give early-stage companies the models, tools and a cost-effective infrastructure to experiment, differentiate and scale fast,” said Navin Chaddha, managing partner at Mayfield. “Nemotron 3 gives founders a running start on building agentic AI applications and AI teammates, and helps them tap into NVIDIA’s massive installed base.”\n\nNemotron 3 Reinvents Multi-Agent AI With Efficiency and Accuracy \n\nThe Nemotron 3 family of MoE models includes three sizes:\n\nAvailable today, Nemotron 3 Nano is the most compute-cost-efficient model, optimized for tasks such as software debugging, content summarization, AI assistant workflows and information retrieval at low inference costs. The model uses a unique hybrid MoE architecture to deliver gains in efficiency and scalability.\n\nThis design achieves up to 4x higher token throughput compared with Nemotron 2 Nano and reduces reasoning-token generation by up to 60%, significantly lowering inference costs. With a 1-million-token context window, Nemotron 3 Nano remembers more, making it more accurate and better capable of connecting information over long, multistep tasks.\n\nArtificial Analysis, an independent organization that benchmarks AI, ranked the model as the most open and efficient among models of the same size, with leading accuracy.\n\nNemotron 3 Super excels at applications that require many collaborating agents to achieve complex tasks with low latency. Nemotron 3 Ultra serves as an advanced reasoning engine for AI workflows that demand deep research and strategic planning.\n\nNemotron 3 Super and Ultra use NVIDIA’s ultraefficient 4-bit NVFP4 training format on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, significantly cutting memory requirements and speeding up training. This efficiency allows larger models to be trained on existing infrastructure without compromising accuracy relative to higher-precision formats.\n\nWith the Nemotron 3 family of models, developers can choose the open model that is right-sized for their specific workloads, scaling from dozens to hundreds of agents while benefiting from faster, more accurate long-horizon reasoning for complex workflows.\n\nNew Open Tools and Data for AI Agent Customization\n\nNVIDIA also released a collection of training datasets and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning libraries available to anyone building specialized AI agents.\n\nThree trillion tokens of new Nemotron pretraining, post-training and reinforcement learning datasets supply the rich reasoning, coding and multistep workflow examples needed to create highly capable, domain-specialized agents. The Nemotron Agentic Safety Dataset provides real-world telemetry to help teams evaluate and strengthen the safety of complex agent systems.\n\nTo accelerate development, NVIDIA released the NeMo Gym and NeMo RL open-source libraries, which provide the training environments and post-training foundation for Nemotron models, along with NeMo Evaluator to validate model safety and performance. All tools and datasets are now available on GitHub and Hugging Face.\n\nNemotron 3 is supported by LM Studio, llama.cpp, SGLang and vLLM. In addition, Prime Intellect and Unsloth are integrating NeMo Gym’s ready-to-use training environments directly into their workflows, giving teams faster, easier access to powerful reinforcement learning training.\n\nGet Started With NVIDIA Open Models\n\nNemotron 3 Nano is available today on Hugging Face and through inference service providers including Baseten, DeepInfra, Fireworks, FriendliAI, OpenRouter and Together AI.\n\nNemotron is offered on enterprise AI and data infrastructure platforms, including Couchbase, DataRobot, H2O.ai, JFrog, Lambda and UiPath. For customers on public clouds, Nemotron 3 Nano will be available on AWS via Amazon Bedrock (serverless) as well as supported on Google Cloud, CoreWeave, Crusoe, Microsoft Foundry, Nebius, Nscale and Yotta soon.\n\nNemotron 3 Nano is available as an NVIDIA NIM™ microservice for secure, scalable deployment anywhere on NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure for maximum privacy and control.\n\nNemotron 3 Super and Ultra are expected to be available in the first half of 2026.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said the US needs to shift away from \"power-hungry\" chips, but Nvidia has a \"death grip\" on the sector.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Nvidia is pushing the idea that building graphics chips that consume more and more power is the best path to advancing AI — and the result could be the US losing the AI race to China.\n\n\"Exactly and sadly,\" Burry wrote on X late Saturday, responding to another user's comment that called Nvidia the \"gangster of the AI neighborhood\" as it has \"shut down any narrative that even hints at reducing GPU demand.\"\n\nIn another post over the weekend, Burry shared a chart showing China has more than double America's electric generation capacity, and is expanding its energy infrastructure at a much faster rate.\n\nWhy China will win AI in one chart. \n\nPower hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward for the U.S. \n\nIt is not just the total power advantage. It is the slope. pic.twitter.com/qNXh1e4lZj\n\nNvidia has framed AI innovation as \"just figuring out how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon,\" Burry said. But China's huge lead in building out power sources means companies in the US are \"plowing capital into a race it is structurally positioned to lose.\"\n\nBurry said the US needs to shift its focus from developing more and more \"power hungry\" chips toward advancing \"AI-tuned ASICs\" — application-specific integrated circuits that are designed to do a particular task quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut he said Nvidia has a \"death grip on development\" thanks to its deals with many key players in the AI industry.\n\nNvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Business Insider about Burry's posts.\n\nNvidia stock has surged more than 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.\n\nThe chipmaker raked in about $148 billion of revenue and $77 billion of net income in the first nine months of this year. \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the third-quarter earnings release.\n\nBurry, whose contrarian bet against the US housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack.\n\nHe has made the case to his readers that Nvidia and other AI companies are inflating a historic tech bubble. He has said that Nvidia's customers have exaggerated the lifespan of its chips to drag out depreciation and boost short-term earnings.\n\nBurry has also called out the \"give-and-take\" deals between Nvidia and chip buyers such as OpenAI and Oracle, and criticized Nvidia's stock-based compensation as excessive.\n\nNvidia previously responded to his critiques in a memo to Wall Street analysts that was quickly leaked. Burry fired back that the document featured \"one straw man after another\" and he stood by his analysis.\n\nReplying to a subsequent comment on his Substack, Burry wrote that Nvidia had \"become too much of a focus.\" While the company's response did make him \"think to look a little deeper,\" he said it was a \"relatively small short\" for him.\n\n\"I believe it will fall, and is a pure play on my overall thesis, but it is not the worst out there.\"",

    "description": "This tech giant's early entry into the AI space has helped it build a substantial revenue backlog that could propel its shares higher in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft's stock needs to appreciate by 41% from current levels to achieve a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nThe company's AI tools are gaining terrific traction in the productivity space, while its cloud business is also booming.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush expects Microsoft to become a $5 trillion company next year, and it won't be surprising to see the company indeed hitting that milestone.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly became the first company to cross a $5 trillion market cap just a couple of months ago, driven by the company's remarkable revenue and earnings growth on account of its dominance of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\n\nHowever, the share price of the chip giant has pulled back since then, even though it continues to maintain terrific growth despite its massive size. Concerns about the AI boom becoming a bubble and the sustainability of the heavy infrastructure spending that has driven Nvidia's phenomenal growth over the past three years have begun to weigh on the stock.\n\nBut there's another company -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- that's making the most of the proliferation of AI. One analyst believes that this \"Magnificent Seven\" company could hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2026. Let's take a closer look at Microsoft's prospects and why it could hit the $5 trillion market cap milestone in the new year.\n\nThere is no denying that Nvidia's chips have played a crucial role in the widespread adoption of AI technology. However, the computing power provided by its chips is eventually harnessed to create customer-facing solutions. For example, training OpenAI's ChatGPT wouldn't have been possible without Nvidia's chips, but the chatbot became popular because of what it was doing for users.\n\nFrom helping users write emails to creating images to drafting documents and writing code, ChatGPT's versatility and productivity have been the key reasons behind its raging success. Not surprisingly, ChatGPT parent OpenAI points out that it now has more than 1 million paying enterprise customers, while more than 800 million users use ChatGPT every week.\n\nMicrosoft made a smart move in 2019 by investing in OpenAI. It still holds a 27% stake in OpenAI, a company reportedly worth $500 billion. However, more than the financial aspect, OpenAI provided Microsoft with access to large language models (LLMs) and applications, enabling it to build a wide portfolio of AI-powered tools and deploy them across its offerings.",

    "description": "Several AWS customers have complained about rising cloud costs in the AI era. Capital One is the latest, and one of the biggest.",
    "fullText": "Capital One is concerned about AI costs rising via its cloud-computing relationship with Amazon and may be looking for alternatives, according to an internal Nvidia document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nIn the document, an Nvidia employee wrote that the chip giant talked with Capital One about AI infrastructure alternatives to Amazon Web Services, as the bank was \"looking to control costs.\"\n\nThe Nvidia staffer was recapping discussions with Capital One in an internal email after meeting representatives from the bank at a recent tech conference.\n\n\"They see their need for GPUs and reasoning models growing and the costs in AWS will soon get out of hand,\" the Nvidia employee wrote, referring to Capital One.\n\nNvidia and Capital One discussed \"AI factory and neo-clouds,\" according to the email. An AI factory is an in-house data center that a company can build to train and run AI models as an alternative to renting compute from a third party. Financial institutions can use this infrastructure for tasks such as fraud detection, customer support, and algorithmic trading, according to Nvidia.\n\nNeoclouds are upstart cloud providers, often powered by Nvidia hardware, that focus on AI workloads, whereas AWS supports a much broader range of computing needs. Top neocloud players include CoreWeave, Lambda, Crusoe, and Nebius. Nvidia has been working closely with several of these players, in part to reduce its reliance on established cloud giants as customers.\n\nThe Capital One situation underscores a key dynamic in the AI boom. Companies are racing to adopt generative AI but also trying to mitigate rising cloud costs. This new technology has great promise, but developing and running AI models and AI applications can be expensive.\n\nLarge companies also regularly assess their cloud spending, including varying setups that increasingly incorporate multiple providers. Forty-three percent of companies use more than two public cloud providers, according to a recent RBC Capital report.\n\n\"We continue to be committed to AWS as our predominant strategic cloud partner,\" a Capital One spokesperson wrote in a statement. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\n\"Our pricing philosophy is to work relentlessly to take cost out of our own cost structure and to pass those savings back to our AWS customers in the form of lower prices,\" an AWS spokesperson said. \"It's easy to lower prices, it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices, and at AWS we work really hard at that.\"\n\nCapital One isn't the only company taking issue with AWS costs. Business Insider's Eugene Kim reported in October that AI startups are increasingly delaying traditional AWS spend in favor of AI model and developer tools, according to internal Amazon documents from March and July.\n\nThe documents said that 90% of startups in Radical Ventures' portfolio were building primarily on rival clouds due to AWS costs. Amazon also noted internally that there was increasing demand from customers for neocloud providers, which let them rent GPU power in small chunks and only pay for what they use.\n\nWhen that story published in October, an AWS spokesperson said Business Insider was \"using old data to reach outdated conclusions,\" noting that \"AWS remains the top choice for startups to build because we offer the best core services as well as the most innovative and powerful generative AI offerings.\"\n\nHave a tip?

The stock ended the trading session at 829.9 yuan, up 693%.\n\n\"It's another IPO tale in China that turns a crow into ‌a phoenix,\" said fund manager Yang Tingwu at Tongheng Investment.\n\nThe price surge \"creates huge arbitrage opportunities\" for pre-IPO investors, Yang said, and \"we're likely witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years\".\n\nMakers of artificial intelligence (AI) chips are rushing to sell shares in China to capitalise on interest generated by a government drive to boost local production in competition with the U.S.\n\n\"AI and semiconductors are key areas of competition in the Sino-U.S. tech rivalry,\" Guotai Haitong Securities said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing. \"Against the backdrop of geopolitical tension, AI chipmaking has huge growth potential,\" as China seeks to achieve self-sufficiency.\n\nResearcher ⁠Frost & Sullivan forecast China AI chip sales to top $189 billion ‌by 2029 versus $54 billion in 2026.\n\nMetaX, which makes graphics processing units (GPUs), raised 4.2 billion yuan ($596 million) last week in a share sale that was more than 4,000 times oversubscribed by retail investors.\n\nThe IPO - China's sixth biggest so far this year, according to KPMG - priced the money-losing ‍startup at 50 times its 2024 sales. That compared with a multiple of 34 for Nvidia and 14 for AMD, MetaX said in a pre-listing statement.\n\nMetaX's debut catapulted the value of the five-year-old startup to more than 300 billion yuan ($42.58 billion) and boosted the wealth of founder and major shareholder Chen Weiliang, 49.\n\nAfter working for AMD Shanghai for 13 years, Chen founded MetaX with a mission to \"contribute to China's rejuvenation ​and national prosperity.\" The founding team also included Peng Li and Yang Jian, both former AMD engineers.\n\n\"The company is a leading GPU maker in China thanks to its AMD gene,\" ‌Li Hui, analyst at Huajin Securities, said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing.",

In front of a huge Nvidia logo, he urged the venture capitalists before him to herald “a new industrial revolution”, announced billions of pounds in AI investments and, like Willy Wonka handing out golden tickets, singled out some lucky recipients in the room.\n\n“If you want to get rich, this is where you want to be,” he declared.\n\nBut his biggest party trick was a surprise guest waiting in the wings. At Huang’s cue, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, walked out as the crowd whooped at Huang’s pulling power.\n\nStarmer, looking slightly dazed, saluted his host’s “absolutely phenomenal” presentation, told the audience about how he had been “texting away” with Huang and effusively thanked one of the world’s richest men for his “confidence in what we are doing, in your investment, your foresight”. Huang sent him away with a gift: an inscribed AI processing unit.\n\nNot done, Huang called on to the stage Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, followed by Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for business. The parade of British cabinet ministers at this private Nvidia event spoke volumes about how successfully US tech oligarchs have pulled British politicians – serving and former – into their orbit.\n\nThis week, they landed another big fish. The $500bn Chat GPT maker Open AI hired the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne, prompting him to gush he was joining “the most exciting and promising company in the world”.\n\nHe was just the latest senior figure to pass through the revolving door between Westminster and Silicon Valley. In October, the former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals, and with Microsoft, which has invested heavily in both AI startups. Liam Booth-Smith, Sunak’s chief of staff, who sits in the House of Lords, also this summer took a senior role at Anthropic after it signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government.\n\nThey followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook. Clegg is now an AI investor who last week predicted “we will move from staring at the internet to living in the internet”. He made tens of millions of dollars at Meta. Some reports said as much as $100m. He would not confirm that but said he was paid “extremely well”.\n\nMeanwhile, Tony Blair, prime minister for a decade until 2007, is becoming increasingly influential on technology policy, lobbying successfully, through his Tony Blair Institute (TBI), for the UK to introduce a digital ID.\n\nTBI is part-funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle. A former TBI policy expert, Kirsty Innes, recently became a special adviser to Kendall.\n\nThe Commons science, innovation and technology select committee is monitoring the revolving door situation. Alex Sobel MP, a member of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which is currently investigating AI, said: “I am deeply concerned tech companies may be using their huge buying power to water down much-needed regulation by hiring those who have served at the highest level of previous governments.”\n\nJobs with the biggest US AI companies can be a good fit for frontline politicians because they also require comfort with risk-taking, said one tech company insider. Another advantage is that tech leaders do not tend to demand polished management skills. Meanwhile, their value is growing as AI companies increasingly target their products at government clients as well as businesses and consumers. Osborne’s task appears to be to wedge his foot in the door of governments to help OpenAI to inject its technology into the bloodstream of public systems. It already has government-level arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Germany, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Kazakhstan, but it wants more.\n\nSelling state-level AI is competitive. Palantir, which hosted Starmer at its Washington base in February and signed a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Defence in September, is pushing its systems into health trusts, police forces and local councils in Britain. The company’s UK communications are being led by a former head of strategic communications at Downing Street.\n\nBritain is an important place for AI firms to gain influence: regulations on AI development remain looser than in the EU, its universities foster important innovations, and the UK also has one of the world’s most respected AI safety institutes.\n\nThe revolving door also spins the other way, sending tech industry people into positions of public influence. The UK government last month appointed Raia Hadsell, the vice-president of research at Google DeepMind, as an “AI ambassador”, alongside Tom Blomfield the founder of the online bank Monzo. Blomfield is also a partner at Y Combinator, the San Francisco start-up incubator that used to be led by Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.\n\nCivil servants from the government’s digital service set up a consultancy called Public Digital, which has since won millions of pounds worth of public contracts. One of its partners, Emily Middleton, last year took a senior director general role in the government’s digital service.",

The HBM3E bandwidth advantage over MI300X is impressive but what really caught my eye is how the 126MB L2 cache almost completely offsets the cross-die latency penalty. Ran some FluidX3D variants last quarter and bandwidth-bound workloads like that absolutley benefit more from raw HBM throughput than extra L3 capacity. Dunno if this stays true for transformer inference where the attention mechanism can exploit larger caches, but for traditional HPC the B200's aproach seems optimal.Expand full commentReplyShareNo postsReady for more?",

    "description": "Google's TPU business is ramping up. Here's everything you need to know about Google's AI chips, and what they mean for Nvidia's dominance.",
    "fullText": "Google has been in the AI chip game for more than a decade. Now its custom hardware is moving markets.\n\nShares of Nvidia and other chipmakers tumbled last month following a report that Meta — one of Nvidia's largest customers — was exploring a deal to use Google's AI chips, known as Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs.\n\nGoogle has primarily used its TPUs for internal use, but it also leases them to external customers through the cloud. Nvidia, meanwhile, has become the dominant provider of AI chips with its graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nGoogle has a potential blockbuster business to unlock. In a research note sent December 2, Morgan Stanley projected that 5 million of Google's TPUs will be purchased in 2027 and about 7 million in 2028, significantly increasing its prior projections.\n\nHere's a breakdown of everything you need to know about TPUs, what they're used for, and when they might become a more prominent threat to Nvidia's chip dominance.\n\nOver a decade ago, Google needed more powerful and specialized compute power for the type of AI work it wanted to do. A team led by the now-CEO of Groq, Jonathan Ross, designed a new chip based on a specific type of integrated circuit for machine learning. The TPU was born.\n\nGoogle has continued to improve and refine its TPUs over the years, making them more effective at both training models and inference, the process where a trained model answers a question or performs a task. As large language models have grown in size, Google has also increased the memory bandwidth of later TPUs to handle these bigger workloads.\n\nGoogle says its latest \"Ironwood\" TPU, which the company is making widely available, is more than four times better than its predecessor for both training and inference.\n\nNvidia's GPU cards, which launched in 1999, were originally designed for gaming, not AI. When researchers later discovered that the chips were useful for tasks such as training neural networks, Nvidia doubled down on the AI market.\n\nGoogle's TPUs, on the other hand, were designed for AI from the get-go. Being more specialized means they're more efficient than Nvidia's chips at some tasks, and faster for running select AI models. They have something called a systolic array, which lets a more constant stream of data pass through the chip, rather than having to keep fetching more from memory.\n\nWhere Google's TPUs have a big edge is in cost at scale. It's possible to have thousands of TPUs working in tandem in a single \"pod.\" Because they are faster at some calculations than GPUs, running many TPUs at once can sometimes be more cost-efficient.\n\nThat may become more important as companies increase investments at the inference stage, which Google says its latest TPU is especially good at. That could save companies money.\n\nOne advantage that Nvidia has over Google is its CUDA software, which makes it possible for regular applications to use GPUs for general computing tasks — not just for graphics. CUDA also only works with Nvidia chips, one of the biggest points of friction stopping companies from switching to Google's chips.\n\nGoogle is trying to change that. For example, there is a lot of industry demand to have TPUs better support Pytorch, a popular tool for building AI applications that was created inside Meta. Google is allocating more resources and attention to better supporting Pytorch, which data suggests is seeing much more demand than Google's own Tensorflow software, according to Google employees and industry experts.\n\nWhen it comes to TPUs, Google remains its own biggest customer. It uses the chips across the company to power products like Search and Maps. Its latest Gemini 3 model was trained on TPUs.\n\nWhile Google has prioritized its own needs, it has leased its TPUs to other customers. Apple used TPUs to train its in-house AI model, Business Insider previously reported. In October, Anthropic announced a blockbuster deal with Google that it says will see it using up to 1 million TPUs. Broadcom, which helps build the TPU chips for Google, revealed in its Q4 earnings call this week that it has received a total of $21 billion in orders from Anthropic for Google's Ironwood TPUs.\n\nMeta is also in early testing of Google's TPUs, according to a person familiar with the matter, although it's not clear if it will result in a long-term deal.\n\nGoogle's TPU business could be poised to explode in the coming years. In a research note this month, Morgan Stanley wrote that every 500,000 TPU chips sold could potentially add around $13 billion in revenue to Google's balance sheet in 2027.\n\nHaving TPUs isn't just a potential revenue boost for Google. It also gets a feedback loop in using TPUs to run and train its AI models, learning from them, and changing how it develops its next chips to be better at the things Google needs.\n\nNvidia's GPU is still very much the chip du jour, but other tech giants are increasingly pouring resources into their own custom chips. Amazon just announced its new Trainium3 custom AI chip, which the company says can cut the cost of training and powering AI models in half compared with a GPU.\n\nMany TPU buyers are also Nvidia customers, and some industry insiders told Business Insider that it's more likely that the rise of more specialized chips will see companies and labs diversify the chips they use, rather than going all in on one provider.\n\nThat could still hurt Nvidia, which could lose pricing power as a result of a more diverse market.\n\nHowever, even if Google's TPU business finds more momentum, it doesn't mean Nvidia will suddenly crumble overnight. Jordan Nanos, member of technical staff of research firm SemiAnalysis, said his firm believes companies, including Nvidia, Google, and Amazon, will all \"sell lots\" of chips in the future.\n\n\"We don't see TPU as a significant threat to Nvidia's business, but it has been a real player in the market for many years,\" said Nanos. \"It is possible that Google sells TPU servers externally in the future, to many more customers. Right now, they are very selective.\"\n\nHave something to share? Contact this reporter via email at hlangley@businessinsider.com or Signal at hughlangley.01.

    "fullText": "Warren Buffett has frequently recommended that non-professional investors periodically buy shares of an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers easy exposure to many of the most influential companies in the world, including Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nThe S&P 500 advanced 1,810% during the last three decades, which is equivalent to 10.3% annually, a pace that would turn $400 per month into $835,000 over three decades.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ›\n\nWarren Buffett, who took control of Berkshire Hathaway six decades ago, has earned a reputation as one of the greatest investors in American history. He has consistently given the same advice: Buy an index fund that tracks the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)\n\n\"In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 index fund,\" Buffett told attendees at Berkshire's annual meeting in 2021. He has suggested the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).\n\nHere's how that advice could turn $400 invested monthly into $835,000 over 30 years.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 measures the performance of the S&P 500, which tracks 500 large U.S. companies. It includes value stocks and growth stocks from all 11 stock market sectors, and covers about 80% of domestic equities and 40% of global equities by market value.\n\nThe index fund provides exposure to many of the most influential businesses in the world. The top 10 positions are listed by weight below:\n\nOne risk associated with owning an S&P 500 index fund is the extraordinary concentration of the underlying index. The top 10 companies account for 41% of the S&P 500 by market-cap weight, which means a large decline in two or three of those stocks could really drag on the entire index.\n\nHowever, the top 10 companies also account for approximately 33% of the S&P 500's earnings, so the statistic is not as alarming as many pundits make it out to be. Their price-to-earnings multiples are above average, but their strong competitive positions warrant premium valuations.\n\nThere is a simple reason Warren Buffett believes an S&P 500 index fund is the best way for the average investor to get stock market exposure: Buying individual stocks requires more work than most people are willing to take on, and beating the S&P 500 is challenging even for professional money managers.",

    "fullText": "Young tech talent hoping to land a job in the private sector has a new way in: the public sector.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration announced the launch of the United States Tech Force on Monday, a two-year program that offers participants federal government jobs and eventual recruitment opportunities for private sector roles.\n\nThe government is partnering with at least 28 tech companies on the program, including Apple, Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Dell, Box, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, Palantir, Oracle, Uber, and xAI, among others.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management is spearheading the early-career program in partnership with other agencies. Participants will be placed at agencies across the government to work on modernization projects and, in part, implement AI, according to the Tech Force website.\n\nTech Force plans to hire around 1,000 applicants to start, according to the site, and is looking for people \"highly skilled in the areas of software engineering, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data analytics, or technical project management.\"\n\nApplicants will submit an application, complete a technical assessment, have interviews with agency leaders, and undergo a background test. OPM will do the initial resume review and technical assessment before passing the hiring decisions off to individual agencies, OPM Director Scott Kupor said during a call before the announcement.\n\nPrivate sector partners can provide training resources and mentorship opportunities, and have committed to considering Tech Force participants for employment after the two years, according to the site. Kupor said on Monday's call that there will also be a speaker series featuring company CEOs. The program, he added, will end with public- and private-sector job fairs.\n\nCompanies haven't made any firm hiring commitments, Kupor said on the call.\n\n\"It wouldn't be appropriate for us to ask companies to hire people without knowing who those people are,\" Kupor said. He added that he'll \"be certainly disappointed\" if the program doesn't lead to hiring by the private-sector partners.\n\nSalaries will likely range from around $130,000 to $195,000, Kupor said. There are no specific degree or experience requirements for the positions, which will be posted on USA Jobs. Those interested are encouraged \"to apply as soon as possible\" on the site. Kupor said he hopes to get everybody hired by the end of March.\n\nThe roles are largely based in Washington, DC, and remote work options will depend on the agency and role, according to the site. They're non-partisan positions and are entirely distinct from the US DOGE Service.\n\nThough the Tech Force is primarily an early-career program, the government is also seeking \"experienced engineering managers from private sector partners,\" the site says.

    "fullText": "TAIPEI/SINGAPORE, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Taiwan's tech-heavy stocks show few signs of slowing a rally even as AI bubble worries cast a shadow over global markets, underscoring home-grown confidence in the structural advantages in AI that foreign investors may have overlooked.\n\nTaiwan's benchmark index is poised to breach ​a record 30,000 points in 2026, investors say, extending a three-year surge that has seen the stock market nearly double as the island rides a wave of demand ‌for chips that power artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile foreign money worries about stretched AI valuations, Taiwanese investors have enthusiastically ploughed into the market.\n\nAnalysts say domestic investors are betting on Taiwan's unique position as the lynchpin of an AI supply chain, where ‌even increasing competition in the sector would only benefit Taiwanese firms, including TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.\n\nOne major focus of anxiety around AI comes from uncertainty about Nvidia's ability to sustain its market dominance, with Google's tensor processing units (TPUs) emerging as a potentially more cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nBut it's a win-win scenario for Taiwan because the island is essential to supply chains of both the GPU and TPU, the building blocks of AI computing power.\n\n\"Taiwan is a major beneficiary of the AI market,\" said Piter Yang, a fund manager of Fuh Hwa Securities Investment Trust Co, citing the ⁠advantage of Taiwan being the world's semiconductor hub.\n\nAnd for now, as ‌a promising future fuels optimism, Taiwan markets and local investors seem relatively unfazed by the AI bubble fears, just as they remain calm in the face of rising geopolitical tensions with Beijing that have often spooked foreign investors.\n\nGains in Taiwan's market have also been underpinned ‍by earnings growth, leaving it with a reasonably steady price-to-earnings ratio of 21, below that of the Nasdaq and the Nikkei, meaning the rally has not made stocks more expensive.\n\n\"We are not worried about an AI bubble,\" said Li Fang-kuo, chairman of the securities investment arm of food conglomerate Uni-President. \"We are comfortable with where the valuations stand.\"\n\nLi pointed out that several of the magnificent seven companies in the U.S. have gross ​margins of as much as 70% or higher. \"So it's not comparable to the dot-com bubble, when companies were not generating meaningful earnings.\"",

    "description": "Jensen Huang biography author Stephen Witt explains why Google's self-developed AI model, Gemini, could pose a threat to Nvidia's AI dominance",
    "fullText": "Nvidia's (NVDA) AI turf could take a blow if Google (GOOGL, GOOG) keeps firing on all cylinders.\n\n\"The biggest risk right now obviously is Google,\" said Stephen Witt, author of \"The Thinking Machine,\" a Jensen Huang biography.\n\nThat risk, he told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid, is largely tied to Google's Gemini model. Witt described it as the \"best AI right now in the benchmarks outside the Nvidia stack.\"\n\nWitt explained that Gemini was trained entirely on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). If Google proves it can sustain world-leading AI development using only its homegrown chip stack, it sets a potent precedent for other tech giants to follow suit.\n\n\"That's a huge risk,\" Witt said. \"If Google ends up winning this AI race ... Nvidia will be in trouble.\"\n\nThis risk, coupled with competition from rivals like Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), is why \"it's very easy to imagine a world\" where Nvidia's high-flying stock declines. The AI chipmaker's shares are up over 1,270% in the past five years.\n\nTo mitigate the core risk of rivals like Google winning the chip war, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is already looking past generative AI. Witt said a significant amount of the CEO's personal effort is being poured into the next great computing wave: robotics.\n\nIf Huang can dominate the robotics wave, he said, \"that will mean several trillion dollars in market capitalization for this company.\"\n\nHowever, Nvidia has another issue: the lack of any clear succession plan.\n\n\"It's just Jensen at the top,\" Witt said. \"There's no second in command. There's no obvious successor.\" He noted that the board has been silent, and Huang has offered no advice on a succession strategy.\n\nThat suggests Nvidia's $4 trillion valuation — which accounts for over 8% of the entire S&P 500 (^GSPC) — is, in many ways, resting solely on Huang's vision.\n\nWitt described Huang as a \"world-class engineer\" who could \"design these microchips himself,\" a skill that whoever takes the helm must also possess. He noted that neither of Huang's two children, who work at the company, has a technical background, making them noncontenders for the top spot.\n\nWitt also provided a look behind the polished stage persona of Huang, known for his trademark leather jacket. Beneath the showmanship is a highly intense, \"almost totally neurotic\" leader who is driven not by optimism, but by fear.\n\n\"He's driven by negative emotions, things like fear of failure, guilt, even shame are what make Jensen get up in the morning and work so hard to make Nvidia succeed,\" Witt explained.",

    "description": "An internal memo, obtained by Business Insider, assessed Microsoft's deployment of cutting-edge GPUs.",
    "fullText": "As Nvidia works to install some of its newest chips in Microsoft data centers, an employee at the GPU giant observed in early fall that Microsoft's cooling approach at one facility seemed \"wasteful.\"\n\nNvidia has been deploying its GB200 Blackwell architecture at Microsoft and other tech giants as demand for compute to train and run AI models surges.\n\nBlackwell, announced in March 2024, is roughly twice as powerful as its predecessor, Hopper, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at launch. GB200 is part of an earlier wave of Blackwell deployments, with the GB300 generation now available.\n\nIn early fall, an internal email sent by a staffer on the Nvidia Infrastructure Specialists (NVIS) team described one Blackwell installation of server racks for OpenAI, which Microsoft supports as its cloud partner and largest investor.\n\nThe email described the setup of two GB200 NVL72 racks, each of which houses 72 Nvidia GPUs. The setup uses liquid cooling technology, given the heat generated by multiple GPUs operating closely in tandem.\n\nThe staffer wrote that Microsoft's \"cooling system and data center cooling approach for their GB200 deployment seems wasteful due to the size and lack of facility water use, but does provide a lot of flexibility and fault tolerance,\" according to the memo.\n\nWhile liquid cooling is used for the servers, data centers also use a second, building-level system to expel heat from the facility, according to Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California.\n\nThe Nvidia employee may have been referring to a building-level system that uses air-cooling instead of water, explained Ren, who studies how data centers use water and other resources.\n\n\"This type of cooling system tends to be using more energy,\" he said, \"but it doesn't use water.\"\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson described a cooling setup consistent with Ren's two-phase explanation.\n\n\"Microsoft's liquid cooling heat exchanger unit is a closed-loop system that we deploy in existing air-cooled data centers to enhance cooling capacity on first and third-party platforms,\" the Microsoft spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.\n\n\"These systems ensure we maximize our existing global data center footprint for scale while promoting efficient heat dissipation and optimizing power delivery to meet the demands of AI and hyperscale systems,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nAs AI infrastructure expands, energy and water use in data-center cooling have become flashpoints globally, prompting pushback in some regions where new facilities are being built.\n\nRen noted that because data centers can use air cooling, water cooling, or a hybrid system at the building level, \"there's a trade-off\" between resources.\n\nAir cooling requires more energy, but can \"address some of the public concerns with water consumption — because water is something people can really see,\" he said.\n\n\"These companies are profit-driven,\" he added, \"they weigh in the water cost, the energy cost, and also the publicity cost.\"\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, said it intends to be \"carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste\" by 2030.\n\n\"We've also announced a zero water cooling design for our next-generation data centers and breakthroughs in on-chip cooling,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe internal email from the Nvidia staffer described some logistical hiccups that occurred during the Blackwell installation in early fall, which can be typical in the early deployment of new data center hardware.\n\n\"Onsite support for this activity was a necessity,\" the staffer wrote. \"Many hours were spent creating the validation process documentation as well as vetting the steps worked and made sense to those less familiar with how cluster and system validation is usually performed.\"\n\nAdditionally, the handover processes between Nvidia and Microsoft \"required a lot more solidification than what was performed before arrival.\"\n\nStill, the memo suggested Blackwell's production hardware quality had improved compared to early samples.\n\nThe email said GB200 NVL72 production hardware \"has good quality\" compared to the qualified samples sent to customers for early testing. Both racks had a 100% pass rate on certain compute performance tests.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider that its Blackwell systems \"deliver exceptional performance, reliability, and energy efficiency for a wide variety of computing applications.\"\n\n\"Our customers, including Microsoft, have successfully deployed hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GB200 and GB300 NVL72 systems to meet the world's growing need for artificial intelligence,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "description": "AI spending is front and center again for investors. Oracle plunged Thursday, with top hardware makers including Nvidia and Broadcom also dropping.",
    "fullText": "Oracle just raised a fresh red flag for investors worried that tech companies are getting ahead of themselves when it comes it their massive capex spending.\n\nOracle stock plunged 14% on Thursday after the tech giant reported an earnings beat but delivered revenue that was below Wall Street estimates, posting $16.06 billion compared to $16.21 billion expected by analysts. Cloud sales rose 34% from the previous quarter but also fell short of estimates.\n\nImportantly, Oracle also pledged to spend about $15 billion more next year than previously forecast, sparking fresh concerns about aggressive capex among the biggest tech firms.\n\nThe tech titan's stock drop was enough to weigh on other AI names and drag markets lower in Thursday's session.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood at the 9:30 a.m. ET opening bell on Thursday:\n\n• Nasdaq 100: 25,563.72, down 0.8%\n\nOracle stock has been highly volatile lately, dropping almost 20% in the last month after a huge surge following a blockbuster revenue forecast issued in September.\n\nIt's flurry of deals cemented the company as an AI power player, announcing a $300 billion contract with OpenAI, new partnership commitments with both Nvidia and Meta Platforms, and plans to expand its AI and cloud computing infrastructure in booming international markets.\n\nNow Oracle's lackluster earnings are prompting speculation that its big plans in the space are going to take awhile to payoff, and that it's spending plans are too ambitious. Morgan Stanley described the results as a moment when investors might resume their disbelief about the AI trade.\n\n\"Cloud growth at the low-end of the guide with building pressure on gross margins and op margins may further sap investor confidence in ORCL's ability to execute efficiently against a large and growing book of GPUaaS business, leaving the shares lacking a clear catalyst,\" analysts at the bank wrote on Thursday.\n\nSeveral other high-growth AI stocks were pulled down by Oracle's earnings report, dragging down the entire S&P 500 index, which fell 0.31% in premarket hours, while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite index rose slightly.\n\nHere are some of the biggest losers on Thursday:\n\nFor many investors, it is likely concerning that a company like Oracle could manage to fall short of analyst estimates after doing so much to position itself as an AI infrastructure leader this year. The key takeaway is likely that the company overpromised on what it could deliver.\n\n\"Oracle faces its own mounting scrutiny over a debt-fueled data center build-out and concentration risk amid questions over the outcome of AI spending uncertainty,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne. \"This revenue miss will likely exacerbate concerns among already cautious investors about its OpenAI deal and its aggressive AI spending.\n\nThe concerns aren't limited to Oracle. While some have recently argued that the biggest AI fears may be overblown, it's possible that if one major tech player overspent on AI in 2025, others may have done the same. This could weigh on investor sentiment around AI as the market heads into 2026.",

    "description": "Chris Lattner helped build the software behind Google TPUs. Now he's coming after Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, where bold technical bets abound, few bets look bolder than trying to break the grip of Nvidia's CUDA, a software stack that's quietly become the operating system of the AI boom.\n\nThat's what Modular, a startup founded by software gurus from Apple and Google, is trying to do.\n\nCofounders Chris Lattner and Tim Davis have spent decades building the software plumbing that sits beneath the modern tech industry. Lattner is famous for creating Apple's Swift programming language. He also built the software underpinning Google's TPU AI chips, with Modular cofounder Tim Davis.\n\nThey're now aiming that expertise at CUDA itself. The attempt borders on madness, but it's the kind of audacious project that could transform the AI industry.\n\n\"It's seen by a lot of people as somewhat crazy,\" said Kylan Gibbs, CEO of startup Inworld AI and a former product manager at Google DeepMind. \"That's where Chris has the advantage: He's smart enough to actually know how to do it, and somewhat crazy enough to set out to do it.\"\n\nCUDA began life almost 20 years ago as a way to make graphics chips programmable. Today, it has grown into a multilayered software ecosystem — language, libraries, compilers, inference systems — that most AI companies rely on.\n\nThat success comes at a cost: Most of the industry is now optimized around a single vendor's hardware. CUDA binds AI workloads to Nvidia GPUs. That is great for Nvidia, but deeply limiting for everyone else.\n\nOn the surface, there seems to be a ton of competition: AMD sells GPUs. Google has TPUs. Amazon created Trainium AI chips, and a host of startups are building similar hardware.\n\nThe problem is that each chip comes with its own software stack optimized just for that component. That means an endless reinvention of the wheel. Most of the time, it's simpler to just stick with CUDA — and Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nAnd yet, AI developers crave portability: Being able to use any combination of GPUs from multiple providers without juggling different software stacks.\n\n\"Nobody is building portable stuff, because why would anyone work on software for more than one chip when the chip projects themselves are doing the software?\" Lattner, Modular's CEO, told me in an interview.\n\nNvidia could extend CUDA to run well on rival AI chips. But doing so would undermine Nvidia's greatest moat: the closed-loop bond between its software and its chips. \"Obviously, they don't want portability,\" he said.\n\nFor Lattner, this paradox presents a big opportunity.\n\n\"We realized there's nobody in the industry that's actually incentivized to do this. It's very expensive, very hard,\" he said. \"And at the same time, everybody wants it.\"\n\nThat's what inspired Lattner and Davis to leave Google and start Modular in 2022, the year ChatGPT took the world by storm.\n\nSince then, Modular has raised $380 million from investors including Greylock, General Catalyst, and GV, Google's venture capital arm. The latest financing in September valued the startup at $1.6 billion. Modular isn't the only effort to break the CUDA lock-in. There has been ZLUDA, an open-source project that was funded by AMD, and more recently, the startup Spectral Compute, which has raised $6 million.\n\nLattner has used some of this money to hire talented programmers from Google, Apple, and other tech companies. They spent three years working in relative obscurity to create the building blocks of a new AI software stack.\n\nThe foundation starts with a brand-new programming language, called Mojo, that offers deep controls for making AI chips run as efficiently as possible.\n\nModular designed this to work similarly to Python, a popular and easy-to-use programming language. But Mojo also has the speed and power of other, more complex languages, such as C++, that are essential for AI development. Mojo also works well with PyTorch, an open-source framework that is often used when building AI models and applications.\n\nI first heard about Modular earlier this year when interviewing Carles Gelada, a former OpenAI researcher. \"There are several interesting projects to create GPU-agnostic frameworks and platforms, and challenge CUDA,\" he said at the time. \"Mojo is the most interesting one.\"\n\nMAX is the next major layer of Modular's new software stack. It powers AI inference, which is how models are run. This part of the system works with Nvidia GPUs, AMD GPUs, and similar chips from Apple. Modular hopes to add more AI chips in the future.\n\nOn top of that is another layer called Mammoth, which helps AI developers manage GPU clusters.\n\nIn late September, Modular announced that it got top performance out of Nvidia's new Blackwell B200 GPUs and AMD's latest MI355X GPUs — crucially on the same software platform.\n\nLattner said Modular got these AMD GPUs to perform roughly 50% better than when these chips run on AMD's own software.\n\nMore importantly, the ability to run different GPUs on the same software stack now supports the tantalizing opportunity to compare Nvidia's offerings with rival AI chips on a more level playing field.\n\n\"The obvious question is: can MI355X compete with Blackwell?\" Modular wrote in a blog announcing the results. \"Early signs point to yes.\"\n\nGibbs, the CEO of Inworld AI, has been putting Modular's software through its paces in the real world.\n\nInworld builds high-speed, real-time conversational AI technology that supports offerings from big companies, including Disney, NBCUniversal, and Niantic Labs.\n\nEarlier this year, when the startup designed a new text-to-speech AI model and got early access to Nvidia B200 GPUs, they issued Modular a challenge: Cut our costs by 60% and reduce our latency by 40% and we'll work with you.\n\n\"Within about four weeks, we were able to get this incredible performance,\" said Gibbs, who signed a partnership deal with Modular soon after. \"I've bet with my wallet.\"\n\nWhile Inworld was mostly lured by Modular's performance gains on Nvidia's latest GPUs, Gibbs likes the flexibility of using different AI chips more easily in the future, if needed.\n\n\"The promise is that we'd be able to move to new hardware,\" he said. \"Let's say AMD takes off, let's say TPUs take off for Google, or there could be other new hardware that comes online. So it's nice to have that optionality.\"\n\nIn fact, Google's TPUs are suddenly having a moment. The internet giant released a new AI model called Gemini 3 to rave reviews recently. That was trained and run using TPUs, and some other AI companies have signed deals to use these chips instead of, or alongside of, Nvidia GPUs.\n\nThat's put Nvidia on the defensive. A project like Modular, with its promise of portability across different AI hardware, adds to this pressure.\n\n\"Nvidia could kill this in a day,\" said Gibbs of the Modular project. \"Nvidia could basically say, 'okay, we don't really care that you run just on Nvidia hardware. Here's a CUDA option that runs on AMD GPUs as well.' It'd be a bit crazy for them to do that, but it's something they could do and that would of course be somewhat bad.\"\n\nFor all Lattner's critique of the industry, he says Modular is not trying to kill Nvidia. In fact, he argues that Nvidia will continue to thrive, even if Modular succeeds spectacularly.\n\n\"We're trying to build something like Android, but for AI hardware,\" he told me, referring to Google's mobile operating system that powers most of the world's smartphones.\n\nDespite billions of people using Android devices, this success didn't kill iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. iPhones still rule in the US, for example.\n\nLattner thinks something similar will happen in AI as Modular's software makes other hardware more competitive, giving developers more freedom, and chipping away at the industry's single-vendor monoculture.\n\n\"So Nvidia doesn't have to die, but we do want more competition. We do want more innovation,\" he said. \"I think that's good for the world.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Export-controlled technology worth US$30 million with fake brand labels was allegedly addressed to a facility near Toronto’s Pearson airport",
    "fullText": "A Chinese-born Canadian citizen who lives in Mississauga, Ont., was arrested in Virginia by the FBI and charged with trying to smuggle restricted high-tech Nvidia computer chips used in AI processing to China\n\nU.S. authorities seized export-controlled technology worth about $30 million that was addressed to an air freight facility in Mississauga, close to Toronto Pearson International Airport, according to allegations filed in court.\n\nNvidia labels on the components had been removed and replaced with labels for a fake company, authorities said.\n\nThe arrest of Benlin Yuan, of Mississauga, immediately west of Toronto, and the large shipment destined for Toronto are part of Operation Gatekeeper, described by U.S. authorities as targeting “a sophisticated illicit procurement conspiracy and smuggling network that orchestrates buying and exporting controlled high-tech computer chips to China.”\n\nYuan is described in U.S. prosecution documents as president of an information technology company based in Virginia that provides data centre services and IT support and consulting in Canada and the United States. The documents say it is a subsidiary of a Chinese company based in Beijing.\n\nHe was arrested in Sterling, Virginia, on Nov. 28 and charged with conspiring to violate export control acts.\n\nThe network is accused of purchasing at least US$50 million worth of GPUs from a large U.S. technology company.\n\nThe computer products Yuan is alleged to be involved in exporting are Nvidia A100, H100, and H200 Tensor Core graphic processing units, known as GPUs, and HGX baseboards. The equipment is used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications and in high-performance computing. The chips can handle huge amounts of data that is needed in AI applications, an exploding field that is revolutionizing technology.\n\nThe GPUs can perform calculations at higher speeds than most previous computers.\n\nSince about November 2023, a Chinese company has worked to import these chips from the United States, prosecutors allege. The entire plot is alleged to have involved US$160 million in tech goods.\n\nYuan is accused of joining the conspiracy this spring.\n\nIn a criminal complaint sworn by a special agent in the U.S. Department of Commerce, Yuan helped buy the technology using straw purchasers and intermediaries, meaning in the name of a person or company that is not the real end buyer.\n\nThe buyers allegedly declared the goods were for use by customers within the United States or in countries that do not require an export licence, including Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nAt various U.S. warehouses, Nvidia labels were allegedly removed from the computer circuits and relabeled with a fake manufacturing brand of SANDKYAN, according to the criminal complaint against Yuan.\n\nWhen preparing the items for export, the shipping paperwork misclassified the products as harmless and unrestricted pieces of tech: “adapters,” “adapter modules,” and “computer controllers,” authorities claim.\n\nThey were then shipped, directly or indirectly, to China.\n\nInvestigators received a tip about pallets of suspicious GPUs at a New Jersey warehouse that were addressed to companies in China.\n\nAn undercover agent was sent inside, where he spent an hour.\n\nThe agent allegedly saw two engineers who appeared to be of Chinese origin unboxing Nvidia components. One of the engineers spoke to the undercover agent in Mandarin, documents say. The engineers said they had to cover up all of the Nvidia branding on the equipment for “export purposes,” court filings allege.\n\nThe agent watched Nvidia labels being pulled off and new ones for the fake firm put in their place. The next day the agent returned and found the boxes had been resealed. The products were now labeled as having been “Made in Taiwan.”\n\nNot only were those packages addressed for shipping to Toronto, but warehouse employees told agents they recently had several similar tech exports to Canada.\n\nThe packages were removed and secured in a government warehouse. That sparked a flow of complaint calls and demand letters about the missing GPUs. The people expecting the goods believed the undercover officer had stolen the products and started negotiating to have them returned, authorities allege.\n\nThey offered $1 million to get their packages back, but insisted the equipment be inspected before payment was made.\n\nYuan is accused of organizing the “inspection.”\n\nHe is accused of recruiting and arranging the group of inspectors and of being one of the six who arrived to examine the packages, about two weeks after the seizure, court filings allege.\n\nThe inspection arrangements were allegedly planned in a group chat using an encrypted communication app and confirmed later over a video conferencing app.\n\nYuan was told by a high-level representative of the buyer in China to make sure no one said the items were destined for China, according to the criminal complaint. He is accused of helping them develop an elaborate “compliance backstory” to justify the products based on false information.\n\nThey also allegedly discussed how to make the million-dollar payment and Yuan was told to send copies of the driver’s licences of everyone on the inspection team. Three trucks were arranged for the pick up.\n\nHe is also accused of handling the storage of a different shipment of Nvidia products destined for China. A cooperating witness for U.S. prosecutors alleged that Yuan told him not to put fake labels on this one as he thought they looked suspicious; he would rather the Nvidia labels just be removed.\n\nAlexander Blanchard, a Virginia-based lawyer for Yuan, declined to comment about Yuan or the case when asked by National Post.\n\n“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said Nicholas Ganjei, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.\n\n“These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control AI technology; the country that controls AI technology will control the future.”\n\nU.S. regulation restricts the export of items that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of other nations or could be detrimental to the foreign policy or national security of the United States.\n\nAdvanced computing integrated circuits, including certain Nvidia-manufactured GPUs were added to the export restriction list in 2022. Some of the latest Nvidia chips have been classed by the U.S. as “critical technologies” that China could use to “modernize its military capabilities in ways that threaten the national security interests of the United States and its allies,” according to export regulations.\n\nThe chips require a special licence to export to China.\n\nOn Monday, the same day Operation Gatekeeper was announced, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States will allow Nvidia’s H200 processors to be exported to China with a 25 per cent fee.\n\nAlan Hao Hsu, also known as Haochun Hsu, 43, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company both pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities in October as part of Operation Gatekeeper.\n\nNewly unsealed court documents say Hsu received more than US$50 million in wire transfers from China to help fund the scheme. He is scheduled for sentencing in February.\n\nFanyue Gong, also known as Tom Gong, 43, a citizen of China who lives in Brooklyn, New York, was also charged in the probe. He is described as the owner of a New York technology company. He was arrested in New York on Dec. 3, and charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the United States.\n\nFive unnamed co-conspirators are linked to IT companies based in Hong Kong or Shenzhen, a city on the Pearl River that acts as a bridge between Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\n• Email: ahumphreys@postmedia.com | X: AD_Humphreys\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

    "fullText": "Ever heard of a chipmaker called \"SANDKYAN?\"\n\nNo? That's because it doesn't exist — it was the fake company name involved in what US authorities are saying was a \"sophisticated\" AI chip-smuggling operation.\n\nOn Monday, prosecutors announced they have arrested several parties in connection with an operation that involved smuggling Nvidia's most advanced AI chips to China and Hong Kong in violation of US export control laws.\n\nAmong those are Fanyue \"Tom\" Gong, a 43-year-old tech-company owner in New York, and Benlin Yuan, a 58-year-old Canadian executive. They were arrested on December 3 and November 28, respectively, after investigators linked them to the trafficking network, the Department of Justice said in a press release published Monday.\n\nThe Nvidia chips, known as GPUs, are used to train cutting-edge AI models and high-performance computing systems. They are tightly restricted due to their potential military applications.\n\n\"These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications,\" said US Attorney Nicholas Ganjei for the Southern District of Texas, adding that the smuggling operation threatened national security.\n\nYuan's lawyer told Business Insider he had no comment about the cases. A representative for Gong could not immediately be identified.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider that the export system is \"rigorous and comprehensive\" and that it will \"continue to work with the government and our customers to ensure that second-hand smuggling does not occur.\"\n\nIt comes as President Donald Trump on Monday announced his approval for Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China under a plan that includes a 25% payment to the US.\n\nProsecutors said the smuggling operation relied on falsified paperwork, shell companies, and covert relabeling.\n\nThe people involved purchased GPUs through straw buyers and intermediaries who claimed the hardware was destined for US customers or countries that don't require export licenses, prosecutors said.\n\nOnce the chips reached US warehouses, the DOJ said, workers under Gong's direction removed Nvidia labels and then rebranded the GPUs as \"SANDKYAN,\" a fake company name.\n\nShipping documents were also rewritten to classify the GPUs as generic computer parts, the DOJ said.\n\nThe mislabeled GPUs were then exported covertly to China, Hong Kong, and other restricted destinations, often routed through a Hong Kong logistics firm and a China-based AI company.\n\nYuan, who ran the US arm of a Beijing IT company, recruited inspectors and instructed them not to disclose the GPUs' true destination, Ganjei said.\n\nProsecutors said Yuan also helped craft false explanations when federal authorities detained certain shipments.\n\nThe arrests are part of \"Operation Gatekeeper,\" a wider crackdown that earlier led Texas businessman Alan Hao Hsu and his company to plead guilty to smuggling offenses. According to court documents unsealed on December 8, Hsu exported or attempted to export $160 million worth of Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips to China, Hong Kong, and other prohibited countries.\n\nProsecutors said they seized more than $50 million in GPUs and cash from Hsu's operation. The activity took place between October 2024 and May 2025, the DOJ said.\n\nGong and Yuan remain in custody pending further proceedings. Yuan was charged with conspiring to violate the Export Control Reform Act, while Gong was charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the US. If convicted, Yuan faces up to 20 years in prison. Gong faces up to 10 years.",

    "fullText": "Commerce department finalising deal to allow H200 chips to be sold to China as strict Biden-era restrictions relaxed\n\nDonald Trump has cleared the way for Nvidia to begin selling its powerful AI computer chips to China, marking a win for the chip maker and its CEO, Jensen Huang, who has spent months lobbying the White House to open up sales in the country.\n\nBefore Monday’s announcement, the US had prohibited sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips to China over national security concerns.\n\nTrump posted to Truth Social on Monday: “I have informed President Xi, of China, that the United States will allow NVIDIA to ship its H200 products to approved customers in China, and other Countries, under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security. President Xi responded positively!”\n\nTrump said the Department of Commerce was finalising the details and that he was planning to make the same offer to other chip companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel. Nvidia’s H200 chips are the company’s second most powerful, and far more advanced than the H20, which was originally designed as a lower-powered model for the Chinese market that would not breach restrictions, but which the US banned anyway in April.\n\nThe president said the US would receive 25% of the proceeds, more than the 15% previously agreed to with Nvidia in an earlier deal to lift restrictions, and following similar unorthodox plans for the federal government to take a financial cut from private business dealings.\n\nIn August, Trump said the US would receive a 10% stake in the tech company Intel. Some lawmakers have questioned the legality of such arrangements.\n\nAccording to the Hill, the Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andy Kim of New Jersey sent letters to the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, last week outlining their concerns over selling these chips to China and saying it risked powering the country’s “surveillance, censorship and military applications”.\n\nThey wrote: “I urge you to stop ignoring the input of bipartisan members of Congress and your own experts in order to cut deals that trade away America’s national security.”\n\nOn social media, Warren called for Huang to appear before Congress to testify under oath.\n\nHuang has worked closely with Trump since the inauguration and has made several trips to the White House. The CEO attended the president’s AI summit in July, met Trump as recently as last week and was even a guest at the White House dinner for the Saudi crown price, Mohammed bin Salman. Huang has pledged to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years.\n\nHuang has visited China several times, meeting officials and Chinese tech executives, as US bans were variously lifted and reintroduced. Earlier this year, China imposed its own controls on the imports of Nvidia chips, with top tech firms reportedly instructed to cancel orders, citing national security concerns and confidence in China’s domestic chip development.\n\nIn October, Huang said Nvidia has gone from having 95% of the Chinese market to having none, and called the bans a “strategic mistake”.\n\nSelling chips to China, the world’s second largest economy, could now mean a windfall worth billions of dollars for Nvidia, which is already valued at $4.5tn.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said: “We applaud President Trump’s decision.” He said offering the H200 chips “to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America”.\n\nThe Nvidia spokesperson and Trump said the move would support US jobs and manufacturing.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump condemned the Biden administration’s policies, which imposed strict export controls on powerful chips. The Biden administration had said withholding such technology from China bolstered US competition, protected national security and hampered AI development in China.\n\n“That Era is OVER!” Trump wrote. “My Administration will always put America FIRST.”\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry said it had noted the reports. “China has always adhered to the principle that China and the United States can achieve mutual benefit and win-win results through cooperation,” the spokesperson said.\n\nMa Jihua, a telecom industry analyst, told the state media outlet the Global Times that years of US curbs on AI exports had “provided a rare chance of China’s domestic chip industry to grow and catch up”.",
