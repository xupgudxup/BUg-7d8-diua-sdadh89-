    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China's main space contractor vowed to develop space tourism in the next five years, state media reported on Thursday, as Beijing revs up its commercial spaceflight and deep space exploration ambitions ​amid a technology race with the U.S.\n\nState-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) said it would \"achieve the flight operation of ‌suborbital space tourism and gradually develop orbital space tourism,\" as well as \"build a gigawatt-level space digital intelligence infrastructure\", state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n\nChina and the U.S. are competing ‌as they look to turn space exploration into a commercially viable business similar to civil aviation, as well as becoming the first to exploit the military and strategic advantages of space dominance. CASC has vowed to transform China into a \"world-leading space power\" by 2045.\n\nBeijing's key bottleneck so far is its failure to complete a reusable rocket test. U.S. rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 reusable rocket has allowed its subsidiary Starlink to ⁠achieve a near-monopoly on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites ‌and it is also used for orbital space tourism.\n\nReusability is crucial to lowering the costs of rocket launches and making it cheaper to send satellites into space. China achieved a record 93 space launches ‍last year, according to official announcements, buoyed by its rapidly maturing commercial spaceflight startups.\n\nHowever, China has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on LEO satellites as a national security risk and is launching its own satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the next decades.\n\nIn late ​December, Chinese entities submitted filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) laying out plans to put about 200,000 satellites in orbit over ‌the next 14 years. Two mega-constellations account for the vast majority, and the move would strategically reserve suborbital slots and frequencies for Beijing.\n\nCASC's plans were announced after China inaugurated its first School of Interstellar Navigation housed in the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Tuesday, aiming to foster the next generation of space talent in frontier fields including interstellar propulsion and deep space navigation.\n\nThe new institution signals China's ambitions to strategically transition from near-Earth orbit operations to deep space exploration, and will support China's planned lunar research station and efforts in ⁠detecting planets outside our solar system, according to a Xinhua report on ​the inauguration.\n\n\"The next 10 to 20 years will be a window for leapfrog ​development in China's interstellar navigation field. Original innovation in basic research and technological breakthroughs will reshape the pattern of deep space exploration,\" Xinhua wrote.\n\nThursday's CCTV report said CASC would also focus on breakthroughs in key technologies ‍such as small celestial resource exploration ⁠and intelligent independent mining and step up monitoring of space debris and the formulation of international space traffic management rules.\n\nChina's Chang'e-6 lunar probe was the first spacecraft to bring back samples from the far side of the moon in 2024, and ⁠Beijing is actively setting international standards for spaceflight and space infrastructure to establish itself as a dominant space power.\n\nThe U.S. faces intense competition this decade from ‌China in its effort to return astronauts to the moon, where no humans have gone since the final U.S. ‌Apollo mission in 1972.",

    "description": "Russia is testing a plasma engine prototype designed to slash Mars travel time to just 60 days. Developed by Rosatom’s Troitsk Institute, the system uses electromagnetic fields to accelerate particles to 100 km/s, promising a flight-ready model for deep-space missions by 2030.",
    "fullText": "Russia is quietly testing a new plasma propulsion system that, if it performs as claimed, could dramatically change how long it takes to travel to Mars. Early results suggest a leap in speed and efficiency that has drawn attention precisely because it is not coming from NASA or private U.S. companies such as SpaceX.\n\nThe engine is being developed by the Troitsk Institute, part of Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom. According to researchers involved in the program, the system could reduce interplanetary travel time from several months to roughly one to two months. Ground-based testing is currently underway, and the developers say the technology could be ready for space deployment by around 2030.\n\nUnlike conventional chemical rockets, the new system relies on electromagnetic fields to accelerate charged hydrogen particles. This places it firmly in the category of electric or plasma propulsion, a field that has gained increasing global attention as space agencies look for more efficient ways to travel deeper into the solar system.\n\nChemical rockets deliver very high thrust for a short time, which is ideal for launching from Earth. However, they are inefficient for long-distance travel once a spacecraft is in orbit. Plasma engines, by contrast, generate much lower thrust but can operate continuously for long periods, gradually building up extremely high speeds while using far less propellant.\n\nIf the Russian system achieves its projected performance, it could have a major impact on how future missions to Mars and beyond are planned, both for scientific exploration and for potential military or logistical applications.\n\nThe prototype engine is currently being tested inside a 14-meter-long vacuum chamber designed to simulate space conditions. According to technical details reported by the Russian newspaper Izvestia, the engine operates at a power level of 300 kilowatts in a pulsed periodic mode and has already demonstrated a working lifespan of 2,400 hours. That duration would be sufficient for a full Mars mission, including acceleration and deceleration phases.\n\nResearchers say the engine accelerates charged hydrogen particles, including protons and electrons, to speeds of up to 100 kilometers per second. By comparison, traditional chemical rockets typically achieve exhaust velocities of around 4.5 kilometers per second. This massive difference in exhaust velocity is the key to the engine’s potential efficiency and speed.\n\nThe plasma engine is not intended to launch directly from Earth’s surface. A conventional chemical rocket would first carry the spacecraft into low Earth orbit. Once in space, the plasma engine would be activated to provide continuous thrust for the journey through deep space.\n\nOfficials involved in the project also note that the system could function as a space tug, moving cargo, modules, or satellites between different planetary orbits. This concept aligns with broader international interest in reusable orbital transport systems.\n\nThe engine uses hydrogen as propellant and relies on an onboard nuclear reactor to provide a constant energy supply. According to project researcher Yegor Biryulin, hydrogen’s low atomic mass allows for faster acceleration while reducing fuel consumption. Its abundance in space could eventually allow for in situ refueling, at least in theory.\n\nThe propulsion system uses two high-voltage electrodes to create directed plasma flow. Charged particles pass between them, forming a magnetic field that expels plasma and generates thrust. This design avoids the need to heat plasma to extreme temperatures, which reduces component wear and improves overall efficiency.\n\nRosatom documentation lists the projected thrust at 6 newtons, which is high for a plasma propulsion prototype. Even so, the thrust remains far lower than chemical rockets, meaning spacecraft would be designed for slow but continuous acceleration rather than short bursts of power.\n\nPlasma propulsion is already used in orbit on many satellites, including systems on OneWeb spacecraft and on NASA’s Psyche mission launched in 2023. Most existing plasma engines operate at exhaust velocities between 30 and 50 kilometers per second. The Russian claims of 100 kilometers per second would represent a significant step forward.\n\nHowever, the technology remains unproven in space. Peer-reviewed scientific data have not yet been published, and the nuclear reactor design has not been disclosed. Nuclear-powered spacecraft raise complex safety, regulatory, and international approval issues, especially during launch.\n\nWhile the concept is promising, the engine is still years away from practical use. Its projected readiness by 2030 will depend on continued testing, funding, and successful resolution of engineering and regulatory challenges.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Autorepublika.com and has been republished with permission by Guessing Headlights.

    "title": "You Can Finally Clean Up Your Mac’s Menu Bar (Without Using Third-Party Software)",
    "description": "Hide icons in the settings, then shrink the space between icons.",
    "fullText": "The Mac menu bar is a bit of a mess. Way too many applications want to put icons in the top-right corner of the screen, and most users only want to see a fraction of those. This is a particular problem on recent MacBooks, where the camera notch blacks out a chunk of space right in the middle of the menu bar. This is why applications for cleaning up the Mac menu bar are so popular—the clutter can feel overwhelming.\n\nHere's the thing, though: You probably don't need to leave applications like that running constantly. You can hide icons in macOS' Settings, then use a free tool once to move all the icons closer together. Here's how.\n\nTahoe, also known as macOS 26, gave users a lot to talk about, which meant a few features were broadly overlooked. One of them: the ability to hide any menu bar icon, no third party software required. To use this feature open System Settings and head to the Menu Bar section. You will see the ability to toggle system icons, like Siri and Spotlight, on and off. Keep scrolling, though, and you'll find the ability to hide icons for any of your installed applications. Just toggle off any application you'd rather not see in the menu bar and it will disappear.\n\nI've been using this to disable unwanted icons for months, and it's working well for me. Having said that, though, it isn't a perfect replacement. Applications like Bartender and Ice don't just hide icons—they give you access to a secondary tray where you can still occasionally access icons you hid. There's no quick way to do that using the macOS settings. Still: It's a free way to hide unwanted icons, and there's no need to keep third party software running.\n\nIf your menu bar still feels crowded, you can free up a bit more space by squeezing all of your icons together. A free application called Menu Bar Spacing lets you change the spacing in your menu bar. Just \n\nThe great thing about Menu Bar Spacing, as an application, is that it doesn't need to run constantly. You can launch it once, make the changes you like, and then delete it—your setting will still apply. This is because the application changes a few hidden macOS settings. You can make the changes yourself using the Terminal if you prefer not to use an app, but I think the app makes things a little bit easier.\n\nThere's a bit of a caveat for macOS 26 users. Because of a bug, only Apple's own icons will move closer together at first. Your other applications will need to be restarted before they bunch closer together. That means you'll need to manually close and re-launch each application, or simply restart your Mac. It's annoying, but only relevant right after you change the settings. And you'll have a lot more space on your menu bar once you're done.",

    "fullText": "On the morning of January 28, 1986, seven crew members were killed when the space shuttle Challenger broke apart a little over a minute after it launched.\n\nThose killed included five NASA astronauts, one payload specialist, and a civilian schoolteacher.\n\nThis mission was Challenger's 10th, but the shuttle exploded due to a design flaw in a seal that was exacerbated by cold temperatures on launch day. A joint in one of the rocket boosters failed at liftoff, and the external fuel tank subsequently collapsed, leading to the demise of the vehicle.\n\nChallenger was the second shuttle to reach space, which it did in April 1983. It also sent the first African-American astronaut into space, completed the first in-flight capture and repair of a satellite, and launched the first US woman in space.\n\nThe 1986 disaster marked a turning point for NASA. An investigation after the explosion found that many engineers and astronauts believed NASA was pushing its programs forward at breakneck speed, without sufficient funding or testing. NASA added more internal checks and processes after the event to prevent similar tragedies.\n\nThe space agency also stopped sending civilians on potentially dangerous space-shuttle missions.\n\nThe new orbiter sat atop a 747 carrier aircraft.\n\nThe ship led the Challenger Expedition: a groundbreaking marine research trip from 1872 to 1876.\n\nFor its maiden voyage, the Challenger deployed a communications satellite and conducted a space walk.\n\nAfter that first flight, Challenger flew 85% of all space-shuttle missions during its lifetime.\n\nSally Ride served as a mission specialist in 1983 and returned to space on the Challenger in 1984.\n\nBluford flew to space a total of four times.\n\n\"It may have been one small step for Neil, but it's a heck of a big leap for me,\" McCandless said of his untethered space walk, according to NASA.\n\nThe crew consisted of teacher-in-space Christa McAuliffe, astronauts Gregory Jarvis and Judith Resnik, mission commander Dick Scobee, astronaut Ronald McNair, pilot Mike Smith, and astronaut Ellison Onizuka.\n\nThe cause of the malfunction was later found to be rubber O-rings that were not sealed properly on the right Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster due to the cold weather.\n\nThe disaster was broadcast on live television.\n\nA memorial marker was also dedicated at Arlington National Cemetery in 1987, with the grave site featuring cremated remains from all seven crew members.\n\nIn place of a national space-shuttle program, NASA has partnered with Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to develop new vehicles for returning astronauts to the moon.\n\nIn May 2020, Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken flew on SpaceX's first crewed mission and became the first astronauts to launch into space from the US since NASA's space-shuttle program ended in 2011. They spent two months on the International Space Station before returning in August 2020.",

    "fullText": "A resurfaced incident from June 2022 about a Yellowstone National Park bison attack is drawing attention online, as viewers react to yet another reminder of how quickly wildlife encounters can turn dangerous when people get too close.\n\nABC News reported the occurrence at the time, detailing how a bull bison gored a 71-year-old woman while she visited the park — the third bison attack at Yellowstone that year.\n\nAccording to park officials, the woman and her daughter were heading back to their vehicle at Storm Point near Yellowstone Lake when they inadvertently approached the animal, causing it to charge. The woman suffered non-life-threatening injuries and was transported to a nearby hospital in Cody, Wyoming.\n\nThe story continues to circulate online as an example of how easily visitors can misjudge wild animals' behavior, especially during peak seasons.\n\nYellowstone urges visitors to stay at least 25 yards away from bison and other large animals. Despite appearing calm, bison are unpredictable and can run up to three times faster than humans.\n\n\"Mother bison are extremely protective of their calves in spring, and bulls can be more aggressive in July and August,\" Dennis Jorgensen, a bison program manager at the World Wildlife Fund, told ABC News.\n\nSimilar incidents have continued in the years since, with Yellowstone reporting additional bison-related injuries in 2024 and 2025, which are often tied to visitors approaching animals too closely for photos or videos.\n\nBeyond the danger to people, these encounters can also endanger wildlife. Animals that injure humans — even when provoked — may be euthanized, removing healthy animals from protected ecosystems because of human behavior.\n\nCommenters responding to ABC News' coverage on Facebook emphasized that the responsibility lies with visitors, not wildlife.\n\n\"I don't understand why such simple rules are broken these are wild animals and you are driving in their home,\" one person said.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAnother commenter wrote: \"The Rules are for Humans to follow. These animals are doing what's natural, instinct, it's their home and people should respect these awesome creatures.\"\n\n\"This is their habitat. Give the animals space and respect,\" a third user added.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Using observations from the James Webb Space Telescope in a patch of the sky covering almost three times the area of the full moon, scientists have",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Using observations from the James Webb Space Telescope in a patch of the sky covering almost three times the area of the full moon, scientists have created the most detailed cosmic map to date of the mysterious substance called dark matter that ​accounts for most of the stuff that populates the universe.\n\nOrdinary matter makes up stars, planets, people and everything else we can see. But it represents ‌only about 15% of all the matter in the cosmos. The rest is dark matter, which does not emit or reflect light, making it invisible to the human eye and to telescopes.\n\nScientists infer its existence based ‌on the gravitational effects it exerts on a large scale such as how quickly galaxies rotate, how galaxy clusters are held together and how light from distant objects bends as it passes through massive cosmic structures.\n\nThe new map of the distribution of dark matter was based on this phenomenon of light bending - causing subtle distortions in the shape of roughly 250,000 distant galaxies as observed by Webb - thanks to the gravitational effects of matter along the line of sight.\n\nA previous map of dark matter was based on observations by the Hubble ⁠Space Telescope. The new map, powered by Webb's greater capabilities, ‌offers double the resolution of the previous map, spans more parts of the cosmos and peers further back in time - effectively looking to roughly 8 to 10 billion years ago, a key period for galaxy formation.\n\n\"This allows us to resolve finer dark matter structures, detect ‍mass concentrations that were previously unseen, and extend dark-matter mapping into earlier epochs of the universe,\" said observational cosmologist Diana Scognamiglio of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, lead author of the research published on Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nThe map reveals with unprecedented clarity new details of the macrostructure of the universe called the cosmic web - galaxy clusters, immense filaments built of dark ​matter along which galaxies and gas are distributed, as well as regions with less density of mass.\n\nWebb, an infrared telescope possessing about six times the light-gathering power of ‌Hubble, was launched in 2021 and became operational in 2022.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope is like putting on a new pair of glasses for the universe,\" Scognamiglio said. \"It sees fainter and more distant galaxies with much sharper detail than ever before. That effectively gives us a much denser grid of background galaxies to work with, which is exactly what you want for this kind of study. More galaxies and sharper images translate directly into a sharper map of dark matter.\"\n\nThe map covers a part of the sky called the Cosmic Evolution Survey, or COSMOS, located in the direction of the constellation Sextans. The map will facilitate future investigations of the universe in numerous ways, the researchers said.\n\n\"For example, ⁠a major question in astrophysics is how galaxies grow and evolve with time - how the universe went from an ​almost perfectly homogenous soup to the spectacular variety of galaxies we see today,\" said observational cosmologist and ​study co-author Jacqueline McCleary of Northeastern University in Boston.\n\n\"Dark matter halos - self-gravitating 'clouds' of dark matter - are the site of galaxy formation, the nurseries of galaxies, if you will. So knowing where the dark matter is, how much of it there is and connecting it to the population of galaxies inside ‍the dark matter distribution places an important boundary ⁠condition on models of galaxy formation and evolution,\" McCleary said.\n\nThe method used by the researchers involving the bending of light revealed the distribution of dark and ordinary matter.\n\nThe researchers said their observations are in harmony with the leading cosmological model - called Lambda-CDM, or cold dark matter - that explains the universe's beginning with the ⁠Big Bang and its subsequent evolution and structure. The model sees a universe dominated by dark matter and the invisible cosmic force called dark energy that is responsible for its accelerating expansion.\n\n\"In this framework, ‌dark matter provides the gravitational backbone on which galaxies, groups and clusters form, creating the large-scale cosmic web. Our map provides a much sharper observational ‌view of this dark-matter scaffolding,\" Scognamiglio said.",

    "description": "A new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track space junk by tuning into their sonic booms.",
    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — As more and more space junk comes crashing down, a new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track incoming objects by tuning into their sonic booms.\n\nScientists reported Thursday that seismic readings from sonic booms that were generated when a discarded module from a Chinese crew capsule reentered over Southern California in 2024 allowed them to place the object’s path nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) farther south than radar had predicted from orbit.\n\nUsing this method to track uncontrolled objects plummeting at supersonic speeds, they said, could help recovery teams reach any surviving pieces more quickly — crucial if the debris is dangerous.\n\n“The problem at the moment is we can track stuff very well in space,” said Johns Hopkins University’s Benjamin Fernando, the lead researcher. “But once it gets to the point that it’s actually breaking up in the atmosphere, it becomes very difficult to track.”\n\nHis team’s findings, published in the journal Science, focus on just one debris event. But the researchers already have used publicly available data from seismic networks to track a few dozen other reentries, including debris from three failed SpaceX Starship test flights in Texas.\n\nA growing concern among scientists and others is that falling space debris could strike a plane in flight.\n\n“There are thousands, tens of thousands, more satellites in orbit than there were 10 years ago,” including SpaceX’s Starlinks and other companies’ internet satellites, said Fernando. “Unfortunately, we don’t really have anything other than the word of the company to say that when they break up, they completely burn up in the atmosphere.”\n\nFernando, who normally studies quakes on the moon and Mars, teamed up with Imperial College London’s Constantinos Charalambous the day after the Chinese debris streaked across the California sky in 2024. Over time, they gathered data from more than 120 seismometers that captured the sonic booms from the reentry, using that data to plot the object’s suspected path.\n\nChina’s out-of-control module had been abandoned in a decaying orbit ever since it was cut loose from the Shenzhou-15 capsule returning three Chinese astronauts from their country’s space station in 2023. The 1.5-ton (1.36-metric tonne) module — more than 3 feet (1 meter) in size — broke into countless smaller pieces as it plummeted through the atmosphere, resulting in multiple sonic booms. Besides attempting to trace the object’s fall, the seismic readings provided a sense of the cascading breakup, Fernando said.\n\nFernando acknowledged it’s impossible to know how close his team’s predictions are to the actual path since no debris was reported on the ground.\n\nThe goal is to ascertain, within minutes or even seconds, the speed and direction of the incoming space junk as well as its fragmentation. In remote areas like the South Pacific, nuclear blast monitoring stations could potentially track the sonic booms to fine-tune the paths of descent. That’s where NASA plans to ditch the International Space Station in five years. SpaceX is working on the deorbiting vehicle to ensure a controlled entry.\n\nFernando is looking to eventually publish a catalog of seismically tracked, entering space objects, while improving future calculations by factoring in the wind’s effect on falling debris.\n\nIn a companion article in Science, Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Chris Carr, who was not involved in the study, said further research is needed to reduce the time between an object’s final plunge and the determination of its course.\n\nFor now, Carr said this new method “unlocks the rapid identification of debris fall-out zones, which is key information as Earth’s orbit is anticipated to become increasingly crowded with satellites, leading to a greater influx of space debris.”\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center is located on Dulles Airport property in Chantilly, Virginia, and the observation tower is its highest structure.\n\nParking costs $15, but admission to the museum is free.\n\nWhen I visited in January, the observation tower closed at 4:30 p.m., an hour before the rest of the museum closed at 5:30 p.m.\n\nThe observation tower was my last stop after touring the rest of the museum, so I was grateful for the chance to sit and rest my feet in the waiting area.\n\nAfter a short elevator ride, I arrived at the top of the tower.\n\nLooking down at the museum's 10-story aviation and space hangars from above showed me just how large the entire complex is: 760,000 square feet, to be exact.\n\nAn informational plaque indicated that the Bull Run and Catoctin mountain ranges were 12 miles away, and the Blue Ridge mountains were 23 miles away.\n\nI could see planes taking off and landing at the airport, with some planes passing directly over the observation tower. On a clearer day, I likely would have been able to see more aircraft in the sky.\n\nPlanes take off into the wind for extra lift. Landing into the wind helps them reduce speed.\n\nI could hear air traffic controllers instructing flights to turn certain directions or use certain runways at Dulles, but much of it was jargon meant for pilots.\n\nThe exhibit included a lighting control panel depicting airport runway layouts known as a \"mimic,\" a vacuum tube from a vintage communication radio, and a light gun used to communicate with pilots via lighting signals if radio isn't available.\n\nWhile touring the museum, my guide pointed out the Boeing 367-80 Jet Transport known as \"Dash 80.\" The only model of its kind ever built, the Dash 80 first took off in 1954 and was eventually developed into the first Boeing 707 jetliner, ushering in a new era of commercial air travel.\n\nAfter viewing the museum's vast collection of historic planes, watching passenger jets take off and land at Dulles gave me a deeper appreciation of how much — and how quickly — aviation has changed. I was glad I'd saved the best for last.",

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the company started robotaxi rides with no safety monitor present in the cars in Austin, a long-awaited move. This comes after Waymo announced another expansion of its robotaxi service in the US, hammering home its lead in the autonomous space — for now.\n\nMusk also claimed on Thursday that he expects the company’s self-driving service to get EU and China approval soon.\n\nTesla stock popped on the news, closing up over 4%.\n\nIn a post on X.com, Musk said Tesla \"started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car. Congrats to the Tesla AI team!\" This post came in response to users on X posting videos of the Tesla robotaxi operating without a safety driver.\n\nTesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy added on X.com that the service is \"starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Waymo, part of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), said on its company blog that it is now operating in the Miami area, inviting its first public riders in the city. “With nearly 10,000 residents already signed up, we will be inviting new riders on a rolling basis to ensure a seamless experience across our initial 60-square-mile service area.”\n\nWaymo says plans for rides to Miami International Airport will be coming soon.\n\nBefore the Miami announcement, Waymo operated in five major US markets: Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the greater San Francisco area.\n\nThis year, Waymo has an aggressive plan to expand, with Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and Nashville targeted for public service.\n\nIt also has plans for densely populated cities, with testing ongoing in New York, Tokyo, and London.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's autonomous and robotaxis services are lagging. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Musk claimed the company’s full self-driving (FSD) autonomous service, a supervised product that requires users to pay attention while using it, would soon be coming to Europe and China.\n\n\"We hope to ​get Supervised Full Self-Driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month, and then maybe a similar timing for China,\" Musk ‍said.\n\nWhile Waymo currently is only testing internationally in the cities mentioned above, its service is level 4 autonomous, which is fully autonomous in certain geographic areas. Tesla’s FSD is considered level 2.\n\nTesla’s robotaxis, currently operating in Austin and the San Francisco Bay area, have grown in numbers but only modestly. The robotaxis still require a safety driver in each vehicle, owing to the fact that it is still a supervised service. The new video shared by Musk suggests the company has approval to operate without a safety driver in Austin, but the CEO didn't share whether that was the case.",

    "title": "Six Ways to Use Staging Psychology to Sell Your House",
    "description": "Staging a house isn’t just making it look clean and neat—it’s about manipulating folks to see themselves in the space.",
    "fullText": "Selling a house is one of the largest transactions most of us will ever make. Considering how much you’ve invested in the place in terms of both money and sweat equity, it’s natural to want to get as much profit from the sale as possible. One strategy to maximize profits that most real estate professionals will recommend is staging: temporarily dressing, furnishing, and arranging the home to make it as appealing as possible.\n\nStaging works—it’s been shown to speed up the time to sale and to increase the sale price of a house. But it’s not magic—there’s a specific psychology to staging a house that you have to keep in mind, especially if you’re choosing to do it yourself in order to save a few bucks. It might seem like all you need to do is freshen the paint, clean the place up, and make a few furnishing choices, but if you want to get the most bang for your staging buck, you should keep staging psychology in mind.\n\nThe first thing to know about house staging psychology is the fundamental purpose of staging: It’s not to make the house look clean or presentable—it’s to shape a narrative. Essentially, you’re telling prospective buyers how they could live in your home. From where they’ll have their morning coffee to where they’ll entertain, you want to help them imagine what life will be like in the house. The easier you make it for people to see themselves living their ideal life there, the easier it will be to close the sale.\n\nIn order to support that narrative, there are specific psychological levers you’ll be pulling as you stage.\n\nFirst impressions really do matter, and the first staging psychology lever you’ll pull is what’s known as the “primacy effect.” This is a common cognitive bias wherein the first impression we get of something influences our perceptions in an outsized way. In other words, if the first impression people get from your home is that it’s luxurious and comfortable, this will override any negative impressions they get later in the house tour.\n\nStaging itself helps with this, of course, but you should also focus on the curb appeal and the entryway of the house to really cement that first impression as positive. Then, consider the fact that each room or space within the house will also offer its own first impression—that’s why decluttering is so vital. Clearing out your stuff and leaving behind a clean, curated visual will let potential buyers see a house they can easily move into, instead of getting an impression that they’d be buying a lot of chores.\n\nThe next bit of staging psychology you need to implement is anchoring—you want buyers to see the house as valuable right away so that impression gets anchored in their heads. This is why staged homes tend to sell for higher prices.\n\nThis involves staging with expensive-looking furniture, if you can, and decorating in a luxe way that implies high value. Seeing high-end decor, smart technology, and other expensive features cements in people’s minds that this is a high-value house, and they will be more willing to pay a premium for it because of that perceived value. Anchoring this value also lets you use the next bit of staging psychology—the Halo Effect.\n\nThe Halo Effect is a cognitive bias where a positive impression prevents you from seeing the flaws or downsides. If your property is a bit old or needs some work, staging it with a fresh, luxe look not only anchors a higher value in buyer’s minds, it can actually cause them to overlook those flaws. Even if they’re aware of some of the problems on one level, the overall sense of value and comfort is what will drive their decision-making.\n\nIt’s important to note that you shouldn’t try to conceal problems or needed upgrades; that would be unethical. The goal here is to let the staging drive a potential buyer’s enthusiasm so they willingly overlook those problems in favor of the comfortable, high-value narrative you’ve constructed.\n\nA key aspect of staging is triggering an emotional response in folks touring your house. Your goal is to make them imagine living there, and to make that fantasy one they associate with positive emotions. To do that, you’ll engage their senses:\n\nLighting. Soft lighting and a focus on natural light creates a warm, inviting atmosphere.\n\nScent. A house that smells fresh and clean is a comfortable space that doesn’t hint at a lot of work to be done. (Pro tip: Get someone who doesn’t live there to sniff the place out; we often become nose-blind to how our house smells.) You can also try to trigger a sense of nostalgia with the tried-and-true trick of baking some cookies. Don’t go overboard—an entire can of air freshener, a house that smells overwhelmingly of cookies, or a house that smells like you just cleaned it using buckets of bleach can backfire. Subtlety is key.\n\nAspiration. We all know there’s the way we think we’re going to live our lives, and then there’s reality. You want to offer potential buyers the fantasy. Maybe you don’t spend time cozied up in a reading nook with a good book and a cup of tea, for example, but you wish you did—so create that reading nook for buyers to picture themselves in. Their emotional attachment to the idea will make them more positive about the house overall.\n\nWhen staging a house, an easy psychological approach is to group things—furniture, decorations, lighting, even color palettes—using the Rule of Three. This is exactly what it sounds like: Arranging things in subtle groups of odd numbers (typically three) and arranging them to have some height and texture variety. The psychological effect is that this is perceived as more natural and less “stagey” than even numbers, and odd numbers tickle the brain’s need for symmetry, so people will be more engaged with your house.\n\nFinally, you want to make a buyer’s path to imagining themselves living in your clean, fresh, artfully decorated home as easy as possible—so get rid of yourself. Decluttering and depersonalizing doesn’t mean bare walls and empty rooms, it means going neutral with your decor and artwork. Get rid of the hobbies, the personal collections, and that weird lamp everyone else hates. Leaving some personal touches, like a few tasteful photos of the family, is a good idea—you don’t want the house to feel like a hotel. But you also don’t want people to feel like they’re intruding, or like they’re picking their way through your dirty laundry.",

Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, staff members repair and preserve historic aircraft in an in-house restoration hangar that offers a behind-the-scenes look at the work that goes into maintaining the museum's collection.\n\nThe Smithsonian museum's second location, situated about 30 miles from the National Air and Space Museum's flagship site in downtown Washington, DC, offers an expansive setting with 340,000 square feet of exhibit space.\n\nThe Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar, which is connected to the exhibits, can accommodate several aircraft at a time and houses everything workers might need, including a sheet-metal shop, a welding room, a paint room, and a fabric shop.\n\nIt also features floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the hangar, allowing visitors to watch the work happening in real time.\n\nHolly Williamson, public affairs specialist at the National Air and Space Museum, told Business Insider that visitors shouldn't expect to see planes being built with the speed of a factory assembly line. Progress can be slow, with some restoration projects spanning months or years.\n\n\"This kind of will look like paint drying if you just sit here for the whole day,\" Williamson said. \"It's a lot of research. It's very detail-oriented.\"\n\nDespite the slow pace, there's still plenty to see. One of the museum's longer-term projects is \"Flak-Bait,\" a Martin B-26 Marauder that flew 202 combat missions during World War II, including D-Day.\n\nWhen the museum first opened in 1976, visitors were allowed to touch the aircraft's nose, which wore down the paint. Workers have focused on restoring its appearance while preserving its authentic combat damage.\n\n\"It flew more missions than any other aircraft in World War II for the US, so we want it to look like it's been through hundreds of missions,\" Williamson said.\n\nAnother striking display is a Sikorsky JRS-1 seaplane, the only aircraft in the museum's collection that was present at Pearl Harbor when it was attacked on December 7, 1941. After Pearl Harbor, the Sikorsky JRS-1 patrolled for Japanese submarines. It arrived at the Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar in 2011.\n\nStaff members are also working to restore a McDonnell F-4S Phantom II, a fighter and bomber that shot down an MiG-21 during the Vietnam War. After the Vietnam War, it underwent modernization and was redeployed in 1983, remaining in service until its last squadron duty in 1987.\n\nThe rest of the hangar floor is a maze of tools, machinery, aircraft parts, and storage bins, indicators of just how intricate the museum's restoration efforts are.\n\nCertainly more interesting than watching paint dry.",

That speed, possible with the satellites’ planned optical communications, is extreme by consumer standards and would make the network key for data processing and large-scale government programs. Blue Origin said the network would be meant to serve a maximum of roughly 100,000 customers.\n\nThe reveal of TeraWave coincides with a space industry rush to build data centers in space that can meet the soaring demand for large-scale AI data processing, which on Earth requires immense energy and resources as adoption of the technology expands.\n\nThe planned network adds another satellite constellation linked to Bezos, executive chairperson of Amazon, which is in an early phase of deploying Leo – a network formerly called Project Kuiper – involving 3,200 satellites providing internet to consumers and businesses.\n\nMusk’s Starlink network of roughly 10,000 satellites is farthest ahead in a global push to put internet infrastructure in space, where swarms of low-orbiting satellites offer more security and higher connection speeds than traditional, unitary satellites farther out in space.\n\nThe SpaceX CEO has said he plans to build data centers in space, complementing the Starlink network, while Bezos has predicted such space-based centers will be commonplace in orbit within the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nStarlink, which has reported more than 6 million customers across at least 140 countries, targets individual consumers, businesses, governments and, with its Starshield variant, US national security agencies. Amazon Leo, with 180 satellites in space so far, has a similar customer strategy.\n\nA handful of Chinese companies are swiftly deploying similar satellite networks to get up to pace with Starlink, which has proved key for remote communications and geopolitical conflicts. China is developing new reusable rockets that can loft thousands of these satellites over the next several years for lower costs, a playbook first written by Musk’s SpaceX and its reusable Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nBlue Origin’s reusable New Glenn rocket, which has launched twice but has been slow to achieve a rapid flight rate, will likely be a vital part of TeraWave’s deployment.\n\nUnlike Starlink, the planned network appears off-limits to individual consumers, according to Blue Origin’s statement.\n\nBlue Origin’s statement said: “TeraWave enterprise-grade user and gateway terminals can be rapidly deployed worldwide and interface with existing high-capacity infrastructure, providing additional route diversity and strengthening overall network resilience,” leaving unclear what types of existing infrastructure the network can work with.",

    "fullText": "Jeff Bezos has unveiled his plans for a massive satellite network, mounting a direct challenge to Elon Musk's grip on internet infrastructure in orbit.\n\nThe project, called TeraWave, would deploy 5,408 satellites into orbit to serve data centers, governments, and businesses worldwide, Bezos's space venture, Blue Origin, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nLaunches are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2027.\n\nTeraWave is designed to deliver \"data speeds of up to 6 terabits per second anywhere on Earth,\" enabled by advanced optical communications between satellites, the company said.\n\nThe network is \"optimized for enterprise, data center, and government customers\" and would serve up to 100,000 customers, it added.\n\nThe announcement comes after Bezos' other company, Amazon, rebranded its consumer satellite network Leo in November. Formerly known as Project Kuiper, the initial constellation design includes more than 3,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites providing standard broadband service.\n\nThe launch of TeraWave raises the stakes in a billionaire-led fight over space-based internet infrastructure. Starlink, led by Elon Musk, dominates the field with roughly 10,000 satellites in orbit. The subsidiary project of SpaceX targets consumers, businesses, and governments, and serves more than 6 million users globally.\n\nIn a reply to an X user on Monday, Musk said \"Starlink space to ground laser links will exceed this,\" referring to the data speeds touted by TeraWave.\n\nSpaceX has also begun laying the regulatory groundwork to scale its satellite operations. In a January filing with the US Federal Communications Commission, the company said satellite systems should be treated as essential infrastructure for future wireless networks as the US seeks to maintain leadership in next-generation space-based services.\n\nBeyond internet access, the satellite race is increasingly tied to the future of computing, as tech leaders point to satellite networks as potential infrastructure for future data centers in space.\n\nResponding on X to an article about building data centers in space, Musk said in October that \"simply scaling up Starlink V3 satellites, which have high speed laser links would work.\"\n\n\"SpaceX will be doing this,\" he added.\n\nMusk has also discussed the idea internally. During an xAI all-hands meeting in December, he said he sees data centers eventually moving off Earth, raising the possibility of space-based facilities that could be operated by Tesla Optimus robots, people with knowledge of the meeting told Business Insider.\n\nJeff Bezos has voiced a similar long-term view, predicting that data centers could shift to space within the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said in November that the concept may sound \"crazy,\" but \"when you truly step back and envision the amount of compute we're going to need, it starts making sense and it's a matter of time.\"",

    "fullText": "NASA astronaut Suni Williams, who famously stayed in space for an extended nine-month visit because of problems with an experimental capsule, has retired after 27 years, NASA said Tuesday.\n\nWilliams retired effective Dec. 27, NASA said in a statement. Williams, a former Navy pilot, joined NASA in 1988.\n\n\"Suni Williams has been a trailblazer in human spaceflight, shaping the future of exploration through her leadership aboard the space station and paving the way for commercial missions to low Earth orbit,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in the statement.\n\nWilliams went on three missions to the International Space Station, the first of which was in 2006 and in which she was carried aboard the space shuttle Discovery, NASA said.\n\nBut it was the most recent, in 2024, in which the planned one-week stay stretched from June until March 2025 because of concerns over Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, which was on a test mission.\n\nStarliner launched June 5, 2024, taking Williams and Butch Wilmore to the space station on its first crewed flight. But there were problems with the capsule's thrusters during the docking process, and eventually, in September, NASA decided to return the capsule with no one on board.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore spent 286 days aboard the International Space Station.\n\nA SpaceX Dragon capsule was then sent up to bring the pair, as well as two other astronauts who were wrapping up a six-month mission, back to Earth. The Dragon capsule left the space station on March 18 and splashed down in the ocean off Florida.\n\nOver her career, Williams logged 608 days in space, which is the second-longest cumulative time in space in NASA history, the space agency said.\n\nShe also logged the most spacewalk time of any female astronaut, at 62 hours and 6 minutes, which is the fourth-most time of any NASA astronaut, it said.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore have said they enjoyed their extended time living and working at the orbiting outpost, even though it was longer than expected.\n\n\"The plan went way off for what we had planned, but because we’re in human spaceflight, we prepare for any number of contingencies,” Wilmore said in late March, after they returned to Earth. “This is a curvy road. You never know where it’s going to go.”\n\nWilliams said her recovery on Earth after the longer-than-intended space stay was helped by her previous space flights.\n\n“Though it was longer than any flight either one of us have flown before, I think my body remembered,” she told NBC News in an interview alongside Wil\n\nWilliams called her career and the opportunities to serve at NASA an \"incredible honor.\"\n\n\"Anyone who knows me knows that space is my absolute favorite place to be,\" she said in NASA's statement.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The astronauts evacuated last week from the International Space Station say a portable ultrasound machine came in “super handy” during the medical crisis.\n\nDuring their first public appearance since returning to Earth, the four astronauts refused Wednesday to say which one of them needed medical attention and for what reason. It was NASA's first medical evacuation in 65 years of human spaceflight.\n\nNASA’s Mike Fincke said the crew used the onboard ultrasound machine once the medical problem arose Jan. 7, the day before a planned spacewalk that was abruptly canceled. The astronauts had already used the device a lot for routine checks of their body changes while living in weightlessness, “so when we had this emergency, the ultrasound machine came in super handy.”\n\nIt was so useful that Fincke said there should be one on all future spaceflights. “It really helped,” he said.\n\n“Of course, we didn't have other big machines that we have here on planet Earth,” he added. “We do try to make sure that everybody before we fly are really, really not prone to surprises. But sometimes things happen and surprises happen, and the team was ready ... preparation was super important.\"\n\nThe space station is set up as well as it can be for medical emergencies, said NASA's Zena Cardman, who commanded the crew's early return flight with SpaceX. She said NASA “made all the right decisions” in canceling the spacewalk, which would have been her first, and prioritizing the crew's well-being.\n\nJapanese astronaut Kimiya Yui said he was surprised how well all the preflight training paid off in dealing with the health concerns.\n\n“We can handle any kind of difficult situation,” Yui said. “This is actually very, very good experience for the future of human spaceflight.”\n\nJoining them on what turned out to be a 5 1/2-month mission — more than a month shorter than planned — was Russia's Oleg Platonov. They launched last August from Florida and splashed down in the Pacific off the San Diego coast last week.\n\nWelcoming them back to Houston were their replacements, who aren't due to launch until mid-February. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the flight.\n\n“We were hoping to give them hugs in space, but we gave them hugs on Earth,” Fincke said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "Earlier this month, NASA announced that it had to cancel a scheduled spacewalk, citing a “medical situation” affecting a “single crew member who is stable” on board the International Space Station.\n\nThe mystery illness eventually led to the space agency staging the first medical evacuation in 25 years of continuous operation on board the aging orbital outpost, rushing four astronauts back to Earth in a move that brought the station’s number of occupants from seven to a skeleton crew of just three.\n\nWhile the medical incident only affected a single astronaut, who has yet to be identified for privacy reasons, all four members of the Crew-11 mission cut their time on board the ISS short by weeks, safely splashing down off the coast of San Diego early Thursday morning.\n\nThe four astronauts were airlifted to the Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego via helicopter for a “planned overnight stay at a local medical facility for additional evaluation,” according to a January 16 statement. After being “released as expected,” they continued their journey to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will “continue standard postflight reconditioning and evaluations.”\n\nDo you know anything about what caused the evacuation from the ISS? Drop us a line at tips@futurism.com. We can keep you anonymous.\n\n“All crew members remain stable,” the space agency reassured. “To protect the crew’s medical privacy, no specific details regarding the condition or individual will be shared.”\n\nIt’s an exceedingly rare event, highlighting the challenges inherent to providing healthcare in space. While hundreds of miles above the surface, specialized care is hard, if not impossible, to execute. While astronauts undergo rigorous EMT-level training so they can respond to emergencies on board the station, they aren’t full-blown medical professionals, and can only do so much under the direction of doctors back on Earth.\n\nThere’s a lot to still learn about providing care during medical emergencies, particularly when it comes to long-duration space exploration missions into deep space. According to a 2022 study, there still are plenty of “gaps in knowledge regarding the potential for unanticipated in-flight medical events to affect crew health and capacity, and potentially compromise mission success.”\n\nAs researchers from Northumbria University in Newcastle point out in a recent essay for The Conversation, medical emergencies are remarkably rare on the ISS, despite being expected to occur on average every three years. Studies have shown that the most common health issues astronauts experience are skin irritation, congestion, disruptions to sleep, and in-flight injuries — most of which are ironically caused by exercise, which is designed to protect astronauts’ long-term health.\n\nSpending prolonged periods in a microgravity environment has also been shown to affect astronauts’ vision and blood pressure.\n\nNow that there’s finally been a medical emergency on the station, though, it’s unclear whether the public — or even the broader medical community — will ever find out any details.\n\nMore on the evacuation: Entire Space Station Down to Skeleton Crew After NASA Evacuation",

    "description": "Near-weightless conditions can mutate genes and alter the physical structures of bacteria and phages, disrupting their normal interactions in ways that could help us treat drug-resistant infections.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nBacteria and the viruses that infect them, called phages, are locked in an evolutionary arms race. But that evolution follows a different trajectory when the battle takes place in microgravity, a study conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) reveals.\n\nAs bacteria and phages duke it out, bacteria evolve better defenses to survive while phages evolve new ways to penetrate those defenses. The new study, published Jan. 13 in the journal PLOS Biology, details how that skirmish unfolds in space and reveals insights that could help us design better drugs for antibiotic-resistant bacteria on Earth.\n\nIn the study, researchers compared populations of E. coli infected with a phage known as T7. One set of microbes was incubated aboard the ISS, while identical control groups were grown on Earth.\n\nThe analysis of the space-station samples revealed that microgravity fundamentally altered the speed and nature of phage infection.\n\nWhile the phages could still successfully infect and kill the bacteria in space, the process took longer than it did in the Earth samples. In an earlier study, the same researchers had hypothesized that infection cycles in microgravity would be slower because fluids don't mix as well in microgravity as they do in Earth's gravity.\n\n\"This new study validates our hypothesis and expectation,\" said lead study author Srivatsan Raman, an associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nOn Earth, the fluids bacteria and viruses exist within are constantly being stirred by gravity — warm water rises, cold water sinks, and heavier particles settle at the bottom. This keeps everything moving and bumping into each other.\n\nIn space, there is no stirring; everything just floats. So because the bacteria and phages weren't bumping into each other as often, phages had to adapt to a much slower pace of life and become more efficient at grabbing onto passing bacteria.\n\nExperts think understanding this alternative form of phage evolution could help them develop new phage therapies. These emerging treatments for infections use phages to kill bacteria or make the germs more vulnerable to traditional antibiotics.\n\n\"If we can work out what phages are doing on the genetic level in order to adapt to the microgravity environment, we can apply that knowledge to experiments with resistant bacteria,\" Nicol Caplin, a former astrobiologist at the European Space Agency who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. \"And this can be a positive step in the race to optimise antibiotics on Earth.\"\n\nWhole-genome sequencing revealed that both the bacteria and the phages on the ISS accumulated distinctive genetic mutations not observed in the samples on Earth. The space-based viruses accumulated specific mutations that boosted their ability to infect bacteria, as well as their ability to bind to bacterial receptors. Simultaneously, the E. coli developed mutations that protected against the phages' attacks — by tweaking their receptors, for instance — and enhanced their survival in microgravity.\n\nThen, the researchers used a technique called deep mutational scanning to examine the changes in the viruses' receptor-binding proteins. They found that the adaptations driven by the unique cosmic environment may have practical applications back home.\n\nWhen the phages were transported back to Earth and tested, the space-adapted changes in their receptor-binding protein resulted in increased activity against E. coli strains that commonly cause urinary tract infections. These strains are typically resistant to the T7 phages.\n\n\"It was a serendipitous finding,\" Raman said. \"We were not expecting that the [mutant] phages that we identified on the ISS would kill pathogens on Earth.\"\n\n—Antibiotic found hiding in plain sight could treat dangerous infections, early study finds\n\n—How fast can antibiotic resistance evolve?\n\n—Antibiotic resistance makes once-lifesaving drugs useless. Could we reverse it?\n\n\"These results show how space can help us improve the activity of phage therapies,\" said Charlie Mo, an assistant professor in the Department of Bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"However,\" Mo added, \"we do have to factor in the cost of sending phages into space or simulating microgravity on Earth to achieve these results.\"\n\nIn addition to helping fight infections in Earthbound patients, the research could help yield more effective phage therapies for use in microgravity, Mo suggested. \"This could be important for astronauts' health on long-term space missions — for example, missions to the moon or Mars, or prolonged ISS stays.\"",

Then, we even scored a goal that was chalked off. Even if Augsburg created another chance, we can see the positives in the last half an hour.”\n\nIgor Matanovic, who scored Freiburg’s equalizer, saw his second goal chalked off due to the ball crossing the line in the buildup. “Both teams had so much space (to create chances).

    "description": "Earth and its neighbors orbit the sun on a relatively flat plane. But what's below this plane, and is anythign below the Earth?",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nIf you've seen illustrations or models of the solar system, maybe you noticed that all the planets orbit the Sun in more or less the same plane, traveling in the same direction.\n\nBut what is above and below that plane? And why are the planets' orbits aligned like this, in a flat pancake, rather than each one traveling in a completely different plane?\n\nI'm a planetary scientist who works with robotic spacecraft, such as rovers and orbiters. When my colleagues and I send them out to explore our solar system, it's important for us to understand the 3D map of our space neighborhood.\n\nEarth's gravity has a lot to do with what people think is up and what is down. Things fall down toward the ground, but that direction depends on where you are.\n\nImagine you're standing somewhere in North America and point downward. If you extend a line from your fingertip all the way through the Earth, that line would point in the direction of \"up\" to someone on a boat in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nIn the bigger picture, \"down\" could be defined as being below the plane of the solar system, which is known as the ecliptic. By convention, we say that above the plane is where the planets are seen to orbit counterclockwise around the Sun, and from below they are seen to orbit clockwise.\n\nIs there anything special about the direction of down relative to the ecliptic? To answer that, we need to zoom out even farther. Our solar system is centered on the Sun, which is just one of about 100 billion stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way.\n\nEach of these stars, and their associated planets, are all orbiting around the center of the Milky Way, just like the planets orbit their stars, but on a much longer time scale. And just as the planets in our solar system are not in random orbits, stars in the Milky Way orbit the center of the galaxy close to a plane, which is called the galactic plane.\n\nThis plane is not oriented the same way as our solar system's ecliptic. In fact, the angle between the two planes is about 60 degrees.\n\nGoing another step back, the Milky Way is part of a cluster of galaxies known the the Local Group, and — you can see where this is going — these galaxies mostly fall within another plane, called the supergalactic plane. The supergalactic plane is almost perpendicular to the galactic plane, with an angle between the two planes of about 84.5 degrees.\n\nHow these bodies end up traveling paths that are close to the same plane has to do with how they formed in the first place.\n\nThe material that would ultimately compose the Sun and the planets of the solar system started out as a diffuse and very extensive cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. Every particle within the solar nebula had a tiny amount of mass. Because any mass exerts gravitational force, these particles were attracted to each other, though only very weakly.\n\nThe particles in the solar nebula started out moving very slowly. But over a long time, the mutual attraction these particles felt thanks to gravity caused the cloud to start to draw inward on itself, shrinking.\n\nThere would have also been some very slight overall rotation to the solar nebula, maybe thanks to the gravitational tug of a passing star. As the cloud collapsed, this rotation would have increased in speed, just like a spinning figure skater spins faster and faster as they draw their arms in toward their body.\n\nAs the cloud continued shrinking, the individual particles grew closer to each other and had more and more interactions affecting their motion, both because of gravity and collisions between them. These interactions caused individual particles in orbits that were tilted far from the direction of the overall rotation of the cloud to reorient their orbits.\n\nFor example, if a particle coming down through the orbital plane slammed into a particle coming up through that plane, the interaction would tend to cancel out that vertical motion and reorient their orbits into the plane.\n\nEventually, what was once an amorphous cloud of particles collapsed into a disc shape. Then particles in similar orbits started clumping together, eventually forming the Sun and all the planets that orbit it today.\n\nOn much bigger scales, similar sorts of interactions are probably what ended up confining most of the stars that make up the Milky Way into the galactic plane, and most of the galaxies that make up the Local Group into the supergalactic plane.\n\nThe orientations of the ecliptic, galactic and supergalactic planes all go back to the initial random rotation direction of the clouds they formed from.\n\nSo there's not really anything special about the direction we define as \"down\" relative to the Earth, other than the fact that there's not much orbiting the Sun in that direction.\n\nIf you go far enough in that direction, you'll eventually find other stars with their own planetary systems orbiting in completely different orientations. And if you go even farther, you might encounter other galaxies with their own planes of rotation.\n\nThis question highlights one of my favorite aspects of astronomy: It puts everything in perspective. If you asked a hundred people on your street, \"Which way is down?\" every one of them would point in the same direction. But imagine you asked that question of people all over the Earth, or of intelligent life forms in other planetary systems or even other galaxies. They'd all point in different directions.\n\nThis edited article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.",

    "description": "Cardiff astronomers say they don't yet know where iron bar detected inside the Ring Nebula came from.",
    "fullText": "Scientists have discovered a large bar‑shaped cloud of iron atoms in space that could offer clues about the future of Earth.\n\nThe structure, which was found inside the Ring Nebula - a famous, colourful cloud formed when a dying sun-like star released its outer layers - was roughly 500 times wider than Pluto's orbit and sits 2,283 light‑years away.\n\nAstronomers from Cardiff University, as well as University College London, detected the iron bar using a new telescope instrument called the WHT Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer (Weave).\n\nScientists observing it say its origin is unclear, but their theories about how it formed suggest it could hint at the Earth's future.\n\nThe first theory is the cloud may have formed during the nebula's creation, as the parent star collapsed.\n\nAlternatively, experts believe it could be space plasma, left behind from a rocky planet that was destroyed as the star expanded. If true, it could offer a preview of Earth's future as the sun - Earth's parent star - expels its outer layers in a similar way, engulfing Earth, in a few billion years.\n\nThe team said it was planning further observations to unravel precisely what the iron bar was, where it came from, and what it could tell them.\n\nDying star images show details never seen before\n\nThe amazing images taken by the $10bn telescope\n\nLead author Dr Roger Wesson, based jointly at Cardiff University and UCL, said although the Ring Nebula had been studied using many different telescopes and instruments, Weave had allowed them \"to observe it in a new way, providing so much more detail than before\".\n\nHe said: \"By obtaining a spectrum continuously across the whole nebula, we can create images of the nebula at any wavelength and determine its chemical composition at any position.\n\n\"When we processed the data and scrolled through the images, one thing popped out as clear as anything – this previously unknown 'bar' of ionized iron atoms, in the middle of the familiar and iconic ring.\"\n\nCo-author Prof Janet Drew added: \"We definitely need to know more – particularly whether any other chemical elements co-exist with the newly-detected iron, as this would probably tell us the right class of model to pursue.\"\n\nWeave is set to carry out eight surveys over the next five years, targeting everything from nearby white dwarfs - a type of dead star - to very distant galaxies.\n\nWesson added: \"It would be very surprising if the iron bar in the Ring is unique.\n\n\"So hopefully, as we observe and analyse more nebulae created in the same way, we will discover more examples of this phenomenon, which will help us to understand where the iron comes from.\"\n\nHealth and safety rules 'don't really apply' to Michelin restaurants, says food critic\n\nTV doctor says ADHD and OCD diagnoses have 'changed my life'\n\nGavin and Stacey stars reveal details of their new TV comedy",

Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data.

    "title": "Senator Cruz wants commercial space stations up and manned before ISS retires",
    "description": "It comes up almost every time that I see him. Continuous human presence and no gap.\"",
    "fullText": "In remarks this week to a Texas space organization, a key Senate staff member said an “extension” of the International Space Station is on the table and that NASA needs to accelerate a program to replace the aging station with commercial alternatives.\n\nMaddy Davis, a space policy staff member for US Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, made the comments to the Texas Space Coalition during a virtual event.\n\nCruz is chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and has an outsized say in space policy. As a senator from Texas, he has a parochial interest in Johnson Space Center, where the International Space Station Program is led.\n\nDavis said Cruz has repeatedly reaffirmed that one of his core priorities is establishing a continuous human presence in low-Earth orbit, with “no gap” in that capability. That means he wants commercial space stations operating before the International Space Station is de-orbited, which is currently scheduled for 2030.\n\n“He’s very painfully clear,” Davis said. “It comes up almost every time that I see him. Continuous human presence and no gap.”\n\nTo that end, Davis said she has been pressing NASA to accelerate the program to develop private space stations, known as Commercial LEO Destinations, or CLDs. In this program, NASA has previously provided funding to four different companies to develop space station concepts. The CLD program will soon enter “Phase 2,” in which these and other companies will compete for larger amounts of funding—at least hundreds of millions of dollars. One or two companies are likely to win these larger contracts. They will then build their stations with a mix of public and privately raised funding.\n\nTo kick off this competition, NASA is due to issue a long-delayed “request for proposals,” or RFP.\n\n“Earlier today, I was having a briefing with NASA and begging for—we really needed that RFP released for CLDs like nine months ago,” Davis said. “But here we are still begging for it.”\n\nThe program has largely been stuck in neutral over the last year as the space agency’s leadership has been in flux. Interim NASA Administrator Sean Duffy threw a grenade of sorts into the process last August by issuing a new directive that changed the rules for private space stations. This appeared to favor some of the companies over others. But this directive is now being reviewed by new NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman and his team, and the requirements for these stations may well shift again.\n\nThe delays and different directives “added a lot more gray” to the process, Davis said. “It’s not very helpful for these CLDs that are trying to bring on investors,” she added.\n\nGiven that the International Space Station is now scheduled to be decommissioned in fewer than five years, Davis was asked whether Cruz would consider extending the life of the space station beyond 2030. This is a proposal favored by Boeing, which has the contract to operate the station. However, there are serious questions about the viability of the aging station, elements of which are now more than two and a half decades old.\n\n“It’s completely dependent on the development of the CLD platforms,” Davis said of a possible extension. “And that’s not a ding or any sort of a shrouded threat there. You know, these are very highly complicated platforms, and we haven’t had much direction from NASA on it. So to answer the question, maybe. If it starts to look like we’re creeping into a situation where we are not going to have any sort of a platform or capability in LEO for humans, extension is not off the table. The chairman did that last time—it certainly is within his wheelhouse.”\n\nCruz also played a key role in the confirmation process of Isaacman, whose nomination passed through the Commerce Committee. At times, it looked like Cruz was slow-walking the nomination, but Davis said she has liked what she’s seen from NASA’s new leader since he was sworn in to the top job about three weeks ago.\n\n“I have high hopes,” she said. “And I think the way that he’s responded to the Crew 11 situation has been refreshing. It’s clear that he is taking it very seriously, and their communication has been almost in near real-time with us, and very clear and concise. So that has been really lovely. And then it’s clear that he wants to make sure that Artemis II goes off not just as quickly as possible but as safely.”",

    "title": "'Death by a thousand cuts': James Webb Space Telescope figures out how black hole murdered Pablo's Galaxy",
    "description": "\"It points to a slow starvation rather than a single dramatic death blow.\"",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nAstronomers have discovered that a young galaxy was gradually starved by its central supermassive black hole, in what was effectively a cosmic \"death by a thousand cuts.\"\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) studied this unfortunate galaxy, known as GS-10578 or by the slightly snappier nickname \"Pablo's Galaxy\" in honor of the first astronomer to study it in detail. The light from Pablo's Galaxy has taken around 11 billion years to reach us, meaning the JWST and ALMA allow astronomers to see it as it was just 3 billion years after the Big Bang. For such an early galaxy, it is exceptionally massive, containing as much mass as around 200 billion suns.\n\nThe majority of the stars in Pablo's Galaxy seem to have formed between 12.5 billion and 11.5 billion years ago. However, this galaxy seems to have stopped forming stars and has exhausted its supply of star-forming cold gas despite its relatively young age. As astronomers define the cessation of star formation and the transition into quiescence as the \"death\" of a galaxy, that means Pablo's Galaxy \"lived fast and died young.\"\n\nThe team behind this study first released results concerning Pablo's Galaxy back in Sept. 2024, using the JWST alone, finding that the supermassive black hole at its heart is pushing away huge amounts of gas at speeds as great as 2.2 million miles per hour (3.5 million km/h). That's fast enough to allow this star-forming matter to escape the gravitational influence of Pablo's Galaxy entirely.\n\nAdding ALMA, an array of 66 radio telescopes located in the Atacama Desert region of northern Chile, the researchers observed Pablo's Galaxy for a further seven hours searching for carbon monoxide, which they could use as a way to trace cold hydrogen gas, the stuff that forms stars. However, this search turned up empty-handed.\n\nBut this in itself was telling.\n\n\"What surprised us was how much you can learn by not seeing something,\" team member Jan Scholtz from Cambridge University in the UK said in a statement. \"Even with one of ALMA's deepest observations of this kind of galaxy, there was essentially no cold gas left. It points to a slow starvation rather than a single dramatic death blow.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a further 6.5 hours of observations with the JWST revealed that Pablo's Galaxy is losing about 60 suns' worth of mass in gas each year. At that rate, the galaxy's fuel for star formation could have been exhausted in a timescale of between 16 million and 220 million years. If that seems like an incredibly long period of time, consider that scientists normally estimate that it takes as long as a billion years to exhaust their fuel for star-formation in a galaxy such as this.\n\n\"The galaxy looks like a calm, rotating disc,\" team co-leader Francesco D'Eugenio of the Kavli Institute for Cosmology said. \"That tells us it didn't suffer a major, disruptive merger with another galaxy. Yet it stopped forming stars 400 million years ago, while the black hole is yet again active.\n\nThe team reconstructed the star formation history of Pablo's Galaxy, finding that fresh gas has been prevented by the black hole pushing gas outward from falling back into the galaxy. This prevents allowing the \"fuel tanks\" for star birth from being refilled. They also discovered that the supermassive black hole in this young galaxy didn't push away all of its gas at once, but has been experiencing repeated cycles of gas expulsion.\n\n\"So the current black hole activity and the outburst of gas we observed didn't cause the shutdown; instead, repeated episodes likely kept the fuel from coming back,\" D'Eugenio added.\n\nThe team's findings could help to explain why the JWST has been discovering lots of old-looking galaxies in the early universe.\n\n\"You don't need a single cataclysm to stop a galaxy forming stars, just keep the fresh fuel from coming in. Before Webb, these were unheard of,\" Scholtz said. \"Now we know they're more common than we thought — and this starvation effect may be why they live fast and die young.\"\n\nWith the effectiveness of the ALMA/JWST telescope tag-team established, astronomers hope that further observations of Pablo's Galaxy can reveal more about the mechanism used by the supermassive black hole to prematurely starve this galaxy to death.\n\nThe team's research was published on Tuesday (Nov. 25) in the journal Nature Astronomy.",

    "description": "China has broken a record by installing a massive hypergravity machine that can \"compress\" time and space for the benefit of important experiments.",
    "fullText": "After holding onto the record for possessing the world's most powerful centrifuge (or hypergravity machine) for close to three decades, the U.S. ceded that title to China in 2025. When China's new hypergravity machine — the CHIEF1300 — came online in September 2025, it yanked the title from the centrifuge installed in the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center's (ERDC) Centrifuge Research Complex (CRC) located at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The CHIEF1300's (CHIEF is short for Centrifugal Hypergravity and Interdisciplinary Experiment Facility) reign at the top, however, would only last a few months. In December 2025, China commissioned another even more powerful centrifuge, the CHIEF1900, which is currently the world's most powerful centrifuge.\n\nHypergravity centrifuges are machines designed to produce gravitational forces thousands of times stronger than that of the Earth. They do this by rotating at extremely high speeds and, in the process, creating artificial gravity. These machines have been used by agencies like NASA and ESA for various research purposes, ranging from earthquake simulations, dam failures, and the impact of a high gravity environment on living things. In contrast to hypergravity centrifuges, there are also machines that simulate gravity lower than Earth's.\n\nChina on Monday launched the world's largest centrifuge in terms of capacity, capable of generating 300 times Earth's gravity for a load up to 20 tonnes. The machine, coded CHIEF1300, is one of the core components of the Centrifugal Hypergravity and Interdisciplinary Experiment... pic.twitter.com/3ljFrx334o\n\n— China Science (@ChinaScience) September 29, 2025\n\nAs for the claim that these machines compress space and time, it doesn't actually work the way you may have imagined. One of the purposes of these machines is to test small models of huge structures like dams or foundations. Under high gravity, these tiny models feel the same forces a real-world structure would feel, so a small setup behaves like something much larger. Higher gravity also makes slow processes like soil settling or water flow accelerate, so years of real-world behavior can be observed in days or weeks. This is how hypergravity machines can \"compress\" space and time.\n\nThe capacity of large centrifuges is measured using a unit called g·tonnes (gravity-tonnes). A centrifuge that most people use in their daily lives is a typical washing machine, which, during its fastest spin cycle, generates close to 2 g.tonnes of effective force. The long-time record-holding U.S. centrifuge at Vicksburg was rated at 1,200 g·tonnes — already hundreds of times more powerful than anything encountered in everyday life. China's CHIEF1300 pushed that to 1,300 g.tonnes. The current record holder — the CHIEF1900 — takes it much further, and if not evident already, it is rated to generate up to 1,900 g.tonnes of force.\n\nBoth of China's record-breaking hypergravity centrifuges are located at the CHIEF facility, which is part of the Zhejiang University campus in Hangzhou and has been under construction since 2019. The facility is located 49 feet below ground — a move aimed at minimizing vibrations that could be generated while operating these centrifuges.\n\nWhile the CHIEF1900 has just been installed, its predecessor — the CHIEF1300 — has already been used for several experiments. Notable among these is a study that measured the amount of seismic energy a hydropower-focused dam foundation can withstand. Another group of scientists used it to study the effect of large waves on the seabed. These included looking at the impact of 13-foot high wind-driven waves and a massive 65-foot tsunami on the seabed. The aim of this study was to ascertain if the chosen site is a good candidate to install an offshore wind farm. The CHIEF1300 was also able to reproduce the extreme pressure experienced at depths of around 2000 meters (6500 feet) in the ocean.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "Stephen Hutyra was inspired by a Facebook post to build a pub in his backyard. He spent $61,000 and created the space of his dreams.",
    "fullText": "Stephen Hutyra was scrolling Facebook in November 2020 when a post caught his attention.\n\nIt showed a couple in England who'd built a small pub in their backyard. Their design was simple, but inspiring.\n\nThe 42-year-old program analyst, who lives in the small town of West, Texas, immediately started imagining what it'd be like to have his own.\n\n\"We have a saying that everything is bigger and better in Texas,\" he told Business Insider. \"So I wanted our pub to be bigger and better than the one I saw in the picture.\"\n\nHutyra asked his wife if she'd be on board, and as soon as she said yes, he began buying furniture on Facebook Marketplace — despite not having a structure yet.\n\nHe later took out a bank loan, enlisted a contractor, and spent months perfecting his dream space. Now, Hutyra is the proud owner of The Thirsty Goat, a private pub built right in his backyard.\n\nHutyra told Business Insider that he'd joined the Navy right after high school and was first stationed in England. He lived in the seaside town of Newquay, where he'd frequent its various nightlife spots.\n\n\"I fell in love with all the pubs, and walking down the street to hang out with both Navy and local friends I'd made,\" he said. \"I'd really missed that part of my life.\"\n\nSo when he saw a Facebook post about a UK couple building a small pub in their backyard, a lightbulb went off: Hutyra could create his own in his Texas backyard.\n\nFor years, the grassy area had been Hutyra's space to store wood and let the family dogs play.\n\nAs soon as he envisioned a backyard pub, though, he knew the open land was the perfect spot.\n\n\"I almost immediately started making floor plans, buying tables and chairs off Facebook Marketplace, decor off Amazon, and bar items on eBay,\" he said.\n\nHutyra also started to virtually design the future pub. He spent hours on Facebook, Pinterest, and Google, where he found inspiration and added ideas to a PowerPoint presentation.\n\n\"My wife and I were driving back from a vacation in Port Aransas on the Texas coastline, and I said we had to make a pit stop at a bank to sign some loan papers,\" Hutyra said. \"She asked what for, and I said, 'The pub. You gave me your blessing a long time ago.'\"\n\nShe laughed, Hutyra entered the bank, and the couple later left with a $44,320 loan. They also got a permit to build the structure.\n\nA month later, in August 2023, the Hutyras had a contractor on-site who broke ground and began building.\n\nHutyra had never taken on a project of this size, so hiring a contractor was crucial.\n\nHe first paid them $600 to draw actual building construction plans, inspired by the PowerPoint presentation Hutyra had put together.\n\nFrom there, the team helped run vital water and electricity lines, create the pub's concrete base, and craft its shell, framing, and roof. They also added foam insulation.\n\nContractors worked until November 2023, at which point the pub was turned over to Hutyra.\n\nHe got to work with the help of his son and father, who Hutyra described as a master carpenter and overall handyman, to complete the build.\n\nTogether, they installed ceilings, painted walls, stained wood, added shelving, built the pub's bar, and more.\n\n\"I had about three years to plan, so when the time came, I knew where I wanted everything to be,\" Hutyra said. \"I had it planned down to the light switches.\"\n\nWhen you enter the pub, you're greeted by a dark-wood bar with string-light decor and matching stools.\n\nThere are also tables and chairs throughout, televisions above the door, and framed photos around the room.\n\nA chalkboard tells you which drinks are available, and if you visit during the holidays, you'll see glowing Christmas trees.\n\nSimilar to the rest of the bar, the bathroom has dark-wood panelling, framed photo decor, and running water.\n\n\"All the shelving that goes around the top of the pub, I did myself, but the bar was probably the biggest challenge for me,\" Hutyra said. \"I had to make a lot of cuts at different angles, and make sure it was straight and level. It was a lot of work.\"\n\nHutyra has spent 24 years in the Navy and currently serves as a chief petty officer. Naturally, the inspiration behind his pub's name came from his years of service.\n\n\"The goat is kind of like the official mascot for the Navy,\" he said. \"In the earlier days of the service, goats were kept aboard ships to provide fresh meat and milk to the crew. Other livestock didn't fare as well.\"\n\nThe area where the goats were kept was named the Goat Locker, he said, and the phrase has stuck around for more than 200 years. Now, it's the name for the chief's working quarters.\n\nWith that in mind, he named his pub The Thirsty Goat.\n\n\"I've been in the reserves the last 19 years now, and I've traveled the world and seen a lot of different places and things,\" Hutyra said. \"But I've always returned to my hometown. After buying a house here, I've really started to feel that family connection.\"\n\nSo he wanted to feel it in his pub, too. Hutyra has a jar from 1903 that belonged to his great-grandmother, which now sits on his bar as a tip jar. The bar itself also has ties to his ancestors.\n\nAs Hutyra was building his pub, a nearby homestead barn — built and owned by his great-great-great-grandfather around 1880 — was being demolished, so he salvaged some materials.\n\n\"The wood was actually in a remarkable condition,\" Hutyra said. \"I took floorboards from the second-story hayloft, which were under the roof of the barn, so they were out of the rain and weather.\"\n\n\"My father and I brought the wood back to his woodworking shop just across town, a few miles from my childhood home, where he still lives today,\" he added.\n\nTogether, they turned that wood into the top of Hutyra's bar, which is now the focal point of his pub.\n\nHutyra said that he and his wife always dreamed of owning a big house where they could have parties and host friends and family.\n\nNow, their personal pub has become that dream spot.\n\n\"We find ourselves sitting out here in the middle of the week until midnight, or until 2 or 3 a.m. on the weekends with family and friends,\" he said. \"We've thoroughly enjoyed it since finishing back in August, but we're only just starting to see how much we're going to use it.\"",

    "description": "Apple Wallet taking up 4GB on your iPhone? Here’s why it happens, what causes the storage spike, and how you can fix it safely.",
    "fullText": "We use the Wallet app without thinking too much about it. It holds our cards, tickets, and passes, and it usually stays out of the way. You check Settings > General > iPhone Storage and see something that makes no sense: Wallet shows nearly 4GB in Documents and Data. You delete your passes, remove cards, even delete and reinstall the app, but the number stays the same.\n\nIf you feel stuck, you are not alone. People have reported Wallet storage that looks wildly out of proportion to what the app does.\n\nWallet does more than store a few cards. It also holds local files tied to passes and payment features. That storage can add up, especially if something goes wrong.\n\nIn short, you did the right first steps. If Wallet still shows 4GB after a reinstall, you need to force iOS to rebuild whatever Wallet keeps locally.\n\nWork through these in order. You will usually get results before the last step.\n\n1) Restart your iPhone\nA restart sounds basic, but it can flush stuck indexing and temporary caches. After you restart, re-check iPhone Storage to see if Wallet drops.\n\n2) Update iOS, then check storage again\nIf you run an older build, update first. Storage bugs often ride along in iOS releases and Apple fixes them quietly. After the update finishes, give your phone a few minutes on Wi-Fi and power, then check Wallet storage again.\n\n3) Remove Wallet content the “full” way\nEven if you already deleted passes, do a clean sweep:\n\nThen restart again and re-check storage.\n\n4) Sign out of iCloud and sign back in\nThis step often forces iOS apps that sync data to rebuild local databases.\n\nThen check Wallet storage again.\n\n5) Back up, then reset as the “break glass” fix\nIf Wallet still sits at multiple gigabytes, treat it like a system-level storage bug. You see similar behavior in other Apple apps when their Documents and Data gets stuck, and the most reliable fix becomes a full reset after backup.\n\nThis takes longer, but it gives iOS a clean slate. In many “storage won’t clear” cases, it is the only step that truly resets the hidden cache.\n\nA big Wallet number does not automatically mean someone hacked you. People who never use Wallet still see some Wallet storage, and Apple Support forum threads show that small amounts can appear even when you do nothing with the app.\n\nThe issue here is scale. Gigabytes usually mean a stuck cache, a database that never compacts, or a system bug that keeps re-growing the same files.",

NASA is targeting a date no earlier than January 17, with the exact day depending on the weather and on the possible need for additional time to address technical issues.Artemis 2 is the first crewed mission to the moon since the Apollo program’s final flight in 1972. The 10-day mission will have four astronauts on board who’ll be testing if Orion’s critical life support systems can sustain human passengers on future longer duration missions. They will first orbit the Earth twice before making their way 4,700 miles beyond the far side of the moon. If the SLS and Orion system is rolled out as planned, NASA intends to conduct a wet dress rehearsal at the end of January.

    "title": "We run our bakery out of shipping containers. It was an unexpectedly cost-effective solution to scaling our business.",
    "description": "Chrissy Traore and her husband Ben started a bakery in New York. When they needed more space, they turned to shipping containers as the solution.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chrissy Traore, 41, who opened See & Be Kitchen with her husband Ben Salif Traore in Cairo, New York, about 40 miles from Albany, New York. When their business expanded quickly, they began running parts of it out of shipping containers on their property. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBen and I met while I was a chef and he was a baker. We worked at the same restaurant — they had a bakery and a restaurant right next door, and I was their pizza chef and he was their head baker. I had to mix my pizza dough in his mixer and that's kind of how we met.\n\nBefore, I worked on Madison Avenue in marketing and brand strategy, and in 2008, the economy crashed and my job crashed too. When that happened, I moved into food. I took a job on an ice cream truck and just fell in love with food work.\n\nI was in the food industry in various ways in New York City from about 2008 until 2017.\n\nWhile working in the industry, I was unhappy with the way that they treated employees. I was in management at the time, so I could see the full round numbers.\n\nI thought, \"There has to be a better way, but it's not my job to change this business owner or this business.\"\n\nBen and I talked a lot about it, and we were going upstate frequently — I was working at a place upstate as their first chef.\n\nI said, \"We should really move upstate.\" It's more our speed. We like the outdoors. We like having space. The quality of life is better. We love farming and being close to what's happening on the ground, literally. In 2017 we said, let's get out of the city.\n\nWe didn't have a ton of money, and we had to be scrappy and thoughtful about how we deployed the resources that we had saved. We wanted a place where we could live and work, so we wanted property and land — that was important to us.\n\nWe found a property in Cairo, New York, and it had been a bar and a hotel, so it was already grandfathered in on DOH, and had some structures there. We have 11 acres, and the house was practically falling apart, so we could afford it. We paid $189,900, and that was it. We went all in.\n\nWe knew we wanted to open our own place and we were trying to discover what that was. We knew it would involve Ben's bread and my cooking.\n\nWe started renovating the property and doing farmers markets, and that's how we got to know the community that we were in.\n\nWe came in quietly, like, \"Let's see what's already here and get to know people before we just bash them over the head with what we do.\" Let's see what they want, because ultimately we're entering a community that's not necessarily ours yet.\n\nWe were moving from Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn, and part of the reason we moved out was we saw that happening. People were moving in and they would say, \"We need to fix this. This is broken.\" And I'm like, \"What is broken? This is a wonderful community. Please stop.\"\n\nSometime in 2018, we turned into See & Be. Then, from there, we really got some traction at farmers markets.\n\nWe were doing porch pickups — people could pick up their orders at a local massage therapist's house — so we had started operating, but we didn't have a physical space yet.\n\nWe were still building out the cafe in the very small already existing structure on our property. We had one oven, with one proofer, a little cooktop that I would do the sandwiches on, and a coffee station with this beautiful wooden bar that people could sit at. And we opened that in February of 2019. Ben baked everything; I ran the front of house.\n\nWe had a five-year plan and it went into overdrive. Soon, we needed more space, and I could not get a building up fast enough. With traditional buildings, we looked at it and we thought it was going to take a year and a half to two years. We couldn't do that. We needed space like tomorrow.\n\nI had worked for a company while in Brooklyn that was actually my first shipping container job. That was at the DeKalb Market, and it was all built out of shipping containers.\n\nI realized there was no way to get a building through the planning board and everything quickly enough — but I could get a shipping container.\n\nI looked at Ben and I said, \"The fastest way we can do this is to get a shipping container.\" And he said, \"Are you kidding?\" I said, \"No.\"\n\nWe really bootstrapped our business from day one. We had a $10,000 investment in building out the space over time. We costed it out, and we could afford it with what we had already made in the business.\n\nWe got our approval and I was so excited. I posted it on our Facebook page and we got over 4,000 interactions. We couldn't not open.\n\nOur first shipping container was a regular shipping container — a 40' by 20' high cube. We placed it on wooden rail ties, which was not great — those degraded over the years, especially with heavy usage.\n\nWe thought of ourselves as scrappy: \"Well, we did the cafe, we can do this ourselves. So why would I pay to have a spray foam? We'll do that ourselves.\" That was terrible idea.\n\nI think we bought every spray foam insulation canister in a 200-mile radius of here from Home Depot and Lowe's. We didn't know what we were doing. We were just trying to figure it out. The walls were uneven and it worked, but it wasn't a great solution.\n\nThen we pushed out of that shipping container and needed even more space. At that point, we needed more cold storage. I started doing more research into shipping containers and came across decommissioned reefers.\n\nThey're pre-insulated and have steel walls. And unlike a regular shipping container that has a wood floor, this has a steel flat floor. So it's already food-ready.\n\nWe bought the first container for $6,000 painted and delivered. And then we spent another couple thousand dollars in spray foam. God only knows how much the labor was, because we did it ourselves and that took forever.\n\nWe have running water and electric in the containers, but most of the mixing happens in our original building.\n\nThat following year, as our business grew and began to quickly scale, we kept outgrowing our space and needing more and more room. Once we saw how quickly we could get a shipping container in place — about a month — it was easy to go, \"OK, well, gee, trucks can double my space in a month.\"\n\nThe second container was much faster and easier to set up. I bought that directly through a broker at the port. We paid $8,500 for that one.\n\nWhen we installed the second container, we leveled the ground, put in concrete pillars, and the cranes came in and moved the original container and did that whole process. Then, with the third container, it was very easy to attach it because the ground was already graded and leveled.\n\nIt cost about $7,500 to $15,000 per container at the end of the day, because we had to get the crane to get them moved, and we had to get them welded together.\n\nIt's always funny when someone comes up to the building for the first time, and they're just like, \"What is this? Where is the bakery?\" And then they knock on a shipping container door.\n\nPeople are always shook to see that it's a real production. They think we're winging this or pretending because there's these shipping containers. But when you walk in, you forget you're in a shipping container.",

    "description": "\"In fact, at first I was skeptical about the signal as it was too strong to be real.\"",
    "fullText": "While peering into some of the oldest regions of the known universe — dating back to just 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang — an international team of astronomers made a puzzling discovery.\n\nAs detailed in a paper published the journal Nature, they discovered an extremely hot galaxy cluster that’s far hotter and older than current theories allow.\n\nIn other words, the discovered cluster is, under our current best understanding of cosmology, impossible — which could upend our current understanding of how the early universe evolved.\n\n“We didn’t expect to see such a hot cluster atmosphere so early in cosmic history,” said lead author and University of British Columbia PhD candidate Dazhi Zhou in a statement about the finding.\n\n“In fact, at first I was skeptical about the signal as it was too strong to be real,” he added. “But after months of verification, we’ve confirmed this gas is at least five times hotter than predicted, and even hotter and more energetic than what we find in many present-day clusters.”\n\nThe astronomers’ best theory is that the cluster somehow got a massive head start — previously unimaginable even to top thinkers — thanks to black holes lurking at its core.\n\n“This tells us that something in the early universe, likely three recently discovered supermassive black holes in the cluster, were already pumping huge amounts of energy into the surroundings and shaping the young cluster,” added coauthor and Dalhousie University professor Scott Chapman, “much earlier and more strongly than we thought.”\n\nConventional theories suggest that galaxy clusters gain energy as the gases inside are pulled together and squeezed due to intensifying gravitational forces. The latest research, however, suggests there’s more to how these clusters evolve — perhaps even a separate source beyond these gravitational forces.\n\nThe team found the strange readings when they analyzed observations by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Atacama desert in Chile that examined a “baby” galaxy cluster called SPT2349-56.\n\nThe cluster, which dates back to around 12 billion years, is huge: its core alone measures around half a million light-years across. That’s roughly the size of the halo that circles our own Milky Way galaxy, a vast region that contains globular clusters and older stars — yet it spawns stars more than 5,000 times faster.\n\nThe astronomers are hoping to figure out what allowed it to get so incredibly hot, a source of energy that defies our current models. The research suggests galaxy clusters evolve in a far more explosive manner than previously thought, aided by gravitational interactions between multiple supermassive black holes.\n\n“We want to figure out how the intense star formation, the active black holes and this overheated atmosphere interact, and what it tells us about how present galaxy clusters were built,” Zhou explained in the statement. “How can all of this be happening at once in such a young, compact system?”\n\n“Understanding galaxy clusters is the key to understanding the biggest galaxies in the universe,” Chapman said. “These massive galaxies mostly reside in clusters, and their evolution is heavily shaped by the very strong environment of the clusters as they form, including the intracluster medium.”\n\nMore on galaxy clusters: Scientists Intrigued by Bridge of Dark Matter Inside Huge Galaxy Cluster",

    "description": "Taylor Swift's new single \"The Fate of Ophelia\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, joining hits like \"Blank Space\" and \"Anti-Hero.\"",
    "fullText": "Despite writing ubiquitous hits like \"You Belong With Me\" and \"Love Story\" earlier in her career (which peaked at No. 2 and No. 4, respectively), \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" was Swift's first-ever song to top the Hot 100.\n\nThe country-pop crossover smash was released as the lead single from Swift's fourth album, \"Red.\" It rose from No. 72 to No. 1 in its second week of tracking and remained atop the chart for two more weeks.\n\n\"Shake It Off\" was released as the lead single from Swift's fifth album, \"1989.\" It became her first No. 1 debut on the Hot 100.\n\n\"Blank Space,\" the second single from \"1989,\" debuted at No. 18 on the Hot 100.\n\nIt rose to No. 13 before soaring to No. 1 in its third week — dethroning \"Shake It Off\" and making Swift the first woman in history to replace herself in the chart's top spot.\n\n\"Blank Space\" went on to become one of Swift's biggest hits, reigning atop the chart for nearly two months.\n\nDespite mixed reactions from critics, Swift's lead single from \"Reputation\" rose to No. 1 after its first full week of tracking, breaking the weekly streaming record for a song by a woman.\n\nOnce again, Swift's music video broke the record for most views within 24 hours, racking up 43.2 million views in its first day.\n\nSwift announced the arrival of her eighth album, \"Folklore,\" just one day in advance. The second track, \"Cardigan,\" was released at the same time as the album and promoted with a whimsical music video.\n\n\"Folklore\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 while \"Cardigan\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, making Swift the first artist in history to open atop both charts in the same week.\n\nJust five months after \"Folklore,\" Swift repeated her pandemic-era strategy and surprise-released her ninth album, \"Evermore,\" alongside its lead single.\n\nAgain, \"Willow\" debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 while \"Evermore\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\n\"Red (Taylor's Version)\" was the second rerecorded album Swift released. It was accompanied by the long-awaited 10-minute version of \"All Too Well,\" a fan-favorite track from the original album.\n\n\"All Too Well (Taylor's Version)\" was promoted with a self-directed short film and plenty of theories about the song's most likely muse.\n\nIt debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, becoming the longest song in history to top the chart. The record was previously held by Don McLean's \"American Pie (Parts I & II)\" at 8 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\n\"Anti-Hero\" was released alongside Swift's 10th album, \"Midnights,\" and promoted as the lead single.\n\nIt dominated the Hot 100 for eight weeks, surpassing the high-water mark set by \"Blank Space.\"\n\nThe same week that \"Anti-Hero\" debuted at No. 1, Swift became the first and only artist in history to occupy the entire top 10 on the Hot 100. The hit single was flanked by \"Lavender Haze\" (No. 2), \"Maroon\" (No. 3), \"Snow on the Beach\" (No. 4), \"Midnight Rain\" (No. 5), \"Bejeweled\" (No. 6), \"Question...?\" (No. 7), \"You're On Your Own, Kid\" (No. 8), \"Karma\" (No. 9), and \"Vigilante Shit\" (No. 10).\n\n\"Cruel Summer\" was originally released as the second track on Swift's 2019 album \"Lover.\"\n\nAlthough it was identified early as a fan favorite, the song was never promoted as a single and debuted modestly at No. 29 on the Hot 100.\n\nFour years later, Swift transformed \"Cruel Summer\" into a showstopping spectacle on the Eras Tour. Streams of the song began to surge, and it reigned atop Billboard's Pop Airplay chart for two months. Swift's label sent the song to pop radio in June 2023.\n\nFinally, following the release of \"The Cruelest Summer\" EP — which includes a live version of the song and a remix by LP Giobbi — the song reached No. 1 on the Hot 100, marking Swift's milestone 10th chart-topper.\n\n\"Is It Over Now?\" was released as the final vault track on \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" a rerecording of her beloved fifth album.\n\nAlthough it wasn't initially slated as a single, its enthusiastic reception from fans pushed Swift's team to serve the song to pop radio.\n\n\"Is It Over Now?\" debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, dethroning \"Cruel Summer.\" Swift remains the only woman in history to replace herself in the top spot, a feat she's now achieved twice.\n\n\"Fortnight,\" a duet with Post Malone, was released alongside \"The Tortured Poets Department\" and promoted as the album's lead single.\n\nThe song debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 while \"Poets\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\nFor the second time in her career, Swift managed to occupy the entire top 10 of the Hot 100. In fact, the top 14 positions on the chart were occupied by \"Poets\" tracks, including \"Down Bad\" (No. 2) and \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart\" (No. 3), all the way through to \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" (No. 14).\n\n\"Fortnight\" returned to No. 1 on the Hot 100 for a second consecutive week.\n\n\"The Fate of Ophelia\" was released alongside Swift's 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" and promoted as the lead single.\n\nThe Shakespeare-inspired pop song debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, while \"Showgirl\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, breaking a record for the biggest sales week of all time.\n\nAll 12 tracks on the album debuted within the Hot 100's top 12 spots, making Swift the first and only artist to dominate the chart's top 10 on three separate occasions. \"The Fate of Ophelia\" was joined in the top five by \"Opalite\" (No. 2), \"Elizabeth Taylor\" (No. 3), \"Father Figure\" (No. 4), and \"Wood\" (No. 5).\n\n\"The Fate of Ophelia\" remained atop the Hot 100 for eight straight weeks after its release. After falling to lower positions during the holiday season, it returned to No. 1 for its ninth week, surpassing \"Anti-Hero\" as Swift's longest-leading hit to date.",

    "title": "The Space-Saving Tools and Tricks That Made My Tiny Kitchen Usable",
    "description": "It took creativity (and money), but now I can cook in my little kitchen.",
    "fullText": "Last year, one of my New Year's resolutions was to overhaul my apartment and turn it into a cleaner, more comfortable, more organized, and more efficient space. Knowing that a messy space can negatively impact your productivity and overall mental health, I reasoned that this would actually serve the purpose of making me a more efficient, peaceful person, so I took it seriously. One major issue was quickly apparent: My kitchen is tiny, which meant it was disorganized and more or less useless when it came to its primary function, which is to facilitate my cooking. It took some creativity (and money), but I figured out what to do—and now I'm learning to cook and bake better for one of this year's resolutions.\n\nMy kitchen is a little over three feet wide and five feet long. (I live in NYC, where this is the norm.) There is no counter space; all there is along one side is a sink and an oven. The first thing I had to do was manufacture counter space, which I did by adding cubed storage shelving. (I did this years ago, but only truly organized the cubes last year. We're getting to that.) It looks like this:\n\nThe main things I thought of, besides organizing the cubed storage, were how I could better utilize what space I did have, which is why anything and everything possible is now hanging vertically on under-cabinet wine glass racks, utensil holders, or a towel rack, plus hooks all over. What I'm most excited for is the impending delivery of this big peg board, which is going to allow me to hang more utensils and cookware on the wall.\n\nOther, smaller improvements became more obvious to me as I worked through organizing the big stuff. Once I cleared out and designated a suitable spot for my Nespresso, I figured out I needed a vertical, adhesive-backed holder for the pods, since there wasn't enough room in the cubes to hold them in their retail boxes. I finally bought a big ladder so I could actually use my cupboards. I then set about organizing the cupboards with acrylic risers, the same way I organized my perfume and makeup. For the area under the sink, I bought a pull-out shelf to give me easy access to cleaning materials. The boxes containing my various grains and oats were too unwieldy to keep in my cupboards, which led me to a rotating rice dispenser. It went on that way for a while, with me paying tribute to the Amazon gods every few days, but it was all because I had a bigger plan.\n\nYou may not want a giant peg board or need to hang all your spatulas upside-down. Maybe you have lots of drawers. That's cool. You still need a plan for organizing whatever you've got and a plan for figuring out what you, specifically, need.\n\nThroughout the organizing process, I kept a key principle in mind. It's called the Organizational Triangle and it's a set of three rules: Everything needs a place, similar items must be stored together, and for every new thing that comes in, one should go out. I ignored the last rule, for the most part, because what I was bringing in was meant to store what was already there better, but those first two were crucial. Prior to using the OT, not everything had a place. Some bowls and mugs lived in the sink. Not everything was stored together, either, which made it a pain to attempt to cook. By grouping similar items and designating each of them a spot, I could assess the volume of each category, get rid of what I didn't need, and better organize everything. By organizing smaller batches of things that would fit into one cube or on one hanging rack, I ended up organizing the whole thing, big-picture-style.\n\nOther cleaning and organizing techniques, like SIMPLE and Core 4, were also instrumental. Both of these advise that you need containers for your things. Again, this helps you assess actual volume and make sharper decluttering choices, but it also keeps everything neat. I got a little abstract in my interpretation, considering my hanging organizers \"containers,\" but also used boxes and the aforementioned grain dispenser to meet those requirements.",

    "title": "After half a decade, the Russian space station segment stopped leaking",
    "description": "NASA and Roscosmos continue to monitor and investigate the previously observed cracks.\"",
    "fullText": "A small section of the International Space Station that has experienced persistent leaks for years appears to have stopped venting atmosphere into space.\n\nThe leaks were caused by microscopic structural cracks inside the small PrK module on the Russian segment of the space station, which lies between a Progress spacecraft airlock and the Zvezda module. The problem has been a long-running worry for Russian and US operators of the station, especially after the rate of leakage doubled in 2024. This prompted NASA officials to label the leak as a “high likelihood” and “high consequence” risk.\n\nHowever, recently two sources indicated that the leaks have stopped. And NASA has now confirmed this.\n\n“Following additional inspections and sealing activities, the pressure in the transfer tunnel attached to the Zvezda Service Module of the International Space Station, known as the PrK, is holding steady in a stable configuration,” a space agency spokesman, Josh Finch, told Ars. “NASA and Roscosmos continue to monitor and investigate the previously observed cracks for any future changes that may occur.”\n\nFor the better part of half a decade, Russian cosmonauts have been searching for the small leaks like a proverbial needle in a haystack. They would periodically close the hatch leading to the PrK module and then, upon re-opening it, look for tiny accumulations of dust to indicate the leak sites.\n\nThen the Russian cosmonauts would apply a sealant known as Germetall-1 (which has now been patented) to the cracks. They would close the hatch again, monitor the pressure inside the PrK module, and begin the search anew for additional leaks. This process went on for years.\n\nTheir success with the long-running leak problem probably will not prevent new leaks from developing in the decades-old hardware. The Zvezda module was launched a quarter of a century ago, in July 2000, on a Russian Proton rocket. The cracking issue first appeared in 2019, and despite the long-running investigations, its precise cause remains unknown. But this is a nice win in space for both Russia and NASA.\n\nThere is other potential good news on the horizon regarding Russia’s civil space program. This involves the country’s primary launch pad for getting people and cargo to the International Space Station.\n\nThe problems there occurred when a Soyuz rocket launched Roscosmos cosmonauts Sergei Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikayev, as well as NASA astronaut Christopher Williams, on an eight-month mission to the International Space Station in late November. The rocket had no difficulties, but a large mobile platform below the rocket was not properly secured prior to the launch and crashed into the flame trench below, taking the pad offline.\n\nIt is unclear when the pad, Site 31 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, will come back online.\n\nRussia had been targeting a return-to-flight mission in March 2026. NASA now appears to believe that. The US space agency’s internal schedule, which was recently updated, has the next Progress spacecraft launch set for March 22, followed by another Progress mission on April 26. The next Soyuz crewed mission, MS-29, remains scheduled for July 14th. This flight will carry NASA astronaut Anil Menon to the space station.",

    "description": "ALTADENA, Calif. (AP) — “DANGER: Lead Work Area” reads a sign on a front door of an Altadena home.  \"I don’t feel comfortable in the space,” said Nina, whose neighbors' homes burned down across the street.",
    "fullText": "ALTADENA, Calif. (AP) — “DANGER: Lead Work Area” reads a sign on a front door of an Altadena home. “May damage fertility or the unborn child. Causes damage to the central nervous system.”\n\nBlock after block there are reminders that contaminants still linger.\n\nHouse cleaners, hazardous waste workers and homeowners alike come and go wearing masks, respirators, gloves and hazmat suits as they wipe, vacuum and power-wash homes that weren’t burnt to ash.\n\nIt’s been a year of heartbreak and worry since the most destructive wildfires in the Los Angeles area's history scorched neighborhoods and displaced tens of thousands of people. Two wind-whipped blazes that ignited on Jan. 7, 2025, killed at least 31 people and destroyed nearly 17,000 structures, including homes, schools, businesses and places of worship. Rebuilding will take years.\n\nThe disaster has brought another wave of trauma for people afraid of what still lurks inside their homes.\n\nIndoor air quality after wildfires remains understudied, and scientists still don’t know the long-term health impacts of exposure to massive urban fires like last year’s in Los Angeles. But some chemicals released are known to be linked to heart disease and lung issues, and exposure to minerals like magnetite has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nAsh in the area is a toxic soup of incinerated cars, electronics, paints, furniture and every other kind of personal belonging. It can contain pesticides, asbestos, plastics, lead or other heavy metals.\n\nMany with homes still standing are now living with the hazards left by the fires.\n\nPeople forced back into their Altadena homes\n\nNina and Billy Malone considered their home of 20 years a safe haven before smoke, ash and soot seeped inside, leaving behind harmful levels of lead even after professional cleaning. Recent testing found the toxin is still on the wooden floors of their living room and bedroom.\n\nThey were forced to move back home in August anyway, after insurance cut off their rental assistance.\n\nSince then, Nina wakes up almost daily with a sore throat and headaches. Billy had to get an inhaler for his worsening wheezing and congestion. And their bedroom, Nina said, smells “like an ashtray has been sitting around for a long time.\" She worries most about exposure to unregulated contaminants that insurance companies aren't required to test.\n\n\"I don’t feel comfortable in the space,” said Nina, whose neighbors' homes burned down across the street.\n\nData shows dangerous lead levels still in homes\n\nAccording to a report released in November by the Eaton Fire Residents United, a volunteer group formed by residents, six out of 10 homes damaged from smoke from the Eaton Fire still have dangerous levels of cancer-causing asbestos, brain-damaging lead or both. That’s based on self-submitted data from 50 homeowners who have cleaned their homes, with 78% hiring professional cleaners.\n\nOf the 50 homes, 63% have lead levels above the Environmental Protection Agency’s standard, according to the report. The average lead levels were almost 60 times higher than the EPA's rule.\n\nEven after fires were extinguished, volatile organic compounds from smoke, some known to cause cancer, lingered inside of people's homes, according to a recent study. To mitigate these risks, residents returning home should ventilate and filter indoor air by opening windows or running high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers with charcoal filters.\n\nZoe Gonzalez Izquierdo said she can’t get her insurance company to pay for an adequate cleanup of her family's Altadena home, which tested positive for dangerous levels of lead and other toxic compounds.\n\n“They can’t just send a company that’s not certified to just wipe things down so that then we can go back to a still contaminated home,” Gonzalez said, who has children ages 2 and 4.\n\nExperts believe the lead, which can linger in dust on floors and windowsills, comes from burned lead paint. The University of Southern California reported that more than 70% of homes within the Eaton Fire were built before 1979, when lead paint was common.\n\n“For individuals that are pregnant, for young children, it’s particularly important that we do everything we can to eliminate exposure to lead,” said pediatrician Dr. Lisa Patel, executive director for the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and a member of the climate group Science Moms.\n\nThe same goes for asbestos, she added, because there is no safe level of exposure.\n\nPeople who lived in the Pacific Palisades, which was also scorched, face similar challenges.\n\nResidents are at the mercy of their insurance companies, who decide on what they cover and how much. It’s a grueling, constant battle for many. The state’s insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over its handling of fire damage claims.\n\nHomeowners want state agencies to enforce a requirement that insurance companies return a property to pre-fire condition.\n\nJulie Lawson won't take any risks. Her family paid about $7,000 out of pocket to test the soil in their Altadena home, even though their insurance company had already agreed to pay to replace the grass in their front yard. They planned to test for contaminants again once they finished remediating the inside, the process of making a home contaminant-free after a fire. If insurance won't cover it, they'll pay for it themselves.\n\nEven if their home is livable again, they still face other losses — including equity and the community they once had.\n\n“We have to live in the scar,\" she said. “We're all still really struggling.\"\n\nThey will be living in a construction zone for years. “This isn't over for us.”\n\nChallenges and mental health toll\n\nAnnie Barbour with the nonprofit United Policyholders has been helping people navigate the challenges, which include insurance companies resisting to pay for contamination testing and industrial hygienists disagreeing on what to test for.\n\nShe sees the mental health toll it's having on people — and as a survivor herself of the 2017 Tubbs Fire in Northern California, she understands it.\n\nMany were at first joyful to see their houses still standing.\n\n“But they’ve been in their own special kind of hell ever since,” Barbour said.\n\nNow residents like the Malones are inspecting their belongings, one by one, fearing they may have absorbed toxins.\n\nBoxes, bags and bins stuffed with clothes, chinaware and everything in between fill the couple's car, basement, garage and home.\n\nThey have been painstakingly going through their things, assessing what they think can be adequately cleaned. In the process, Nina is cleaning cabinets, drawers, floors and still finding soot and ash. She wears gloves and a respirator, or sometimes just an N-95 mask.\n\nTheir insurance won't pay to retest their home, Billy said, so they're considering paying the $10,000 themselves. And if results show there's still contamination, their insurance company told them they will only pay to clean up toxins that are federally regulated, like lead and asbestos.\n\n“I don't know how you fight that,” said Nina, who is considering therapy to cope with her anxiety. “How do you find that argument to compel an insurance company to pay for something to make yourself safe?”\n\nAP staff writer Alex Veiga contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

    "fullText": "SpaceX is adjusting the orbits of thousands of Starlink satellites weeks after a near-miss with several Chinese satellites.\n\nMichael Nicholls, VP of Starlink engineering at Elon Musk's rocket company, said on Thursday that SpaceX would move around 4,400 Starlink satellites to a lower orbit over the course of 2026.\n\nNicholls wrote in a post on X that the move would reduce the amount of time it takes for defunct satellites to burn up in Earth's atmosphere and reduce the \"likelihood of collision\" with other satellites and space debris.\n\nSpaceX founder Musk weighed in on the move, writing on X that it would also allow Starlink, which uses a constellation of around 9,000 satellites to provide wireless internet in over 150 countries, to serve a \"higher density\" of customers.\n\nEarth's orbit has become increasingly crowded since the beginning of the space age, and it's likely to get even busier as satellite constellations such as Starlink and Amazon's Leo grow.\n\nThe buildup has sparked concerns about the risks of satellite collisions, which could add to the huge amount of debris in orbit.\n\nThe European Space Agency estimates there are around 1.2 million bits of space debris between about 0.4 inches and 4 inches in orbit, all of which are circling the Earth at 17,000 miles per hour and have the potential to cause damage to satellites and crewed space launches.\n\nIn December, SpaceX said that one Starlink satellite had a near miss after nine Chinese satellites came within 650 feet, with Nicholls saying in a post on X that the approach was \"dangerously close.\"\n\nThe rocket company also reported that one of its Starlink satellites exploded last month, releasing a small number of \"trackable low relative velocity objects\" before burning up in orbit.\n\nNicholls wrote on X that the Starlink satellites will be lowered from about 342 miles to about 298 miles above Earth's surface, adding that the amount of space debris and planned satellite constellations was \"significantly lower\" below 311 miles.\n\n\"These actions will further improve the safety of the constellation, particularly with difficult to control risks such as uncoordinated maneuvers and launches by other satellite operators,\" he said.",

Others showed the pinks and greens of the northern lights and what sunrises look like from space.\n\nWhile there are challenges in taking photos from the ISS — the multiple layers of windows, for example, cause reflections that need to be overcome — there are benefits as well.\n\nLarge camera setups, like Pettit's 800-millimeter telephoto lens and solar filter, would be cumbersome in a place with gravity.\n\n\"There are things we can do up here that would make many photographers envious when they're mounting their heavy gear on stout tripods,\" Pettit said.\n\nTake a look at some of the most awe-inspiring images of Earth taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station in 2025.",

In this case, and for these Bitwise ETFs, this means up to 60% in the actual token (like AAVE) and the rest in other ETPs or derivatives that track that token’s price.\n\nThe 11 filings target: Aave (AAVE), Canton (CC), Ethena (ENA), Hyperliquid (HYPE), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Starknet (STRK), Sui (SUI), Bittensor (TAO), Tron (TRX), Uniswap (UNI), and Zcash (ZEC).\n\nThere is no set date. The filings are the first step in a process that requires SEC review and approval, which can take several months and is not guaranteed. The funds would list on NYSE Arca if approved.\n\nRead also: Mirae Asset Group Pursues Major Crypto Foray with $100 Million Korbit Acquisition",

That put SpaceX on alert and LandSpace is now preparing to go public ​to fund its future projects, just as its bigger and far more successful U.S. rival considers an initial public offering of its own.\n\nEven though LandSpace's ‌Zhuque-3 rocket test ended in failure, its aspiration to become second only to SpaceX in reusable rockets is providing a fresh impetus to China's space industry, which has long been dominated by risk-averse, state-owned entities.\n\n\"(SpaceX) ‌can push products to the edge and even into failure, quickly identifying limits and iterating,\" Zhuque-3 chief designer Dai Zheng told state broadcaster CCTV after the rocket's inaugural flight.\n\nDai said his decision in 2016 to join LandSpace and leave the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, the country's main state-owned rocket developer, was partly motivated by SpaceX's focus on reusability and his desire to create a Chinese equivalent.\n\nLandSpace's focus on giving China its own low-cost launch option similar to SpaceX's flight-proven reusable rocket Falcon 9 will play a key role ⁠in Beijing's plans to build up 10,000 satellite constellations in ‌the coming decades.\n\n\"Falcon 9 is a successful configuration that has been tested by engineering,\" Zhuque-3's deputy chief designer Dong Kai said in a podcast interview last week. \"After studying it, we recognize its rationality; this is learning, not imitation.\"\n\n\"Calling (Zhuque-3) a 'Chinese Falcon 9,' I think, is a ‍very high compliment.\"\n\nIts startup culture and mimicking of SpaceX has already initiated a paradigm shift in China's space industry.\n\nChina's state-led space programme has historically been allergic to failed launches, in contrast to SpaceX and other Western firms that regularly broadcast their mishaps.\n\nBut earlier this month, state media covered China's first two failed attempts at recovering a reusable rocket, with the second launch ​coming from a state-owned firm, just three weeks after Zhuque-3's maiden flight.\n\nLandSpace also opened its engine factory floor to Reuters this month, allowing foreign media to take ‌a peek at one of its core assets for the first time.\n\nAfter opening up the space sector to private money in 2014, which spawned several startups including LandSpace, Beijing is now looking to help leading domestic players tap into capital markets by making it easier for them to pursue IPOs.",

    "fullText": "Nino Paoli is a former Dow Jones News Fund news fellow at Fortune.\n\nSam Altman, one of the most powerful leaders in Silicon Valley, is jealous of Gen Z college dropouts.\n\n“I’m envious of the current generation of 20-year-old dropouts,” the OpenAI CEO told Rowan Cheung during an interview at the DevDay conference. “Because the amount of stuff you can build… the opportunity space is so incredibly wide.”\n\nAltman said in the past couple of years he has not had a “real chunk of free mental space” to think about what he’d build now. “But I know that there would be a lot of cool stuff to build,” he said.\n\nAltman dropped out of Stanford University in 2005 after two years of studying computer science. An “unexpected opportunity arose” for 19-year-old Altman, who left Stanford to cofound the location-sharing app Loopt.\n\nAs CEO of the company, Altman helped bring in more than $30 million in funding including from notable VC firms like Sequoia Capital. Loopt went through startup accelerator Y Combinator, and after the app was acquired, he became the president of YC. He later cofounded OpenAI in December 2015 with a slew of people, including the world’s richest man, Elon Musk.\n\nDespite his rise to success with tech startups, Altman said he longs to brainstorm other businesses.\n\n“The degree to which OpenAI is, like, taking over all of my mental space, and I don’t get to go think about how to build a new startup, is a little bit sad,” Altman said.\n\nAltman joins a list of college dropouts that have become tech leaders in Silicon Valley, including Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe tech billionaire also said in August he’s envious of young people because current early-career jobs will look “boring” by comparison to jobs in 10 years’ time.\n\nAs Gen Z is in the midst of a job crisis, higher education is being scrutinized even more as the right path for tech entrepreneurs and startup hopefuls.\n\nIn September, GV CEO David Krane—and employee No. 84 at Google—said his son spent the entire summer break between college semesters working in AI, and was questioning if higher education was a “scam.”\n\nOnly 41% of junior U.S. professionals say a college degree is necessary for career success, according to a new LinkedIn Workforce Confidence survey. And CEOs of big tech companies are echoing similar sentiments.\n\n“There’s going to have to be a reckoning,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Theo Von in a “This Past Weekend” episode in April. “Maybe not everyone needs to go to college,” because there are a lot of jobs that don’t require it, he added.\n\n“People are probably coming around to that opinion a little more now than maybe, like, 10 years ago,” Zuckerberg said.\n\nA version of this story published on Fortune.com on October 8, 2025.",

But it has said the capital-intensive nature of rocket development means it ⁠will need access to China's capital markets if it hopes ​to compete with SpaceX.\n\nThe Shanghai exchange's rules do not state ​that rocket firms must successfully recover a rocket, only that reusable rocket technology be used to put a satellite into orbit, something LandSpace already achieved with this month's launch.\n\nCompanies ‍that undertake national missions ⁠or participate in major state-led space projects will receive priority support, according to the new guidelines, which take effect immediately, underscoring the close alignment between commercial launch activity and China's broader strategic ⁠goals.\n\nChina has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on low-Earth orbit satellites as a national security risk and is actively pushing its own ‌satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the ‌next decades.",

    "description": "While Bill Gates has said the two-day workweek could come within the next decade, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says Gen Alpha college graduates will be too busy planet-hopping.",
    "fullText": "With Gen Z facing existential career crises, billionaire OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that in just 10 years, college grads will be exploring the solar system—jobs that will reel in sky-high salaries. The tech leader even says he’s envious of young people because our early-career jobs will look “boring” by comparison.\n\nAs AI reshapes the workforce, many Gen Z college graduates are finding out the hard way that their degrees don’t guarantee a smooth career launch.\n\nNow, even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman—one of Silicon Valley’s biggest leaders driving the AI revolution—is admitting the elephant in the room is true: AI will wipe out some jobs entirely. However, the tech billionaire insists the coming decade could be the most exciting time in history to start a career, especially for anyone who’s ever dreamed of working in space.\n\nNot only will they be reeling in sky-high salaries, but Altman says they’ll also be “feeling so bad for you and I that we had to do this really boring, old work and everything is just better.”\n\n“In 2035, that graduating college student, if they still go to college at all, could very well be leaving on a mission to explore the solar system on a spaceship in some completely new, exciting, super well-paid, super interesting job,” Altman told video journalist Cleo Abram.\n\nThough it’s unclear how widespread space exploration will expand in the coming years—considering NASA’s broad goal of getting to Mars in the 2030s—aerospace engineers are growing faster than the national average of all jobs, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And they bring home an envy-inducing annual paycheck of over $130,000.\n\nOther tech pioneers have AI predictions that are more grounded on Earth—but still alluring to workers. For example, billionaire Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said that the technology might dramatically reduce the length of the workweek, thanks to humans no longer being needed “for most things.”\n\n“What will jobs be like? Should we just work like two or three days a week?” the tech billionaire told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed that AI has already given his workers “superhuman” skills—something that will only increase as the technology advances.\n\n“I’m surrounded by superhuman people and super intelligence, from my perspective, because they’re the best in the world at what they do. And they do what they do way better than I can do it. And I’m surrounded by thousands of them. Yet it never one day caused me to think, all of a sudden, I’m no longer necessary,” he separately told Cleo Abram on her Huge Conversations podcast series.\n\nWhile Altman admitted that his crystal ball remains foggy—and that the true direction of AI is unclear—he is actually envious of Gen Z professionals starting off their careers: “If I were 22 right now and graduating college, I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history,” he added to Abram.\n\nFortune reached out to OpenAI for comment.\n\nAfter the launch of OpenAI model, GPT-5, Altman declared the world has access to technology equivalent to a “team of PhD-level experts” right in their pocket. And as a result, the CEO said it will be easier than ever for one person to create a business that used to take “hundreds” of people—all it takes is coming up with a great idea and mastering AI tools.\n\n“It is probably possible now to start a company, that is a one-person company that will go on to be worth more than a billion dollars, and more importantly than that, deliver an amazing product and service to the world, and that is like a crazy thing,” he said.\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban has gone even further with his prediction, saying that AI could give Elon Musk a run for his money as the world’s richest person.\n\n“We haven’t seen the best or the craziest of what [AI is] going to be able to do,” Cuban told the High Performance podcast. “And not only do I think it’ll create a trillionaire, but it could be just one dude in the basement. That’s how crazy it could be.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on August 11, 2025.\n\n‘Godmother of AI’ says degrees are less important in hiring than how quickly you can ‘superpower yourself’ with new tools\n\nForget the four-day workweek, Elon Musk predicts you won’t have to work at all in ‘less than 20 years’\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos says ‘millions of people’ will be living in space by 2045—and robots will commute on our behalf to the moon\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "annas-archive.li/blog, 2025-12-20, Discuss on Hacker News\n\nWe backed up Spotify (metadata and music files). It’s distributed in bulk torrents (~300TB), grouped by popularity.\n\nThis release includes the largest publicly available music metadata database with 256 million tracks and 186 million unique ISRCs.\n\nIt’s the world’s first “preservation archive” for music which is fully open (meaning it can easily be mirrored by anyone with enough disk space), with 86 million music files, representing around 99.6% of listens.\n\nAnna’s Archive normally focuses on text (e.g. books and papers). We explained in “The critical window of shadow libraries” that we do this because text has the highest information density. But our mission (preserving humanity’s knowledge and culture) doesn’t distinguish among media types. Sometimes an opportunity comes along outside of text. This is such a case.\n\nA while ago, we discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale. We saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation.\n\nGenerally speaking, music is already fairly well preserved. There are many music enthusiasts in the world who digitized their CD and LP collections, shared them through torrents or other digital means, and meticulously catalogued them.\n\nHowever, these existing efforts have some major issues:\n\nThis Spotify scrape is our humble attempt to start such a “preservation archive” for music. Of course Spotify doesn’t have all the music in the world, but it’s a great start.\n\nBefore we dive into the details of this collection, here is a quick overview:\n\nThe data will be released in different stages on our Torrents page:\n\nFor now this is a torrents-only archive aimed at preservation, but if there is enough interest, we could add downloading of individual files to Anna’s Archive. Please let us know if you’d like this.\n\nPlease help preserve these files:\n\nWith your help, humanity’s musical heritage will be forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts, and other catastrophes.\n\nIn this blog we will analyze the data and look at details of the release. We hope you enjoy.\n\n— Volunteer “ez” of Anna’s Archive team\n\nLet’s dive into the data! Here's some high-level statistics pulled from the metadata:\n\nSpotify has around 256 million tracks.\n\nThe most convenient available way to sort songs on Spotify is using the popularity metric, defined as follows:\n\nThe popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.\n\nGenerally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity.\n\nIf we group songs by popularity, we see that there is an extremely large tail end:\n\n≥70% of songs are ones almost no one ever listens to (stream count < 1000). To see some detail, we can plot this on a logarithmic scale:\n\nThe top 10,000 songs span popularities 70-100. You can view them all in this HTML file (13.8MB gzipped).\n\nAdditionally, we can estimate the number of listens per track and total number per popularity. The stream count data is estimated since it is difficult to fetch at scale, so we sampled it randomly.\n\nAs we can see, most of the listens come from songs with a popularity between 50 and 80, even though there's only 210.000 songs with popularity ≥50, around 0.1% of songs. Note the huge (subjectively estimated) error bar on pop=0 — the reason for this is that Spotify does not publish stream counts for songs with < 1000 streams.\n\nWe can also estimate that the top three songs (as of writing) have a higher total stream count than the bottom 20-100 million songs combined:\n\nNote that the popularity is very time-dependent and not directly translatable into stream counts, so these top songs are basically arbitrary.\n\nWe have archived around 86 million songs from Spotify, ordering by popularity descending. While this only represents 37% of songs, it represents around 99.6% of listens:\n\nPut another way, for any random song a person listens to, there is a 99.6% likelihood that it is part of the archive. We expect this number to be higher if you filter to only human-created songs. Do remember though that the error bar on listens for popularity 0 is large.\n\nFor popularity=0, we ordered tracks by a secondary importance metric based on artist followers and album popularity, and fetched in descending order.\n\nWe have stopped here due to the long tail end with diminishing returns (700TB+ additional storage for minor benefit), as well as the bad quality of songs with popularity=0 (many AI generated, hard to filter).\n\nBefore diving into more fun stats, let’s look at how the collection itself is structured. It’s in two parts: metadata and music files, both of which are distributed through torrents.\n\nThe metadata torrents contain, based on statistical analysis, around 99.9% of artists, albums, tracks. The metadata is published as compact queryable SQLite databases. Care was taken, by doing API response reconstruction, that there is (almost) no data loss in the conversion from the API JSON.\n\nThe metadata for artists, albums, tracks is less than 200 GB compressed. The secondary metadata of audio analysis is 4TB compressed.\n\nWe look at more detail at the structure of the metadata at the end of this blog post.\n\nThe data itself is distributed in the Anna’s Archive Containers (AAC) format. This is a standard which we created a few years ago for distributing files across multiple torrents. It is not to be confused with the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) encoding format.\n\nSince the original files contain zero metadata, as much metadata as possible was added to the OGG files, including title, url, ISRC, UPC, album art, replaygain information, etc. The invalid OGG data packet Spotify prepends to every track file was stripped — it is present in the track_files db.\n\nFor popularity>0, the quality is the original OGG Vorbis at 160kbit/s. Metadata was added without reencoding the audio (and an archive of diff files is available to reconstruct the original files from Spotify).\n\nFor popularity=0, the audio is reencoded to OGG Opus at 75kbit/s — sounding the same to most people, but noticeable to an expert.\n\nThere is a known bug where the REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_PEAK vorbiscomment tag value is a copy-paste of REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_GAIN instead of the correct value for many files.\n\nMany people complain about how Spotify shuffles tracks. Since we have metadata for 99.9+% of tracks on Spotify, we can create a true shuffle across all songs on Spotify!\n\nWe're curious about the peaks at whole minutes (particularly 2:00, 3:00, 4:00). If you know why this is, please let us know!\n\nSome songs, especially popular songs, have 2, 3, or even 20 different versions. We can quantify this by counting number of songs per ISRC:\n\nEach song on Spotify is only available on a specific set of markets. Most songs are available on most markets, but if we filter to popular songs, you can see a difference in availability (without filtering, the graph is almost flat):\n\nSpotify provides a list of genres per artist (not per song). If we count the artists for each genre, we get this result:\n\nSince each genre is very specific, we can also group genres and count the results:\n\nWe can also group artists by popularity. The resulting graph looks very similar to the tracks popularity graph:\n\nThe same graph for albums also looks the same.\n\nIf we group albums by release year, we see that more and more new music is added to Spotify, a lot of it likely automatically generated:\n\nThe amount of procedurally and AI generated content makes it hard to find what is actually valuable.\n\nYou can see that most songs on Spotify are singles, not part of an album.\n\nWe also scraped audio features generated by Spotify. They can be analyzed to find interesting trends.\n\nThis chart contains a lot of information. You can for example see that loudness correlates with energy and that BPM is normally distributed with a mean around 120.\n\nA scrape of the three main APIs of Spotify: artists, albums, tracks. Each track exists in exactly one album, but each track and each album can have multiple artists.\n\nThe tables are an almost lossless representation of Spotify API JSON responses, care was taken during creation by always reconstructing the original JSON based on each inserted row, with minor exceptions.\n\nA scrape of AudioFeatures objects from the Spotify API. One row per track.\n\nA scrape of Playlist objects from the Spotify API. Requires the spotify_clean.sqlite3 database to map track_rowid to track_id.\n\nMost playlists with < 1000 followers were excluded. Completeness unknown.\n\nRow count: 6.6 million playlists with 1.7 billion playlist tracks.\n\nThis is an almost lossless representation of the original Spotify API response. JSON reconstruction was tested during creation of all tables, with minor exceptions. For example, the original response JSON for playlists can be reconstructed with code similar to the following:\n\nThe link between the tracks table in spotify_clean and the actual files we have.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for audiobooks on Spotify. Contains around 700 thousand rows. Incomplete.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for audiobook chapters on Spotify. Contains around 20 million rows. Incomplete.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for shows (podcasts) on Spotify. Contains around 5 million rows. Incomplete.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for (podcast) episodes on Spotify. Contains around 54 million rows. Incomplete.\n\nRedirect responses for the artist endpoint.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for audio analysis on Spotify.\n Contains around 40 million rows, fetched in descending priority order. Many songs do not have an audio analysis (404). Incomplete.\n\nAlbum art files. Correspond to last part of url from album_images. Indexed into directories with filename prefixes (after stripping the first 16 chars from the filename).",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan's space agency said its H3 rocket carrying a navigation satellite failed to put the payload into a planned orbit, a setback for the country's new flagship rocket and its space launch program.\n\nMonday's failure is the second for Japan's new flagship rocket after its botched 2023 debut flight and six successful flights.\n\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency said the H3 rocket carrying the Michibiki 5 satellite took off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a southwestern Japanese island Monday as part of Japan's plans to have a more precise location positioning system of its own.\n\nThe rocket's second-stage engine burn unexpectedly had a premature cutoff and a subsequent separation of the satellite from the rocket could not be confirmed, Masashi Okada, a JAXA executive and launch director, told a news conference.\n\nWhether the satellite was released into space or where it ended up is unknown, and that JAXA is investigating the data to determine the cause and other details, Okada said.\n\nJun Kondo, an official at the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, told reporters that the failure was “extremely regrettable” and that the government set up a task force to investigate the cause and take necessary measures as soon as possible to “regain credibility.”\n\nMonday's failure is a setback for Japan's new flagship that replaced the earlier mainstay H-2A which had near-perfect success record. It also delays Japan’s satellite launch plans, including one to have a more independent geolocation system for smartphones, maritime navigation and drones without relying on the U.S. GPS system.\n\nThe H3 rocket is designed to be more cost-competitive in the global space market. Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security.\n\nJAXA's H3 project manager, Makoto Arita, said the new flagship is still in the early stages of operation but can be globally competitive. “We will pull ourselves together so that we won't fall behind rivals. We'll fully investigate the cause and put H3 back on track.”\n\nMonday's launch came five days after JAXA aborted just 17 seconds before liftoff, citing an abnormality of a water spray system at the launch facility, following an earlier problem with the rocket.\n\nIn its debut flight in March 2023, H3 failed to ignite the second-stage engine.\n\nJapan currently has the quasi-zenith satellite system, or QZSS, with five satellites for a regional navigation system that first went into operation in 2018. The Michibiki 5 was to be the sixth of its network.\n\nJapan currently relies partially on American GPS and wants to have a seven-satellite network system by March 2026 and an 11-satellite network by the late 2030s.",

    "fullText": "Rising meat prices have wreaked havoc on the barbecue space.\n\nMany restaurants have the option of leaning more heavily on fish or chicken, maybe even pastas and vegetarian options, when meat prices climb. That's not something barbecue eateries can do because while they may serve chicken and fish, beef and pork are the stars of the show.\n\nOmaha Steaks CEO Nate Rempe said the nation’s shrinking cattle supply and record demand are driving a \"$10-per-pound reality\" that could stretch family budgets for years.\n\n\"We are headed for what I'm calling…the $10-a-pound reality. By [the] third quarter of '26, families are gonna see $10 a pound [for] ground beef in the grocery store. So we're in for a bit of a haul here,\" Omaha Steaks’ CEO Nate Rempe told Fox Business. \"I don't believe we'll see price[s] come down in any meaningful way until sometime in 2027.\"\n\nGround beef did not reach those levels, but beef prices are up.\n\nThe FAO Food Price Index, which serves as a global benchmark for food commodity prices, averaged 130.1 points in July, a 1.6% increase from June, FAO said.\n\nFAO's meat price index hit a new all-time high of 127.3 points, up 1.2% from its previous peak in June, as strong import demand from China and the United States boosted beef and sheep meat prices, the agency said.\n\n\"U.S. beef imports have climbed after drought led to a decline in the domestic cattle herd. China shipped in record amounts of beef last year amid growing popularity of the meat,\" Reuters reported.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics reports show rising beef prices as well.\n\nKey auto parts and services company files Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nKey travel brand files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nSelf-driving-car company files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection\n\n35-year-old consumer company files Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\n\"Drastically declining cattle inventories have made ground beef retail prices in the U.S. 13% dearer August 2025 than a year back,\" according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report. \"By August, prices of steak and minced beef had surged by 16.6% and 12.8%, respectively, year-on-year (YoY).\"\n\nSome experts think the worst is yet to come.\n\n“As high as prices are, I still think the risk is for prices to go up instead of down,” Michael Irgang, president and owner of Global Risk Management, a firm specializing in commodity risk management for the food and agribusiness industries, told Meat and Poultry. “It’s a perfect storm of a bunch of different things coming together at the exact same time.”\n\nThat adds to the woes of barbecue chains already facing struggling consumers, increased labor costs, and an overall challenging operating market. Taken together, all of these issues have factored in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing from Smoke Ring, LLC, which operates restaurants under the Ray Ray’s, Ray Ray’s Hog Pit, and Ray Ray’s Ohio Style brand names.",

    "description": "This tech giant's early entry into the AI space has helped it build a substantial revenue backlog that could propel its shares higher in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft's stock needs to appreciate by 41% from current levels to achieve a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nThe company's AI tools are gaining terrific traction in the productivity space, while its cloud business is also booming.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush expects Microsoft to become a $5 trillion company next year, and it won't be surprising to see the company indeed hitting that milestone.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly became the first company to cross a $5 trillion market cap just a couple of months ago, driven by the company's remarkable revenue and earnings growth on account of its dominance of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\n\nHowever, the share price of the chip giant has pulled back since then, even though it continues to maintain terrific growth despite its massive size. Concerns about the AI boom becoming a bubble and the sustainability of the heavy infrastructure spending that has driven Nvidia's phenomenal growth over the past three years have begun to weigh on the stock.\n\nBut there's another company -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- that's making the most of the proliferation of AI. One analyst believes that this \"Magnificent Seven\" company could hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2026. Let's take a closer look at Microsoft's prospects and why it could hit the $5 trillion market cap milestone in the new year.\n\nThere is no denying that Nvidia's chips have played a crucial role in the widespread adoption of AI technology. However, the computing power provided by its chips is eventually harnessed to create customer-facing solutions. For example, training OpenAI's ChatGPT wouldn't have been possible without Nvidia's chips, but the chatbot became popular because of what it was doing for users.\n\nFrom helping users write emails to creating images to drafting documents and writing code, ChatGPT's versatility and productivity have been the key reasons behind its raging success. Not surprisingly, ChatGPT parent OpenAI points out that it now has more than 1 million paying enterprise customers, while more than 800 million users use ChatGPT every week.\n\nMicrosoft made a smart move in 2019 by investing in OpenAI. It still holds a 27% stake in OpenAI, a company reportedly worth $500 billion. However, more than the financial aspect, OpenAI provided Microsoft with access to large language models (LLMs) and applications, enabling it to build a wide portfolio of AI-powered tools and deploy them across its offerings.",

    "description": "\"The forces that are needed to dislodge such a massive black hole from its home are enormous.\"",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nAstronomers have made a truly mind-boggling discovery using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST): a runaway black hole 10 million times larger than the sun, rocketing through space at a staggering 2.2 million miles per hour (1,000 kilometers per second).\n\nThat not only makes this the first confirmed runaway supermassive black hole, but this object is also one of the fastest-moving bodies ever detected, rocketing through its home, a pair of galaxies named the \"Cosmic Owl,\" at 3,000 times the speed of sound at sea level here on Earth. If that isn't astounding enough, the black hole is pushing forward a literal galaxy-sized \"bow-shock\" of matter in front of it, while simultaneously dragging a 200,000 light-year-long tail behind it, within which gas is accumulating and triggering star formation.\n\n\"It boggles the mind!\" discovery team leader Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University told Space.com. \"The forces that are needed to dislodge such a massive black hole from its home are enormous. And yet, it was predicted that such escapes should occur!\"\n\nSupermassive black holes, which can reach masses billions of times that of the sun, are usually found at the hearts of their home galaxies, which they dominate with their immense gravity. The incredible speed of this supermassive black hole means it is around 230,000 light-years from its point of origin.\n\n\"This is the only black hole that has been found far away from its former home,\" van Dokkum said. \"That made it the best candidate [for a] runaway supermassive black hole, but what was missing was confirmation. All we really had was a streak that was difficult to explain in any other way. With the JWST, we have now confirmed that there is indeed a black hole at the tip of the streak, and that it is speeding away from its former host.\"\n\nThis now-confirmed runaway supermassive black hole was first identified by van Dokkum and colleagues back in 2023 using the Hubble Space Telescope, which spotted what appeared to be the wake of a massive body passing through space. Of course, like all black holes, this runaway is bounded by a one-way light-trapping surface called an event horizon, making it difficult to spot.\n\n\"The black hole is, well, black - and is very difficult to detect when it is moving through empty space. The reason why we spotted the object is because of the impact that the passage of the black hole has on its surroundings: we now know that it drives a shock wave in the gas that is moving through, and it is this shock wave, and the wake of the shock wave behind the black hole, that we see,\" van Dokkum said. \"With the JWST, we discovered the huge displacement of the gas at the tip of the wake, where the black hole is pushing against it. The shock signatures are crystal clear, and there is just no doubt about what is happening here.\" The gas is pushed sideways away from the supermassive black hole at a velocity of hundreds of thousands of miles per hour (hundreds of km per second), a dynamical signature that the team saw with JWST.\n\n\"The velocity of the displaced gas is directly related to the velocity of the black hole, and this is how we determined the black hole's velocity from the JWST data,\" van Dokkum said. \"It is moving at approximately 1000 km per second, faster than just about any other object in the universe. It is this high speed that enabled the black hole to escape the gravitational force of its former home.\"\n\nvan Dokkum explained that two possible mechanisms could lead to a supermassive black hole being ejected from the heart of its own galaxy. Both scenarios begin when two galaxies collide and begin to merge, each bringing to the cosmic smash its own supermassive black hole. Both mechanisms are initiated when the supermassive black holes reach the center of the newly formed galaxy.\n\n\"The first mechanism is that the two black holes merge with each other, and that the gravitational radiation [gravitational waves] released in that merger imparts a powerful kick to the newly formed black hole. That kick could impart a speed of 1,000 km/s, enough to eject the black hole,\" van Dokkum said. \"The second is a three-body interaction. That happens when one of the two galaxies had a pair of binary black holes at its center. When a third black hole enters the binary system, it becomes unstable, and one of the three black holes will get kicked out of the system.\"\n\nThe team believes that it is the first scenario that accounts for the runaway supermassive black hole in this instance. That would lead to a galaxy lacking a supermassive black hole at its center, which van Dokkum said is unlikely to impact said galaxy very much. However, this runaway supermassive black hole could have a huge impact on any other galaxy it encounters as it rockets through space.\n\n\"An encounter with another galaxy would be quite spectacular, mostly because of the huge, galaxy-sized shock wave that precedes the black hole,\" van Dokkum continued. \"When this shock wave encounters the dense gas of another galaxy, it would compress and shock that gas and likely form a lot of new stars. It would be quite the show!\"\n\nFortunately, the two-ring galaxies that comprise the Cosmic Owl are located around 9 billion light-years away, meaning even if this runaway cosmic titan were headed our way, we don't ever need to worry about it reaching us.\n\nMergers between galaxies are common, occurring multiple times over the lifetime of a single galaxy. That means that ejected supermassive black holes may also be quite common, though population numbers vary based on how these collisions are modelled.\n\n\"Mergers happen often in the life of a galaxy; each galaxy with the size and mass of the Milky Way has experienced several during its lifetime. So black hole binaries should form pretty regularly. What we don't know is how quickly these binaries merge, if at all, and how often the resulting kick removes a black hole,\" van Dokkum said. \"My view is empirical: now that we know how to look for them, we can find other examples - and then we can answer the question directly from data, by counting the number of escapes. The big thing is that black hole escapes lived purely in the realm of theory until now.\"Even though runaway supermassive black holes had been predicted by theory long before this discovery confirmed their existence, that doesn't mean these findings didn't deliver some unexpected twists.\n\n\"Everything about this research surprised me! I never expected to see such a thing, and confirming it with JWST was just incredible,\" van Dokkum said. \"What we also had not quite appreciated is how much impact these escaping black holes have on the gas that they are moving through. In the wake, many new stars have formed from the shocked gas, about 100 million times the mass of the sun. This mode of star formation was unknown before, and it leads to a trail of stars far away from the galaxy, seemingly formed in empty space.\"\n\nThe Yale University researcher explained that the obvious next step for the team will be to search for more examples of runway black holes.\n\n\"You need space-based imaging to see them: the wake stood out to us because it is such a thin streak, and in ground-based images, it would be blurred beyond recognition,\" van Dokkum explained. \"Fortunately, wide-field Hubble-quality imaging is just around the corner, thanks to the Roman Space Telescope, and, slightly blurrier, Euclid. Using machine learning algorithms to find thin streaks in the Roman data will be a cool project!\"\n\nThe team's research has been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Letters and is currently available as a pre-peer-reviewed paper on arXiv.",

He's also the author of The Space Economy. Good to see you.\n\nSo, I'm so curious about SpaceX and kind of like whether it sucks the air out of the room for other types of space investment or creates more of a halo effect for space investment.\n\nI think it's definitely the ladder. Um this is really exciting news. It's still uncertain, but we'll see what happens. But if they do, I mean, this is, I think this is going to um uh set a new benchmark. It's going to reprice um a lot of assets throughout the category. I think it's going to show what can be done. And I think it's going to kick off a wave of new listings. So this could be really exciting. And then from our perspective as private market investors in early companies, uh we're really excited to see what happens when these founders get some liquidity, who own stock options and shares, and they go on now and they're freed from the shackles of working at um big companies, they can go and, you know, um think about what they want to do, start their own thing. So we expect that this is going to um uh increase the SpaceX mafia. I mean, a few years ago it was, you know, we were tracking 45 companies or something like that of SpaceX alumni that had gone on and done founded new companies. It's now up to, I don't know, closer to 200, and we'll see what happens with with this um uh liquidity event. But for us, I mean, this is um uh SpaceX is the Apex player. They're 10 years ahead of anybody else. They've been setting the benchmark all along. Uh now this sort of moment, um we'll see what happens, but it could really catalyze a lot of activity.\n\nI mean, on the flip side, if they are so far ahead of everyone else, and then their numbers are public, does that then um mean that some of the other players, particularly in the public markets who also their numbers are public, like that that they're disadvantaged if they're not in the same place as SpaceX is.\n\nHmm, well, that's um that's a really interesting point. So I think SpaceX has stayed private for so long and they've been so in demand. Um, uh this is the hottest stock in the private markets. Everyone is vying to get access to SpaceX. Um and I think it's really sort of difficult, um when you've got that much interest and that many investors, um to sort of keep things quiet. So, you know, you see throughout the the the news that there's a lot of information that's out there\n\non what their performance looks like, right? So um it's no um so that sort of cat's out of the bag already.\n\nSo it wouldn't necessarily change the dynamic.\n\nYeah, I think so. And so you see like um what are the numbers, you know, um uh 13 last year, 15 this year. You start to think like the the growth is not parabolic um in uh uh their their growth is not parabolic. They but they are cash flow positive and they've been buying back shares, right? So I think what um this would do is really give them sort of uh a large cash infusion to go after some of their long-term missions to get to Mars, to um uh build data centers in orbit, uh to fund that and really have a big cash infusion to basically speed things up and go faster.\n\nUm and one of those is also what Starship is one of the projects that they're working on. Um so how important is that and what what's the timeline for something like that?\n\nSuper important. So Starship is a next generation massive vehicle. Um we've never had anything of this size. So if 2025 was the year of launch frequency, we were basically, we started launching, we launched almost every day, one launch per day, right? And that launch cadence is increasing. 2026 is going to be about mass. Um Starship is a massive vehicle. It is going to be fully reusable, which means that both the first stage of the rocket and the second stage both can land and be refueled and stacked and launched again. More like operational commercial airlines, which is really exciting because that is going to um it promises to deliver another step change in the order of magnitude, further reduction in launch cost, which really um will do a lot to again, to the halo effect, you know, comment to really stimulate growth in in this category. Um but at the same time, that vehicle is is necessary to launch these next generation Starlink satellites, the V3 satellites that they already um that they have already designed and they're just waiting for a vehicle that can carry them. Their data centers in orbit that they're now talking about in conjunction with this um potential IPO, uh requires Starship to be able to launch these things, right? So, this um is uh a lynchpin. It's it's critical to their strategy and it's also um critical um to to take the space economy to the next level.\n\nUm another thing that you're watching closely going into next year is what? geo intelligence and defense. Those are kind of some themes within space. So what should we be watching for there?\n\nYeah, I kind of just thinking about the convergence of AI and space in totality, right? So we talked a little bit about orbital data centers. Everyone seems to be talking about that now. Um Starship is and and Blue Origin's next generation vehicles too are going to allow us to launch new infrastructure that, you know, we couldn't do before like orbital data centers and some other things. So that's really interesting on the AI front. And also, um with regards to, you know, geospatial intelligence. So, um if GPS is the dot on the map, geospatial intelligence is the map. This is um uh digital information layered on top of the physical world. A lot of that comes from the global intelligence comes from satellites, um and different sensor types that are feeding into this really robust rich data set about what's going on on the surface of our planet. That's too much data for humans to comb through. So, um uh AI has come along at just the right time to basically help us parse through that and make sense of that, drive useful insights from that. And this is a huge area of growth. We're seeing um what what we call world models. So, everyone's familiar with LLMs and what's going on there, but those aren't really good at helping us to understand and navigate the physical world. So there's a lot of work going on right now um in geospatial embeddings, basically embedding the data to have the right geospatial information, coordinates, positioning data, rich layers of of data to basically help you now use AI to make sense of the physical world, right? Not just language. So, this is a huge area of opportunity. Um a lot of demand is being driven by defense and intelligence communities, but then also there's massive consumer and enterprise applications as well.\n\nVery cool. All right, Chad, we got to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.",

    "description": "At a companywide meeting at xAI's San Francisco headquarters, Musk discussed the company's future, its finances, and data centers in space.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk appears to be feeling upbeat about the future of his AI company.\n\nAt a companywide meeting at xAI's San Francisco headquarters last week, Musk told staff that if the company could survive the next two to three years, xAI would triumph over its competitors, several sources with knowledge of the meeting said.\n\nThe xAI CEO said that the company's ability to rapidly scale its power and data capacity would be a key ingredient in the race to achieve superintelligence — which surpasses human intelligence — and become the most powerful AI company.\n\nMusk said that xAI could achieve artificial general intelligence, which matches or exceeds human intelligence, in the next few years, even as soon as 2026, sources said.\n\nMusk said in November that xAI had a 10% likelihood of achieving AGI with its Grok 5 model, which he has said the company plans to release early next year.\n\nThe CEO also told staff that xAI would have an advantage over other AI companies because it would have access to around $20 billion to $30 billion in funding per year, and it could benefit from its proximity to his other companies, sources said. Tesla integrated Grok into its vehicles earlier this year.\n\nOverall, workers said Musk appeared happy with the company's progress. One insider described the meeting as \"peppy.\"\n\nMusk also theorized about building data centers in space and his plans to colonize Mars, the sources said. He said that Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot could eventually man such extraterrestrial data centers, the people said.\n\nMusk has previously said that Optimus could provide support for SpaceX missions as soon as next year. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have publicly talked about the possibility of building data centers in space, though Pichai acknowledged that it is a \"moonshot.\"\n\nIn response to Business Insider's request for a comment, the company responded with an automated message: \"Legacy Media Lies.\"\n\nOver the past year, xAI has rapidly expanded the footprint of its data centers, a project it has named Colossus. Earlier this year, the company said it had around 200,000 GPUs, and Musk has said it plans to expand to 1 million GPUs.\n\nxAI is one of many companies racing to build AGI and justify valuations worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Despite Musk's outsize profile, xAI is still a relatively new player in a race dominated by giants like OpenAI and Google.\n\nThe AI race shows no signs of slowing down. Earlier this month, OpenAI entered a state of emergency as it raced to push out its latest model, according to reports. Google released a new Gemini model in November, and xAI has pushed new versions of Grok in rapid succession.\n\nDuring the all-hands, xAI leads demonstrated several updates to existing products, such as Grok Voice, the company's app for Tesla owners, and its agents, sources said. Some of the updates included improvements to Grok's ability to predict outcomes, better listening functions for Grok voice, and video editing, the people said.\n\nDo you work at xAI or have a tip?

    "description": "Companies like AT&T, Amazon, JPMorgan, and Instagram have a RTO problem: there's not enough places for workers to sit.",
    "fullText": "Your mileage may vary on Instagram's recent corporate culture updates (to the extent you care at all). Fewer meetings: excellent. Faster decisions: great. Return-to-office five days a week: woof, but such is life. Return-to-office five days a week when there aren't enough places for people to sit: What??? At least Instagram chief Adam Mosseri is aware of the issue — in a memo to staff, he said New York employees get a pass on the butts-in-seats mandate until the company figures out where all those butts will go. The timeline is TBD.\n\nAfter the pandemic-driven wave of remote work, many employees are being dragged, kicking and screaming, back into the office. For workers at companies such as Amazon, JPMorgan, and Starbucks, the perpetual workday-in-your-pajamas party is over. The odd wrinkle is that in some cases, it's not just employees who aren't ready to be back at work every day. Their employers aren't ready for it, either, at least logistically. They're telling people to come to the office without having the actual space for them to be there. So, workers are competing for desks, setting up shop in common areas, or refusing to show up altogether until their employers have a more well-thought-out plan. It's emblematic of the broader issues surrounding RTO mandates: Many companies are implementing them without a solid logic as to how or why and alienating their employees — intentionally or not — in the process.\n\nMultiple big-name companies have had some small-time whoopsie daisies on back-to-office space constraints.\n\nIn late 2024, AT&T acknowledged in a memo to employees that they would not offer \"one-for-one seating per employee\" as they were called back in. At the time, employees told Business Insider that workers were filling up hallways or hanging out in the cafeteria in order to check the attendance box. Around the same time, Amazon wound up delaying its RTO ask for some employees because their spots weren't ready. Not only were there not enough desks, but workers also complained that offices and meeting rooms were lacking in chairs.\n\nEarlier this year, JPMorgan employees required to come back found themselves in a sort of Hunger Games situation for spots, showing up extra early and leaving behind possessions to mark their spots and signing on from vacation to try to book scarce desk space. On Reddit, some employees described the situation as \"pure chaos,\" and complained of being unable to accomplish work because \"half the morning is spent on desk f***ery.\" One JPMorgan employee told me that they often find themselves seated far away from the rest of their team because someone else reserved their regular spot, and there are often lines for the women's bathroom at the New York office where they work.\n\nHow much office space is needed and what to do with it is a perpetual conundrum. Just look at all the hate for open-office floor plans. But the pandemic added more complications to an already complicated situation. As the RTO wave has picked up momentum, space has become a significant issue at many companies, both large and small, including giant federal agencies. So what gives?\n\nSome of it is simply a result of poor planning, explains Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work. Decisions are made at the executive level without proper consultation with facilities personnel, who have detailed information on desks and seating. \"It's not as easy as adding up people and comparing to desks, as it matters which cities and offices they are in,\" he says in an email. \"Kind of like airlines that some flights may be overbooked and others half-empty.\"\n\nSome of the shortages may be on purpose. Strict RTO mandates are often viewed, at least in part, as a soft layoff — companies expect some level of attrition when they force people back, even if they won't openly admit it. \"Having insufficient seating is all part of the plan,\" Bloom says. \"If you want a 10% head count reduction, you only need seating for 90% of the folks.\"\n\nBrian Elliott, the CEO of Work Forward, a future of work think tank and consultancy, says that when executives started to think about bringing people back to the office in about 2021, many were surprised to learn how low the percentage of their workforce actually showing up on a given day had been pre-2020, because of sick time, vacations, workers visiting customers, etc. \"So your average CFO looks at this and goes, 'It's a 60% utilized asset on average. Why am I doing assigned seating? Why not go to hoteling and hot desking?'\" Elliott says. Add in the belief that at least some sort of remote work would stick around (especially as companies offered it as a perk to attract workers in a tight labor market), and many companies decided to downsize their overall office footprint to save some cash. Now, as businesses decide they want everyone back in full-time, they're realizing they axed too many desks.\n\nSome companies are moving in the other direction, and are on the hunt for more spacious offices. But that process takes time, and economic uncertainty has leaders nervous to go too big. Commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE says economic jitters, high interest rates, and slow growth in in-person jobs has been somewhat of a drag on office leasing activity this year, but the overall trend is up: A growing majority of its office occupants expect to maintain or expand their space over the next three years, while the share anticipating downsizing is steadily decreasing.\n\n\"Companies are taking more spaces, so clearly, they are very comfortable in expansionary mode,\" says Henry Chin, global head of research at CBRE.\n\nThat doesn't mean employees should expect to be drowning in spacious offices anytime soon — businesses are driving toward higher people-to-desk ratios, not lower. So instead of a single assigned desk for every person, there are multiple people sharing. Per CBRE, the most common ratio today is 1-1.49 employees per seat, and the plan is to up it. \"Ultimately, they want to have the higher ratio, that two or three people share a desk,\" Chin says.\n\nIn other words, however you feel about hotel desking, you might want to get used to it.\n\nThe RTO battle in America is proving to be quite the push-and-pull. Remote work is falling, but it hasn't gone away: According to Bloom's tracker, about 25% of work is being done from home in the US, compared to 62% in the spring of 2020, the height of the pandemic, and well under 10% prior to the lockdowns. And just because companies ask workers to come back doesn't mean they're all complying — there's a delta between what employers are asking, and employees are giving, RTO-wise. As the job market weakens, employees may be inclined to give in and commute more. You want your boss to see you enough that they at least feel a little guilty when they fire you.\n\nThese space-related headaches are reflective of broader questions about where and how it's best for people to work, and what sort of planning needs to be put into it. Some executives seem to be knee-jerk demanding people come back in without considering whether that's how their teams work best, or whether the infrastructure can handle it. A five-day-a-week office mandate isn't super helpful if teams are located all over the country and everyone's just sitting on video calls all day. Some companies are discovering they need more small meeting rooms, not just a few large ones, so people can gather if they are in the same place. And some are falling short on basic blocking and tackling — having working WiFi, or supplying sufficient monitors and equipment. In the internet age, it's a little tough to get work done when you don't have the internet itself, or a keyboard or a mouse.\n\nEmployers may be \"conflating productivity and effectiveness with proximity\" in insisting people show up full-time, explains Melissa Daimler, a corporate culture consultant. \"If I can see you and I know that you're working, then I feel good about how productive we are as a company.\" Much of the issue comes down to trust — businesses feeling confident that their people will get the work done when they're in the office collaborating and when they're at home for the day. \"It takes an extra kind of set of planning skills and a system that you put in place as a company and a team,\" she says.\n\nThe space problem is one that companies should fix, whether they actually will is another question. Your employees aren't going to love the return of long commutes and sad salad desk lunches, whatever you do, but they're probably going to be even more annoyed if, at the end of that commute, they find themselves eating that sad salad on the floor in the hallway, seated next to their laptop.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "Sol Rashidi worked in the AI space for 15 years, and said it's important to make a conscious effort not to outsource your thinking.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sol Rashidi, a former tech executive at IBM, AWS, and Estée Lauder, who is based in Miami. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn the last 15 years, I have built and scaled AI capabilities, and I have over 200 deployments under my belt.\n\nI went from being an individual practitioner to running IBM's enterprise data management practice. I was the chief data officer at Sony Music, the chief analytics officer at Estée Lauder, and the head of technology for AWS's startup division in North America.\n\nAll my experiences from 2011 on have led me to realize there's a real chance people will develop a codependency on AI. So I'm focused on workforce preparation and educating the masses.\n\nNow I have my own company where I'm working on solving the problem of AI in the workforce by teaching enterprises how to prepare their workforce for the future, and how to use AI and automation to amplify the workforce instead of eliminating it. If you're going to use AI in your day-to-day, great — but you have to be conscientious, to outsource tasks and not your critical thinking. You need to avoid intellectual atrophy.\n\nIntellectual atrophy is when you lose your cognitive ability to think critically because you're outsourcing that thinking to tech. Just like our muscles atrophy if we don't use them, so does our brain. The big thing that you've got to be careful of is making sure that generative AI doesn't make your thinking become generic, because everyone else is also using ChatGPT. You maintain your edge by using cognitive power.\n\nAs an individual, I use six to eight AI tools every day. I use AI a lot for data processing, so I can think about the patterns and insights and, from there, observe and spotlight frameworks and models.\n\nBut when using the tools, I always ask myself, \"Am I using this to accelerate work I have to do, or am I using it to do the work for me?\" It needs to accelerate the work so that the thinking is left to me. \"This is making me faster, but is it making me more capable? This is making me more productive, but is this making me more valuable?\" I use the tools to expedite and facilitate versus doing the work for me.\n\nPart of what I do is communication, and I don't ever want to lose that edge. I don't use AI to write emails, keynotes, or personal interactions.\n\nIt's really important for me to be able to understand whether or not what I'm communicating is being perceived in the way I intended. That takes practice. Anything that comes from the heart or mind has to be sincere, expressive, and communicate the right messaging. It has to be organically generated by me — no exceptions.\n\nWe live in a society right now that values convenience over competition and speed over substance. But the key to keeping up is actually slowing down, because there is no shortage of information coming to us. We're ingesting so many gigabytes of data every day through WhatsApp, Slack, email, LinkedIn, and Instagram. The way we used to handle the workload of the past cannot be replicated to handle the speed of today.\n\nSo we have to develop our discernment muscles, which is the ability to spot a signal from noise. A large percentage of content worldwide right now is AI-generated, and we have AI-generated content that is being cannibalized to retrain itself.\n\nMoving forward, we're going to get to the point of diminishing return. Problem-solving skills are going to be so important, and it will be super important to discern, validate, and verify AI responses. You can use AI to author the first draft, but maybe don't copy and paste the output because it's often inaccurate. Think of it as a first draft always.\n\nThe last team that I managed was a data science team at a Fortune 500 company. I tasked my junior and senior data scientists to come up with an approach for the CMO for a new product. My junior scientist produced the same deliverable as the senior scientists but it took them less than half the time because they took the word of ChatGPT.\n\nIt sounded great, but they short-circuited the process of research and verification, so I had to make a new mandate that they cannot use AI to do the work for them, but only to help facilitate and accelerate the research.\n\nI told my junior scientists and anyone highly codependent on AI, \"I'm paying for your brain and uniqueness. I'm not paying you to copy and paste, because, quite frankly, a license for enterprise API from OpenAI is a lot cheaper than you.\"\n\nIt's so easy to ask ChatGPT a question and get an answer that sounds really good. But if you don't use critical thinking and depend on yourself to solve problems, you could be outdated within a few years.\n\nHow is AI affecting your work?

    "description": "The Fishy Inspiration Behind a Bold, Tandem Space Mission: Remarkable remoras get their time in the orbital spotlight.",
    "fullText": "I’m a sucker for remoras. The streamlined fish are the ocean’s perfect hitchhiker, honed by millions of years of evolution to catch a ride with some of the sea’s biggest movers and shakers—sharks, whales, rays, even turtles. And now remoras can add another accomplishment to their already impressive resume: They were the inspiration for a space mission that could make autonomous tandem space missions in low Earth orbit.\n\nTwo private space companies recently revealed that they were conducting a test run of what’s called rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) technology. Essentially, two spacecraft, made by Impulse Space, used software from another space company, Starfish Space, to come within about 4,000 feet of each other as they floated high above Earth. The collaboration, called “Remora” by the companies involved, demonstrated the accuracy of such RPO technology, which could be used to bring two spacecraft in lockstep orbit—remora-like—to autonomously service the multitude of satellites that encircle the Earth.\n\nBut back to the watery realm. Remoras likely evolved from more garden variety fish starting about 32 million years ago. Cobia, the closest living relatives of remoras, are free-living and don’t latch onto other marine organisms. But they do provide an interesting model of how remoras may have come about.\n\nCobia look remarkably similar to remoras save for the one thing that makes the latter a champion marine hitchiker—a suction cup positioned on the tops of their heads. That structure most likely morphed through time from a dorsal fin on the remora’s ancestor, an insight definitively proven by researchers in 2012, after naturalists had been suggesting as much since the early 1800s.\n\nThat evolutionary innovation helps modern day remoras glom onto all sorts of their fellow oceanic travelers—sharks, whales, turtles, and more—while snapping up their scraps and sometimes picking off parasites. Interestingly, cobia also tend to tag along with larger marine swimmers, such as manta rays, marlins, and sharks. They just don’t employ a sucker to keep hold.\n\nI for one am glad to see remora get their moment in the spaceflight spotlight in the shallows of the cosmic ocean.\n\nEnjoying  Nautilus? \n\nLead image: Richard ling / Wikimedia",

    "fullText": "Outside the lavish event, workers called out the ‘greed’ in the industry that has left games ‘being sold for parts to make a few people a lot of money’\n\nIt’s the night of the 2025 Game Awards, a major industry event where the best games of the year are crowned and major publishers reveal forthcoming projects. In the shadow of the Peacock theater in Los Angeles and next to a giant, demonic statue promoting new game Divinity, which would be announced on stage later that evening, stands a collection of people in bright red shirts. Many are holding signs: a tombstone honouring the “death” of The Game Awards’ Future Class talent development programme; a bold, black-and-red graphic that reads “We’re Done Playing”; and “wanted” posters for Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick and Microsoft CEO Phil Spencer. This is a protest.\n\nThe protesters, who were almost denied entry to the public space outside the Peacock theater (“they knew we were coming,” one jokes), are from United Videogame Workers (UVW), an industry-wide, direct-join union for North America that is part of the Communications Workers of America. “We are out here today to raise awareness of the plight of the game worker,” says Anna C Webster, chair of the freelancing committee, in the hot Los Angeles sun. “Our industry has been strip-mined for resources by these corporate overlords, and we figured the best place to raise awareness of what’s happening in the games industry is at the culmination, the final boss, as it were: The Game Awards.”\n\nWebster is referencing several things here. More than 40,000 layoffs have decimated the industry over the past few years; just last month, Grand Theft Auto developer RockstarGames was accused of union-busting after firing more than 30 staff (the studio denies this, saying the employees were leaking confidential information), and AI is being rapidly injected into game development processes. The industry seems unwilling to reckon with these issues.\n\n“I recently read that a three-minute trailer at The Game Awards costs more than $1m,” says the union’s local secretary, Kaitlin “KB” Bonfiglio. “[Despite] the pomp and circumstance of all of this, they never seem to acknowledge the historic amount of layoffs that have happened in the industry.”\n\nFor the UVW, there is a core issue here. “It’s all about greed,” Webster insists. “Anyone who works in the games industry can identify that our art form is being sold for parts to make a few people a lot of money. And they don’t care about the games. They don’t care about the art. They just want their money.”\n\nFor those working in games, the problems plaguing the industry are obvious. But how can UVW make it clear that the issues industry workers face affect players, too? “If you’re someone who loves video games, if you are frustrated by games that launch buggy and are delayed messes, if you’re frustrated by games you’re excited about getting cancelled without warning, all of that ties back to what we’re doing here,” treasurer Sherveen Uduwana says. “Giving us layoff protections, making sure bosses can’t take away our healthcare, making sure they can’t replace us with AI – that is going to lead to better games for players and more ambitious, interesting, creative projects. It’s really a win-win for players and a win-win for workers.”\n\nThere’s a clear love for the industry permeating through this group, a desire to make the medium and the work they cherish even better. The Game Awards is a major night, one that can help prop up smaller independent studios and highlight incredible voice actors. The UVW team recognises that.\n\n“Have a good time today, and tomorrow, let’s wake up and start organising for better workers’ rights and a better games industry,” Uduwana says.",

    "description": "It's unimaginably vast.",
    "fullText": "Astronomers have observed enormous filaments of galaxies tied together with dark matter — the stuff scientists believe makes up 85 percent of the total mass of the universe — stretching across unfathomably vast distances.\n\nSome of these behemoth structures have been observed to spin in the same direction, a dazzling and mysterious cosmic dance stretching across tens of millions of light-years, and a tantalizing clue in our efforts to understand how galaxies, and eventually stars, are formed.\n\nNow, an international team of researchers led by the University of Oxford says it has spotted the largest one of these rotating structures ever identified using data from South Africa’s MeerKAT radio telescope, an array of 64 linked satellite dishes.\n\nAs detailed in a study published this month in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, they observed 14 galaxies arranged in a “razor-thin” string that measures roughly 5.5 million light-years long and 117,000 light-years across. This structure is located inside a much larger filament that contains 280 other galaxies, reaching a length of 50 million light-years.\n\nMany of these hundreds of galaxies appear to be rotating in the same direction as the overarching filament itself.\n\n“This is the largest individual spinning structure so far detected,” colead author and University of Oxford postdoctoral researcher Lyla Jung told Reuters. “Statistically, we believe there are other spinning structures, some of which could be larger. However, we have not been able to detect them directly with our current data and telescopes.”\n\nThe discovery suggests these structures can influence the spin of galaxies for longer, and more strongly, than previously thought.\n\n“What makes this structure exceptional is not just its size, but the combination of spin alignment and rotational motion,” Jung said in a statement about the work.\n\n“You can liken it to the teacups ride at a theme park,” she added. “Each galaxy is like a spinning teacup, but the whole platform- the cosmic filament -is rotating too. This dual motion gives us rare insight into how galaxies gain their spin from the larger structures they live in.”\n\nThe researchers suggest the filament is still fairly young after finding it’s in a “dynamically cold” state. The hydrogen-gas-rich galaxies within may still be gathering fuel to spit out stars, an intriguing glimpse into the earliest stages of a galaxy’s evolution.\n\n“This filament is a fossil record of cosmic flows,” said colead author and University of Cambridge postdoctoral research assistant Madalina Tudorache in the statement.\n\nThe findings also detail how this gas is being swirled around inside the filament, which could inform future observation efforts using the European Space Agency’s Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.\n\n“This is a very exciting time to work in this field, as our capacity of discovering such structures is increasing with the advent of better radio and optical surveys,” Tudorache told Reuters. “It will deepen our understanding of the universe.”\n\nMore on cosmic filaments: Scientists Detect “Strange Filaments” at the Heart of Our Galaxy",
