    "fullText": "annas-archive.li/blog, 2025-12-20, Discuss on Hacker News\n\nWe backed up Spotify (metadata and music files). It’s distributed in bulk torrents (~300TB), grouped by popularity.\n\nThis release includes the largest publicly available music metadata database with 256 million tracks and 186 million unique ISRCs.\n\nIt’s the world’s first “preservation archive” for music which is fully open (meaning it can easily be mirrored by anyone with enough disk space), with 86 million music files, representing around 99.6% of listens.\n\nAnna’s Archive normally focuses on text (e.g. books and papers). We explained in “The critical window of shadow libraries” that we do this because text has the highest information density. But our mission (preserving humanity’s knowledge and culture) doesn’t distinguish among media types. Sometimes an opportunity comes along outside of text. This is such a case.\n\nA while ago, we discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale. We saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation.\n\nGenerally speaking, music is already fairly well preserved. There are many music enthusiasts in the world who digitized their CD and LP collections, shared them through torrents or other digital means, and meticulously catalogued them.\n\nHowever, these existing efforts have some major issues:\n\nThis Spotify scrape is our humble attempt to start such a “preservation archive” for music. Of course Spotify doesn’t have all the music in the world, but it’s a great start.\n\nBefore we dive into the details of this collection, here is a quick overview:\n\nThe data will be released in different stages on our Torrents page:\n\nFor now this is a torrents-only archive aimed at preservation, but if there is enough interest, we could add downloading of individual files to Anna’s Archive. Please let us know if you’d like this.\n\nPlease help preserve these files:\n\nWith your help, humanity’s musical heritage will be forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts, and other catastrophes.\n\nIn this blog we will analyze the data and look at details of the release. We hope you enjoy.\n\n— Volunteer “ez” of Anna’s Archive team\n\nLet’s dive into the data! Here's some high-level statistics pulled from the metadata:\n\nSpotify has around 256 million tracks.\n\nThe most convenient available way to sort songs on Spotify is using the popularity metric, defined as follows:\n\nThe popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.\n\nGenerally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity.\n\nIf we group songs by popularity, we see that there is an extremely large tail end:\n\n≥70% of songs are ones almost no one ever listens to (stream count < 1000). To see some detail, we can plot this on a logarithmic scale:\n\nThe top 10,000 songs span popularities 70-100. You can view them all in this HTML file (13.8MB gzipped).\n\nAdditionally, we can estimate the number of listens per track and total number per popularity. The stream count data is estimated since it is difficult to fetch at scale, so we sampled it randomly.\n\nAs we can see, most of the listens come from songs with a popularity between 50 and 80, even though there's only 210.000 songs with popularity ≥50, around 0.1% of songs. Note the huge (subjectively estimated) error bar on pop=0 — the reason for this is that Spotify does not publish stream counts for songs with < 1000 streams.\n\nWe can also estimate that the top three songs (as of writing) have a higher total stream count than the bottom 20-100 million songs combined:\n\nNote that the popularity is very time-dependent and not directly translatable into stream counts, so these top songs are basically arbitrary.\n\nWe have archived around 86 million songs from Spotify, ordering by popularity descending. While this only represents 37% of songs, it represents around 99.6% of listens:\n\nPut another way, for any random song a person listens to, there is a 99.6% likelihood that it is part of the archive. We expect this number to be higher if you filter to only human-created songs. Do remember though that the error bar on listens for popularity 0 is large.\n\nFor popularity=0, we ordered tracks by a secondary importance metric based on artist followers and album popularity, and fetched in descending order.\n\nWe have stopped here due to the long tail end with diminishing returns (700TB+ additional storage for minor benefit), as well as the bad quality of songs with popularity=0 (many AI generated, hard to filter).\n\nBefore diving into more fun stats, let’s look at how the collection itself is structured. It’s in two parts: metadata and music files, both of which are distributed through torrents.\n\nThe metadata torrents contain, based on statistical analysis, around 99.9% of artists, albums, tracks. The metadata is published as compact queryable SQLite databases. Care was taken, by doing API response reconstruction, that there is (almost) no data loss in the conversion from the API JSON.\n\nThe metadata for artists, albums, tracks is less than 200 GB compressed. The secondary metadata of audio analysis is 4TB compressed.\n\nWe look at more detail at the structure of the metadata at the end of this blog post.\n\nThe data itself is distributed in the Anna’s Archive Containers (AAC) format. This is a standard which we created a few years ago for distributing files across multiple torrents. It is not to be confused with the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) encoding format.\n\nSince the original files contain zero metadata, as much metadata as possible was added to the OGG files, including title, url, ISRC, UPC, album art, replaygain information, etc. The invalid OGG data packet Spotify prepends to every track file was stripped — it is present in the track_files db.\n\nFor popularity>0, the quality is the original OGG Vorbis at 160kbit/s. Metadata was added without reencoding the audio (and an archive of diff files is available to reconstruct the original files from Spotify).\n\nFor popularity=0, the audio is reencoded to OGG Opus at 75kbit/s — sounding the same to most people, but noticeable to an expert.\n\nThere is a known bug where the REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_PEAK vorbiscomment tag value is a copy-paste of REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_GAIN instead of the correct value for many files.\n\nMany people complain about how Spotify shuffles tracks. Since we have metadata for 99.9+% of tracks on Spotify, we can create a true shuffle across all songs on Spotify!\n\nWe're curious about the peaks at whole minutes (particularly 2:00, 3:00, 4:00). If you know why this is, please let us know!\n\nSome songs, especially popular songs, have 2, 3, or even 20 different versions. We can quantify this by counting number of songs per ISRC:\n\nEach song on Spotify is only available on a specific set of markets. Most songs are available on most markets, but if we filter to popular songs, you can see a difference in availability (without filtering, the graph is almost flat):\n\nSpotify provides a list of genres per artist (not per song). If we count the artists for each genre, we get this result:\n\nSince each genre is very specific, we can also group genres and count the results:\n\nWe can also group artists by popularity. The resulting graph looks very similar to the tracks popularity graph:\n\nThe same graph for albums also looks the same.\n\nIf we group albums by release year, we see that more and more new music is added to Spotify, a lot of it likely automatically generated:\n\nThe amount of procedurally and AI generated content makes it hard to find what is actually valuable.\n\nYou can see that most songs on Spotify are singles, not part of an album.\n\nWe also scraped audio features generated by Spotify. They can be analyzed to find interesting trends.\n\nThis chart contains a lot of information. You can for example see that loudness correlates with energy and that BPM is normally distributed with a mean around 120.\n\nA scrape of the three main APIs of Spotify: artists, albums, tracks. Each track exists in exactly one album, but each track and each album can have multiple artists.\n\nThe tables are an almost lossless representation of Spotify API JSON responses, care was taken during creation by always reconstructing the original JSON based on each inserted row, with minor exceptions.\n\nA scrape of AudioFeatures objects from the Spotify API. One row per track.\n\nA scrape of Playlist objects from the Spotify API. Requires the spotify_clean.sqlite3 database to map track_rowid to track_id.\n\nMost playlists with < 1000 followers were excluded. Completeness unknown.\n\nRow count: 6.6 million playlists with 1.7 billion playlist tracks.\n\nThis is an almost lossless representation of the original Spotify API response. JSON reconstruction was tested during creation of all tables, with minor exceptions. For example, the original response JSON for playlists can be reconstructed with code similar to the following:\n\nThe link between the tracks table in spotify_clean and the actual files we have.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for audiobooks on Spotify. Contains around 700 thousand rows. Incomplete.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for audiobook chapters on Spotify. Contains around 20 million rows. Incomplete.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for shows (podcasts) on Spotify. Contains around 5 million rows. Incomplete.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for (podcast) episodes on Spotify. Contains around 54 million rows. Incomplete.\n\nRedirect responses for the artist endpoint.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for audio analysis on Spotify.\n Contains around 40 million rows, fetched in descending priority order. Many songs do not have an audio analysis (404). Incomplete.\n\nAlbum art files. Correspond to last part of url from album_images. Indexed into directories with filename prefixes (after stripping the first 16 chars from the filename).",

It also delays Japan’s satellite launch plans, including one to have a more independent geolocation system for smartphones, maritime navigation and drones without relying on the U.S. GPS system.\n\nThe H3 rocket is designed to be more cost-competitive in the global space market. Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security.\n\nJAXA's H3 project manager, Makoto Arita, said the new flagship is still in the early stages of operation but can be globally competitive. “We will pull ourselves together so that we won't fall behind rivals. We'll fully investigate the cause and put H3 back on track.”\n\nMonday's launch came five days after JAXA aborted just 17 seconds before liftoff, citing an abnormality of a water spray system at the launch facility, following an earlier problem with the rocket.\n\nIn its debut flight in March 2023, H3 failed to ignite the second-stage engine.\n\nJapan currently has the quasi-zenith satellite system, or QZSS, with five satellites for a regional navigation system that first went into operation in 2018. The Michibiki 5 was to be the sixth of its network.\n\nJapan currently relies partially on American GPS and wants to have a seven-satellite network system by March 2026 and an 11-satellite network by the late 2030s.",

    "description": "This tech giant's early entry into the AI space has helped it build a substantial revenue backlog that could propel its shares higher in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft's stock needs to appreciate by 41% from current levels to achieve a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nThe company's AI tools are gaining terrific traction in the productivity space, while its cloud business is also booming.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush expects Microsoft to become a $5 trillion company next year, and it won't be surprising to see the company indeed hitting that milestone.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly became the first company to cross a $5 trillion market cap just a couple of months ago, driven by the company's remarkable revenue and earnings growth on account of its dominance of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\n\nHowever, the share price of the chip giant has pulled back since then, even though it continues to maintain terrific growth despite its massive size. Concerns about the AI boom becoming a bubble and the sustainability of the heavy infrastructure spending that has driven Nvidia's phenomenal growth over the past three years have begun to weigh on the stock.\n\nBut there's another company -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- that's making the most of the proliferation of AI. One analyst believes that this \"Magnificent Seven\" company could hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2026. Let's take a closer look at Microsoft's prospects and why it could hit the $5 trillion market cap milestone in the new year.\n\nThere is no denying that Nvidia's chips have played a crucial role in the widespread adoption of AI technology. However, the computing power provided by its chips is eventually harnessed to create customer-facing solutions. For example, training OpenAI's ChatGPT wouldn't have been possible without Nvidia's chips, but the chatbot became popular because of what it was doing for users.\n\nFrom helping users write emails to creating images to drafting documents and writing code, ChatGPT's versatility and productivity have been the key reasons behind its raging success. Not surprisingly, ChatGPT parent OpenAI points out that it now has more than 1 million paying enterprise customers, while more than 800 million users use ChatGPT every week.\n\nMicrosoft made a smart move in 2019 by investing in OpenAI. It still holds a 27% stake in OpenAI, a company reportedly worth $500 billion. However, more than the financial aspect, OpenAI provided Microsoft with access to large language models (LLMs) and applications, enabling it to build a wide portfolio of AI-powered tools and deploy them across its offerings.",

    "description": "It's lonely out in space, especially if you're a Starfield player waiting for any word about the next major update coming to the game. Bethesda's space-based game will receive an additional story DLC, it's just a matter of when. Now, a new report suggests that the delay of Grand Theft Auto 6 played a role in Bethesda's decision to push back its next Starfield chapter.\nAccording to Windows Central, Bethesda \"felt more comfortable\" about pushing Starfield's second DLC to the first half of 2026 because Microsoft already had a \"busy holiday period\" for 2025 without it. More intriguingly, the same report indicates that Bethesda has already been showing off the new update and DLC behind closed doors to a select group of players.",

    "fullText": "NASA's new boss has reiterated the stakes for the lunar race between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.\n\nOn his first day in the job, Jared Isaacman said the space agency would pick whichever company finished its moon lander first, out of Musk's SpaceX or Bezos' Blue Origin.\n\n\"I don't think it was lost on either vendor that whichever lander was available first to ensure that America achieves its strategic objectives on the moon is the one we were going to go with,\" Isaacman told Bloomberg TV on Thursday, a day after he was confirmed as NASA administrator by the US Senate.\n\nSpaceX and Blue Origin both hold contracts to build lunar landers for NASA to help carry astronauts to the surface of the moon.\n\nA modified version of SpaceX's massive Starship rocket is set to be used in 2027 for NASA's Artemis III mission, which aims to put astronauts back to the moon for the first time in over 50 years.\n\nIn October, however, then-acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy reopened SpaceX's lunar contract, stating that the company was \"behind schedule\" on its lander and suggesting that NASA could opt for Blue Origin's spacecraft for the historic mission instead.\n\nIsaacman flew two private missions as a SpaceX astronaut in 2021 and 2024 and took part in the first-ever commercial space walk.\n\nThe billionaire's connection to Musk almost cost him the top job at NASA, with Donald Trump temporarily withdrawing his nomination earlier this year amid a high-profile spat between the US president and the world's richest man.\n\nMusk also clashed with Isaacman's predecessor, Duffy, over the decision to reopen the moon contracts, calling the transport secretary a \"dummy\" and claiming that SpaceX would end up \"doing the whole moon mission\" by itself.\n\nIt comes after Trump signed a new executive order on Thursday that called on the US to establish a permanent outpost and nuclear reactors on the moon by 2030.",

    "description": "\"The forces that are needed to dislodge such a massive black hole from its home are enormous.\"",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nAstronomers have made a truly mind-boggling discovery using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST): a runaway black hole 10 million times larger than the sun, rocketing through space at a staggering 2.2 million miles per hour (1,000 kilometers per second).\n\nThat not only makes this the first confirmed runaway supermassive black hole, but this object is also one of the fastest-moving bodies ever detected, rocketing through its home, a pair of galaxies named the \"Cosmic Owl,\" at 3,000 times the speed of sound at sea level here on Earth. If that isn't astounding enough, the black hole is pushing forward a literal galaxy-sized \"bow-shock\" of matter in front of it, while simultaneously dragging a 200,000 light-year-long tail behind it, within which gas is accumulating and triggering star formation.\n\n\"It boggles the mind!\" discovery team leader Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University told Space.com. \"The forces that are needed to dislodge such a massive black hole from its home are enormous. And yet, it was predicted that such escapes should occur!\"\n\nSupermassive black holes, which can reach masses billions of times that of the sun, are usually found at the hearts of their home galaxies, which they dominate with their immense gravity. The incredible speed of this supermassive black hole means it is around 230,000 light-years from its point of origin.\n\n\"This is the only black hole that has been found far away from its former home,\" van Dokkum said. \"That made it the best candidate [for a] runaway supermassive black hole, but what was missing was confirmation. All we really had was a streak that was difficult to explain in any other way. With the JWST, we have now confirmed that there is indeed a black hole at the tip of the streak, and that it is speeding away from its former host.\"\n\nThis now-confirmed runaway supermassive black hole was first identified by van Dokkum and colleagues back in 2023 using the Hubble Space Telescope, which spotted what appeared to be the wake of a massive body passing through space. Of course, like all black holes, this runaway is bounded by a one-way light-trapping surface called an event horizon, making it difficult to spot.\n\n\"The black hole is, well, black - and is very difficult to detect when it is moving through empty space. The reason why we spotted the object is because of the impact that the passage of the black hole has on its surroundings: we now know that it drives a shock wave in the gas that is moving through, and it is this shock wave, and the wake of the shock wave behind the black hole, that we see,\" van Dokkum said. \"With the JWST, we discovered the huge displacement of the gas at the tip of the wake, where the black hole is pushing against it. The shock signatures are crystal clear, and there is just no doubt about what is happening here.\" The gas is pushed sideways away from the supermassive black hole at a velocity of hundreds of thousands of miles per hour (hundreds of km per second), a dynamical signature that the team saw with JWST.\n\n\"The velocity of the displaced gas is directly related to the velocity of the black hole, and this is how we determined the black hole's velocity from the JWST data,\" van Dokkum said. \"It is moving at approximately 1000 km per second, faster than just about any other object in the universe. It is this high speed that enabled the black hole to escape the gravitational force of its former home.\"\n\nvan Dokkum explained that two possible mechanisms could lead to a supermassive black hole being ejected from the heart of its own galaxy. Both scenarios begin when two galaxies collide and begin to merge, each bringing to the cosmic smash its own supermassive black hole. Both mechanisms are initiated when the supermassive black holes reach the center of the newly formed galaxy.\n\n\"The first mechanism is that the two black holes merge with each other, and that the gravitational radiation [gravitational waves] released in that merger imparts a powerful kick to the newly formed black hole. That kick could impart a speed of 1,000 km/s, enough to eject the black hole,\" van Dokkum said. \"The second is a three-body interaction. That happens when one of the two galaxies had a pair of binary black holes at its center. When a third black hole enters the binary system, it becomes unstable, and one of the three black holes will get kicked out of the system.\"\n\nThe team believes that it is the first scenario that accounts for the runaway supermassive black hole in this instance. That would lead to a galaxy lacking a supermassive black hole at its center, which van Dokkum said is unlikely to impact said galaxy very much. However, this runaway supermassive black hole could have a huge impact on any other galaxy it encounters as it rockets through space.\n\n\"An encounter with another galaxy would be quite spectacular, mostly because of the huge, galaxy-sized shock wave that precedes the black hole,\" van Dokkum continued. \"When this shock wave encounters the dense gas of another galaxy, it would compress and shock that gas and likely form a lot of new stars. It would be quite the show!\"\n\nFortunately, the two-ring galaxies that comprise the Cosmic Owl are located around 9 billion light-years away, meaning even if this runaway cosmic titan were headed our way, we don't ever need to worry about it reaching us.\n\nMergers between galaxies are common, occurring multiple times over the lifetime of a single galaxy. That means that ejected supermassive black holes may also be quite common, though population numbers vary based on how these collisions are modelled.\n\n\"Mergers happen often in the life of a galaxy; each galaxy with the size and mass of the Milky Way has experienced several during its lifetime. So black hole binaries should form pretty regularly. What we don't know is how quickly these binaries merge, if at all, and how often the resulting kick removes a black hole,\" van Dokkum said. \"My view is empirical: now that we know how to look for them, we can find other examples - and then we can answer the question directly from data, by counting the number of escapes. The big thing is that black hole escapes lived purely in the realm of theory until now.\"Even though runaway supermassive black holes had been predicted by theory long before this discovery confirmed their existence, that doesn't mean these findings didn't deliver some unexpected twists.\n\n\"Everything about this research surprised me! I never expected to see such a thing, and confirming it with JWST was just incredible,\" van Dokkum said. \"What we also had not quite appreciated is how much impact these escaping black holes have on the gas that they are moving through. In the wake, many new stars have formed from the shocked gas, about 100 million times the mass of the sun. This mode of star formation was unknown before, and it leads to a trail of stars far away from the galaxy, seemingly formed in empty space.\"\n\nThe Yale University researcher explained that the obvious next step for the team will be to search for more examples of runway black holes.\n\n\"You need space-based imaging to see them: the wake stood out to us because it is such a thin streak, and in ground-based images, it would be blurred beyond recognition,\" van Dokkum explained. \"Fortunately, wide-field Hubble-quality imaging is just around the corner, thanks to the Roman Space Telescope, and, slightly blurrier, Euclid. Using machine learning algorithms to find thin streaks in the Roman data will be a cool project!\"\n\nThe team's research has been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Letters and is currently available as a pre-peer-reviewed paper on arXiv.",

    "fullText": "As SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) eyes going public via an IPO in 2026, what would such a move mean for the space economy, which for the longest time has been dominated by private companies?\n\nSpace Capital founder and CEO Chad Anderson comes on Market Catalysts to elaborate on the spark this could give the space industry and how it could influence more private operators to go public.\n\nAnderson is also the author of The Space Economy: Capitalize on the Greatest Business Opportunity of Our Lifetime.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.\n\nFor more on what a potential SpaceX IPO means for other space companies looking to go public, as well as just a general landscape for next year, I'm joined here on set by Chad Anderson, Space Capital founder and CEO. He's also the author of The Space Economy. Good to see you.\n\nSo, I'm so curious about SpaceX and kind of like whether it sucks the air out of the room for other types of space investment or creates more of a halo effect for space investment.\n\nI think it's definitely the ladder. Um this is really exciting news. It's still uncertain, but we'll see what happens. But if they do, I mean, this is, I think this is going to um uh set a new benchmark. It's going to reprice um a lot of assets throughout the category. I think it's going to show what can be done. And I think it's going to kick off a wave of new listings. So this could be really exciting. And then from our perspective as private market investors in early companies, uh we're really excited to see what happens when these founders get some liquidity, who own stock options and shares, and they go on now and they're freed from the shackles of working at um big companies, they can go and, you know, um think about what they want to do, start their own thing. So we expect that this is going to um uh increase the SpaceX mafia. I mean, a few years ago it was, you know, we were tracking 45 companies or something like that of SpaceX alumni that had gone on and done founded new companies. It's now up to, I don't know, closer to 200, and we'll see what happens with with this um uh liquidity event. But for us, I mean, this is um uh SpaceX is the Apex player. They're 10 years ahead of anybody else. They've been setting the benchmark all along. Uh now this sort of moment, um we'll see what happens, but it could really catalyze a lot of activity.\n\nI mean, on the flip side, if they are so far ahead of everyone else, and then their numbers are public, does that then um mean that some of the other players, particularly in the public markets who also their numbers are public, like that that they're disadvantaged if they're not in the same place as SpaceX is.\n\nHmm, well, that's um that's a really interesting point. So I think SpaceX has stayed private for so long and they've been so in demand. Um, uh this is the hottest stock in the private markets. Everyone is vying to get access to SpaceX. Um and I think it's really sort of difficult, um when you've got that much interest and that many investors, um to sort of keep things quiet. So, you know, you see throughout the the the news that there's a lot of information that's out there\n\non what their performance looks like, right? So um it's no um so that sort of cat's out of the bag already.\n\nSo it wouldn't necessarily change the dynamic.\n\nYeah, I think so. And so you see like um what are the numbers, you know, um uh 13 last year, 15 this year. You start to think like the the growth is not parabolic um in uh uh their their growth is not parabolic. They but they are cash flow positive and they've been buying back shares, right? So I think what um this would do is really give them sort of uh a large cash infusion to go after some of their long-term missions to get to Mars, to um uh build data centers in orbit, uh to fund that and really have a big cash infusion to basically speed things up and go faster.\n\nUm and one of those is also what Starship is one of the projects that they're working on. Um so how important is that and what what's the timeline for something like that?\n\nSuper important. So Starship is a next generation massive vehicle. Um we've never had anything of this size. So if 2025 was the year of launch frequency, we were basically, we started launching, we launched almost every day, one launch per day, right? And that launch cadence is increasing. 2026 is going to be about mass. Um Starship is a massive vehicle. It is going to be fully reusable, which means that both the first stage of the rocket and the second stage both can land and be refueled and stacked and launched again. More like operational commercial airlines, which is really exciting because that is going to um it promises to deliver another step change in the order of magnitude, further reduction in launch cost, which really um will do a lot to again, to the halo effect, you know, comment to really stimulate growth in in this category. Um but at the same time, that vehicle is is necessary to launch these next generation Starlink satellites, the V3 satellites that they already um that they have already designed and they're just waiting for a vehicle that can carry them. Their data centers in orbit that they're now talking about in conjunction with this um potential IPO, uh requires Starship to be able to launch these things, right? So, this um is uh a lynchpin. It's it's critical to their strategy and it's also um critical um to to take the space economy to the next level.\n\nUm another thing that you're watching closely going into next year is what? geo intelligence and defense. Those are kind of some themes within space. So what should we be watching for there?\n\nYeah, I kind of just thinking about the convergence of AI and space in totality, right? So we talked a little bit about orbital data centers. Everyone seems to be talking about that now. Um Starship is and and Blue Origin's next generation vehicles too are going to allow us to launch new infrastructure that, you know, we couldn't do before like orbital data centers and some other things. So that's really interesting on the AI front. And also, um with regards to, you know, geospatial intelligence. So, um if GPS is the dot on the map, geospatial intelligence is the map. This is um uh digital information layered on top of the physical world. A lot of that comes from the global intelligence comes from satellites, um and different sensor types that are feeding into this really robust rich data set about what's going on on the surface of our planet. That's too much data for humans to comb through. So, um uh AI has come along at just the right time to basically help us parse through that and make sense of that, drive useful insights from that. And this is a huge area of growth. We're seeing um what what we call world models. So, everyone's familiar with LLMs and what's going on there, but those aren't really good at helping us to understand and navigate the physical world. So there's a lot of work going on right now um in geospatial embeddings, basically embedding the data to have the right geospatial information, coordinates, positioning data, rich layers of of data to basically help you now use AI to make sense of the physical world, right? Not just language. So, this is a huge area of opportunity. Um a lot of demand is being driven by defense and intelligence communities, but then also there's massive consumer and enterprise applications as well.\n\nVery cool. All right, Chad, we got to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.",

    "description": "At a companywide meeting at xAI's San Francisco headquarters, Musk discussed the company's future, its finances, and data centers in space.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk appears to be feeling upbeat about the future of his AI company.\n\nAt a companywide meeting at xAI's San Francisco headquarters last week, Musk told staff that if the company could survive the next two to three years, xAI would triumph over its competitors, several sources with knowledge of the meeting said.\n\nThe xAI CEO said that the company's ability to rapidly scale its power and data capacity would be a key ingredient in the race to achieve superintelligence — which surpasses human intelligence — and become the most powerful AI company.\n\nMusk said that xAI could achieve artificial general intelligence, which matches or exceeds human intelligence, in the next few years, even as soon as 2026, sources said.\n\nMusk said in November that xAI had a 10% likelihood of achieving AGI with its Grok 5 model, which he has said the company plans to release early next year.\n\nThe CEO also told staff that xAI would have an advantage over other AI companies because it would have access to around $20 billion to $30 billion in funding per year, and it could benefit from its proximity to his other companies, sources said. Tesla integrated Grok into its vehicles earlier this year.\n\nOverall, workers said Musk appeared happy with the company's progress. One insider described the meeting as \"peppy.\"\n\nMusk also theorized about building data centers in space and his plans to colonize Mars, the sources said. He said that Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot could eventually man such extraterrestrial data centers, the people said.\n\nMusk has previously said that Optimus could provide support for SpaceX missions as soon as next year. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have publicly talked about the possibility of building data centers in space, though Pichai acknowledged that it is a \"moonshot.\"\n\nIn response to Business Insider's request for a comment, the company responded with an automated message: \"Legacy Media Lies.\"\n\nOver the past year, xAI has rapidly expanded the footprint of its data centers, a project it has named Colossus. Earlier this year, the company said it had around 200,000 GPUs, and Musk has said it plans to expand to 1 million GPUs.\n\nxAI is one of many companies racing to build AGI and justify valuations worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Despite Musk's outsize profile, xAI is still a relatively new player in a race dominated by giants like OpenAI and Google.\n\nThe AI race shows no signs of slowing down. Earlier this month, OpenAI entered a state of emergency as it raced to push out its latest model, according to reports. Google released a new Gemini model in November, and xAI has pushed new versions of Grok in rapid succession.\n\nDuring the all-hands, xAI leads demonstrated several updates to existing products, such as Grok Voice, the company's app for Tesla owners, and its agents, sources said. Some of the updates included improvements to Grok's ability to predict outcomes, better listening functions for Grok voice, and video editing, the people said.\n\nDo you work at xAI or have a tip?

At least Instagram chief Adam Mosseri is aware of the issue — in a memo to staff, he said New York employees get a pass on the butts-in-seats mandate until the company figures out where all those butts will go. The timeline is TBD.\n\nAfter the pandemic-driven wave of remote work, many employees are being dragged, kicking and screaming, back into the office. For workers at companies such as Amazon, JPMorgan, and Starbucks, the perpetual workday-in-your-pajamas party is over. The odd wrinkle is that in some cases, it's not just employees who aren't ready to be back at work every day. Their employers aren't ready for it, either, at least logistically. They're telling people to come to the office without having the actual space for them to be there. So, workers are competing for desks, setting up shop in common areas, or refusing to show up altogether until their employers have a more well-thought-out plan. It's emblematic of the broader issues surrounding RTO mandates: Many companies are implementing them without a solid logic as to how or why and alienating their employees — intentionally or not — in the process.\n\nMultiple big-name companies have had some small-time whoopsie daisies on back-to-office space constraints.\n\nIn late 2024, AT&T acknowledged in a memo to employees that they would not offer \"one-for-one seating per employee\" as they were called back in. At the time, employees told Business Insider that workers were filling up hallways or hanging out in the cafeteria in order to check the attendance box. Around the same time, Amazon wound up delaying its RTO ask for some employees because their spots weren't ready. Not only were there not enough desks, but workers also complained that offices and meeting rooms were lacking in chairs.\n\nEarlier this year, JPMorgan employees required to come back found themselves in a sort of Hunger Games situation for spots, showing up extra early and leaving behind possessions to mark their spots and signing on from vacation to try to book scarce desk space. On Reddit, some employees described the situation as \"pure chaos,\" and complained of being unable to accomplish work because \"half the morning is spent on desk f***ery.\" One JPMorgan employee told me that they often find themselves seated far away from the rest of their team because someone else reserved their regular spot, and there are often lines for the women's bathroom at the New York office where they work.\n\nHow much office space is needed and what to do with it is a perpetual conundrum. Just look at all the hate for open-office floor plans. But the pandemic added more complications to an already complicated situation. As the RTO wave has picked up momentum, space has become a significant issue at many companies, both large and small, including giant federal agencies. So what gives?\n\nSome of it is simply a result of poor planning, explains Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work. Decisions are made at the executive level without proper consultation with facilities personnel, who have detailed information on desks and seating. \"It's not as easy as adding up people and comparing to desks, as it matters which cities and offices they are in,\" he says in an email. \"Kind of like airlines that some flights may be overbooked and others half-empty.\"\n\nSome of the shortages may be on purpose. Strict RTO mandates are often viewed, at least in part, as a soft layoff — companies expect some level of attrition when they force people back, even if they won't openly admit it. \"Having insufficient seating is all part of the plan,\" Bloom says. \"If you want a 10% head count reduction, you only need seating for 90% of the folks.\"\n\nBrian Elliott, the CEO of Work Forward, a future of work think tank and consultancy, says that when executives started to think about bringing people back to the office in about 2021, many were surprised to learn how low the percentage of their workforce actually showing up on a given day had been pre-2020, because of sick time, vacations, workers visiting customers, etc. \"So your average CFO looks at this and goes, 'It's a 60% utilized asset on average. Why am I doing assigned seating? Why not go to hoteling and hot desking?'\" Elliott says. Add in the belief that at least some sort of remote work would stick around (especially as companies offered it as a perk to attract workers in a tight labor market), and many companies decided to downsize their overall office footprint to save some cash. Now, as businesses decide they want everyone back in full-time, they're realizing they axed too many desks.\n\nSome companies are moving in the other direction, and are on the hunt for more spacious offices. But that process takes time, and economic uncertainty has leaders nervous to go too big. Commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE says economic jitters, high interest rates, and slow growth in in-person jobs has been somewhat of a drag on office leasing activity this year, but the overall trend is up: A growing majority of its office occupants expect to maintain or expand their space over the next three years, while the share anticipating downsizing is steadily decreasing.\n\n\"Companies are taking more spaces, so clearly, they are very comfortable in expansionary mode,\" says Henry Chin, global head of research at CBRE.\n\nThat doesn't mean employees should expect to be drowning in spacious offices anytime soon — businesses are driving toward higher people-to-desk ratios, not lower. So instead of a single assigned desk for every person, there are multiple people sharing. Per CBRE, the most common ratio today is 1-1.49 employees per seat, and the plan is to up it. \"Ultimately, they want to have the higher ratio, that two or three people share a desk,\" Chin says.\n\nIn other words, however you feel about hotel desking, you might want to get used to it.\n\nThe RTO battle in America is proving to be quite the push-and-pull. Remote work is falling, but it hasn't gone away: According to Bloom's tracker, about 25% of work is being done from home in the US, compared to 62% in the spring of 2020, the height of the pandemic, and well under 10% prior to the lockdowns. And just because companies ask workers to come back doesn't mean they're all complying — there's a delta between what employers are asking, and employees are giving, RTO-wise. As the job market weakens, employees may be inclined to give in and commute more. You want your boss to see you enough that they at least feel a little guilty when they fire you.\n\nThese space-related headaches are reflective of broader questions about where and how it's best for people to work, and what sort of planning needs to be put into it. Some executives seem to be knee-jerk demanding people come back in without considering whether that's how their teams work best, or whether the infrastructure can handle it. A five-day-a-week office mandate isn't super helpful if teams are located all over the country and everyone's just sitting on video calls all day. Some companies are discovering they need more small meeting rooms, not just a few large ones, so people can gather if they are in the same place. And some are falling short on basic blocking and tackling — having working WiFi, or supplying sufficient monitors and equipment. In the internet age, it's a little tough to get work done when you don't have the internet itself, or a keyboard or a mouse.\n\nEmployers may be \"conflating productivity and effectiveness with proximity\" in insisting people show up full-time, explains Melissa Daimler, a corporate culture consultant. \"If I can see you and I know that you're working, then I feel good about how productive we are as a company.\" Much of the issue comes down to trust — businesses feeling confident that their people will get the work done when they're in the office collaborating and when they're at home for the day. \"It takes an extra kind of set of planning skills and a system that you put in place as a company and a team,\" she says.\n\nThe space problem is one that companies should fix, whether they actually will is another question. Your employees aren't going to love the return of long commutes and sad salad desk lunches, whatever you do, but they're probably going to be even more annoyed if, at the end of that commute, they find themselves eating that sad salad on the floor in the hallway, seated next to their laptop.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "Sol Rashidi worked in the AI space for 15 years, and said it's important to make a conscious effort not to outsource your thinking.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sol Rashidi, a former tech executive at IBM, AWS, and Estée Lauder, who is based in Miami. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn the last 15 years, I have built and scaled AI capabilities, and I have over 200 deployments under my belt.\n\nI went from being an individual practitioner to running IBM's enterprise data management practice. I was the chief data officer at Sony Music, the chief analytics officer at Estée Lauder, and the head of technology for AWS's startup division in North America.\n\nAll my experiences from 2011 on have led me to realize there's a real chance people will develop a codependency on AI. So I'm focused on workforce preparation and educating the masses.\n\nNow I have my own company where I'm working on solving the problem of AI in the workforce by teaching enterprises how to prepare their workforce for the future, and how to use AI and automation to amplify the workforce instead of eliminating it. If you're going to use AI in your day-to-day, great — but you have to be conscientious, to outsource tasks and not your critical thinking. You need to avoid intellectual atrophy.\n\nIntellectual atrophy is when you lose your cognitive ability to think critically because you're outsourcing that thinking to tech. Just like our muscles atrophy if we don't use them, so does our brain. The big thing that you've got to be careful of is making sure that generative AI doesn't make your thinking become generic, because everyone else is also using ChatGPT. You maintain your edge by using cognitive power.\n\nAs an individual, I use six to eight AI tools every day. I use AI a lot for data processing, so I can think about the patterns and insights and, from there, observe and spotlight frameworks and models.\n\nBut when using the tools, I always ask myself, \"Am I using this to accelerate work I have to do, or am I using it to do the work for me?\" It needs to accelerate the work so that the thinking is left to me. \"This is making me faster, but is it making me more capable? This is making me more productive, but is this making me more valuable?\" I use the tools to expedite and facilitate versus doing the work for me.\n\nPart of what I do is communication, and I don't ever want to lose that edge. I don't use AI to write emails, keynotes, or personal interactions.\n\nIt's really important for me to be able to understand whether or not what I'm communicating is being perceived in the way I intended. That takes practice. Anything that comes from the heart or mind has to be sincere, expressive, and communicate the right messaging. It has to be organically generated by me — no exceptions.\n\nWe live in a society right now that values convenience over competition and speed over substance. But the key to keeping up is actually slowing down, because there is no shortage of information coming to us. We're ingesting so many gigabytes of data every day through WhatsApp, Slack, email, LinkedIn, and Instagram. The way we used to handle the workload of the past cannot be replicated to handle the speed of today.\n\nSo we have to develop our discernment muscles, which is the ability to spot a signal from noise. A large percentage of content worldwide right now is AI-generated, and we have AI-generated content that is being cannibalized to retrain itself.\n\nMoving forward, we're going to get to the point of diminishing return. Problem-solving skills are going to be so important, and it will be super important to discern, validate, and verify AI responses. You can use AI to author the first draft, but maybe don't copy and paste the output because it's often inaccurate. Think of it as a first draft always.\n\nThe last team that I managed was a data science team at a Fortune 500 company. I tasked my junior and senior data scientists to come up with an approach for the CMO for a new product. My junior scientist produced the same deliverable as the senior scientists but it took them less than half the time because they took the word of ChatGPT.\n\nIt sounded great, but they short-circuited the process of research and verification, so I had to make a new mandate that they cannot use AI to do the work for them, but only to help facilitate and accelerate the research.\n\nI told my junior scientists and anyone highly codependent on AI, \"I'm paying for your brain and uniqueness. I'm not paying you to copy and paste, because, quite frankly, a license for enterprise API from OpenAI is a lot cheaper than you.\"\n\nIt's so easy to ask ChatGPT a question and get an answer that sounds really good. But if you don't use critical thinking and depend on yourself to solve problems, you could be outdated within a few years.\n\nHow is AI affecting your work?

    "description": "The Fishy Inspiration Behind a Bold, Tandem Space Mission: Remarkable remoras get their time in the orbital spotlight.",
    "fullText": "I’m a sucker for remoras. The streamlined fish are the ocean’s perfect hitchhiker, honed by millions of years of evolution to catch a ride with some of the sea’s biggest movers and shakers—sharks, whales, rays, even turtles. And now remoras can add another accomplishment to their already impressive resume: They were the inspiration for a space mission that could make autonomous tandem space missions in low Earth orbit.\n\nTwo private space companies recently revealed that they were conducting a test run of what’s called rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) technology. Essentially, two spacecraft, made by Impulse Space, used software from another space company, Starfish Space, to come within about 4,000 feet of each other as they floated high above Earth. The collaboration, called “Remora” by the companies involved, demonstrated the accuracy of such RPO technology, which could be used to bring two spacecraft in lockstep orbit—remora-like—to autonomously service the multitude of satellites that encircle the Earth.\n\nBut back to the watery realm. Remoras likely evolved from more garden variety fish starting about 32 million years ago. Cobia, the closest living relatives of remoras, are free-living and don’t latch onto other marine organisms. But they do provide an interesting model of how remoras may have come about.\n\nCobia look remarkably similar to remoras save for the one thing that makes the latter a champion marine hitchiker—a suction cup positioned on the tops of their heads. That structure most likely morphed through time from a dorsal fin on the remora’s ancestor, an insight definitively proven by researchers in 2012, after naturalists had been suggesting as much since the early 1800s.\n\nThat evolutionary innovation helps modern day remoras glom onto all sorts of their fellow oceanic travelers—sharks, whales, turtles, and more—while snapping up their scraps and sometimes picking off parasites. Interestingly, cobia also tend to tag along with larger marine swimmers, such as manta rays, marlins, and sharks. They just don’t employ a sucker to keep hold.\n\nI for one am glad to see remora get their moment in the spaceflight spotlight in the shallows of the cosmic ocean.\n\nEnjoying  Nautilus? \n\nLead image: Richard ling / Wikimedia",

    "fullText": "Outside the lavish event, workers called out the ‘greed’ in the industry that has left games ‘being sold for parts to make a few people a lot of money’\n\nIt’s the night of the 2025 Game Awards, a major industry event where the best games of the year are crowned and major publishers reveal forthcoming projects. In the shadow of the Peacock theater in Los Angeles and next to a giant, demonic statue promoting new game Divinity, which would be announced on stage later that evening, stands a collection of people in bright red shirts. Many are holding signs: a tombstone honouring the “death” of The Game Awards’ Future Class talent development programme; a bold, black-and-red graphic that reads “We’re Done Playing”; and “wanted” posters for Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick and Microsoft CEO Phil Spencer. This is a protest.\n\nThe protesters, who were almost denied entry to the public space outside the Peacock theater (“they knew we were coming,” one jokes), are from United Videogame Workers (UVW), an industry-wide, direct-join union for North America that is part of the Communications Workers of America. “We are out here today to raise awareness of the plight of the game worker,” says Anna C Webster, chair of the freelancing committee, in the hot Los Angeles sun. “Our industry has been strip-mined for resources by these corporate overlords, and we figured the best place to raise awareness of what’s happening in the games industry is at the culmination, the final boss, as it were: The Game Awards.”\n\nWebster is referencing several things here. More than 40,000 layoffs have decimated the industry over the past few years; just last month, Grand Theft Auto developer RockstarGames was accused of union-busting after firing more than 30 staff (the studio denies this, saying the employees were leaking confidential information), and AI is being rapidly injected into game development processes. The industry seems unwilling to reckon with these issues.\n\n“I recently read that a three-minute trailer at The Game Awards costs more than $1m,” says the union’s local secretary, Kaitlin “KB” Bonfiglio. “[Despite] the pomp and circumstance of all of this, they never seem to acknowledge the historic amount of layoffs that have happened in the industry.”\n\nFor the UVW, there is a core issue here. “It’s all about greed,” Webster insists. “Anyone who works in the games industry can identify that our art form is being sold for parts to make a few people a lot of money. And they don’t care about the games. They don’t care about the art. They just want their money.”\n\nFor those working in games, the problems plaguing the industry are obvious. But how can UVW make it clear that the issues industry workers face affect players, too? “If you’re someone who loves video games, if you are frustrated by games that launch buggy and are delayed messes, if you’re frustrated by games you’re excited about getting cancelled without warning, all of that ties back to what we’re doing here,” treasurer Sherveen Uduwana says. “Giving us layoff protections, making sure bosses can’t take away our healthcare, making sure they can’t replace us with AI – that is going to lead to better games for players and more ambitious, interesting, creative projects. It’s really a win-win for players and a win-win for workers.”\n\nThere’s a clear love for the industry permeating through this group, a desire to make the medium and the work they cherish even better. The Game Awards is a major night, one that can help prop up smaller independent studios and highlight incredible voice actors. The UVW team recognises that.\n\n“Have a good time today, and tomorrow, let’s wake up and start organising for better workers’ rights and a better games industry,” Uduwana says.",

    "description": "It's unimaginably vast.",
    "fullText": "Astronomers have observed enormous filaments of galaxies tied together with dark matter — the stuff scientists believe makes up 85 percent of the total mass of the universe — stretching across unfathomably vast distances.\n\nSome of these behemoth structures have been observed to spin in the same direction, a dazzling and mysterious cosmic dance stretching across tens of millions of light-years, and a tantalizing clue in our efforts to understand how galaxies, and eventually stars, are formed.\n\nNow, an international team of researchers led by the University of Oxford says it has spotted the largest one of these rotating structures ever identified using data from South Africa’s MeerKAT radio telescope, an array of 64 linked satellite dishes.\n\nAs detailed in a study published this month in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, they observed 14 galaxies arranged in a “razor-thin” string that measures roughly 5.5 million light-years long and 117,000 light-years across. This structure is located inside a much larger filament that contains 280 other galaxies, reaching a length of 50 million light-years.\n\nMany of these hundreds of galaxies appear to be rotating in the same direction as the overarching filament itself.\n\n“This is the largest individual spinning structure so far detected,” colead author and University of Oxford postdoctoral researcher Lyla Jung told Reuters. “Statistically, we believe there are other spinning structures, some of which could be larger. However, we have not been able to detect them directly with our current data and telescopes.”\n\nThe discovery suggests these structures can influence the spin of galaxies for longer, and more strongly, than previously thought.\n\n“What makes this structure exceptional is not just its size, but the combination of spin alignment and rotational motion,” Jung said in a statement about the work.\n\n“You can liken it to the teacups ride at a theme park,” she added. “Each galaxy is like a spinning teacup, but the whole platform- the cosmic filament -is rotating too. This dual motion gives us rare insight into how galaxies gain their spin from the larger structures they live in.”\n\nThe researchers suggest the filament is still fairly young after finding it’s in a “dynamically cold” state. The hydrogen-gas-rich galaxies within may still be gathering fuel to spit out stars, an intriguing glimpse into the earliest stages of a galaxy’s evolution.\n\n“This filament is a fossil record of cosmic flows,” said colead author and University of Cambridge postdoctoral research assistant Madalina Tudorache in the statement.\n\nThe findings also detail how this gas is being swirled around inside the filament, which could inform future observation efforts using the European Space Agency’s Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.\n\n“This is a very exciting time to work in this field, as our capacity of discovering such structures is increasing with the advent of better radio and optical surveys,” Tudorache told Reuters. “It will deepen our understanding of the universe.”\n\nMore on cosmic filaments: Scientists Detect “Strange Filaments” at the Heart of Our Galaxy",

    "description": "Discover Papermoon, the open source project creating a standard, space-grade Linux to replace bespoke software for satellites and spacecraft in the NewSpace era.",
    "fullText": "TOKYO — When I worked for NASA in the 1980s, every satellite and spaceship that went into orbit ran one-off, hand-coded, semi-proprietary programs. This approach was painful, expensive, and sometimes disastrous, as with the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter in 1999 due to a software blunder.\n\nThings have changed. In his “Space Grade Linux” keynote at the Open Source Summit Japan conference, Ramón Roche, a longtime robotics developer and general manager of the Dronecode Foundation, told how Linux and open source software are becoming the default for every launch — replacing the bespoke, one-off programs of the past.\n\nThis change has been coming for a while. By 2013, the International Space Station (ISS) switched out its Windows laptops for Debian Linux machines for mission-critical work. Today, SpaceX’s workhorse rocket, Falcon 9, and its Dragon spacecraft both run Linux. Roche also noted that the first aircraft on another planet, the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars, flew with Linux. Heck, a developer recently managed to run open source Doomon, a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite.\n\nBut Roche stressed that one thing has been lacking. A common space Linux platform so that space companies can stop “competing on the plumbing” and start sharing core software infrastructure.\n\nThe economic backdrop is a classic space‑tech storyline: It’s cheaper than ever to access orbit, but software complexity and safety requirements keep rising.\n\n“You can launch a satellite for the cost of a nice car,” Roche said, noting that the cost per kilogram is “quickly approaching less than $100 per kilo to ship payload to space,” which in turn fuels a flywheel of more launches, more applications and even “data centers in space.”\n\nWhat doesn’t scale, he argued, is the way many missions are still engineered as bespoke, one‑off software stacks. “It’s 2025 right now, and we’re still in a phase like 1969,” where missions are one‑off and expensive. That model “was fine back when launches cost millions of dollars, he noted, “but no longer fits the economics of NewSpace.\n\nSpace’s harsh realities — radiation‑induced “single set events” that reboot systems without warning, communication delays “measured in minutes,” and the impossibility of “SSH there” to fix a broken satellite — are pushing developers toward robust, well-understood, community‑maintained open source instead of proprietary stacks.\n\nThe problem, as Roche sees it, is not whether Linux is the right base layer for autonomous systems, but how it is used.\n\nA survey of practitioners identified Yocto as the “clear winner” among embedded Linux distributions. However, we still have a fragmented landscape of teams “building their own version of Linux from scratch” with “no shared foundational layer,” Roche said.\n\n“Everyone agrees that Linux is the answer,” he said. “But nobody agrees on which Linux.”\n\nThat fragmentation looks familiar to Roche, who has spent more than a decade in the drone ecosystem around PX4 and related projects.\n\n“I was there in 2010 when the drone industry looked very similar. Everyone was building on their own stacks, nobody talking to anyone else,” he recalled, describing “years of complicated effort” and “every company reinventing the wheel, incompatible protocols” before the community decided to “stop competing on the plumbing and start competing on innovation.”\n\nIn his telling, that shift enabled open source to power “the majority of commercial and professional drones worldwide,” from agriculture and inspection to mapping, search‑and‑rescue, and even defense.\n\nThe answer is Papermoon, a proposed space‑grade Linux stack. Roche described it as “an open source project and a new foundation” built around Linux as the “autoplay, middle layer architecture,” licensed under MIT, with a Developer Certificate of Origin rather than contribution agreements “friction.”\n\nOn the hardware side, early targets include RISC‑V development boards “like a Raspberry Pi, same price point,” Roche said, alongside space‑designed platforms such as Microchip’s radiation‑tolerant MPSoC, with continuous integration already running “on every commit” and images booting on actual boards.\n\n“This is what you’re getting,” Roche told the audience, arguing that teams who adopt Papermoon are “not starting from zero”— the base layer, build system, and “safety‑aware configuration” represent “months that you don’t need to spend reinventing if you collaborate with us.”\n\nTo tackle safety and certification head-on, the project has been incubating inside the Linux Foundation’s Enabling Linux in Safety Applications (ELISA) initiative.  Roche highlighted ELISA vice president Kate Stewart’s work as emblematic of the community Papermoon wants to align with.\n\n“If you’re building safety‑critical systems that run on Linux, there’s no one better to learn from,” he said. “ELISA has been working on this problem since 2019: How do you use Linux in systems where failure means loss of life?”\n\nA year ago, about 30 people met in person at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) — my home base when I worked for NASA — with another 40 joining virtually from more than 20 organizations, agencies, and research groups, to “decide the direction for this project,” which Roche framed as “not a maintenance‑only conversation, that’s actual, real commitment.”\n\nThe next move, he said, is to “step out of the ELISA incubation and form our own foundation with neutral overheads, member‑driven, the same models that work for automotive grade Linux,” where founding members “help us shape what this becomes: the governance, the roadmap, and standards that we set.”\n\nRoche’s pitch to developers and companies in the room was blunt: Ingenuity “proved Linux belongs in space,” but “the next mission shouldn’t start from scratch.”\n\n“The question is, does every team after this rebuild from zero, or do we give them that foundation?” he asked, positioning Papermoon as that shared base and urging those “building for space” who recognize the pattern from drones and automotive to “come talk to us” and “help us build the foundation for the next era of space.”",

    "description": "One of the biggest surprises of 2025 was Microsoft's push to bring even more of its games to PlayStation, its longtime rival in the console gaming space. Not only have those ports been well received, but they've also been best-sellers, and next year will see the arrival of Halo and Forza Horizon on PlayStation. In a new interview, Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, spoke about the success of Xbox games on PS5 and the reaction to Halo's announcement for PS5.\n\"We had a bit of a moment earlier in the summer from end of April to end of June, where we had six of the top 10 games on PlayStation were our Xbox games,\" Booty said to Variety. \"I look at that as validation for the teams, but most importantly, it's an opportunity for more players to engage with our content, to come into our worlds.",

    "fullText": "The latest installment of the legendary series could have been a Breath of the Wild-level revitalization, but it’s instead a shadow of its progenitors.\n\n on December 12, 2025 at 10:00AM PST\n\nNew Metroid games are few and far between, so the launch of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond should have been a monumental event for the fanbase. Instead, eight years after its announcement, and 18 years after the previous game, Nintendo’s big December 2025 release landed with a loud thud. Already, this once highly anticipated title is poised to be one of the series' most divisive games, earning a spot alongside Other M and Federation Force.\n\nThis isn't for lack of polish, as Prime 4 is indeed visually stunning and perhaps the greatest first-party showcase of graphics on the Nintendo Switch and its successor. But while it has its share of enthusiasts, it’s difficult not to feel underwhelmed by the final product in comparison to prior Prime games and even other, similar entries in the Metroidvania space that has grown in Nintendo’s frequent absence.\n\nThe list of Metroidvania games from independent and third-party developers in the past decade alone is astonishing, with Ori and the Blind Forest, Axiom Verge, Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, Animal Well, and others throwing new concepts and innovations into the genre’s well of ideas. Hollow Knight and its follow-up, Silksong, have captivated players with their dense worldbuilding, roaming NPCs, and optional side objectives, all of which have come to define the critically acclaimed series. Nine Sols stood out with its intricate combat system, while more out-there games like pinball Metroidvania Yoku’s Island Express have proven anything can be a Metroidvania with the right amount of determination and creativity. Even Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown changed the game with something as simple as an in-game screenshot system to help with backtracking. The Metroidvania genre is rapidly iterating with a volume of unique takes.\n\nUnfortunately, Metroid Prime 4 lacks the same ambition as its contemporaries and serves as proof that the series is now lagging behind the very games that it inspired. All Nintendo has had to show in the midst of this huge explosion of search-action games is Metroid Dread, which, as good a game as it is, is far from the most innovative or unique game of the bunch.\n\nIt’s disappointing to see Nintendo become an also-ran in a space it helped create. Not every game the company publishes has to be an earth-shattering release that completely shakes up the tenets of game development. But this is a company that has reinvented its other legacy properties multiple times. For Zelda, Ocarina of Time was a revolutionary transition to 3D, while Breath of the Wild once again reimagined the series with a new open-world format. The first Metroid Prime in 2002 was a similar accomplishment, unmatched by anything in the series since then.\n\nPrime 4 could have taken a similar approach: using familiar gameplay concepts and structures while building something new, unexpected, or refreshing. Nintendo and Retro Studios could have challenged our notion of what a Metroid game could be. Instead, Prime 4 feels archaic--the same as usual, except further distilled and with the added prefix of \"Psychic\" before everything.\n\nUnder the hood, Prime 4 reuses game design ideas from the 1990s and 2000s, which wouldn’t be egregious if it had iterated on or refined any of them. The closest feature to an innovation that the game includes is the nonsensical paywalling of background music. The end result is a strange mix of concepts from the first three Prime games, as if Prime 4 was based on a vague memory of the original trilogy.\n\nIt retains the visual identity established in the original Metroid Prime, but it turns the complex rooms and environments into long, narrow corridors with the occasional split path. Prime 4’s world structure is somewhat like Prime 2’s, centering on an overworld that connects the different biomes. However, unlike in Prime 2, Prime 4's map lacks any connection between the biomes themselves, and the Ocarina of Time-like overworld of Sol Valley is more of a chore to travel through than its own compelling area to explore. And controversially, Prime 4 has the voice acting and cutscene-filled cinematics of Prime 3, except that Prime 4 forgot to include either a story that makes sense or reasonable character motivations. All in all, Prime 4 is like a botched cover version of the preceding three games.\n\nPrime 4’s loop is essentially this: Enter a dungeon, go through lengthy hallways, ride some elevators, turn on the power or complete some other objective, and then backtrack through the entire area while facing a new challenge. It’s extremely straightforward, and I was able to accept that loop as a tutorial section--but Prime 4 never felt like it got past the tutorial.\n\nThe borderline on-rails nature of Prime 4 is problematic for a series--and genre--based around exploration. Linearity and hand-holding aren’t new to the series--Fusion and Zero Mission were early examples of the game explicitly giving players a destination waypoint on the map. Prime 3 is also considered by fans to be a more linear affair, and Metroid Dread, with all of its Metroidvania-ness, imploys clever techniques to provide an invisible guiding hand to help players advance through its world. But while Dread was a modernization and streamlining of 2D Metroid, Prime 4 feels like a regression, with its version of streamlining actively dissolving much-needed tension and discouraging player agency.\n\nThis is further exemplified by the game’s characters, who continue to radio you even after they stop following you around. To hear a character \"suggesting\" where to go in an almost passive-aggressive tone feels patronizing to me as a player, and I found myself ignoring these suggestions, defiantly turning my Vi-O-La motorcycle in the opposite direction through the mostly empty desert. I felt the need to push back on Prime 4’s guiding hand to feel any sort of empowerment, but even then, there’s little to do outside of the game’s critical path.\n\nPrime 4 stripping away that Metroidvania structure and feel is particularly disappointing given that the 3D Metroidvania space is largely untapped. There are hints of Metroid Prime in games like Batman: Arkham Asylum and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. But with how groundbreaking Prime 1 was, it’s sad that it didn’t inspire imitators to the same degree as Breath of the Wild did after its release. Prime 4 could have been a watershed moment for 3D exploration-based games--instead, it wastes the opportunity, relapsing to antiquated ideas and questionable design decisions to form an overall underwhelming experience.\n\nNintendo should be leading the charge in the Metroidvania space, as it does with platformers, action-adventure games, and other genres. Unfortunately, Prime 4 feels more like an obligation for stakeholders and investors--something Nintendo couldn’t back away from after prematurely announcing it, rather than a passion project that showcases the company’s ingenuity. Naturally, this leads to questions about just how troubled Prime 4’s development was.\n\nUltimately, the Metroidvania genre doesn’t need Nintendo in order to thrive--other game creators have long proven this case. While developers may not find inspiration in modern Metroid, they can still look to the likes of Hollow Knight as a North Star. The democratization of the Metroidvania is objectively a good thing, as no one company should have a monopoly on a genre. But despite my misgivings with Prime 4 and my contentment with competing Metroidvanias, I still want Nintendo to make more Metroid games. It’s my favorite Nintendo series, and it deserves the same treatment as the company’s other key brands.\n\nA comforting thought is that the reaction to Prime 4 might send Nintendo back to the drawing board for the Metroid series. Although it might have fumbled its Breath of the Wild moment, hopefully there will be something of a Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword effect, in which Prime 4's shortcomings lead to Nintendo reevaluating the franchise and putting out a more ambitious title the next time around.\n\nBut if and when we get a Prime 5, my expectations will be even larger. Nintendo wants to be all about innovation, and I want the next Metroid to be a landmark achievement that other developers will follow. The Metroid franchise deserves nothing less. I just hope it won’t take another 18 years for Metroid Prime to get that chance.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "fullText": "Talk of a colossal 2026 IPO from SpaceX is already having an impact on the market.\n\nInvestors have been asking for years if Elon Musk will ever allow SpaceX to start trading on public markets, and reports indicate next year could see its long-awaited debut at a $1.5 trillion valuation.\n\nIn a post on X on Wednesday, Musk appeared to confirm talk of a SpaceX public offering, describing a reporter's explanation of an imminent IPO as \"accurate.\"\n\nThe fresh focus on the space industry has sparked fresh momentum for stocks in the sector. Since the SpaceX IPO chatter picked up in the last week, a handful of space companies have seen their shares soar.\n\nHere are the top-performing space stocks in the last five days:\n\n\"SpaceX's IPO acts as a 'sector validator,' proving privates can command valuations despite thin profits, encouraging investors to focus on less well known public space stocks, like Redwire and Firefly Aero, for early exposure to a projected $1 trillion space economy by 2040,\" Tony Bancroft, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds told Business Insider.\n\nPure hype may not be the only reason that these space stocks are surging, though. According to Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities, the prospect of SpaceX going public at a trillion dollar valuation is likely shifting the ways in which investors view smaller companies.\n\n\"When the anchor of the entire ecosystem is valued that highly, then companies like Rocket Lab and AST SpaceMobile suddenly screen as structurally undervalued because they participate in the same demand cycle SpaceX is proving out,\" he noted.\n\nBoloor added that SpaceX's lofty valuation means that investors will have to start looking at the industry not as a high-risk emerging market, but as critical infrastructure that will be crucial to the US's future in multiple areas.\n\nThe consensus among finance pros seems to be that the space investing landscape has already started shifting, making small-cap space stocks an appealing play.\n\n\"If anything, the biggest impact of a SpaceX IPO is psychological,\" stated Drew Wandzilak, a principal at Alumni Ventures. \"It tells the market that this ecosystem is entering its growth phase. That is encouraging for investors like us and even more encouraging for the founders who are building the next layer of the space economy.\"",
