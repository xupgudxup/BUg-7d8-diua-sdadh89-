    "title": "14 'Second Wave' startups aiming to take the AI era beyond cost cutting",
    "description": "AI startups Luvu, Status, and others lead a Second Wave, supported by Kylan Gibbs, creating unique experiences and revenue models in the AI space.",
    "fullText": "Second Wave AI startups are trying to move beyond cost-cutting and use this technology to create brand-new experiences and generate new sources of revenue.\n\nThe concept is being supported by Kylan Gibbs, a former DeepMind product manager who now runs an AI startup called Inworld. His company has raised more than $100 million from investors including Microsoft, Intel, and Founders Fund.\n\nIn January, Gibbs launched a Second Wave AI startup accelerator to back up to 30 \"Second Wave\" AI startups — companies building new consumer experiences rather than bolting chatbots onto old workflows. Venture capital firms, including Khosla Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, are involved, alongside leaders from OpenAI, Google, and Stripe. A demo day will take place in early March in San Francisco, and participants get intros to potential investors.\n\nGibbs shared some examples of these types of startups with Business Insider.\n\nLuvu is an AI-powered fitness app that acts as a highly personalized personal trainer, using generative AI to send tailored motivational messages and real-time workout feedback. Through computer vision and reinforcement learning, it verifies users' exercises, adapts to their behavior, and creates a continuous feedback loop designed to boost engagement and retention. Luvu raised a pre-seed round with a16z speedrun and a seed round with investors including Insiders Ventures.\n\nStatus is an AI-powered social simulation game that lets users role-play in dynamic, AI-generated social media worlds, casting themselves as characters ranging from Hogwarts students to pro athletes. Powered by large language models, the app creates instant replies, evolving storylines, and even \"aura scores\" that grade interactions, turning open-ended AI responses into immersive, ever-changing gameplay. WishRoll, the startup behind Status, has raised more than $15 million in VC funding.\n\nParticle is an AI-native news platform that uses AI embeddings and generative tools to connect reporting with the most relevant insights from sources, including long-form podcasts. By mapping relationships between transcripts and stories, it automatically surfaces curated clips and adds summaries and context, bringing the most relevant information directly to readers. Particle has raised more than $10 million from investors, including Lightspeed and Axel Springer, the owner of Business Insider.\n\nThis is a consumer-facing \"talk to the Bible\" style app that lets users ask faith questions, request prayers, and explore scripture in a conversational interface, an example of AI being used to create an always-on, personalized spiritual guide rather than a back-office efficiency tool. Bible Chat raised about $14 million in funding from True Ventures and other investors last year.\n\nLiven positions itself as a \"self-discovery companion,\" blending mood tracking, habit-building tools, bite-sized courses, and an AI personal assistant named \"Livie\" that's meant to help users reflect, reframe, and stay consistent. It's more like a pocket coach than a productivity feature. Liven has raised a seed round.\n\nBorn is building social AI companions designed to bring real people together, not replace them: its flagship product is Friends, an app where users raise and co-parent cute virtual pets (like Pengu), play mini-games, and build routines with friends. The startup has framed this as an antidote to isolating, purely one-on-one chatbot dynamics. Born has raised about $25 million from investors, including Tencent and Accel.\n\nOtherHalf pitches itself as an immersive companion experience: anime-inspired 3D characters with expressive body language and real-time voice interactions, aiming to feel more emotionally resonant than plain text chat. Azimov, the startup behind OtherHalf, is backed by a16z speedrun.\n\nFlowGPT is less a single app than a consumer \"marketplace\" and community hub where people share, discover, and remix prompts (and increasingly agent-like experiences) for models like ChatGPT. FlowGPT raised $10 million from Goodwater Capital and DCM in 2024.\n\nTolan is a voice-first AI companion app built around animated alien \"best friends,\" designed to feel caring and emotionally supportive, while also nudging users toward healthier boundaries (like putting the phone down). OpenAI has highlighted Tolan's focus on low-latency, voice-first interaction and \"memory-driven personalities.\" Portola, the startup behind Tolan, raised $20 million in a Series A round led by Khosla Ventures last year.\n\nLittle Umbrella is an AI-powered social games studio aiming to blend party-game dynamics with generative AI, including titles designed for online communities, such as Discord. The startup raised $2 million in early 2025 from investors, including Zynga founder Mark Pincus.\n\nSpeak is an AI tutor app built around getting users to spoken fluency by practicing out loud, an approach that's closer to a personal conversation partner than a traditional gamified worksheet. In late 2024, Speakeasy Labs, the startup behind Speak, raised $78 million from investors including OpenAI, Accel, Khosla Ventures, and Y Combinator.\n\nHiggsfield is an AI video platform aimed at creators and marketers with tools for generating videos and effects from ideas, part of a broader consumer-first push to make cinematic content creation accessible without traditional production resources. Founded by the former head of generative AI at Snap, Higgsfield has raised $130 million as a valuation of more than $1 billion.\n\nTalkPal markets a digital language teacher that supports dozens of languages and emphasizes conversation practice, using AI to simulate speaking scenarios, deliver feedback, and keep learners practicing on demand.\n\nPromova is a large consumer language-learning platform that says it blends bite-sized lessons with AI tools and personalized plans, positioning itself as a more adaptive learning journey rather than a one-size-fits-all curriculum.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "In his BBC Sport column, ex-Premier League boss Tony Pulis explains why more matches in a shorter space of time might mean more injuries, and why the expansion of tournaments does not help players or fans.",
    "fullText": "With the season heading into its final months, games are coming thick and fast, especially for the Premier League clubs still in Europe.\n\nWith the extra games, travelling, time difference and the added disadvantage when teams return to face an away game in the Premier League, player welfare is another problem for managers of those teams. How do you maintain the quality of rest time that you know the players need to perform at the highest level and reduce the risks of injury?\n\nOut of the teams in action this week, Newcastle have had the longest journey. Their 2,529-mile trek to Baku is the furthest distance ever travelled by an English side in the Champions League.\n\nThe journey there and back, plus the difficulty of an away game at Manchester City on Saturday evening, is a tough ask - especially when you factor in how, statistically, the results usually go against the team playing away in Europe.\n\nThis was something I had to deal with at Stoke when we were in the Europa League, and faced long flights to Israel, Ukraine, Croatia and Turkey.\n\nWe tried all kinds of methods to help our recovery, sometimes flying straight back after games, or staying overnight and allowing the medical staff to take the lads in the mornings for a light recovery session, having breakfast then flying home.\n\nIt was really difficult to find the most balanced way. Irrespective of what we tried, having to play an away game that same weekend was really tough, and we suffered a couple of heavy Premier League defeats afterwards.\n\nThe same goes for many teams, though. I don't think anyone has truly found the answer to that particular problem, even if there were ways to manage players' fitness over the course of the season that I used effectively myself.\n\nIn the modern-day game, enormous investment is made into all different departments of Premier League clubs, and the medical and sports science departments are especially well-supported.\n\nToday, these departments offer enormous amounts of data on fitness issues and players are without doubt treated with more care and attention than ever before.\n\nGone are the days where you were encouraged to take pain-killing injections or tablets just to get you on the pitch, which were never questioned. Many players in the 1970s and 80s relied on appearance money and win bonuses to pay their mortgages so going through the pain barrier was never an issue.\n\nThe amount of change in our game since then in all departments is quite astonishing, and obviously most of it has made things better for all concerned.\n\nFor all of those advances, however, there are still questions being asked about soft-tissue injuries and why so many are still occurring.\n\nIn my years in the Premier League, I worked with some fantastic medical staff, club doctors, physios and fitness coaches.\n\nAt the beginning of every pre-season, I would explain what I needed from every single person mentioned above. My main topic was these soft-tissue injuries, like hamstring, calf and groin strains. I believed if the players were prepared and looked after in the right manner then we could avoid them.\n\nMy thinking was that joint injuries occurring from competitive challenges are always going to happen and we could not control those incidents, but muscular issues, we could.\n\nMy pre-season consisted of 10-14 days of endurance work, all within a certain range that would not impede or trouble the players' main leg muscles.\n\nAfter consultation with my medical staff, to ensure the players were strong enough, sessions would get progressively shorter and quicker, with and without the ball.\n\nOnce a solid strength and conditioning base had been implemented, and the season had begun, our general routine would entail pre-activation exercises like glute bridges and band walks, light weights, and lots of movement stretches.\n\nOne hour and 20 minutes each day on the grass was all I wanted and early in the week I would generally push the lads pretty hard, then taper it off closer to game day.\n\nThe above approach worked well for me so, having read up about the number of soft-tissue injuries occurring now, I contacted medical people in the game who I respect to try to find out why.\n\nObviously I wondered if strength and conditioning programmes like the ones I used had dropped off, but I got a big rebuff on that. I was told that, as in most sports, footballers today have got bigger, stronger and quicker.\n\nIt is not down to the players playing more games, either. Manchester United had 66 competitive games in 2008-09, Liverpool had 63 in 2021-22 and this season Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal will all experience something similar.\n\nSo, what has happened over the past five years to affect our top players?\n\nToday, there are more than two or three quick players in every team - the difference there is massive compared to when I started out as a manager more than 30 years ago.\n\nThat means that, while the distance covered by players has not altered much over time, the players are accelerating more, and also more often. It leads to much more stress in the top levels of their payload.\n\nSurely this can be managed? Yes, but it is getting harder. Not because players are playing more games, but because they are playing more in a shorter period of time.\n\nOver the past few years, players have started to question the amount of games they are now asked to play at international level, on top of the demands of club football.\n\nFifa and Uefa have increased everything, not just the fixture lists, but the number and size of competitions too.\n\nLet's start with this year's World Cup, where a record 48 teams will be competing and playing a total of 104 games - double the number the last time the tournament was held in the United States in 1994. It will take 72 group games to lose just 16 of those teams before the first knockout stage.\n\nSimilarly, the new Champions League format also has a busload of teams.\n\nIt takes 144 games to get rid of 12 of the 36 clubs, before you even reach the knockout stages, and I have completely ignored all these early matches as I don't understand how teams can lose game after game but still qualify for the next round.\n\nAdd to this two Europa League competitions and a new Club World Cup format and you can understand how busy Fifa and Uefa have been in building up their own empires.\n\nI congratulate the so-called smaller countries who will experience the World Cup for the first time this summer.\n\nHopefully millions of supporters will enjoy the experience too but I am sure many neutral supporters will question the adage that bigger is better, especially because the expansion of all of these tournaments will adversely affect the Premier League.\n\nFor me, the Premier League is the best league in the world and we should be protecting it.\n\nMany people in the game are concerned about player safety and although I am old school when it comes to how you look after players, I do believe that the top teams and players should be protected more to ensure our league remains the best and also the most successful in the world.\n\nTeams in the NFL, the only international sports league that can compare with the Premier League's success, only play one game a week.\n\nIt is an elite league, with elite players, and although they play a different sport which means that, physically, they operate on a different level, they are very conscious of having their best players in their best shape for their clubs and games.\n\nThe same should apply to the Premier League and the governing bodies in our country must be very careful with this dramatic increase in Fifa and Uefa's conquest of new concepts and new competitions.\n\nOur top players should not be used as cash cows to play in competitions that are over-subscribed.\n\nI believe football's top competitions should showcase our elite players at their peak level for their clubs and countries, so the Champions League and World Cup should be an almighty step up in class and a different level to anything we see on our own domestic stage.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not the case. In my view, Fifa and Uefa have watered down both competitions, and it feels to me like the main aim now is to make a shed-load of money from games that have no substance, and little meaning.\n\nTony Pulis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "fullText": "NASA’s new boss blasted Boeing and the space agency Thursday for Starliner’s botched flight that left two astronauts stuck for months at the International Space Station.\n\nAdministrator Jared Isaacman said poor leadership and decision-making at Boeing led to Starliner’s troubles. He also blamed NASA managers for failing to intervene and get Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back more quickly.\n\nThe two test pilots, now retired from NASA, spent more than nine months at the station before catching a lift back with SpaceX last March.\n\nIsaacman said Starliner’s problems must be better understood and fixed before any more astronauts strap in.\n\nIn a sweeping and emphatic move, Isaacman upgraded the seriousness of Starliner's troubled astronaut debut, declaring it a “Type A mishap,” something that could endanger a crew. Both the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters also involved cultural and leadership missteps. It is a mistake that Starliner was not designated a serious mishap right from the start, Isaacman said, citing internal pressure to keep Boeing on board and flights on track.\n\n“This is just about doing the right thing,” he said. “This is about getting the record straight.”\n\nThruster failures and other problems almost prevented Wilmore and Williams from reaching the space station following liftoff in 2024. The thruster analyses continue by Boeing.\n\n“We almost did have a really terrible day,\" said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya, referring to a potential loss of life.\n\nNASA issued its 312-page Starliner report while conducting a second fueling test of its moon rocket at Kennedy Space Center. Hydrogen fuel leaks spoiled the first dress rehearsal earlier this month and stalled astronauts' first flight to the moon since 1972.\n\nBoeing said the findings will help the company move forward in ensuring crew safety, and stressed that the Starliner program would continue. Time is running out as NASA proceeds toward decommissioning the space station in 2030, although Isaacman, a self-financed space traveler, foresees “endless demand” for multiple pathways to orbit once private outposts are booming.\n\nThere is no timeline for when Boeing can launch Starliner on a supply run, essentially another test flight to prove its safety before astronaut flights. The grounding leaves SpaceX as the only U.S. taxi service for astronauts.\n\n“Boeing has made substantial progress on corrective actions for technical challenges we encountered and driven significant cultural changes across the team,” Boeing said in a statement.\n\nEven before the troubled astronaut flight, Boeing was struggling with Starliner issues. The first test flight in 2019, without anyone on board, ended up in the wrong orbit and forced a repeat mission, which had its own difficulties.\n\nNASA hired Boeing and SpaceX in 2014, in the wake of the space shuttles’ retirement, to ferry astronauts to and from the orbiting lab. Their contracts are worth billions. SpaceX just delivered its 13th crew to the space station for NASA since 2020.\n\nKshatriya said the space agency must do better moving forward.\n\n“We have to own our part of this,” he said. As for Wilmore and Williams, “We failed them.\"\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "title": "This over-the-toilet shelf transformed my tiny bathroom without a remodel",
    "description": "My tiny bathroom lacked storage. Umbra's Bellwood Over-the-Toilet Shelf adds extra space without remodeling and looks stylish.",
    "fullText": "When I bought my first home nearly five years ago, I spent a lot of time planning out the living areas and bedrooms. The bathrooms, however, were somewhat of an afterthought — especially my half bath. Primarily used by guests, the previous owners renovated it prior to selling with a new countertop and mosaic wall tiles. I liked the look and simply added a towel on a hanging rack and called it a day.\n\nBut as time went on, I realized this room was lacking. The sink's open-format design lacked cabinetry or storage of any kind, and the bathroom itself seemed unfinished, despite its diminutive size. Eager for a fix that didn't involve remodeling, I gave Umbra's Bellwood Over-the-Toilet Shelf a try.\n\nI couldn't be happier with the results.\n\nAs a mom of two managing a busy household — and a freelance writer who specializes in testing and reviewing many home and furniture products — I found it to be an excellent solution for adding shelving in a small space without spending thousands of dollars or ripping out walls. Better yet, it was easy to assemble and elevated the entire look of my bathroom. I only wish I hadn't waited five years to try it.\n\nUmbra's Bellwood shelf is a sleek, stylish storage solution for small bathrooms.\n\nThe last time I used an over-the-toilet storage rack was in college. One narrow bathroom counter wasn't going to cut it with four girls, and we picked up a cheap metal rack that I happily parted ways with after graduation. Far from what I used in my undergrad days, Umbra's Bellwood Shelf offers a grown-up solution to the storage space problem.\n\nThe shelf arrived in a box that was taller than me — at 5'7,'' I estimated that the shipment stood around 6 feet tall. It was packaged efficiently, with each piece packed tightly in cardboard or styrofoam. Nothing arrived broken or scratched.\n\nI decided to challenge myself to build the shelf in the approximately 30 to 40 minutes I had between my husband leaving to pick up our kids from school and returning home. At that point, my task would assuredly turn into pure chaos.\n\nI opened the box to find multiple planks of wood, 10 bags of small tools and parts, and only one page of slightly vague, image-led directions. I immediately worried I should have kicked the job off earlier.\n\nFortunately, my pangs of regret were unnecessary. Once I understood the gist of the directions and got going, things moved quickly. I'm not the most handy person, and usually leave heavy assembly to my husband, yet I only experienced a single hiccup while building the shelf. .\n\nAll in, from opening the box to standing back to admire my work took 40 minutes — and successfully before my kids got home.\n\nBefore adding the shelf, I had no storage in this bathroom. Zero. Zip.\n\nThe exposed piping under the sink counter and the fact that my bathroom was oddly shaped with one slanted wall had me scratching my head for solutions. I could have inserted a slim storage caddy with drawers or a cart with shelves next to the toilet, but it felt like too much of a squeeze.\n\nThat's why this shelf is such a unicorn.\n\nIt helped me to add storage in a small space where it completely didn't exist previously, while also working well in an awkwardly-shaped area. Everything was added vertically, leaving the bathroom feeling clean and uncluttered.\n\nPlus, over-the-toilet shelves are widely recommended by interior designers, who agree they fit well over any standard toilet without taking up additional room. As such, I think the Umbra Bellwood is a great choice for anyone who wants to add space-saving storage in bathrooms that have tight nooks or untraditionally-shaped dimensions.\n\nOnce the Bellwood shelf was in place, it felt like my bathroom had been missing a vital piece for five years. The light natural wood was nearly identical to my countertop and took the bathroom from stark to styled. On top of the three wooden tiers, I added a long, leafy plant for a burst of color, as well as candles and a basket filled with toilet rolls and miscellaneous small items, which had previously been positioned next to the sink.\n\nInitially, I worried that adding an open shelf might introduce clutter without the safety of cabinet doors to hide behind. But adding these select pieces felt curated and transformed the space into something that looked like it was created by a designer — except I didn't hire one. Nor did I have to take on any pricey remodeling to add cabinetry.\n\nWhile I have noticed that the legs wobble a tad, everything has stayed in place. Overall, the shelf feels pretty sturdy, with each shelf capable of holding 29 pounds. According to Umbra, the shelf is sourced from a combination of \"renewable wood sources\" as opposed to 100% solid wood. Despite being made from MDF, it's sturdier than you might think.\n\nWhile I didn't initially plan to place a shelf in my bathroom — evidenced by the five years I neglected the room, despite it being a high-traffic area for guests — I'm so glad I did. I just wish I had added it sooner.\n\nI'm in love with the overall style of my bathroom, and the fact that I finally have a designated place to store toilet paper rolls, toiletries, and anything else without adding cabinets or crowding the sink with bulky baskets is an added bonus. I also think the shelves offer ample space to add items without appearing cluttered.\n\nWhile the natural wood color was a great fit for my bathroom, I also appreciate that it's available in a darker walnut shade. The classic, slightly rustic hue will add versatility for many home styles. Overall, this shelf is a great choice for anyone looking to quickly add storage and maximize a small bathroom without spending a ton of money",

    "title": "A startup wants to beat Airbus and Boeing with an ultra-wide 'flying wing' jet with massive cargo space",
    "description": "The CEO said Horizon's redesign with two decks across an ultra-wide cabin captures lucrative cargo space that is unavailable on exisiting narrobodies.",
    "fullText": "Airbus' CEO recently said the future of flying is a B2-bomber-shaped \"blended-wing body\" plane with passengers housed inside the plane's one giant wing for maximum efficiency.\n\nAleksey Matyushev, the CEO of the US aerospace startup Natilus, told Business Insider that his company has taken that vision one step further by redesigning its proposed blended-wing plane, Horizon, with plans to offer more lucrative cargo space while still delivering the 50% lower operating costs and up to 250 seats previously promised.\n\nInstead of the single-deck seating layout originally planned, the newly unveiled Horizon Evo — which the company expects to enter service as soon as the early 2030s — reimagines what cargo-heavy passenger jets can look like by adding a \"dual-deck\" layout.\n\nSo far, Natilus' blended-wing vision is just a sketch on paper, and a mini-sized prototype it's been flying; actually developing and certifying the new plane type and getting it into the air is a much longer road.\n\nStill, the dual-deck idea should be familiar to regulators and airlines, as it is the configuration of traditional tube-and-wing jets where passengers sit in a single level above the cargo hold. When installed on an ultra-wide blended-body, it results in a very cargo-heavy plane.\n\nEvo is expected to boast 2,600 cubic feet of dedicated cargo space on the lower level. For context, most Boeing 737s or Airbus A320s, which are at least 10 feet longer but have a cabin roughly half as wide despite similar wingspans, offer between roughly 1,300 and 1,800 cubic feet of belly cargo space.\n\nThis cargo focus comes at a time when belly freight has become one of the most reliable money-makers in aviation (e-commerce helped keep airlines afloat during the pandemic). The lure could help break the Airbus-Boeing duopoly while also addressing a projected shortfall of roughly 15,000 narrow-body aircraft over the next two decades.\n\n\"The market has gravitated toward a single-deck [blended-wing] layout because it's simpler to design and build in many ways, but I just don't see it as operationally better,\" Matyushev said.\n\nCalifornia-based competitor JetZero, for example, is developing a single-deck version. Company leaders have previously said there is a lower deck for the landing gear and some cargo containers, but it could move that floor up to create more space.\n\nMaking a dual-deck layout in a blended-wing aircraft is challenging. Unlike conventional jets, the design spreads volume horizontally rather than vertically, and stacking passengers above a cargo deck in this uniquely triangular-shaped airframe requires careful structural and engineering solutions.\n\nEvo's cargo economics could shake up the market for freight-reliant carriers. With roughly 11,000 cubic feet of cargo space across its two levels, Matyushev said Evo could serve as a dedicated freighter — potentially replacing planes like the Boeing 757.\n\n\"There's a huge product gap left behind by the 757; companies like UPS and FedEx heavily rely on that configuration,\" Matyushev said. \"Evo has the same volumetric capacity as a 757 but in a smaller airframe.\"\n\nBeyond cargo, Matyushev said the plane's unique geometry would similarly enhance the customer experience: airlines could fit the wide upper level with unique living spaces, such as a playroom or mini-offices.\n\nHe added that the economy cabin would feature more overhead bins and three aisles for better comfort, door access, and safety during evacuations: \"It'd have four sets of three seats across, which is close to the A380,\" Matyushev said, referring to the superjumbo's possible 11-abreast seats.\" We're thinking about it like a widebody layout in a narrow-body type of footprint.\"\n\nMatyushev also said that Evo would have windows — something Airbus' top executive warned could be absent from some blended-wing designs. A windowless passenger jet could create a claustrophobic environment, and flight attendants may struggle to see outside as easily during an emergency.\n\nNatilus doesn't have a prototype of Evo, but a subscale model of its blended-wing cargo plane, called Kona, has been test-flying since 2023. Kona has secured orders from companies like US-based Ameriflight and Canada-based Norlinor, while Indian carrier SpiceJet has signed a conditional deal for 100 Evos.\n\nNatilus has raised $28 million in Series A financing to support its first full-scale Kona prototype and further development of Evo. It typically costs billions of dollars to develop passenger-ready commercial jetliners, and Natilus has a long way to go.\n\nThe 737 Max cost around $2 billion to develop (before safety issues and the subsequent global grounding forced Boeing to redesign the plane). It was built on an older airframe that cost around $1.1 billion, in inflation-adjusted dollars, to develop. Meanwhile, the Airbus A320neo cost just over $1 billion to develop; it was also built on an older airframe, that originally cost around $3 billion to develop.\n\nNatilus isn't the only company betting on a Jetsons-like blended-wing aircraft. United Airlines has tentatively committed to buying up to 200 of JetZero's \"Z4,\" which it previously described to Business Insider as a \"living room in the sky.\"\n\nAirbus has also been developing a commercial flying wing since 2017 as part of its ZEROe program, which aims to build zero-emission airlines powered by hydrogen rather than traditional jet fuel. That project flew a demonstrator in 2019 but has since been delayed at least a decade from its initial 2035 timeline.",

    "description": "In our 3D space, elementary particles neatly filter into either bosons or fermions. But in lower dimensions, that distinction gets a bit murky.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when reading this story:\n\nIn three-dimensional particle physics, elementary particles divide nicely into fermions and bosons. But in lower-dimensions, things aren’t so clear cut.\n\nThese dimensions host a “third kingdom” of quasiparticles known as anyons, which have properties that sit between the quantum description of fermions and boson.\n\nIn 2020, scientists found the experimental existence of an anyon in two-dimensional space, and in two new studies, scientists describe the existence of tunable anyons in one-dimensional space (and describe their properties).\n\nWhen you drill down into the very fabric of reality—where elementary particles make up the matter that is you and me and everything around us in three-dimensional space—things get divided nicely into two categories: fermions and bosons. These two categories of particles are defined primarily by their atomic spin (in quantum mechanical terms), with bosons (photons, gluons, Higgs boson, W bosons, and Z bosons) having integer spin values and fermions (protons, neutrons, electrons, neutrinos) having half-integer spin values. While two bosons can occupy the same quantum state (which is why photons can pass through each other), two fermions can not—a good thing, since if they could, you’d fall through the floor right now.\n\nBut as is true of most things in science, things don’t always line up so neatly. For example, for half a century, scientists have known about the anyon, which exists in two-dimensional space. This quasiparticle is essentially anything between a boson and a fermion, which explains why American physicist Frank Wilczek named them “any-ons,” or simply anyons. However, it wasn’t until 2020 that these weird particles were observed experimentally in one-atom thick (two-dimensional) semiconductors. “We had bosons and fermions, and now we’ve got this third kingdom,” Wilczek said at the time. “It’s absolutely a milestone.”\n\nNow, scientists from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) and the University of Oklahoma report the existence of a one-dimensional system in which anyons can exist. In two separate papers—both published in the journal Physical Review A—the researchers describe the recipe for adjustable anyons and their theoretical properties, exploring a new corner of this “third kingdom” of elementary particles.\n\n“Every particle in our universe seems to fit strictly into two categories: bosonic or fermionic. Why are there no others?” Thomas Busch, a co-author of both studies from OIST, said in a press statement. “With these works, we’ve now opened the door to improving our understanding of the fundamental properties of the quantum world and it’s very exciting to see where theoretical and experimental physics take us from here.”\n\nAnyons only exist in lower dimensions because, to put it very simply, particles in those dimensions have fewer options for moving around. Raúl Hidalgo-Sacoton (a Ph.D. student at OIST) describes the “exchange factor” that exists in 3D space—the property demanding that when two electrons swap places, they must obey a simple rule governing the mathematical statistics of the event: Its square must be equal to 1, meaning that all particles are either -1 (fermions) or 1 (bosons).\n\nIn two dimensions, however, it’s not so simple: “To satisfy the law of indistinguishability, we need exchange factors over a continuous range to account for the exchange, dependent on the exact twists and turns of the paths,” Hidalgo-Sacoto said in a press statement. And whatever lies in that range between -1 and 1 is considered an anyon.\n\nIn this study, Busch, Hidalgo-Sacoto, and their colleague Doerte Blume (from the University of Oklahoma) found that this boson-fermion binary remains broken in one dimension, and they even discovered a method to specifically tune the exchange factor. Because of their limited movement in one dimension, particles must pass through each other, and this causes the exchange factor to differ from higher dimensions. This is likely connected to the strength of the short-range interaction between the particles.\n\n“We’ve identified not only the possibility of existence of one-dimensional anyons, but we’ve also shown how their exchange statistics can be mapped,” Busch said in a press statement. “We’re thrilled to see what future discoveries are made in this area, and what it can tell us about the fundamental physics of our universe.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "Yeli Heidecker and her husband built her mom a tiny home themselves to cut costs. They love the space, but they learned a few lessons along the way.",
    "fullText": "Yeli Heidecker and her husband had no experience with small spaces when they decided to build a tiny home for her mom in the fall of 2025.\n\nThey didn't let that stop them, though. The Heideckers learned on the job and, despite their inexperience, finished the build in just eight weeks. Everything worked out great — for the most part.\n\nHere are the biggest lessons Heidecker took away from building her first tiny home.\n\nHeidecker's mother had been living in an RV on the 32-year-old content creator and her husband's two-acre property in Texas when they decided to build her something more permanent.\n\nTheir solution was a tiny home — or, as they like to call it, a tiny casita — designed to be a mini version of the barndominium Heidecker and her husband live in with their four children.\n\nHeidecker said they were originally quoted between $63,000 and $97,000 to have professionals build the entire house. To cut costs, she and her husband did nearly all of the work themselves on the 400-square-foot tiny home. They only brought in an expert to build the shell and lay the concrete foundation.\n\nThey built it in just eight weeks for around $33,000, saving at least $30,000.\n\nHeidecker and her husband had never built a tiny home before taking on the project.\n\nAnd while the house has been working great for Heidecker's mom since it was mostly finished in November 2025, there are some tweaks they would consider now that they have a complete build under their belts.\n\n\"Even when you are very intentional about building something, there's going to be something that you're like, 'Man, I wish I would have done this differently,'\" Heidecker said. \"That's why you live and learn.\"\n\nThe Heideckers hired someone to build the shell of the tiny house, including the concrete foundation, since they didn't have the experience to construct it themselves.\n\nLooking back, Heidecker wishes he had either poured a thicker layer of concrete or raised the foundation so it wasn't as close to the ground.\n\n\"When we talked to the guy who built the shell for us, he said, 'This should be fine. We don't need to raise it anymore,'\" Heidecker said. \"We fell for that, and we definitely should have gone with our gut and raised the concrete more just to avoid it from flooding or anything like that.\"\n\nFlood damage is their biggest concern, but Heidecker said they worry that even watering the grass in the backyard could inadvertently lead to damage to the house. They're planning to flatten out the ground around the tiny home to protect it, but it would have been easier if it had just been positioned higher to begin with.\n\n\"It's the foundation, so it's extremely important to keep that in mind,\" she advised.\n\nAlthough the tiny home's size works for Heidecker's mother now, she thinks they should have made it a bit larger to be more functional in the long term.\n\nSpecifically, Heidecker wished the bedroom and bathroom were slightly bigger so they could be completely ADA accessible if her mom needed to use a walker or wheelchair down the line. The shower entrance was designed for accessibility, but the doorways and size of the bedroom weren't.\n\n\"It could have been like $2,000 to $3,000 more if we had gone maybe 2 feet more on each side,\" she said, which would have made the house closer to 500 square feet instead of 400.\n\nThey were trying to be budget-conscious during the project, but Heidecker thinks it would have been worth spending more money up front to avoid having to adapt the tiny home down the line.\n\nShe recommends thinking about how your tiny structure will function long-term if you're building your own.\n\nThe Heidecker family's home sits on two acres, and they built the tiny home parallel to theirs.\n\nThey like that the homes are close together, particularly because Heidecker's children often visit their grandmother. However, after they built her house, they realized it obstructed the main home's view of the sunset.\n\n\"At some point we did mention like, 'Oh man, we probably could have done it a little bit more to the left or a little bit more back for our own views,'\" she said. \"The sun sets on that side, and now the casita is right there.\"\n\nHeidecker said the obstructed view isn't a big deal, but if they were building the tiny home from scratch, they would likely place it in a slightly different spot. That could have also been beneficial if they ever want to use the space as a rental property, as it would give the renter and the Heidecker family more privacy between the two homes.\n\n\"Be extremely sure where you're going to put the unit,\" she advised.\n\nNow that she has a tiny house build under her belt, Heidecker recommends others be flexible when taking on their own projects.\n\n\"Be patient and be open to pivoting or making changes in the middle of it based on either budget or timing,\" she said. \"I think it's very important.\"\n\nFor instance, the Heidecker family's build was initially supposed to take six weeks but ended up taking eight, and they were slightly over budget.\n\nDespite the hiccups, Heidecker and her family love the tiny house, and they're proud of the results. It's working great for Heidecker's mom, and it even withstood the cold when Texas got hit with a winter storm in January.\n\n\"It worked like a champ,\" Heidecker said. \"My mom was like, 'It was so warm. It was so cozy.' I was like, 'Man, we could have just been in here all day.'\"",

    "description": "In this post, we discuss how the ongoing war in Ukraine has led to a significant decline in the amount of IPv4 address space announced by Ukrainian Autonomous Systems (ASes), and why those addresses are often now being announced by western ISPs and major public clouds.",
    "fullText": "In this post, we discuss how the ongoing war in Ukraine has led to a significant decline in the amount of IPv4 address space announced by Ukrainian Autonomous Systems (ASes), and why those addresses are often now being announced by western ISPs and major public clouds.\n\nThe internet of Ukraine, noted for its resilience in the initial months following the Russian invasion, has been profoundly affected by three years of war. One notable change has been the exodus of a vital national commodity: IPv4 addresses.\n\nIn this blog post, we highlight several cases in which large amounts of IPv4 space, formerly originated by prominent Ukrainian ASes, have moved out of the country (often with the help of IPv4 brokers) to dozens of new origins, including major cloud providers, hosting operations, and international telecoms. The result is a dramatic reduction in Ukraine’s footprint in the global routing table — a new consequence of a protracted war in the digital age.\n\nUsing the top 100 retail providers in Ukraine listed in Kentik Market Intelligence, we observed an 18.5% decline in the amount of announced IPv4 space between February 2022 and May 2025.\n\nBut before we get into the various examples of Ukrainian providers leasing out their IPv4 resources around the world, we should mention up front that there are many providers that have not participated in this practice and are originating exactly the same (or very nearly the same) routes as they did before the Russian invasion in 2022.\n\nThe top Ukrainian providers that did not change are listed below, ranked in descending order by the equivalent number of /24s of IPv4 they originated in February 2022:\n\nUkrtelecom (Укртелеком) is the incumbent telecommunications company of Ukraine and is represented in the global routing table by the ASNs 6849 and 6877. In the past three years, the amount of IPv4 address space announced by these ASes has dropped dramatically, with much of the lost IP space migrating out of the country, if not the region entirely.\n\nAS6849 is the primary ASN for Ukrtelecom, which has experienced a marked decline in the amount of IPv4 space it originates in the past three years. AS6849 went from originating the equivalent of 4,728 /24s to only 1377 — a decline of 71%.\n\nWhile much of the decline in originated address space is no longer routed at all, a significant portion of the decline is now originated by various companies outside of Eastern Europe. In fact, there are currently over 100 ASNs that originate IPv4 space announced by AS6849 three years ago.\n\nWho is announcing Ukrtelecom IPv4 space? 92 /24s of IPv4 space are now originated by AS174 (example 91.124.96.0/22), 77 /24s are announced by AS16509 (ex: 91.124.133.0/24) and even AT&T (AS7018, example 91.124.2.0/24) announces 29 /24s. Below is a screenshot from the bgp.tools web utility showing the address range originated by AS7018 and registered to Ukrtelecom. Even passive DNS for this prefix echoes a previous life with the Ukrainian incumbent.\n\nIf we do a whois on this range, we can see that it is currently registered as “ATT-CT.” The highlighted fields indicate that IPv4 broker IPXO (AS834) had a hand in leasing this IPv4 space to a new customer, who is now getting the route originated by AS7018.\n\nPictured below, Ukrtelecom’s sister ASN (6877) experienced an even more dramatic decline over the past three years. On Feb 1, 2022, AS6877 originated 38 prefixes equivalent to 616 /24s of IPv4 space. Now, AS6877 has all but disappeared from the global routing table (except as the contents of an AS-SET for a couple of prefixes).\n\nIn November 2024, this IPv4 space began getting originated by numerous ASes outside of Ukraine. At present, there are over 50 unique origins for these IPv4 ranges including familiar ASNs like 7018 (ex: 46.203.225.0/24), 3356 (ex: 46.203.68.0/22), 174 (ex: 46.203.81.0/24), 5511 (ex: 46.203.86.0/24), 6461 (ex: 46.202.84.0/24), 3257 (ex: 46.202.56.0/24), and 7029 (ex: 46.203.6.0/24).\n\nIn response to an inquiry about the leasing of IPv4 space, a representative of Ukrtelecom confirmed to me that this was an action taken to raise funds during an ongoing war.\n\nYes, this was a necessary step taken during wartime to secure financial stability and continue delivering essential services to our customers.\n\nLeasing out a portion of our IPv4 resources allowed us to mitigate some of the extraordinary challenges we have been facing since the full-scale invasion began.\n\nAt the same time, Ukrtelecom remains committed to maintaining and expanding internet infrastructure across Ukraine, especially through fiber rollout, which remains our strategic priority.\n\nWe appreciate the attention to this issue and are open to further dialogue on how Ukrainian telecoms are adapting in these unprecedented times.\n\nOlena Shramko\n\nPR Director\n\nUkrtelecom\n\nAccording to published rates from IPv4 brokers, a /24 (256 addresses) can be leased for $100–$150 per month. Based on the analysis above, Ukrtelecom is leasing the equivalent of 1500 /24’s (~1000 from former AS6849 IPv4 space and another ~500 from AS6877). If we assumed the low end of that price range, that would be US$150,000 (or ₴6,288,00) of additional revenue per month for the country’s national operator.\n\nIn another example, AS43310 began 2022 originating 3 prefixes equivalent to 24 /24s of IPv4: 91.225.224.0/22, 91.197.4.0/22, and 188.191.96.0/20. By November 2022, things had begun to change as this address space began to be parceled out to over a dozen new origins, with AS7018 currently the primary origin for these former Ukrainian IPv4 ranges.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, AS34092 was originating 6 IPv4 prefixes equivalent to 58 /24s of IP space until the beginning of March that year, when it disappeared from the routing table. Some routes were shifted to sister AS, 57033, but by June 2022, the address space was being farmed out to numerous ASes.\n\nAS57033, for its part, began 2022 by announcing 21 IPv4 prefixes equivalent to 48 /24s of IP space (some overlapping with AS34092). But by December 2024, AS57033 disappeared as well and now all of IPv4 space originated by these two ASNs in 2022 is now originated by 37 ASNs including AS8075 (ex: 81.22.128.0/24), AS7018 (ex: 81.22.129.0/24), AS3320 (ex: 109.72.116.0/24), and AS16509 (ex: 31.43.161.0/24).\n\nIn my blog post from February 2023 about the Russification of IP registrations, I highlighted a route (151.0.0.0/20) originated by AS45025, which had its country field updated from “UA” to “RU” in July of 2022 as part of a larger effort to assimilate newly Russian-held territories.\n\nIn fact, the RIPE database has been altered as well. Below is the output of a whois command I ran in 2023 that was featured in the blog post.\n\nIf you were to run the same command today, you would get a message saying that the object was deleted on April 4, 2024. The evidence of the prior existence as a prefix of Ukraine has been purged from the records.\n\nWell, AS45025 no longer exists in the global routing table. The IPv4 space it was originating in 2022 has been divvied up among providers in the Russian-held region of Donetsk, as well as a few global telecoms such as AS7018 (ex: 93.89.216.0/24), AS5511 (ex: 91.193.252.0/24), and AS2914 (ex: 93.89.218.0/24).\n\nDepicted below, AS42430 was a service provider based in the Lugansk region of Ukraine, along the front lines of battle between Ukrainian and Russian forces. The ASN disappeared from the global routing table in March 2022, and with it, the seven prefixes equivalent to 37 /24s of IPv4. In September 2022, parts of these ranges began to be originated by new origins, including Bursabil Teknoloji (AS60721), a Turkish IPv4 broker.\n\nIn 2023, IPv4 broker IPXO, and US telecom icons Sprint and AT&T were among the origins for the former Lugansk IPv4 space. Still, the primary origin that emerged for these IPs was Paltel (AS12975) of the Palestinian Territories, which currently originates nearly all of it. According to RIPE NCC’s published transfer statistics, 188.0.112.0/20 and 188.0.96.0/20 were transferred from Byte-SD to Paltel on January 6, 2023.\n\nAS43554 was a service provider operating in Mariupol, originating the equivalent of 259 /24s of IPv4 at the beginning of 2022. Trinity went offline in early March of 2022 during the bloody siege of the city.\n\nJust like with the previous example, IPv4 space previously originated by AS43554 started to be originated by as many as 54 ASes outside of Ukraine. This phenomenon continued until the beginning of 2024, when a large portion of the address space was consolidated into Ukrainian content provider Sweet (AS204384).\n\nDuring the summer of 2023, I noticed some of Trinity’s IPv4 space being originated by AT&T (screenshot below).\n\nIn fact, one of the address ranges had been registered as “AT&T Services, Inc.” in a likely attempt to use it for a residential proxy.\n\nCyberintelligence firm Spur summarizes the problems posed by proxy services this way:\n\nResidential proxies have long been used for illicit activity on the internet, including web scraping, scalping tickets to your favorite concerts, pushing spam to forums and social media, new account fraud and account takeovers. It involves hijacking what otherwise is legitimate infrastructure, allowing bad actors to mask their actual IP addresses with those associated with genuine customers your business would otherwise welcome.\n\n“Residential proxies” are so named because they utilize IP addresses that an Internet Service Provider has assigned to a household, as opposed to a business or datacenter. This makes them appear more legitimate and allows them to evade detection by legacy geolocation and fraud services or IP quality score providers like MaxMind or Transunion (formerly Neustar).\n\nI brought this to a contact at AT&T and within a few weeks it was gone.\n\nAlso based in Mariupol, AS24881 was originating six prefixes equivalent to 76 /24s of IPv4 back in 2022. As illustrated below, AS24881 and the IPv4 space it originated disappeared from the global routing table in March of that year.\n\nAS24881’s IPv4 space wouldn’t be seen again until February 2023 when it was originated by Linknet (AS57460), a service provider based in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in the Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast. During 2023, this address space was originated by as many as 20 different origins, as is illustrated below.\n\nIn May 2022, Russian forces rerouted internet service to the occupied southern city of Kherson through Miranda-Media (AS201776) in Russian-occupied Crimea. I detailed the switchover in a blog post and in a collaboration with The New York Times that landed on the front page of the newspaper.\n\nThe first provider in Kherson to make the switch to Russian transit was SkyNet (aka KhersonTelecom, AS47598), whose owner took to Facebook to explain his rationale for reconnecting his service through Russia. “On April 30, EVERYTHING fell!” he said, adding that he had no choice but to “turn on the circuit of the Crimean operator Miranda.” While some local residents thanked him, others accused him of using “enemy internet”, a decision he defended in the post.\n\nIn November 2022, Ukrainian forces retook Kherson Oblast above the Dnieper River, and most providers switched back to using Ukrainian transit to connect to the global internet. It was at that time that AS47598 disappeared from the global routing table. In April 2024, the one prefix (91.206.110.0/23) that had been originated by AS47598 in 2022 reappeared as originated by NTT (AS2914), where it continues to be announced today.\n\nIn April 2025, KhersonTelecom transferred its three IPv4 ranges (including 91.206.110.0/23) to a new owner. All three are hosting proxy services according to cyberintelligence firm Spur.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, I published the first analysis of the emerging private market for IPv4. The analysis was the basis for our talk at RIPE 70 in Amsterdam that year. Following years of debate on the matter, the RIPE NCC created a process for facilitating the sale of IPv4 space, creating a new player in the internet ecosystem: the IPv4 broker.\n\nOne of the first IPv4 brokers to emerge was a Romanian outfit so prolific that roughly half of the transfers recorded by RIPE that year were from that country alone. In fact, the footprint of the Romanian internet in the global routing table shrank by a quarter in 2015 as every bit of the country’s IPv4 space that wasn’t being actively used was sold off — mainly to Saudi Arabia and Iran, which was the subject of my collaboration with the Washington Post later that year.\n\nSomething similar has been happening to Ukraine’s footprint in the global routing table, but for different reasons. Weary from years of missile strikes and aerial bombardment, conditions are tough in many parts of the country. If leasing out parts of their IP resources keeps the business afloat and employees paid, who can blame these providers?\n\nBut questions arise. Are IPv4 brokers taking advantage of the situation by leasing out so much of Ukraine’s IPv4 space? Or are the brokers vital “to secure financial stability” for Ukrainian ISPs? Who is responsible when these ranges are used for various proxy services that cause problems on the internet?\n\nAt APRICOT in 2024, APNIC Chief Scientist Geoff Huston asked whether we have reached peak IPv4, citing a recent decline in the amount of routed IPv4. In another talk (slide 6), he cited the decline in the market price for IPv4, theorizing that perhaps demand was waning as IPv6 was utilized more (or NAT was becoming more acceptable). But another reason could be that the market is being flooded with supply from Ukraine.",

    "title": "The Easiest (and Cheapest) Ways to Turn Your Attic Into Useful Storage Space",
    "description": "Finishing an attic is expensive and time-consuming, but if all you need is a little extra storage, it's not necessary.",
    "fullText": "If you own a home with an unfinished attic, you’ve probably thought about all that precious space and how you might make it more useful. Your attic already serves an important purpose in temperature and moisture regulation in the house, of course, but that doesn’t mean it can’t do more. If you’ve got the budget, you can transform an attic into a bedroom or office space, or a crisp, well-lit storage option.\n\nIf you don’t have the budget to really build out your attic, though, you can still make it into a more useful space, even if it’s small or slightly scary. With just a few modest purchases (and possibly some sweat equity), you can make your attic an ideal storage space.\n\nYour first step towards making your attic useful is to make it safe to walk around. Even if your attic is shallow and standing up straight is impossible, having a stable surface will reduce your chances of falling through the ceiling.\n\nPutting down plywood or oriented strand board (OSB) is a cheap and relatively easy option, but it’s also labor-intensive and pretty permanent. If you want a faster solution, floor panels like these from Attic Dek are sized to fit most standard joist spacings and are designed to just snap together, allowing you to quickly drop a floor into place without needing to cut them. They come with screws, and it’s a good idea to secure them in place, but if you just need a temporary floor that can bear weight (up to 250 pounds) you can just click them into place and bolt them down later.\n\nIf your attic isn’t wired up or lacks light fixtures, you don’t need to hire an electrician and spend a mountain of cash. Just pick up one or two of these rechargeable ceiling lights and stick them to the ceiling or overhead joist (literally—you place a magnetic sticker on the ceiling and that holds the light in place—no screws required). It’s motion-activated, so every time you haul yourself up into the attic, the light will come on and save you from stumbling about in the dark.\n\nOnce you have a sturdy, safe floor in your attic, you can start installing storage options. You could, of course, just pile up some boxes or bins and call it a day, but you can do a lot better than that without breaking the bank:\n\nInstalling some hanging rods designed for slanted surfaces (like an attic ceiling or rafters) will give you the option of hanging clothing or storage bags without cluttering up the floor.\n\nA few cheap, adjustable shelving units like this one can add all the shelf space you need to keep bins of stuff organized and off the floor, making it easy to store or retrieve items.\n\nIf your attic is tight and trusses make it difficult to store anything, you can install some truss-friendly shelving. This can be a relatively easy DIY job involving screwing some support brackets into the trusses (as seen here). If you don’t have a floor in your attic, you have to avoid placing heavy storage boxes or bins directly on insulation—compressed insulation isn’t very effective. You can purchase some truss brackets that support plastic bins or other storage boxes off the floor.\n\nOnce you’ve got storage, you need a way to get stuff up into the attic, which can be more challenging than you expect. Carrying awkward, heavy boxes up flimsy, pull-down attic stairs is a recipe for accidents, so consider rigging up some mechanical assistance. You can spend a fair amount of money on a fancy lift system that will make bringing stuff up to your attic pretty easy, but if that’s too rich for your blood, you could opt for a simpler winch system that will allow you to haul up to 440lbs of stuff up there at a time. If that’s still a little too much, you could also opt for a classic pulley system, using good old-fashioned mechanical advantage to get your stuff up into the attic.",

    "fullText": "Over the past decade, sustained success in the NBA has demanded far more than star talent alone. Championship contention now hinges on organizational stability, roster continuity, advanced analytics, and the ability to evolve with the modern pace-and-space era. The teams with the highest winning percentages over the last ten years represent more than statistical excellence — they embody strategic vision, player development, and resilience across multiple playoff cycles.\n\nMORE: NBA championship chances by SportsLine\n\nAt the forefront stands the Boston Celtics, whose identity has been defined by elite two-way play and a culture built on defensive accountability and adaptability. Close behind, the Milwaukee Bucks transformed sustained regular-season dominance into championship glory behind the generational force of Giannis Antetokounmpo. In the Western Conference, the Denver Nuggets emerged as a model of patience and precision, with Nikola Jokić orchestrating one of the league’s most efficient offenses.\n\nMeanwhile, the Golden State Warriors extended their era-defining dominance through innovation and championship experience, fueled by the transformative shooting of Stephen Curry. Rounding out the group, the Los Angeles Clippers consistently fielded deep, versatile rosters capable of competing with any contender on a nightly basis.\n\nTogether, these franchises illustrate what sustained excellence looks like in today’s league — not just flashes of brilliance, but a decade of strategic execution, adaptability, and relentless competitiveness.\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .648\nBoston has been one of the NBA’s most consistent contenders, built around elite two-way wings. With multiple deep playoff runs and an NBA championship during this stretch, the Celtics combined defensive intensity with offensive versatility. Their culture of toughness kept them among the league’s elite.\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .608\nThe Bucks’ dominance was anchored by Giannis Antetokounmpo’s MVP-caliber performances. Milwaukee secured an NBA title and regularly finished near the top of the Eastern Conference standings. Their combination of size, defense, and star power made them perennial threats.\n\nMORE: NBA points per game season leaders before the 2026 All-Star weekend\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .608\nBehind Nikola Jokić’s brilliance, Denver became a championship-winning franchise. The Nuggets’ balanced roster and efficient offense culminated in an NBA Finals victory during the decade. Their patience in team-building paid off in sustained success.\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .606\nGolden State continued its dynasty run with another championship in this span. Stephen Curry’s shooting and championship experience kept the Warriors in contention despite injuries and roster changes. Their offensive system remained one of the most feared in basketball.\n\nMORE: NBA 2026 Slam Dunk contest participants\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .572\nThe Clippers consistently fielded competitive teams built around elite wing talent. Though a championship eluded them, they remained strong playoff participants year after year. Their depth and defensive versatility kept them among the Western Conference’s toughest squads.\n\nUltimately, the teams with the highest winning percentages over the past decade reveal a clear pattern: long-term success is rarely accidental. It is built through smart roster construction, elite player performance, and organizational commitment to evolution. While each franchise followed a different path — from dynastic continuity to patient rebuilding — they all achieved the same outcome: sustained relevance in the league’s most competitive era.

    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts are in a good position salary-cap-wise this offseason. However, there is always the opportunity to create more space, depending on how aggressive GM Chris Ballard wants to be.\n\nWhen owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon spoke with the media after the season, she mentioned how Ballard adapted his roster-building approach, which included being more aggressive.\n\nBallard then seemed to acknowledge that continuing down that path was going to be the plan this offseason.\n\nWhile veteran cuts are perhaps the most well-known avenue for creating cap space, and Michael Pittman could be one of those candidates, contract extensions are another way to generate space.\n\nAlthough a lot of new money is being added to the contract, there's also more years being added as well, creating a longer runway for current cap charges to be pushed to -- thus creating space in 2026.\n\nTwo contract extension candidates for the Colts are Jonathan Taylor and Quenton Nelson, both of whom are entering the final year of their current deals.\n\nTaylor put together yet another highly productive season in 2025. He finished the season with 1,585 rushing yards -- the third-most in football. He also led the league in total touchdowns.\n\nThe 2025 season was another very good one for Nelson as well. Among all guards this season, Nelson ranked fourth in pass-blocking efficiency and fourth in run-blocking grade.\n\nBoth players were Pro Bowlers, and Nelson was a second-team All-Pro.\n\nIf the Colts wanted to extend Taylor and maximize their cap-savings in the process, OTC projects that would create $8.62 million in cap savings. With Nelson, the Colts could potentially create up to $13.36 million in space.\n\nNow, the downside to this is that both players' cap charges down the road would be inflated even higher, but this offseason, it would give Ballard more cap flexibility to attack free agency.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: How Colts can create $21 million in added salary cap space",

    "description": "Touring Liberty Tiny Village, a tiny home village for older people, left me wondering what matters more in old age: extra space or a built-in community.",
    "fullText": "When I arrived at Liberty Tiny Village on a warmer than usual day in November, I thought I knew exactly what to expect.\n\nThe resort-style, 55-and-older tiny home community in Aubrey, Texas, markets itself as an upscale community for retirees or soon-to-be retirees ready to shed decades of belongings in exchange for a smaller, freer way of living.\n\nBut that's only part of the story.\n\nThat afternoon, I sat with two neighbors, widows Debbie Giamalva a retired intensive care nurse, and Sherry Miller, a retired English teacher. They told me that what they'd really found at Liberty wasn't just a smaller and more manageable home, but a caring group of friends who look out for one another.\n\nIt left me thinking about how much community matters as you age, especially when the house is quieter — when your partner is gone, and your children have lives of their own. In the moments that count, who do you turn to?\n\nLike many Texas cities and suburbs, Aubrey has been growing as people from nearby areas and high-cost states like California and New York move there seeking more affordable homes, lower taxes, and a lower overall cost of living.\n\nThose newcomers have fueled demand for every kind of housing, from apartment complexes and single-family homes to smaller, more affordable options like Liberty's tiny homes.\n\nLiberty Tiny Village was founded in 2022 and is owned by Melissa Hayes and her husband, Phillip. So far, it has 11 occupied lots.\n\nLiberty is one of several tiny-home communities that have sprung up across North Texas over the past decade, but it comes with a major perk: Because the homes are classified as recreational and can be moved, residents don't pay property taxes on them.\n\nThe village's homes are small — under 400 square feet — but not cheap; each costs between $75,000 and $160,000. Still, that's far less than the going rate in Aubrey, where Zillow put the median home-sale price at $303,550 and typical rent at $2,267 in December.\n\nKristene Newton, the village's tiny home designer, told me that most residents buy their homes outright. After that, their main monthly expense is $950 in lot rent, which covers water, sewer, trash, landscaping, and WiFi. For residents living on a mix of savings, investments, and Social Security, that kind of low and predictable bill can feel like a game changer.\n\n\"The senior community can get into one of these homes, pay for the home, and the lot rent is going to be cheaper than moving into an apartment—or sometimes even assisted living,\" Newton said.\n\nShe added that she's been shocked to see people sell million-dollar houses to get into the village's tiny homes.\n\nHayes and Newton pitch Liberty as a luxury tiny-home village. And unlike many communities I've visited around DFW, I have to agree — Liberty's homes look and feel deliberately upscale.\n\nEach of the village's homes has one to two bedrooms and one to one-and-a-half bathrooms. The primary bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and living area are always on the first floor — a design choice that makes sense for a 55+ community.\n\nHayes told me the homes typically have stairs up to the elevated entry, but owners can add a ramp.\n\n\"Even if they want to add it at the very beginning, or decide later as they get older, they can add it,\" she said.\n\nI wanted to get inside the tiny homes to see how they actually feel — and, honestly, to see whether I could picture myself living in one.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how upscale Liberty's tiny homes looked: high ceilings, granite countertops, gleaming gold or silver faucets, chandeliers, hardwood floors, and even electric fireplaces.\n\nThe living rooms and bedrooms felt about as big as some of my first apartments right out of college — just not nearly as well decorated.\n\nThis closet is definitely bigger than the one I had in college, but I still don't think all the things I've collected since then would fit in here.\n\nI toured about five different model homes. Two of the kitchens stood out, but my favorite was the one on the right, with darker cabinetry and appliances.\n\nI've been in hotel rooms with smaller bathrooms. I think this is a pretty decent size for a tiny home.\n\nI'm 5'10\", so tall ceilings are a must. I was shocked by how spacious the two-story models felt — I couldn't believe the entire tiny home fit into just 399 square feet.\n\nIf you're willing to pay extra, many floor plans also include a loft for storage or an extra sleeping spot.\n\nI have a bunch of younger cousins. I can totally picture one of them turning this loft space into a fort.\n\nBoth women came to Liberty for a similar reason — living alone in large homes had started to feel less like freedom and more like a liability.\n\n\"My husband passed away in 2021,\" Giamalva, 70, told me. \"What did I need with a second bedroom? I also didn't need a 900-square-foot apartment.\"\n\nGiamalva paid for her tiny home in full using the money she made from selling her previous house. With her highest fixed cost now the $950 monthly lot rent, she said moving to the village was a \"no-brainer.\"\n\nMiller arrived at a similar conclusion. She'd been living in a 2,200-square-foot house with a pool, but with her son miles away at Texas A&M, she said it no longer made sense to stay there.\n\nMiller told me that moving into a tiny home solved her problems. \"I sold my house, and I didn't owe anything; I didn't have a mortgage, so I was able to take that money, buy this, and have enough left to hopefully last me the rest of my life,\" she said.\n\n\"If something happened to you in your place, everybody would know if they didn't see you,\" Giamalva said.\n\nMiller, who told me she has health issues, echoed that sentiment.\n\n\"Not to be morbid, but when you get to be a certain age, and you're living alone, you think, 'If I fell — if, God forbid, something happened to me—nobody would know. Here, we just watch out for each other.\"\n\nAt Liberty, management plans monthly events — Thanksgiving dinners, for example, and most recently a chili cook-off. Residents also meet for Bible study and, when they can, walk their dogs together.\n\nThey even have a community group chat. \"We have a good chat going,\" Miller said. \"If you needed something, all you would need to do is put it on there — and I know somebody would help.\"\n\nFor me, that sounds like the main draw: the independence of having your own place, with the comfort of knowing you're not entirely on your own.\n\nGiamalva and Miller said they wouldn't get that same mix in an assisted-living facility or retirement home, where costs are higher, and it can be harder to build relationships — or even just get around.\n\n\"As you get older and retire, your body ages, but inside, we still feel young,\" Miller said. \"So I don't want to go to some home or an apartment for old people.\"\n\nFor many of Liberty's residents, living alone must feel liberating, especially in old age, when doing so is often treated as risky or even discouraged.\n\nIt must also feel empowering. Giamalva and Miller chose to give up their bigger lives for something smaller, a move that's both brave and practical.\n\nI'm still young and newly married, so I haven't spent much time thinking about what I'd do in their position — until now.\n\nLeaving the village, I kept turning these questions over: If I ever found myself in a similar chapter, would I make the same choice? And would the promise of community make it easier to give up extra space and the things I'd accumulated over a lifetime?",

    "description": "Elon Musk believes that space is the answer to the AI data center energy problem. SpaceX says it is hiring \"many engineers\" to make it happen.",
    "fullText": "To the world's richest man, all things eventually end in outer space.\n\nAs countries pour billions into new Earth-bound data centers in a global race for AI dominance, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk thinks the best way to conserve energy, money, and space is to put data centers in, well, space.\n\n\"In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,\" Musk wrote in a memo announcing that SpaceX would acquire his AI company, xAI, earlier this month.\n\nSpaceX says its goal is to launch a \"constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers,\" and it's now hiring to make it happen. Each will generate about 100 kW of compute power per ton and would add 100 gigawatts of AI compute capacity annually, the company says.\n\nLike many of Musk's ambitious ideas, some have questioned the viability of this one. Musk, typically, is undeterred. He doubled down on the plan this week on the Dwarkesh Podcast.\n\n\"You can mark my words. In 36 months, but probably closer to 30 months, the most economically compelling place to put AI will be space,\" Musk, who is famous for missing deadlines, said. \"It will then get ridiculously better to be in space.\"\n\nDwarkesh Patel, the host of the eponymous long-form tech podcast (he interviewed Musk for nearly three hours), challenged the SpaceX CEO on his plan to build data centers in space.\n\nPatel said energy use is only about 10% to 15% of the total cost of operating a data center, so while planting data centers in space would solve the cost-of-energy problem, the cost of maintenance and servicing them would presumably erase any savings.\n\nMusk said the plan was not about saving money on energy consumption, but about ensuring energy availability.\n\n\"If you look at electrical output outside of China, everywhere outside of China, it's more or less flat,\" Musk replied. \"If you're putting data centers anywhere except China, where are you going to get your electricity?\"\n\nData centers are resource-intensive.\n\nThe largest can consume as much power as a city and up to several million gallons of water a day. Collectively, Business Insider estimated in an investigation published last year, that US data centers could soon consume more electricity than Poland, with a population of 36.6 million, used in 2023.\n\nBusiness Insider's investigation found that companies had filed permits to build 311 data centers nationwide as of 2010. By the end of 2024, that number had nearly quadrupled to 1,240.\n\nAs of 2023, about 4.4% of total US electricity consumption came from data centers, according to the Department of Energy. Globally, data centers accounted for about 1.5% of global electricity consumption in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nMcKinsey and Company estimates that by 2030, data centers will require $6.7 trillion in investment worldwide to keep pace with demand for computing power.\n\nThe need for data centers is driving enormous spending among the big AI companies. Capital expenditures for Big Tech are expected to reach some $600 billion in 2026, with Amazon alone planning to spend $200 billion.\n\nSpaceX has already started hiring for its space-based data center project.\n\nMichael Nicolls, the vice president of Starlink Engineering, wrote in a post on X on Friday that the company is hiring for \"many critical engineering roles\" to develop space-bound data centers. One of them is for a \"Space Lasers Engineer\" based out of Redmond, Washington.\n\nLocating data centers in space might appeal to the communities, like Northern Virginia, where electricity costs are growing and housing developments are vying with data centers for land.\n\nFor Musk, the idea is simple. \"I mean, space is called 'space' for a reason,\" he wrote in SpaceX's memo.\n\nSpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "title": "Why Scientists Worry About Breaking News About Life in Space",
    "description": "The public could be frightened or skeptical. A lot depends on how scientists announce it—if they ever find life in space.",
    "fullText": "This is the center of the Heart Nebula or IC-1805 in the center is a cluster of stars known as Melotte 15. It is located in the Perseus Arm of the Galaxy in the constellation Cassiopeia. Credit - Getty Images; Javier Zayas\n\nWaiting for news about life on Mars? You’re 120 years late. That story broke on Dec. 9, 1906, when The New York Times ran a major piece under the brooking-no-argument headline, “There Is Life on the Planet Mars.” The proof? “The legions of canals on Mars” which are “an unanswerable argument for the existence of conscious, intelligent life.”\n\nSo…not so much. But the Times—and the world—got another crack at things 90 years later, on Aug. 6, 1996. That’s when NASA announced that chemicals and formations in a Martian meteorite that crash-landed on Earth 13,000 years ago were the fossilized remains of ancient bacterial life. It was a discovery that the newspaper said “is being hailed as startling and compelling evidence.”\n\nThe news was so extraordinary that Pres. Bill Clinton convened a Rose Garden press conference to discuss it. “If this discovery is confirmed,” he said, “it will surely be one of the most stunning insights into our universe that science has ever uncovered.”\n\nUltimately, it wasn’t confirmed, and the Mars rock remains something of an enigma, still pointed to as evidence of life by some, but rejected by most others. That leaves the question of life on Mars and elsewhere in the universe open and unsettled. And that, in turn, could spell trouble when the day at last comes that irrefutable proof of life is found and scientists, political leaders, and the media have to determine just how to announce the news to an unpredictable public that could respond with excitement, fear, suspicion, skepticism, or a whole range of other positive or problematic reactions.\n\n“The concept of aliens is deeply embedded into our popular culture and in our imagination,” says Brianne Suldovsky, associate professor in the Department of Communications at Portland State University. “And so people are likely to already have preexisting fears about those things based on the things they've seen in the media, the things they've read, other conspiracy beliefs they might have.”\n\nIn 2024, NASA took up the matter, convening a virtual astrobiology workshop called Communicating Discoveries in the Search for Life in the Universe. Over 100 experts including journalists, astrobiologists, social scientists, and communicators—among them, Suldovsky—attended the workshop online. Recently, Suldovsky and others co-authored a white paper published last fall in the journal Astrobiology exploring the workshop’s findings—and the stakes couldn’t be higher.\n\n“The search for life in space isn’t just a science question,” Suldovsky says. “It’s a moral question, it's a philosophical question, for some it’s a religious question. This has deep implications for our fundamental understanding of what it means to be human.”\n\nExtraterrestrial life can be discovered in one of two forms: alien biology or, more sensationally, alien technology. Much has been made in recent years of footage captured by Naval pilots of what appear to be flying objects diving, turning, and hovering in space in ways no known aircraft can manage. These unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP—today’s polite term for UFOs) created such a stir they were the subject of Congressional hearings in 2022. Lawmakers did not suss out just what the UAPs are, but Americans have apparently made up their minds. According to a 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center, 51% of respondents believe the UAPs are of extraterrestrial origin. At the NASA workshop, that news was met with incredulity.\n\n“Astrobiologists could not comprehend why the public would believe that,” says Suldovsky. “They said they were flabbergasted.”\n\nWhat makes the Pew finding particularly remarkable is that Americans are taking the idea of alien visitations with a decided sang-froid. Fully 87% of the people polled reported that if the craft are indeed alien, they pose no threat to Earth. Only 7% said they are unfriendly.\n\nDefinitive proof that the aliens move among us—one of those UAPs landing on a naval airstrip, say—could stir up an entirely different public reaction, including fear. That is where communicators could come in.\n\n“We saw this in COVID,” says Suldovsky. “When you’re communicating about a risk, it’s important to communicate what we know and, more importantly, what we don’t know and the steps that are being taken to protect the public interest. With intelligent life you’re talking about planetary protection. Managing public fear is going to be incredibly challenging, however it is possible to communicate in a way that at least gives the public information about how afraid they should be and what they can do to protect themselves.”\n\nThe discovery of microbial life in a rock on Earth like the 1996 meteorite will be a different matter. There may still be fear—in this case of contamination with an alien pathogen—but NASA scientists already proved themselves adept at keeping the public safe from alien rocks back in the Apollo days when they quarantined the 842 lbs. of moon samples the six lunar landing missions brought back, sealing them in a containment lab and working on them through glove boxes. Still, those safety measures will take some explaining.\n\n“We can’t assume the public understands that that’s kind of baked into the way we do this research,” Suldovsky says.\n\nAlien microbes or other biology could also be discovered remotely—on the life forms’ home planet—a less dramatic scenario than finding it on Earth. The white paper says that, “[C]ommunicators need to prepare the public to see ‘traces from faraway places before they see faces.’”\n\nTools for that kind of from-a-distance research are now being deployed. On Jan. 11, NASA launched the Pandora Space Telescope, which will search for signs of life on 20 different exoplanets—planets orbiting stars other than the sun—looking for the spectral signature of water vapor, methane, oxygen, or other chemistry associated with biology.\n\nIn October 2024, the Europa Clipper spacecraft was launched, bound for flybys of Jupiter’s moon Europa, which is covered in a rind of ice beneath which scientists believe lies a warm, salty, amniotic ocean that could harbor life. In April 2023, the European Space Agency launched its Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) spacecraft, which will study Europa and its sister moons Ganymede and Callisto, also looking for chemical signals of biology. All of this, says Suldovsky, means that the first signs of life in space are more likely than not to be a telltale wiggle on a chemical graph which suggests biology but doesn’t prove it. That will take some explaining.\n\n“Media coverage of these types of discoveries use words like [evidence] ‘consistent with life,’” she adds.\n\nIt can be challenging to clearly and simply relay this level of nuance to a public wanting blockbuster news, or a public that’s skeptical of science. And it requires a level of trust not just between the public and the experts, but between the experts and those communicating their science to the public.\n\nSince only a tiny share of people will ever read the published paper that reports the finding, it will be up to journalists—in print, online, on cable stations—to convey the news, and Suldovsky worries about how well that job will be done. “We hardly have science journalists anymore,” she says. “We have generalists who sometimes cover science. A lot of scientists I talked to are hesitant to talk to media outlets because they’re worried their science isn’t going to be accurately communicated.”\n\nDeadline pressures don’t help. Nor does the hunt for the quick and clicky headline that is going to attract eyeballs. “The challenge is amplified by media trends that often favor concise, exciting narratives over detailed explanations of ambiguity,” the white paper says.\n\nNASA has a solution for how best to study and communicate subtler astrobiological findings, known as the CoLD scale—short for confidence of life detection. The scale is made up of seven levels of scientific certitude, with level 1, the lowest, being “detection of a signal known to result from a biological activity;” to level 2, defined as “contamination [some flaw in the detection] is ruled out;” on up to level 4, “all known non-biological sources of signal shown to be implausible in that environment;” and finally to 7, “independent, follow-up observations of predicted biological behavior.” A scientist who makes it up to 7 gets to ring the biology bell—by which time layfolk who have been trying to follow the developing research may be thoroughly confused.\n\nOne way to combat that is to educate the public in advance, providing a steady stream of news releases even before the research begins, explaining the science in simple, descriptive language. This allows scientists to familiarize lay audiences with the work they’re doing and to “prebunk”—or proactively correct—misconceptions and rumors before any breakthroughs are announced. For that, the white paper recommends that a full-time communications professional be affiliated with any research team.\n\nAlso important is distinguishing between misinformation and disinformation and combating both. Misinformation is an honest misunderstanding of the science, while disinformation is deliberate misrepresentation in order to create a sensation or foster conspiracy theories. That’s especially easy to do with the increasing popularity of deep fakes and AI-generated images or videos.\n\nIt’s never too early to start the education process. The white paper recommends that curricula be established in primary and secondary schools to teach students about the scientific method, scientific skepticism, and the complex and often ambiguous nature of scientific evidence.\n\nJust how likely it is that life will be found depends on just which mission or research project is doing the searching. For now, the white paper points to three areas of research as having the greatest chance of yielding results: the study of icy moons by spacecraft like JUICE and Europa Clipper; the search for habitable, Earthlike worlds by spacecraft like Pandora; and efforts to bring Martian soil and rocks back to Earth with robotic spacecraft—a mission long in the planning at NASA. The authors of the paper call for communications professionals to be embedded with all three of these teams and prepared for anything they might uncover.\n\nIn a universe with many trillions of planets, there are surely non-zero odds that at least some of them, like our own world, are chemical kitchens that can cook up something living. There are non-zero odds too that earthly scientists will one day spot that life. Just as they are working to make that discovery, the public must work to understand it when it comes.\n\nWrite to Jeffrey Kluger at jeffrey.kluger@time.com.",

    "fullText": "Peruvian restaurant Lima Nation Peruvian Kitchen, which had operated at 2146 N. Collective Lane in Wichita since January 2024, abruptly closed early last month. And although the owners shared the news in a Facebook post on Jan. 9, they didn’t initially share the reason for the closing.\n\nNow, owners Karo and Carlos Barreda are clarifying why they made the decision to close, even though their restaurant got high marks from local diners.\n\nOn Wednesday, Carlos Barreda filed for Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy, citing total liabilities of $314,183.85 and total assets of $23,774.76. Contacted on Thursday, Karo Barreda responded with a statement that explained the filing.\n\n“It is part of the corporate and personal decisions required to close this chapter in an orderly and responsible way,” her statement read. “Significant efforts were made to sustain the restaurant and meet its obligations, but ultimately the operating costs made it impossible to continue.”\n\nThough they had to close the restaurant, Karo Barreda said, the couple isn’t finished with Wichita. Carlos is planning to start offering catering, private dinners and “more personalized events and collabs, with the intention of continuing to share Peruvian cuisine and culture with the community through a different format,” the statement read.\n\nThey will share more details as they solidify their plans, Karo Barreda wrote.\n\n“Wichita remains very important to us,” she said in the statement. “The next steps will continue to be connected to the community here, although the format will be more personal and gradual rather than a traditional restaurant space for now.”\n\nCarlos Barreda trained at the Le Cordon Bleu culinary school in Lima, Peru, and had been cooking and managing restaurants for more than 25 years when he arrived in Wichita and took over the old Lola’s Bistro space, which is tucked away in the Collective, an office and retail complex on 21st Street in between Greenwich and 127th Street North.\n\nIf the restaurant could have continued operating on good will alone, it would have, Karo Barreda said in the statement.\n\n“The closing of Lima Nation wasn’t due to a single reason, but rather a combination of factors inherent to the model we built: introducing a new culinary concept, working with high-quality ingredients, maintaining very high standards, and operating a restaurant closely tied to the direct work of the chef and the team in a non-commercial area. All of this made the project very intense and complex to sustain over time, even with the incredible and constant support from the community.\n\n“We leave deeply grateful to Wichita. The support from our guests, the outstanding reviews we received, and the connection we built with the city exceeded every expectation we had when we started. For us, the closure is one chapter, but not the end of the project,” she wrote.\n\nStay tuned \n\nWichitans win big on “Family Feud.” Here’s how to watch them defend their title:\n\nWhat happened to the 360 Deli & Grill at Kellogg and Greenwich?\n\nPizzeria opening across from East High will offer a different type of pie",

    "description": "Anthropic explains why Claude will remain ad-free—how advertising incentives conflict with building a genuinely helpful AI assistant users can trust.",
    "fullText": "There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them.\n\nAdvertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns, and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry.\n\nBut including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.\n\nWe want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.\n\nWhen people use search engines or social media, they’ve come to expect a mixture of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction.\n\nConversations with AI assistants are meaningfully different. The format is open-ended; users often share context and reveal more than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it’s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not.\n\nOur analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal—the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.\n\nWe still have much to learn about the impact of AI models on the people who use them. Early research suggests both benefits—like people finding support they couldn’t access elsewhere—and risks, including the potential for models to reinforce harmful beliefs in vulnerable users. Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results.\n\nBeing genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of Claude’s Constitution, the document that describes our vision for Claude’s character and guides how we train the model. An advertising-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle.\n\nConsider a concrete example. A user mentions they’re having trouble sleeping. An assistant without advertising incentives would explore the various potential causes—stress, environment, habits, and so on—based on what might be most insightful to the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: whether the conversation presents an opportunity to make a transaction. These objectives may often align—but not always. And, unlike a list of search results, ads that influence a model’s responses may make it difficult to tell whether a given recommendation comes with a commercial motive or not. Users shouldn’t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.\n\nEven ads that don’t directly influence an AI model’s responses and instead appear separately within the chat window would compromise what we want Claude to be: a clear space to think and work. Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement—for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics aren’t necessarily aligned with being genuinely helpful. The most useful AI interaction might be a short one, or one that resolves the user’s request without prompting further conversation.\n\nWe recognize that not all advertising implementations are equivalent. More transparent or opt-in approaches—where users explicitly choose to see sponsored content—might avoid some of the concerns outlined above. But the history of ad-supported products suggests that advertising incentives, once introduced, tend to expand over time as they become integrated into revenue targets and product development, blurring boundaries that were once more clear-cut. We’ve chosen not to introduce these dynamics into Claude.\n\nAnthropic is focused on businesses, developers, and helping our users flourish. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.\n\nExpanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do it without selling our users’ attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we’ve brought AI tools and training to educators in over 60 countries, begun national AI education pilots with multiple governments, and made Claude available to nonprofits at a significant discount. We continue to invest in our smaller models so that our free offering remains at the frontier of intelligence, and we may consider lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing where there is clear demand for it. Should we need to revisit this approach, we’ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.\n\nAI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help our users. We’re particularly interested in the potential of agentic commerce, where Claude acts on a user’s behalf to handle a purchase or booking end to end. And we’ll continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare, or buy products, connect with businesses, and more—when they choose to do so.\n\nWe’re also exploring more ways to make Claude a focused space to be at your most productive. Users can already connect third-party tools they use for work—like Figma, Asana, and Canva—and interact with them directly within Claude. We expect to introduce many more useful integrations and expand this toolkit over time.\n\nAll third-party interactions will be grounded in the same overarching design principle: they should be initiated by the user (where the AI is working for them) rather than an advertiser (where the AI is working, at least in part, for someone else). Today, whether someone asks Claude to research running shoes, compare mortgage rates, or recommend a restaurant for a special occasion, Claude’s only incentive is to give a helpful answer. We’d like to preserve that.\n\nWe want our users to trust Claude to help them keep thinking—about their work, their challenges, and their ideas.\n\nOur experience of using the internet has made it easy to assume that advertising on the products we use is inevitable. But open a notebook, pick up a well-crafted tool, or stand in front of a clean chalkboard, and there are no ads in sight.\n\nWe think Claude should work the same way.",

    "description": "Musk's memo announcing SpaceX and xAI's merger is full of space jargon. Here's your cheat sheet to bring the wonky language back down to Earth.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has never been shy about his inner nerd — just look at his SpaceX merger memo.\n\nOver the years, the billionaire has peppered his company communications with sci-fi culture Easter eggs, physics nerd jargon, and enough dad-joke flair to make comedian Nate Bargatze blush.\n\nSo it was no surprise that Musk's latest internal memo — announcing that SpaceX would merge with xAI — leaned into the kind of words and phrases that might cause you to scratch your head.\n\nIt reads less like a conventional corporate M&A announcement and more like a sci-fi manifesto, invoking \"sentient suns,\" orbital data centers, and humanity's destiny among the stars.\n\nForget \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" here is your hitchhiker's guide to Musk's memo.\n\nThe memo opens with a sci-fi banger, the kind of premise you'd find in a Hollywood script: Musk says his new vision for the combined company is to build a \"sentient sun.\"\n\nThe phrase is meant to convey scale. Musk is imagining an AI system so large, energy-hungry, and centralized that it metaphorically resembles a star. Except instead of radiating light and heat, this \"sun\" would beam computer-generated intelligence back to Earth.\n\nIt's a piece of sci-fi shorthand for extremely powerful, solar-fed AI.\n\nThis is where the memo goes full-on science nerd: \"Launching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization,\" Musk wrote.\n\nMusk is referencing the Kardashev scale, a '60s framework created by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev that ranks civilizations by the amount of energy they can harness. A Type I civilization can use all the energy available on its home planet. A Type II civilization can capture the full power output of its star.\n\nHumanity today is generally thought to sit somewhere below Type I.\n\nHere, Musk is proposing to move massive computing infrastructure — the power-hungry data centers popping up in rural America to fuel modern AI — off Earth and into orbit. In other words, data centers in space.\n\nIn space, he argues, those systems could rely on near-constant solar energy. As Musk put it elsewhere in the memo: \"It's always sunny in space.\"\n\nSpaceX essentially wants to build a floating gas station. Here, Musk describes a dedicated tanker-to-ship bot expected to roll out in 2026, per SpaceNews.\n\nRight now, rockets carry all of their fuel right from takeoff. This system would allow the company's spacecraft to optimize for other storage cabins.\n\nMusk is essentially a giant railgun designed to launch cargo into space using electricity instead of rocket fuel. It's reminiscent of an instrument in the 1937 science fiction novel \"Zero to Eighty.\"\n\nSpaceX is imagining building one on Earth's Moon, where lower gravity and the lack of an atmosphere would make it easier to fling materials into space.\n\nMusk ends the memo with a linguistic flourish.\n\nIt isn't the first time Musk has used the phrase. In 2014, he launched a Montessori-style school for children from 3 to 9 with the same name. The school's curriculum focused on STEM learning and problem-solving, according to its mission statement.",

    "description": "“My estimate is that within two to three years, the lowest cost way to generate AI compute will be in space,” Musk wrote in a post on SpaceX’s website on Monday.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk’s rocket company SpaceX has acquired xAI, the artificial intelligence firm founded by Musk three years ago, in a massive, and unconventional, deal that combines the two privately held firms into a company with an astounding $1.25 trillion reported valuation and plans for a historic IPO this year.\n\nHow does Musk justify the $1.25 trillion valuation?\n\nHow do Tesla's investments complicate this deal?\n\nWhat are the space-based data center plans?\n\nWhat companies are involved in this SpaceX-xAI merger?\n\nMusk, who is the CEO of both companies as well as publicly traded electric vehicle and robotics company Tesla, described the combination as one that will “form the most ambitious, vertically integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile-device communications, and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform,” he wrote in a blog post on SpaceX’s website.\n\nMusk cited the potential for space-based data centers, the energy-intensive computing facilities necessary to power AI services, as one of the most important benefits of the combination, even though the concept is still unproven and largely theoretical. “Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term,” Musk wrote in the blog post.\n\n“By directly harnessing near-constant solar power with little operating or maintenance costs, these satellites will transform our ability to scale compute,” Musk wrote.\n\nWhile reports of a potential deal emerged last week, the stratospheric value of the transaction and the swiftness with which it closed left many industry observers in awe, underscoring the massive expectations around AI as well as fears of an overheated market that could be due for a reckoning.\n\nAccording to reporting in Bloomberg, the deal between SpaceX and xAI will lead to a combined enterprise value of $1.25 trillion, with shares of xAI valued at $526.59 apiece. Musk has reportedly been hashing out the potential terms of a SpaceX IPO this year that would value the company at $800 billion, setting the stage for what could be the largest initial public offering of all time.\n\nRepresentatives from SpaceX and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMusk, the richest person in the world, has a documented history of mingling the financial interests of his businesses. In 2015, Tesla acquired Solar City, a solar energy company founded by Musk’s cousins and on whose board Musk served as chairman.\n\nAnd in March 2025, xAI acquired X, the Musk-owned social platform formerly known as Twitter, in a $33 billion, all-stock deal. “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk said at the time.\n\nMore recently, Tesla surprised shareholders just last month when it revealed that it had invested $2 billion in xAI in exchange for a batch of preferred stock as part of xAI’s $20 billion Series E funding round. That investment means Tesla shareholders now own preferred stock in a company that has become a subsidiary of SpaceX, which could raise questions from investors about Tesla’s role in funding xAI’s growth. In addition to the $2 billion investment, Tesla disclosed it sold $430 million of Megapack battery storage and systems to xAI in 2025, costing it $285 million, exhibiting the circular nature of Musk’s businesses.",

    "description": "China has unveiled plans for a space carrier that can deploy unmanned fighter jets capable of firing missiles from the edge of the Earth’s atmosphere.",
    "fullText": "China has unveiled plans for a space carrier that can deploy unmanned fighter jets capable of firing missiles from the edge of the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nState media released a concept video of the futuristic Luanniao, the world’s biggest warship, travelling through space above all current defensive systems.\n\nChina claimed the carrier could become operational in 20 to 30 years’ time. However, experts were sceptical about the project and some likened it to a stunt designed to “inspire the Chinese public”.\n\nResembling a spaceship from a Star Wars film, the Luanniao will be a huge grey triangular aircraft carrier 242 metres long and 684 metres wide. It will have a take-off weight of 120,000 tons – significantly more than any similar craft in operation today.\n\nAccording to state media, the Luanniao will be designed to carry up to 88 unmanned Xuan Nu fighter jets. These will reportedly be highly manoeuvrable stealth aircraft capable of launching hypersonic missiles, but will be significantly heavier than drones.\n\nIf completed, the new spaceship would “outclass pretty much everyone”, according to Peter Layton, a defence expert and a visiting fellow at Australia’s Griffith Asia Institute.\n\nIt would be capable of flying over surface-to-air missiles and other fighter aircraft, he said, adding: “You’re also out of range of the weather, generally speaking – and you’re out of range of most defensive systems.”\n\nThe Luanniao could also allow Beijing to position it directly above targets and launch missiles at them.\n\nSuch capabilities would give China a significant advantage, including over Taiwan and in the South China Sea, which could be the scene of a future war against the United States.\n\nThe Luanniao is part of China’s broader Nantianmen Project, which translates to South Heavenly Gate.\n\nDeveloped by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, the project encompasses a number of ambitious plans to expand the country’s air and space capabilities.\n\nOne of the most prominent elements is a sixth-generation fighter, known as the Baidi fighter, that will also be able to operate near space. A model of the jet was displayed at China’s International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition in 2024.\n\nThe Luanniao is the latest development in the ongoing space race between the US and China. Beijing has been investing in developing rockets and satellites in an effort to push the US out of the lead and, by some metrics, it is now winning.\n\nIn 2024, China successfully launched the Chang’e-6, a robotic spacecraft, which reached the Moon’s far side and returned to Earth with lunar samples.\n\nThe Chang’e-7 mission, which has the goal of finding water on the Moon’s surface, is planned for August.\n\nWhile the US still has leading capabilities, its momentum seems to be slowing while China’s is increasing.\n\nThe Luanniao, by far the most ambitious part of the Nantianmen Project, was first conceived more than 10 years ago, but was dismissed by most experts as a fantasy project. For many, it still is.\n\nThe technology needed for an aircraft to hover at the edge of the Earth’s atmospheric boundary and launch missiles towards the surface does not currently exist. It would require “enormous amounts of fuel” as well as a new kind of propulsion system that had yet to be developed, said Mr Layton.\n\nOne way in which China could achieve a similar result is by putting the carrier into orbit, similar to a satellite or rocket. However, in orbit the aircraft would be vulnerable to debris, which would destroy it in the event of a collision.\n\nTo launch the Luanniao into orbit, China would also need a reusable rocket. It has been working towards one for years, but has been unable to achieve it so far.\n\nBeijing could look to Elon Musk’s SpaceX reusable rockets for inspiration. However, the country is probably 10 to 15 years away from developing its own, said Mr Layton.\n\nGiven the major obstacles around the development of the Luanniao, the timing of Beijing’s announcement is likely to be part of a wider strategy – both at home and abroad.\n\nMr Layton explained that China used stunts like this to “inspire the Chinese public” and show itself to be at the cutting edge of technological innovation.\n\nPushing the narrative around futuristic spacecraft was part of a greater effort to demonstrate to its neighbours that it was a leading military power, he said.\n\n“For the external audience, it does paint the picture that they are working on technology that the region just can’t aspire to – it’s literally Star Wars stuff,” he added.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

(AP) — NASA ran into exasperating fuel leaks during a make-or-break test of its new moon rocket Monday, calling into question how soon astronauts could take off for a trip around the moon.\n\nThe leaks — reminiscent of the rocket's delayed debut three years ago — sprang just a couple hours into the daylong fueling operation at Kennedy Space Center.\n\nLaunch controllers began loading the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket with super-cold hydrogen and oxygen at midday. More than 700,000 gallons (2.6 million liters) had to flow into the tanks and remain on board for several hours, mimicking the final stages of an actual countdown.\n\nBut excessive hydrogen quickly built up near the bottom of the rocket. Hydrogen loading was halted at least twice as the launch team scrambled to work around the problem using techniques developed during the previous Space Launch System countdown in 2022. That first test flight was plagued by hydrogen leaks before finally soaring without a crew.\n\nThe four astronauts assigned to the mission — three Americans and one Canadian — monitored the critical dress rehearsal from nearly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away in Houston, home to Johnson Space Center. They have been in quarantine for the past 1½ weeks, awaiting the practice countdown's outcome.\n\nMonday's fueling demo will determine when they can blast off on the first lunar voyage by a crew in more than half a century.\n\nAt best, NASA could launch commander Reid Wiseman and his crew to the moon no sooner than Sunday. The rocket must be flying by Feb. 11 or the mission will be called off until March. The space agency only has a few days in any given month to launch the rocket, and the extreme cold already has shortened February’s launch window by two days.\n\nRunning behind because of the bitter cold snap, the countdown clocks began ticking Saturday night, giving launch controllers the chance to go through all the motions and deal with any lingering rocket problems. The clocks were set to stop a half-minute before reaching zero, just before engine ignition.\n\nThe nearly 10-day mission will send the astronauts past the moon, around the mysterious far side and then straight back to Earth, with the goal of testing the capsule's life support and other vital systems. The crew will not go into lunar orbit or attempt to land.\n\nNASA last sent astronauts to the moon during the 1960s and 1970s Apollo program. The new Artemis program aims for a more sustained lunar presence, with Wiseman’s crew setting the stage for future moon landings by other astronauts.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "description": "Barbara Corcoran said couples living in small apartments could make better use of the space they already have.",
    "fullText": "Barbara Corcoran, 76, swears by having separate bedrooms from her husband. She says couples should try it — even in small spaces.\n\n\"Well, they could get separate beds. They could put a wall up. They could sleep on the convertible couch,\" Corcoran told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Monday.\n\nWhile she acknowledged that the setup won't work for everyone, Corcoran said many people living in small apartments could make better use of the space they already have.\n\n\"I don't really have a solution, but there's a lot of New Yorkers who have two bedrooms and one set up as a den or TV room. I think that's a misuse,\" she said. \"When I got my second bedroom, I immediately loved my husband twice as much.\"\n\nThe \"Shark Tank\" host and her husband, retired Navy captain and FBI agent Bill Higgins, have been married since 1988.\n\nFor Corcoran, protecting her alone time is key, including in the mornings.\n\n\"I always wake up at 5 o'clock. I make myself some coﬀee, sit on my chair and daydream for an hour. I try to stay oﬀ my cellphone and I usually succeed,\" she said.\n\nDespite her busy schedule, the business mogul says she doesn't work on Mondays.\n\n\"I take Mondays oﬀ, and I always have. I will not work on a Monday. On Friday, I leave all my commands, all my notes, little Post-it Notes on everybody's machines. Or now, it's a lot of email,\" Corcoran said.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Corcoran has shared her views on sleep divorce. In a December 2024 appearance on \"The Jamie Kern Lima Show,\" Corcoran described having separate bedrooms as one of the secrets to her successful marriage.\n\n\"Well, I think there's something to be said about your own private space. Yes, I lead a very busy life. I have a huge family that I'm always entertaining. I have very sincere, active friends, and so what I need more than anything else is a respite, and my husband is not relaxing,\" Corcoran told podcast host Jamie Kern Lima.\n\nShe added that it's difficult for her to muster the energy at the end of the day to listen to him and contribute meaningfully to the conversation.\n\nMoreover, she and her husband have rules for entering each other's bedrooms. \"I have to invite him into my bedroom, and I like it that way,\" Corcoran said.\n\nMany other celebrities have also spoken about sleeping separately from their spouses. Carson Daly has called sleep divorce the \"best thing\" for his marriage, while Bette Midler has said she and her husband of over 40 years have slept apart since the start of their relationship.",

    "description": "In one of the most baffling discoveries of the last decade, scientists have found a clue in a cave to how life might survive in deep space without light.",
    "fullText": "When cave biologist Hazel Barton ventured into the pitch darkness, the last thing she expected to find were organisms harnessing energy from light. This new understanding of photosynthesis in the dark, she realised, means life elsewhere in the Universe could exist in places we never thought possible.\n\n\"The wall was bright green. It was the most iridescent green you'd ever seen, and yet the microbes were living in complete darkness,\" says Barton, professor of geological sciences at the University of Alabama.\n\nBeneath the deep rocky canyons of the Chihuahuan Desert in southern New Mexico, lies a network of 119 caves. The caves, part of the Carlsbad Caverns National Park, formed four to 11 million years ago due to sulphuric acid dissolving the limestone rocks.\n\nThe primary attraction of the park is the show cave, Carlsbad Cavern. Here, glittering stalactites cling to the roof of the Big Room, a huge underground chamber measuring almost 4,000ft (1,220m) long and 625ft (191m) wide.\n\n\"The Carlsbad cavern is very easily accessible. It's a very large limestone cave that tourists can visit that has steps and ladders and everyone can go down,\" says Lars Behrendt, a microbial biologist at Uppsala University. Parts of the cave system, he adds, are even wheelchair accessible.\n\nAlmost 350,000 people visit Carlsbad cavern each year, yet most would be completely unaware that the cave is the setting to one of the most baffling scientific discoveries of the past decade.\n\nIn 2018, Behrendt had just finished his PhD. He had also won an academic prize, which awarded him some money. He contacted Barton and asked her if she would accompany him on an expedition. Luckily, she agreed.\n\n\"The first thing you do in the Carlsbad cave is you kind of go down on the tourist trail, and then you turn around a corner,\" says Barton. \"I don't know how many times I've done that trail, probably 40 times. At that point, you go around the corner, and then behind you there's an alcove, and it's completely black.\"\n\nFor more than 20 years, Barton has been studying microscopic life found deep underground. Yet what happened next was a surprise, even to her.\n\nBehrendt shone a torch on the wall. Although the alcove was pitch black, the light revealed a blanket of green microbes clinging to the wall. Later tests revealed they were cyanobacteria; single celled organisms related to bacteria. Unlike most bacteria, though, cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae) use light from the Sun to make food.\n\n\"We started going deeper and deeper into the cave,\" says Barton. \"Eventually we were a point where we couldn't see without using flashlights. We had to use a headlight to be able to see our hand in front of our face, and yet you could still see green pigment on the wall.\"\n\nPlants are green due to a chemical called chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy. In photosynthesis, this energy is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The process is much the same in cyanobacteria. Yet here, in the cave, there was no sunlight.\n\nIt turns out that the cyanobacteria in the cave have a special version of chlorophyll that can capture near-infrared light. This light has a longer wavelength than visible light, and appears just before infrared on the electromagnetic spectrum. It is undetectable to the human eye.\n\nWhile plants and cyanobacteria use chlorophyll a for photosynthesis, the cyanobacteria in the Carlsbad caves use chlorophyll d and f, which are able to generate energy from near-infrared light.\n\nAlthough visible light can only travel a few hundred feet into the caves, near-infrared can journey a lot further due to the reflective nature of the limestone rocks. \"The limestone rock that the cave is made of will absorb almost all visible light, but to near-infrared light, caves are pretty much a hall of mirrors,\" says Barton.\n\nIn fact, when the researchers measured the light in the back of the cave where it was darkest, they found the levels of near-infrared light were 695 times more concentrated than at the entrance. At the same time, while chlorophyll d and f containing cyanobacteria were present in all parts of the cave, they were particularly concentrated in the darkest and deepest places.\n\nThe researchers also hiked out to other caves in the Carlsbad Caverns National Park and tested other off-the-beaten-track caves and caverns. In each case they found photosynthesising microbes deep down underground.\n\n\"We showed that not only do they live down there, but that they photosynthesise in a completely sheltered environment where they've probably been untouched for 49 million years,\" says Behrendt.\n\nBarton and Behrendt aren't the only scientists to find microbes able to live in the dark.\n\nIn 1890, pioneering Ukrainian-Russian microbiologist Sergei Nikolaevich Vinogradskii discovered that some microbes could live solely on inorganic matter – using a process called chemosynthesis. These microbes gain energy through chemical reactions, taking chemicals such as methane or hydrogen sulphide from surrounding rocks and water.\n\nIn 1996, Hideaki Miyashita, who at the time was a student on Nasa's postdoctoral programme, discovered a marine cyanobacterium named Acaryochloris marina that can photosynthesise using both visible and near-infrared light. This discovery kickstarted decades of research into the wavelengths of light required for photosynthesis.\n\nThen, in 2018, scientists at Imperial College London found photosynthesising cyanobacteria living in shady conditions in bacterial mats in Yellowstone National Park, and inside some beach rocks in Australia. They even managed to grow photosynthesising microbes in a dark cupboard fitted with infrared LEDs. In each case, the cyanobacteria used chlorophyll a to photosynthesise using visible light, but then switched to using chlorophyll f to photosynthesise using near-infrared light – beyond the reach of human vision.\n\nThe findings have repercussions for what life on other planets could look like. When looking for a habitable exoplanet – a planet that orbits a star in another solar system – it's important to take into account the type of star that it is orbiting. Astronomers have tried to group stars by the colour of light they produce, resulting in seven classes of stars (O, B, A, F, G, K and M), which are arranged in order of decreasing temperature, from hottest to coolest. O- and B-type stars are the hottest, most massive and most luminous stars in the Universe. They are characterised by their blue-white colour.\n\n\"They produce a lot of UV radiation, so they're toxic to life,\" says Barton.\n\nG-type stars, which include our Sun, are yellow in colour and produce a lot of light in the visible spectrum. These stars would theoretically be good places to look for habitable worlds, but G-type stars constitute just 8% of the estimated one billion trillion stars in the Universe.\n\nAs red dwarfs are low mass stars, their planets tend to orbit closely, which makes them easier to spot. Another reason that M stars have proved so fruitful in scientists' search for exoplanets is because they are so plentiful. However, currently red dwarf stars are thought to have a very narrow habitable zone – the area closest to the star where conditions are neither too hot, nor too cold for liquid water to exist on the planet's surface. the epic hunt for a planet just like Earth.)\n\nAs the existence of liquid water is essential for life on Earth, this measure, known as the star's \"Goldilocks zone\", is what astrobiologists have focused on when looking for extraterrestrial life. So far, they have found dozens of candidates. However not all of these planets could sustain life, and directing telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) takes time and considerable resources.\n\n• The peculiar smells of outer space\n\n• The scientists looking for alien vegetation\n\n• The scientists venturing into the deep, dark Earth\n\nAnother important factor which governs whether life can exist is whether photosynthesis can take place. On Earth, photosynthesis forms the base of most food chains and provides the oxygen we breathe. For this reason, it makes sense to limit the search to planets that can support photosynthesis. This could dramatically reduce the zone around a star where life could exist.\n\nIn the past, astrobiologists set the limit for photosynthesis at a wavelength of 700nm in the light spectrum, which is the equivalent wavelength of the colour red. This is the point at which the efficiency of photosynthesis using chlorophyll a declines. However, the cyanobacteria discovered in the Carlsbad cave systems can harvest light up to wavelengths of 780nm using chlorophyll f.\n\n\"The vast majority of stars in our galaxy are these M- and K-type stars,\" says Barton. \"This means most of the stars in our galaxy are putting out near-infrared light, and yet we barely know anything about how photosynthesis and life could survive under the conditions of light that would be produced by a star like that.\"\n\nBarton plans to change this. Together with Behrendt, she has put in a proposal to Nasa to find the limits of where photosynthetic life can survive. The work would involve going deep down into the darkest caves to measure exactly how much light is needed for cyanobacteria to survive. That information can then be used to narrow down the search for habitable worlds. For example, with the JWST, scientists can measure the amount and type of light exoplanets receive.\n\n\"What our work is trying to do is figure out what is the longest wavelength of light and lowest level of light at which you can photosynthesise,\" says Barton.\n\n\"Then what you can do is take the 100 billion potential stars that we can point the James Webb Space Telescope at, and reduce it down to say 50 stars [which may host life].\"\n\nIn other words, it could lead to astrobiologists broadening the types of worlds that they believe could support life. All that would remain would be to point the JWST at the star in question and then look for planets passing in front of it. As the light from the star travels through the atmosphere of the planet, specific frequencies of light are absorbed depending on what elements are present. Astronomers can therefore work out if certain elements which might hint at the presence of life, such as oxygen, are present in the exoplanet's atmosphere by looking for missing lines on the absorption spectra.\n\n\"There are very, very few ways that oxygen can be made in an atmosphere without life,\" says Barton. \"So, if you can find the oxygen in the atmosphere of one of those exoplanets, it's a very, very strong marker for potential life.\"\\\n\n* This article has been updated to correct information about the spectral classification of stars from O to M. This article also incorrectly stated that all exoplanets discovered to date have been found around red dwarf stars.

    "description": "Researchers have discovered a hidden quantum geometry inside materials that subtly steers electrons, echoing how gravity warps light in space. Once thought to exist only on paper, this effect has now been observed experimentally in a popular quantum material. The finding reveals a new way to understand and control how materials conduct electricity and interact with light. It could help power future ultra-fast electronics and quantum technologies.",
    "fullText": "How can information move at incredible speeds, or electricity flow without wasting energy? Answering these questions has pushed scientists and technology companies toward quantum materials, whose behavior is governed by physics at the smallest scales. Building these advanced materials depends on understanding how atoms and electrons behave, an area where many mysteries remain.\n\nNow, researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), working with colleagues at the University of Salerno and the CNR-SPIN Institute (Italy), have made a significant breakthrough. They identified a previously unseen geometric feature inside a quantum material that alters how electrons move, in a way similar to how gravity bends light. The findings, published in Science, point to new possibilities for next-generation quantum electronics.\n\nModern technologies rely on materials with extraordinary performance, many of which arise from quantum physics. This field focuses on matter at microscopic scales, where particles behave in surprising ways. Over the past century, research into atoms, electrons, and photons led to the invention of transistors and the foundation of today's computers.\n\nEven now, scientists continue to uncover quantum effects that challenge established theories. Recent research suggests that when huge numbers of particles interact inside certain materials, a kind of internal geometry can emerge. This structure can redirect electron motion, closely resembling how Einstein's theory of gravity describes the bending of light.\n\nFrom Mathematical Idea to Measured Reality\n\nThis internal structure is known as the quantum metric. It describes the curvature of the quantum space through which electrons travel and influences many microscopic properties of materials. Despite its importance, proving its existence experimentally has been extremely difficult.\n\n''The concept of quantum metric dates back about 20 years, but for a long time it was regarded purely as a theoretical construct. Only in recent years have scientists begun to explore its tangible effects on the properties of matter,'' explains Andrea Caviglia, full professor and director of the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science.\n\nDetecting a Hidden Geometry in Quantum Materials\n\nIn the new study, the research team led by UNIGE, together with Carmine Ortix, associate professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Salerno, detected the quantum metric at the boundary between two oxide materials, strontium titanate and lanthanum aluminate. This interface is already known as a powerful platform for studying quantum behavior.\n\n''Its presence can be revealed by observing how electron trajectories are distorted under the combined influence of quantum metric and intense magnetic fields applied to solids,'' explains Giacomo Sala, research associate in the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science and lead author of the study.\n\nImplications for Future Technologies\n\nBeing able to observe this effect allows scientists to measure a material's optical, electronic, and transport properties more accurately. The team also found that the quantum metric is a fundamental characteristic of many materials, rather than a rare exception as previously believed.\n\n''These discoveries open up new avenues for exploring and harnessing quantum geometry in a wide range of materials, with major implications for future electronics operating at terahertz frequencies (a trillion hertz), as well as for superconductivity and light-matter interactions,'' concludes Andrea Caviglia.\n\nMaterials provided by Université de Genève.

    "fullText": "Liverpool supporters left Anfield buzzing after Hugo Ekitike tore Newcastle United apart, scoring twice in the space of two breathless minutes to turn a drifting afternoon into a statement win. The French striker, signed from Eintracht Frankfurt in the summer, now has 15 goals this season and the numbers only tell part of the story. What matters more is how he bends matches to his will when Liverpool need it most.\n\nUnder Arne Slot, fresh from guiding Liverpool to a Premier League title in 2024/25, the side have become ruthless at home. Yet even in that setting the visit of Newcastle United felt awkward until Ekitike lit the fuse. Two finishes, calm and clinical, dragged the tempo up and dragged the crowd with it.\n\nThe Kop has seen its share of centre forwards, but there is something disarming about Ekitike’s movement and timing. He does not bully defenders, he ghosts them. When Liverpool needed a foothold, he provided it, and once the door cracked open he kicked it wide. Those two goals before half time shifted the balance and by the final whistle the result felt inevitable.\n\nEkitike’s impact has been immediate since he arrived, yet Saturday carried extra weight. It was the kind of cameo that stamps authority on a dressing room and a fanbase.\n\nAdmiration came from a familiar voice too. International team mate Kylian Mbappe, who knows Ekitike from their days at Paris Saint-Germain and with France, was quick to react on social media. After Ekitike celebrated Liverpool’s win on Instagram, Mbappe replied with a single word, “superstar”.\n\nNo hyperbole required. Mbappe, now scoring freely for Real Madrid, rarely hands out compliments lightly. His nod carries weight, especially with a World Cup looming where the pair are tipped to lead the line for Les Bleus.\n\nFor Liverpool, the timing could not be better. Slot’s side are relentless, the football is sharp, and Ekitike is the focal point. He stretches defences, opens spaces for runners, and finishes chances when they arrive. Newcastle felt all of it in a punishing 4-1 that kept the home crowd singing long after the final whistle at Anfield.\n\nSupporters have already embraced him as one of their own, and with Mbappe publicly backing that view, the wider football world is catching up. Liverpool have a striker who changes games, and right now that makes all the difference.",

    "title": "Pretty soon, heat pumps will be able to store and distribute heat as needed",
    "description": "Researchers have developed a heat storage unit that takes up less space than a regular hot water tank. It charges when electricity is cheap and releases heat when needed.",
    "fullText": "Heat pumps are becoming increasingly common in private homes. But storing the heat they produce has not been possible – until now. SINTEF and Swiss company COWA Thermal Solutions researchers are collaborating on the solution.\n\n“Think of it as a thermal battery, which stores the heat from the heat pump and can be used later. In practice, this means that people get more energy out of the stored heat. It becomes easier and more comfortable to use, and the energy is also used in a smarter way,” says Galina Simonsen, a senior research scientist at SINTEF.\n\nSimonsen is a member of the team that has developed the new thermal batteries.\n\n“The batteries have high efficiency, and they charge and deliver heat quickly, making it easier to meet the need. Like when several people are taking showers one after the other, for example, or you need hot water early on a cold morning,” says Simonsen.\n\nThe solution will also benefit your wallet because it makes it possible to store excess heat when electricity is cheap or produced in an environmentally friendly way, and can be used when the need for more heat arises.\n\nHeat pumps extract energy from the environment – air, soil or water – and transport the heat into the home.\n\nHowever, in households and other buildings, the heat demand varies, depending on usage patterns, time of day, outdoor temperature and weather conditions. The researchers on this project have worked to meet these fluctuations in a smarter way.\n\n“A heat pump that runs constantly is expensive, energy-consuming and can lead to overloading the power grid. With the new batteries, heat pumps combine storage and smart distribution of heat,” says Simonsen.\n\n“The research team at SINTEF has collaborated closely with the Swiss company COWA Thermal Solutions to develop their solution. Although thermal energy storage already exists, the team is among the first to have managed to create a solution that is so effective that it is attractive for private homes.\n\nThe secret lies in a combination of technical solutions and materials called salt hydrates.\n\n“Unlike the salt we sprinkle on food, salt hydrates lock water into their structure and behave in a unique way when exposed to heat,” says Simonsen.\n\nSubstances that can undergo this physical transformation, from melting to solidification, belong to a broader group of materials known as “phase change materials.”\n\nHere you can read about the company Cartesian, which has created a similar solution for both heating and cooling large buildings based on solar or wind power:\n\n“Think of thermal batteries as sponges: When they’re heated to a certain temperature, they undergo a change from solid to liquid and can store heat. When they are cooled, they return to solid form and release heat again,” says Simonsen.\n\n“They can store much more thermal energy than water, for example, and they retain heat longer, even if the temperature does not change that much.”\n\nIn other words: more heat and more stable temperatures.\n\nSalt hydrates thus open up completely new possibilities for smart and more balanced heating systems because heating can be moved to times with low energy demand.\n\n“Salt hydrates aren’t toxic, they’re not flammable and they are also relatively inexpensive. This makes them a safe and good choice for use in private homes. Heat storage with salt hydrates also takes up less space than a traditional hot water tank, often up to four times less,” says Simonsen.\n\nThe work is being carried out as part of the EU-funded project Sure2Coat and in close collaboration with the Swiss company COWA Thermal Solutions and research partners. COWA has worked to develop and improve the salt hydrates with new additives, so that the materials are stable and can function for decades without losing their special properties. SINTEF has worked to improve the efficiency of the batteries themselves.\n\nTraditional systems often have low efficiency and can take a long time to charge and provide heat to the house. By using thin cooling fins, the researchers have managed to increase the efficiency of the new batteries from 65 to 85 percent. At the same time, charging time has been reduced by over 70 percent and the time it takes to release the heat has been cut by more than 80 percent.\n\nThe EU-funded Sure2Coat project is a collaboration between 14 partners in industry and research in 7 European countries. The project involves developing and implementing new or improved methods for surface treatment and coating of surfaces for different types of metals. The methods are demonstrated through three specific application areas: the gearbox, gas-water heater and latent heat storage.\n\nThrough the project, end users will effectively reduce their energy use, material consumption, CO2 emissions and pollution from production. The goal is to contribute positively to European industry and the EU's growth strategy by integrating surface treatment methods into the production line.\n\nSINTEF’s task in the project has been to improve the efficiency itself. That is, how the heat is stored and released in the batteries.\n\n“Specifically, we have designed and tested a type of heat sink that improves heat transfer in the thermal batteries,” says Simonsen.\n\nThe cooling fins are thin metal structures made of recycled aluminium that are effective heat conductors. This means that the heat is distributed quickly and evenly through the salt hydrate.\n\n“Aluminium is a light material, has good thermal conductivity and is easy to form. The use of recycled aluminium also reduces the environmental footprint and costs, and helps to promote a more circular use of materials.\n\nAt the same time, recycled aluminium poses a challenge: it can contain impurities that make it more vulnerable to corrosion.\n\n“Corrosion is particularly critical because salt hydrates are tough on aluminium, especially when impurities are present. Without protection, the cooling fins can degrade over time, reducing performance and shortening the lifespan of the entire system,” Simonsen explains.\n\nTo solve this problem, the researchers have employed a type of coating called plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO), which forms a thin, ceramic layer on the surface of the aluminium.\n\n“This coating is similar to what is used on non-stick pans and provides a very durable and corrosion-resistant barrier,” says the researcher.",

    "fullText": "Dillon Brooks has taken direct aim at Draymond Green, firing back at the Warriors veteran’s media presence while questioning where his priorities lie as an active player.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns wing did not mince his words when discussing Green’s growing role in the podcast space, turning a long-running on-court rivalry into a broader critique.\n\nBrooks’ comments immediately reignited the debate around players balancing media ventures with performance.\n\nBrooks addressed the issue in comments during N3on’s stream, shared on X by Fullcourt Pass, where he was asked about players producing podcasts during their playing careers.\n\n“I be getting on dudes that want to do the podcast grind while they’re still playing… He [Green] talks too much for me. I’m saying they’re not good at basketball, so focus on hoops,” Brooks said.\n\nThe remark was a clear shot at Green, whose podcast has become one of the most visible player-led platforms in the NBA.\n\nRather than focusing on specific games or moments, Brooks framed his criticism around commitment and performance.\n\nThe tension between Brooks and Green stretches back several seasons.\n\nIt became most visible during the 2022 NBA playoffs, when Brooks’ Memphis Grizzlies faced Green’s Golden State Warriors in a heated second-round series.\n\nThat matchup featured repeated verbal exchanges, physical play, and Brooks’ now-infamous “poke the bear” comments directed at the defending champions.\n\nGreen, a key part of four Warriors championship teams, responded at the time by questioning Brooks’ impact and playoff credentials.\n\nSince then, the two have traded indirect jabs through interviews and media appearances, even after Brooks moved on from Memphis.\n\nBrooks’ latest comments suggest that while the teams have changed, the personal edge has not. For both players, the back-and-forth has become part of a public rivalry that now extends beyond the court.\n\nHow a kid reminded Jordan Poole of getting punched by Draymond Green\n\nWhat is Jonathan Kuminga doing ‘too much’ amid trade interest from LA Lakers, reveals Draymond Green\n\n10 NBA players with most swearing fines, Draymond Green is only 8th",

    "fullText": "In a world of incessant distractions and pings, it can feel harder than ever to stay locked in on one task.\n\nThree executives from Slack, EY, and Superhuman shared how they reset to make room for deep thinking amid stacked calendars.\n\nThe common theme: Whether they're putting their phones away or changing rooms, they all said that finding a way to physically disconnect from distractions helps them focus on the task at hand.\n\nSlack's chief technology officer, Parker Harris, said that when he needs to focus on a single task and remove distractions, he turns off the sound of his notifications \"completely off.\" The CTO said he also flips his phone over so he isn't tempted to look at it.\n\n\"I hate that knock sound or any other sound,\" Harris said about notifications in general.\n\nHarris said even outside those situations, he typically keeps his notifications on. However, he doesn't necessarily \"jump straight\" to addressing every individual message he receives, given he works in an \"interrupt-driven\" environment.\n\n\"We all need to find a way to concentrate,\" Harris said.\n\nEY's global chief innovation officer said if he has to do some \"really deep thinking,\" which may include pondering strategy or preparing for a presentation, he'll often go for a walk or run outdoors. Depa said he also likes playing soccer and coaches his son's sports teams. The executive said getting outside removes him from his computer and other devices, and allows him to \"just think.\"\n\nDepa said if he has too much back-to-back travel or too many interviews, his brain will \"get fried.\" He said having some kind of balance is key to preventing getting into that state.\n\n\"You need to have that rest,\" Depa said.\n\nShishir Mehrotra, the CEO of AI productivity suite Superhuman, said that \"changing physical locations is very helpful\" for resetting, and that people \"underestimate\" the benefit of going for a walk.\n\nMehrotra also said he tries to avoid certain \"fidgets,\" which he described as something people use when they need to \"erase\" their brain, or \"cleanse their palette.\"\n\n\"The fidget I try to avoid is social media,\" Mehrotra said. \"That's the one that is inescapable.\"\n\nInstead, he said he likes to pick \"brainy collaborative games,\" especially ones that he can play with family, like Scrabble or The New York Times' Crossplay.\n\nHe also likes listening to podcasts when he's in the car. He said he's especially into the show \"Acquired,\" which offers hours of retrospectives on famous companies, like LVMH and Google. He said if he's going to choose something to cleanse his palette, he would rather it be something healthier that doesn't feel like a complete waste of time.\n\n\"Pick good palate cleansers that you feel good about,\" Mehrotra said.",

Uh, just I mean you just had a, uh yesterday yesterday morning it was touching around 5600.\n\nSo it's it's a massive move to the downside. Silver as well down 13%. Mike McGlone over at Bloomberg is basically saying, you may have just seen the top on silver and this could be for years now that you won't see those same silver prices at\n\nas you've seen. He's basically, he's been warning about this, this massive speed in this rally that we've seen. And we're also looking at other metals as well that are down. I mean, you're looking at copper. Also, copper was up around above 14,000 uh per ton in London. Uh and and that is also moved lower.\n\nThat doesn't take away from sort of this narrative that we've been hearing about is the demand for these metals, for the demand for copper that you're going to need for data centers, for electrification, etc. But look, there's in inelasticity when it comes to that because a data center is not going to stop being built just because you've got higher copper prices.\n\nBut nevertheless, uh a lot of this has to do also with China specula speculative trading trading as well.

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China's main space contractor vowed to develop space tourism in the next five years, state media reported on Thursday, as Beijing revs up its commercial spaceflight and deep space exploration ambitions ​amid a technology race with the U.S.\n\nState-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) said it would \"achieve the flight operation of ‌suborbital space tourism and gradually develop orbital space tourism,\" as well as \"build a gigawatt-level space digital intelligence infrastructure\", state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n\nChina and the U.S. are competing ‌as they look to turn space exploration into a commercially viable business similar to civil aviation, as well as becoming the first to exploit the military and strategic advantages of space dominance. CASC has vowed to transform China into a \"world-leading space power\" by 2045.\n\nBeijing's key bottleneck so far is its failure to complete a reusable rocket test. U.S. rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 reusable rocket has allowed its subsidiary Starlink to ⁠achieve a near-monopoly on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites ‌and it is also used for orbital space tourism.\n\nReusability is crucial to lowering the costs of rocket launches and making it cheaper to send satellites into space. China achieved a record 93 space launches ‍last year, according to official announcements, buoyed by its rapidly maturing commercial spaceflight startups.\n\nHowever, China has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on LEO satellites as a national security risk and is launching its own satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the next decades.\n\nIn late ​December, Chinese entities submitted filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) laying out plans to put about 200,000 satellites in orbit over ‌the next 14 years. Two mega-constellations account for the vast majority, and the move would strategically reserve suborbital slots and frequencies for Beijing.\n\nCASC's plans were announced after China inaugurated its first School of Interstellar Navigation housed in the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Tuesday, aiming to foster the next generation of space talent in frontier fields including interstellar propulsion and deep space navigation.\n\nThe new institution signals China's ambitions to strategically transition from near-Earth orbit operations to deep space exploration, and will support China's planned lunar research station and efforts in ⁠detecting planets outside our solar system, according to a Xinhua report on ​the inauguration.\n\n\"The next 10 to 20 years will be a window for leapfrog ​development in China's interstellar navigation field. Original innovation in basic research and technological breakthroughs will reshape the pattern of deep space exploration,\" Xinhua wrote.\n\nThursday's CCTV report said CASC would also focus on breakthroughs in key technologies ‍such as small celestial resource exploration ⁠and intelligent independent mining and step up monitoring of space debris and the formulation of international space traffic management rules.\n\nChina's Chang'e-6 lunar probe was the first spacecraft to bring back samples from the far side of the moon in 2024, and ⁠Beijing is actively setting international standards for spaceflight and space infrastructure to establish itself as a dominant space power.\n\nThe U.S. faces intense competition this decade from ‌China in its effort to return astronauts to the moon, where no humans have gone since the final U.S. ‌Apollo mission in 1972.",

    "title": "Russian Scientists Test Plasma Engine That Could Cut Mars Travel to About 30 Days",
    "description": "Russia is testing a plasma engine prototype designed to slash Mars travel time to just 60 days. Developed by Rosatom’s Troitsk Institute, the system uses electromagnetic fields to accelerate particles to 100 km/s, promising a flight-ready model for deep-space missions by 2030.",
    "fullText": "Russia is quietly testing a new plasma propulsion system that, if it performs as claimed, could dramatically change how long it takes to travel to Mars. Early results suggest a leap in speed and efficiency that has drawn attention precisely because it is not coming from NASA or private U.S. companies such as SpaceX.\n\nThe engine is being developed by the Troitsk Institute, part of Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom. According to researchers involved in the program, the system could reduce interplanetary travel time from several months to roughly one to two months. Ground-based testing is currently underway, and the developers say the technology could be ready for space deployment by around 2030.\n\nUnlike conventional chemical rockets, the new system relies on electromagnetic fields to accelerate charged hydrogen particles. This places it firmly in the category of electric or plasma propulsion, a field that has gained increasing global attention as space agencies look for more efficient ways to travel deeper into the solar system.\n\nChemical rockets deliver very high thrust for a short time, which is ideal for launching from Earth. However, they are inefficient for long-distance travel once a spacecraft is in orbit. Plasma engines, by contrast, generate much lower thrust but can operate continuously for long periods, gradually building up extremely high speeds while using far less propellant.\n\nIf the Russian system achieves its projected performance, it could have a major impact on how future missions to Mars and beyond are planned, both for scientific exploration and for potential military or logistical applications.\n\nThe prototype engine is currently being tested inside a 14-meter-long vacuum chamber designed to simulate space conditions. According to technical details reported by the Russian newspaper Izvestia, the engine operates at a power level of 300 kilowatts in a pulsed periodic mode and has already demonstrated a working lifespan of 2,400 hours. That duration would be sufficient for a full Mars mission, including acceleration and deceleration phases.\n\nResearchers say the engine accelerates charged hydrogen particles, including protons and electrons, to speeds of up to 100 kilometers per second. By comparison, traditional chemical rockets typically achieve exhaust velocities of around 4.5 kilometers per second. This massive difference in exhaust velocity is the key to the engine’s potential efficiency and speed.\n\nThe plasma engine is not intended to launch directly from Earth’s surface. A conventional chemical rocket would first carry the spacecraft into low Earth orbit. Once in space, the plasma engine would be activated to provide continuous thrust for the journey through deep space.\n\nOfficials involved in the project also note that the system could function as a space tug, moving cargo, modules, or satellites between different planetary orbits. This concept aligns with broader international interest in reusable orbital transport systems.\n\nThe engine uses hydrogen as propellant and relies on an onboard nuclear reactor to provide a constant energy supply. According to project researcher Yegor Biryulin, hydrogen’s low atomic mass allows for faster acceleration while reducing fuel consumption. Its abundance in space could eventually allow for in situ refueling, at least in theory.\n\nThe propulsion system uses two high-voltage electrodes to create directed plasma flow. Charged particles pass between them, forming a magnetic field that expels plasma and generates thrust. This design avoids the need to heat plasma to extreme temperatures, which reduces component wear and improves overall efficiency.\n\nRosatom documentation lists the projected thrust at 6 newtons, which is high for a plasma propulsion prototype. Even so, the thrust remains far lower than chemical rockets, meaning spacecraft would be designed for slow but continuous acceleration rather than short bursts of power.\n\nPlasma propulsion is already used in orbit on many satellites, including systems on OneWeb spacecraft and on NASA’s Psyche mission launched in 2023. Most existing plasma engines operate at exhaust velocities between 30 and 50 kilometers per second. The Russian claims of 100 kilometers per second would represent a significant step forward.\n\nHowever, the technology remains unproven in space. Peer-reviewed scientific data have not yet been published, and the nuclear reactor design has not been disclosed. Nuclear-powered spacecraft raise complex safety, regulatory, and international approval issues, especially during launch.\n\nWhile the concept is promising, the engine is still years away from practical use. Its projected readiness by 2030 will depend on continued testing, funding, and successful resolution of engineering and regulatory challenges.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Autorepublika.com and has been republished with permission by Guessing Headlights.

    "title": "You Can Finally Clean Up Your Mac’s Menu Bar (Without Using Third-Party Software)",
    "description": "Hide icons in the settings, then shrink the space between icons.",
    "fullText": "The Mac menu bar is a bit of a mess. Way too many applications want to put icons in the top-right corner of the screen, and most users only want to see a fraction of those. This is a particular problem on recent MacBooks, where the camera notch blacks out a chunk of space right in the middle of the menu bar. This is why applications for cleaning up the Mac menu bar are so popular—the clutter can feel overwhelming.\n\nHere's the thing, though: You probably don't need to leave applications like that running constantly. You can hide icons in macOS' Settings, then use a free tool once to move all the icons closer together. Here's how.\n\nTahoe, also known as macOS 26, gave users a lot to talk about, which meant a few features were broadly overlooked. One of them: the ability to hide any menu bar icon, no third party software required. To use this feature open System Settings and head to the Menu Bar section. You will see the ability to toggle system icons, like Siri and Spotlight, on and off. Keep scrolling, though, and you'll find the ability to hide icons for any of your installed applications. Just toggle off any application you'd rather not see in the menu bar and it will disappear.\n\nI've been using this to disable unwanted icons for months, and it's working well for me. Having said that, though, it isn't a perfect replacement. Applications like Bartender and Ice don't just hide icons—they give you access to a secondary tray where you can still occasionally access icons you hid. There's no quick way to do that using the macOS settings. Still: It's a free way to hide unwanted icons, and there's no need to keep third party software running.\n\nIf your menu bar still feels crowded, you can free up a bit more space by squeezing all of your icons together. A free application called Menu Bar Spacing lets you change the spacing in your menu bar. Just \n\nThe great thing about Menu Bar Spacing, as an application, is that it doesn't need to run constantly. You can launch it once, make the changes you like, and then delete it—your setting will still apply. This is because the application changes a few hidden macOS settings. You can make the changes yourself using the Terminal if you prefer not to use an app, but I think the app makes things a little bit easier.\n\nThere's a bit of a caveat for macOS 26 users. Because of a bug, only Apple's own icons will move closer together at first. Your other applications will need to be restarted before they bunch closer together. That means you'll need to manually close and re-launch each application, or simply restart your Mac. It's annoying, but only relevant right after you change the settings. And you'll have a lot more space on your menu bar once you're done.",

    "fullText": "On the morning of January 28, 1986, seven crew members were killed when the space shuttle Challenger broke apart a little over a minute after it launched.\n\nThose killed included five NASA astronauts, one payload specialist, and a civilian schoolteacher.\n\nThis mission was Challenger's 10th, but the shuttle exploded due to a design flaw in a seal that was exacerbated by cold temperatures on launch day. A joint in one of the rocket boosters failed at liftoff, and the external fuel tank subsequently collapsed, leading to the demise of the vehicle.\n\nChallenger was the second shuttle to reach space, which it did in April 1983. It also sent the first African-American astronaut into space, completed the first in-flight capture and repair of a satellite, and launched the first US woman in space.\n\nThe 1986 disaster marked a turning point for NASA. An investigation after the explosion found that many engineers and astronauts believed NASA was pushing its programs forward at breakneck speed, without sufficient funding or testing. NASA added more internal checks and processes after the event to prevent similar tragedies.\n\nThe space agency also stopped sending civilians on potentially dangerous space-shuttle missions.\n\nThe new orbiter sat atop a 747 carrier aircraft.\n\nThe ship led the Challenger Expedition: a groundbreaking marine research trip from 1872 to 1876.\n\nFor its maiden voyage, the Challenger deployed a communications satellite and conducted a space walk.\n\nAfter that first flight, Challenger flew 85% of all space-shuttle missions during its lifetime.\n\nSally Ride served as a mission specialist in 1983 and returned to space on the Challenger in 1984.\n\nBluford flew to space a total of four times.\n\n\"It may have been one small step for Neil, but it's a heck of a big leap for me,\" McCandless said of his untethered space walk, according to NASA.\n\nThe crew consisted of teacher-in-space Christa McAuliffe, astronauts Gregory Jarvis and Judith Resnik, mission commander Dick Scobee, astronaut Ronald McNair, pilot Mike Smith, and astronaut Ellison Onizuka.\n\nThe cause of the malfunction was later found to be rubber O-rings that were not sealed properly on the right Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster due to the cold weather.\n\nThe disaster was broadcast on live television.\n\nA memorial marker was also dedicated at Arlington National Cemetery in 1987, with the grave site featuring cremated remains from all seven crew members.\n\nIn place of a national space-shuttle program, NASA has partnered with Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to develop new vehicles for returning astronauts to the moon.\n\nIn May 2020, Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken flew on SpaceX's first crewed mission and became the first astronauts to launch into space from the US since NASA's space-shuttle program ended in 2011. They spent two months on the International Space Station before returning in August 2020.",

    "fullText": "A resurfaced incident from June 2022 about a Yellowstone National Park bison attack is drawing attention online, as viewers react to yet another reminder of how quickly wildlife encounters can turn dangerous when people get too close.\n\nABC News reported the occurrence at the time, detailing how a bull bison gored a 71-year-old woman while she visited the park — the third bison attack at Yellowstone that year.\n\nAccording to park officials, the woman and her daughter were heading back to their vehicle at Storm Point near Yellowstone Lake when they inadvertently approached the animal, causing it to charge. The woman suffered non-life-threatening injuries and was transported to a nearby hospital in Cody, Wyoming.\n\nThe story continues to circulate online as an example of how easily visitors can misjudge wild animals' behavior, especially during peak seasons.\n\nYellowstone urges visitors to stay at least 25 yards away from bison and other large animals. Despite appearing calm, bison are unpredictable and can run up to three times faster than humans.\n\n\"Mother bison are extremely protective of their calves in spring, and bulls can be more aggressive in July and August,\" Dennis Jorgensen, a bison program manager at the World Wildlife Fund, told ABC News.\n\nSimilar incidents have continued in the years since, with Yellowstone reporting additional bison-related injuries in 2024 and 2025, which are often tied to visitors approaching animals too closely for photos or videos.\n\nBeyond the danger to people, these encounters can also endanger wildlife. Animals that injure humans — even when provoked — may be euthanized, removing healthy animals from protected ecosystems because of human behavior.\n\nCommenters responding to ABC News' coverage on Facebook emphasized that the responsibility lies with visitors, not wildlife.\n\n\"I don't understand why such simple rules are broken these are wild animals and you are driving in their home,\" one person said.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAnother commenter wrote: \"The Rules are for Humans to follow.

    "description": "Using observations from the James Webb Space Telescope in a patch of the sky covering almost three times the area of the full moon, scientists have",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Using observations from the James Webb Space Telescope in a patch of the sky covering almost three times the area of the full moon, scientists have created the most detailed cosmic map to date of the mysterious substance called dark matter that ​accounts for most of the stuff that populates the universe.\n\nOrdinary matter makes up stars, planets, people and everything else we can see. But it represents ‌only about 15% of all the matter in the cosmos. The rest is dark matter, which does not emit or reflect light, making it invisible to the human eye and to telescopes.\n\nScientists infer its existence based ‌on the gravitational effects it exerts on a large scale such as how quickly galaxies rotate, how galaxy clusters are held together and how light from distant objects bends as it passes through massive cosmic structures.\n\nThe new map of the distribution of dark matter was based on this phenomenon of light bending - causing subtle distortions in the shape of roughly 250,000 distant galaxies as observed by Webb - thanks to the gravitational effects of matter along the line of sight.\n\nA previous map of dark matter was based on observations by the Hubble ⁠Space Telescope. The new map, powered by Webb's greater capabilities, ‌offers double the resolution of the previous map, spans more parts of the cosmos and peers further back in time - effectively looking to roughly 8 to 10 billion years ago, a key period for galaxy formation.\n\n\"This allows us to resolve finer dark matter structures, detect ‍mass concentrations that were previously unseen, and extend dark-matter mapping into earlier epochs of the universe,\" said observational cosmologist Diana Scognamiglio of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, lead author of the research published on Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nThe map reveals with unprecedented clarity new details of the macrostructure of the universe called the cosmic web - galaxy clusters, immense filaments built of dark ​matter along which galaxies and gas are distributed, as well as regions with less density of mass.\n\nWebb, an infrared telescope possessing about six times the light-gathering power of ‌Hubble, was launched in 2021 and became operational in 2022.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope is like putting on a new pair of glasses for the universe,\" Scognamiglio said. \"It sees fainter and more distant galaxies with much sharper detail than ever before. That effectively gives us a much denser grid of background galaxies to work with, which is exactly what you want for this kind of study. More galaxies and sharper images translate directly into a sharper map of dark matter.\"\n\nThe map covers a part of the sky called the Cosmic Evolution Survey, or COSMOS, located in the direction of the constellation Sextans. The map will facilitate future investigations of the universe in numerous ways, the researchers said.\n\n\"For example, ⁠a major question in astrophysics is how galaxies grow and evolve with time - how the universe went from an ​almost perfectly homogenous soup to the spectacular variety of galaxies we see today,\" said observational cosmologist and ​study co-author Jacqueline McCleary of Northeastern University in Boston.\n\n\"Dark matter halos - self-gravitating 'clouds' of dark matter - are the site of galaxy formation, the nurseries of galaxies, if you will. So knowing where the dark matter is, how much of it there is and connecting it to the population of galaxies inside ‍the dark matter distribution places an important boundary ⁠condition on models of galaxy formation and evolution,\" McCleary said.\n\nThe method used by the researchers involving the bending of light revealed the distribution of dark and ordinary matter.\n\nThe researchers said their observations are in harmony with the leading cosmological model - called Lambda-CDM, or cold dark matter - that explains the universe's beginning with the ⁠Big Bang and its subsequent evolution and structure. The model sees a universe dominated by dark matter and the invisible cosmic force called dark energy that is responsible for its accelerating expansion.\n\n\"In this framework, ‌dark matter provides the gravitational backbone on which galaxies, groups and clusters form, creating the large-scale cosmic web.

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — As more and more space junk comes crashing down, a new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track incoming objects by tuning into their sonic booms.\n\nScientists reported Thursday that seismic readings from sonic booms that were generated when a discarded module from a Chinese crew capsule reentered over Southern California in 2024 allowed them to place the object’s path nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) farther south than radar had predicted from orbit.\n\nUsing this method to track uncontrolled objects plummeting at supersonic speeds, they said, could help recovery teams reach any surviving pieces more quickly — crucial if the debris is dangerous.\n\n“The problem at the moment is we can track stuff very well in space,” said Johns Hopkins University’s Benjamin Fernando, the lead researcher. “But once it gets to the point that it’s actually breaking up in the atmosphere, it becomes very difficult to track.”\n\nHis team’s findings, published in the journal Science, focus on just one debris event. But the researchers already have used publicly available data from seismic networks to track a few dozen other reentries, including debris from three failed SpaceX Starship test flights in Texas.\n\nA growing concern among scientists and others is that falling space debris could strike a plane in flight.\n\n“There are thousands, tens of thousands, more satellites in orbit than there were 10 years ago,” including SpaceX’s Starlinks and other companies’ internet satellites, said Fernando. “Unfortunately, we don’t really have anything other than the word of the company to say that when they break up, they completely burn up in the atmosphere.”\n\nFernando, who normally studies quakes on the moon and Mars, teamed up with Imperial College London’s Constantinos Charalambous the day after the Chinese debris streaked across the California sky in 2024. Over time, they gathered data from more than 120 seismometers that captured the sonic booms from the reentry, using that data to plot the object’s suspected path.\n\nChina’s out-of-control module had been abandoned in a decaying orbit ever since it was cut loose from the Shenzhou-15 capsule returning three Chinese astronauts from their country’s space station in 2023. The 1.5-ton (1.36-metric tonne) module — more than 3 feet (1 meter) in size — broke into countless smaller pieces as it plummeted through the atmosphere, resulting in multiple sonic booms. Besides attempting to trace the object’s fall, the seismic readings provided a sense of the cascading breakup, Fernando said.\n\nFernando acknowledged it’s impossible to know how close his team’s predictions are to the actual path since no debris was reported on the ground.\n\nThe goal is to ascertain, within minutes or even seconds, the speed and direction of the incoming space junk as well as its fragmentation. In remote areas like the South Pacific, nuclear blast monitoring stations could potentially track the sonic booms to fine-tune the paths of descent. That’s where NASA plans to ditch the International Space Station in five years. SpaceX is working on the deorbiting vehicle to ensure a controlled entry.\n\nFernando is looking to eventually publish a catalog of seismically tracked, entering space objects, while improving future calculations by factoring in the wind’s effect on falling debris.\n\nIn a companion article in Science, Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Chris Carr, who was not involved in the study, said further research is needed to reduce the time between an object’s final plunge and the determination of its course.\n\nFor now, Carr said this new method “unlocks the rapid identification of debris fall-out zones, which is key information as Earth’s orbit is anticipated to become increasingly crowded with satellites, leading to a greater influx of space debris.”\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center is located on Dulles Airport property in Chantilly, Virginia, and the observation tower is its highest structure.\n\nParking costs $15, but admission to the museum is free.\n\nWhen I visited in January, the observation tower closed at 4:30 p.m., an hour before the rest of the museum closed at 5:30 p.m.\n\nThe observation tower was my last stop after touring the rest of the museum, so I was grateful for the chance to sit and rest my feet in the waiting area.\n\nAfter a short elevator ride, I arrived at the top of the tower.\n\nLooking down at the museum's 10-story aviation and space hangars from above showed me just how large the entire complex is: 760,000 square feet, to be exact.\n\nAn informational plaque indicated that the Bull Run and Catoctin mountain ranges were 12 miles away, and the Blue Ridge mountains were 23 miles away.\n\nI could see planes taking off and landing at the airport, with some planes passing directly over the observation tower. On a clearer day, I likely would have been able to see more aircraft in the sky.\n\nPlanes take off into the wind for extra lift. Landing into the wind helps them reduce speed.\n\nI could hear air traffic controllers instructing flights to turn certain directions or use certain runways at Dulles, but much of it was jargon meant for pilots.\n\nThe exhibit included a lighting control panel depicting airport runway layouts known as a \"mimic,\" a vacuum tube from a vintage communication radio, and a light gun used to communicate with pilots via lighting signals if radio isn't available.\n\nWhile touring the museum, my guide pointed out the Boeing 367-80 Jet Transport known as \"Dash 80.\" The only model of its kind ever built, the Dash 80 first took off in 1954 and was eventually developed into the first Boeing 707 jetliner, ushering in a new era of commercial air travel.\n\nAfter viewing the museum's vast collection of historic planes, watching passenger jets take off and land at Dulles gave me a deeper appreciation of how much — and how quickly — aviation has changed. I was glad I'd saved the best for last.",

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the company started robotaxi rides with no safety monitor present in the cars in Austin, a long-awaited move. This comes after Waymo announced another expansion of its robotaxi service in the US, hammering home its lead in the autonomous space — for now.\n\nMusk also claimed on Thursday that he expects the company’s self-driving service to get EU and China approval soon.\n\nTesla stock popped on the news, closing up over 4%.\n\nIn a post on X.com, Musk said Tesla \"started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car. Congrats to the Tesla AI team!\" This post came in response to users on X posting videos of the Tesla robotaxi operating without a safety driver.\n\nTesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy added on X.com that the service is \"starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Waymo, part of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), said on its company blog that it is now operating in the Miami area, inviting its first public riders in the city. “With nearly 10,000 residents already signed up, we will be inviting new riders on a rolling basis to ensure a seamless experience across our initial 60-square-mile service area.”\n\nWaymo says plans for rides to Miami International Airport will be coming soon.\n\nBefore the Miami announcement, Waymo operated in five major US markets: Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the greater San Francisco area.\n\nThis year, Waymo has an aggressive plan to expand, with Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and Nashville targeted for public service.\n\nIt also has plans for densely populated cities, with testing ongoing in New York, Tokyo, and London.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's autonomous and robotaxis services are lagging. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Musk claimed the company’s full self-driving (FSD) autonomous service, a supervised product that requires users to pay attention while using it, would soon be coming to Europe and China.\n\n\"We hope to ​get Supervised Full Self-Driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month, and then maybe a similar timing for China,\" Musk ‍said.\n\nWhile Waymo currently is only testing internationally in the cities mentioned above, its service is level 4 autonomous, which is fully autonomous in certain geographic areas. Tesla’s FSD is considered level 2.\n\nTesla’s robotaxis, currently operating in Austin and the San Francisco Bay area, have grown in numbers but only modestly. The robotaxis still require a safety driver in each vehicle, owing to the fact that it is still a supervised service. The new video shared by Musk suggests the company has approval to operate without a safety driver in Austin, but the CEO didn't share whether that was the case.",

    "title": "Six Ways to Use Staging Psychology to Sell Your House",
    "description": "Staging a house isn’t just making it look clean and neat—it’s about manipulating folks to see themselves in the space.",
    "fullText": "Selling a house is one of the largest transactions most of us will ever make. Considering how much you’ve invested in the place in terms of both money and sweat equity, it’s natural to want to get as much profit from the sale as possible. One strategy to maximize profits that most real estate professionals will recommend is staging: temporarily dressing, furnishing, and arranging the home to make it as appealing as possible.\n\nStaging works—it’s been shown to speed up the time to sale and to increase the sale price of a house. But it’s not magic—there’s a specific psychology to staging a house that you have to keep in mind, especially if you’re choosing to do it yourself in order to save a few bucks. It might seem like all you need to do is freshen the paint, clean the place up, and make a few furnishing choices, but if you want to get the most bang for your staging buck, you should keep staging psychology in mind.\n\nThe first thing to know about house staging psychology is the fundamental purpose of staging: It’s not to make the house look clean or presentable—it’s to shape a narrative. Essentially, you’re telling prospective buyers how they could live in your home. From where they’ll have their morning coffee to where they’ll entertain, you want to help them imagine what life will be like in the house. The easier you make it for people to see themselves living their ideal life there, the easier it will be to close the sale.\n\nIn order to support that narrative, there are specific psychological levers you’ll be pulling as you stage.\n\nFirst impressions really do matter, and the first staging psychology lever you’ll pull is what’s known as the “primacy effect.” This is a common cognitive bias wherein the first impression we get of something influences our perceptions in an outsized way. In other words, if the first impression people get from your home is that it’s luxurious and comfortable, this will override any negative impressions they get later in the house tour.\n\nStaging itself helps with this, of course, but you should also focus on the curb appeal and the entryway of the house to really cement that first impression as positive. Then, consider the fact that each room or space within the house will also offer its own first impression—that’s why decluttering is so vital. Clearing out your stuff and leaving behind a clean, curated visual will let potential buyers see a house they can easily move into, instead of getting an impression that they’d be buying a lot of chores.\n\nThe next bit of staging psychology you need to implement is anchoring—you want buyers to see the house as valuable right away so that impression gets anchored in their heads. This is why staged homes tend to sell for higher prices.\n\nThis involves staging with expensive-looking furniture, if you can, and decorating in a luxe way that implies high value. Seeing high-end decor, smart technology, and other expensive features cements in people’s minds that this is a high-value house, and they will be more willing to pay a premium for it because of that perceived value. Anchoring this value also lets you use the next bit of staging psychology—the Halo Effect.\n\nThe Halo Effect is a cognitive bias where a positive impression prevents you from seeing the flaws or downsides. If your property is a bit old or needs some work, staging it with a fresh, luxe look not only anchors a higher value in buyer’s minds, it can actually cause them to overlook those flaws. Even if they’re aware of some of the problems on one level, the overall sense of value and comfort is what will drive their decision-making.\n\nIt’s important to note that you shouldn’t try to conceal problems or needed upgrades; that would be unethical. The goal here is to let the staging drive a potential buyer’s enthusiasm so they willingly overlook those problems in favor of the comfortable, high-value narrative you’ve constructed.\n\nA key aspect of staging is triggering an emotional response in folks touring your house. Your goal is to make them imagine living there, and to make that fantasy one they associate with positive emotions. To do that, you’ll engage their senses:\n\nLighting. Soft lighting and a focus on natural light creates a warm, inviting atmosphere.\n\nScent. A house that smells fresh and clean is a comfortable space that doesn’t hint at a lot of work to be done. (Pro tip: Get someone who doesn’t live there to sniff the place out; we often become nose-blind to how our house smells.) You can also try to trigger a sense of nostalgia with the tried-and-true trick of baking some cookies. Don’t go overboard—an entire can of air freshener, a house that smells overwhelmingly of cookies, or a house that smells like you just cleaned it using buckets of bleach can backfire. Subtlety is key.\n\nAspiration. We all know there’s the way we think we’re going to live our lives, and then there’s reality. You want to offer potential buyers the fantasy. Maybe you don’t spend time cozied up in a reading nook with a good book and a cup of tea, for example, but you wish you did—so create that reading nook for buyers to picture themselves in. Their emotional attachment to the idea will make them more positive about the house overall.\n\nWhen staging a house, an easy psychological approach is to group things—furniture, decorations, lighting, even color palettes—using the Rule of Three. This is exactly what it sounds like: Arranging things in subtle groups of odd numbers (typically three) and arranging them to have some height and texture variety. The psychological effect is that this is perceived as more natural and less “stagey” than even numbers, and odd numbers tickle the brain’s need for symmetry, so people will be more engaged with your house.\n\nFinally, you want to make a buyer’s path to imagining themselves living in your clean, fresh, artfully decorated home as easy as possible—so get rid of yourself. Decluttering and depersonalizing doesn’t mean bare walls and empty rooms, it means going neutral with your decor and artwork. Get rid of the hobbies, the personal collections, and that weird lamp everyone else hates. Leaving some personal touches, like a few tasteful photos of the family, is a good idea—you don’t want the house to feel like a hotel. But you also don’t want people to feel like they’re intruding, or like they’re picking their way through your dirty laundry.",

Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, staff members repair and preserve historic aircraft in an in-house restoration hangar that offers a behind-the-scenes look at the work that goes into maintaining the museum's collection.\n\nThe Smithsonian museum's second location, situated about 30 miles from the National Air and Space Museum's flagship site in downtown Washington, DC, offers an expansive setting with 340,000 square feet of exhibit space.\n\nThe Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar, which is connected to the exhibits, can accommodate several aircraft at a time and houses everything workers might need, including a sheet-metal shop, a welding room, a paint room, and a fabric shop.\n\nIt also features floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the hangar, allowing visitors to watch the work happening in real time.\n\nHolly Williamson, public affairs specialist at the National Air and Space Museum, told Business Insider that visitors shouldn't expect to see planes being built with the speed of a factory assembly line. Progress can be slow, with some restoration projects spanning months or years.\n\n\"This kind of will look like paint drying if you just sit here for the whole day,\" Williamson said. \"It's a lot of research. It's very detail-oriented.\"\n\nDespite the slow pace, there's still plenty to see. One of the museum's longer-term projects is \"Flak-Bait,\" a Martin B-26 Marauder that flew 202 combat missions during World War II, including D-Day.\n\nWhen the museum first opened in 1976, visitors were allowed to touch the aircraft's nose, which wore down the paint. Workers have focused on restoring its appearance while preserving its authentic combat damage.\n\n\"It flew more missions than any other aircraft in World War II for the US, so we want it to look like it's been through hundreds of missions,\" Williamson said.\n\nAnother striking display is a Sikorsky JRS-1 seaplane, the only aircraft in the museum's collection that was present at Pearl Harbor when it was attacked on December 7, 1941. After Pearl Harbor, the Sikorsky JRS-1 patrolled for Japanese submarines. It arrived at the Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar in 2011.\n\nStaff members are also working to restore a McDonnell F-4S Phantom II, a fighter and bomber that shot down an MiG-21 during the Vietnam War. After the Vietnam War, it underwent modernization and was redeployed in 1983, remaining in service until its last squadron duty in 1987.\n\nThe rest of the hangar floor is a maze of tools, machinery, aircraft parts, and storage bins, indicators of just how intricate the museum's restoration efforts are.\n\nCertainly more interesting than watching paint dry.",

Blue Origin said the network would be meant to serve a maximum of roughly 100,000 customers.\n\nThe reveal of TeraWave coincides with a space industry rush to build data centers in space that can meet the soaring demand for large-scale AI data processing, which on Earth requires immense energy and resources as adoption of the technology expands.\n\nThe planned network adds another satellite constellation linked to Bezos, executive chairperson of Amazon, which is in an early phase of deploying Leo – a network formerly called Project Kuiper – involving 3,200 satellites providing internet to consumers and businesses.\n\nMusk’s Starlink network of roughly 10,000 satellites is farthest ahead in a global push to put internet infrastructure in space, where swarms of low-orbiting satellites offer more security and higher connection speeds than traditional, unitary satellites farther out in space.\n\nThe SpaceX CEO has said he plans to build data centers in space, complementing the Starlink network, while Bezos has predicted such space-based centers will be commonplace in orbit within the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nStarlink, which has reported more than 6 million customers across at least 140 countries, targets individual consumers, businesses, governments and, with its Starshield variant, US national security agencies. Amazon Leo, with 180 satellites in space so far, has a similar customer strategy.\n\nA handful of Chinese companies are swiftly deploying similar satellite networks to get up to pace with Starlink, which has proved key for remote communications and geopolitical conflicts. China is developing new reusable rockets that can loft thousands of these satellites over the next several years for lower costs, a playbook first written by Musk’s SpaceX and its reusable Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nBlue Origin’s reusable New Glenn rocket, which has launched twice but has been slow to achieve a rapid flight rate, will likely be a vital part of TeraWave’s deployment.\n\nUnlike Starlink, the planned network appears off-limits to individual consumers, according to Blue Origin’s statement.\n\nBlue Origin’s statement said: “TeraWave enterprise-grade user and gateway terminals can be rapidly deployed worldwide and interface with existing high-capacity infrastructure, providing additional route diversity and strengthening overall network resilience,” leaving unclear what types of existing infrastructure the network can work with.",

    "description": "Jeff Bezos' space venture, Blue Origin, has unveiled a satellite network aimed at challenging Elon Musk's SpaceX dominance in orbit.",
    "fullText": "Jeff Bezos has unveiled his plans for a massive satellite network, mounting a direct challenge to Elon Musk's grip on internet infrastructure in orbit.\n\nThe project, called TeraWave, would deploy 5,408 satellites into orbit to serve data centers, governments, and businesses worldwide, Bezos's space venture, Blue Origin, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nLaunches are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2027.\n\nTeraWave is designed to deliver \"data speeds of up to 6 terabits per second anywhere on Earth,\" enabled by advanced optical communications between satellites, the company said.\n\nThe network is \"optimized for enterprise, data center, and government customers\" and would serve up to 100,000 customers, it added.\n\nThe announcement comes after Bezos' other company, Amazon, rebranded its consumer satellite network Leo in November. Formerly known as Project Kuiper, the initial constellation design includes more than 3,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites providing standard broadband service.\n\nThe launch of TeraWave raises the stakes in a billionaire-led fight over space-based internet infrastructure. Starlink, led by Elon Musk, dominates the field with roughly 10,000 satellites in orbit. The subsidiary project of SpaceX targets consumers, businesses, and governments, and serves more than 6 million users globally.\n\nIn a reply to an X user on Monday, Musk said \"Starlink space to ground laser links will exceed this,\" referring to the data speeds touted by TeraWave.\n\nSpaceX has also begun laying the regulatory groundwork to scale its satellite operations. In a January filing with the US Federal Communications Commission, the company said satellite systems should be treated as essential infrastructure for future wireless networks as the US seeks to maintain leadership in next-generation space-based services.\n\nBeyond internet access, the satellite race is increasingly tied to the future of computing, as tech leaders point to satellite networks as potential infrastructure for future data centers in space.\n\nResponding on X to an article about building data centers in space, Musk said in October that \"simply scaling up Starlink V3 satellites, which have high speed laser links would work.\"\n\n\"SpaceX will be doing this,\" he added.\n\nMusk has also discussed the idea internally. During an xAI all-hands meeting in December, he said he sees data centers eventually moving off Earth, raising the possibility of space-based facilities that could be operated by Tesla Optimus robots, people with knowledge of the meeting told Business Insider.\n\nJeff Bezos has voiced a similar long-term view, predicting that data centers could shift to space within the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said in November that the concept may sound \"crazy,\" but \"when you truly step back and envision the amount of compute we're going to need, it starts making sense and it's a matter of time.\"",

    "fullText": "NASA astronaut Suni Williams, who famously stayed in space for an extended nine-month visit because of problems with an experimental capsule, has retired after 27 years, NASA said Tuesday.\n\nWilliams retired effective Dec. 27, NASA said in a statement. Williams, a former Navy pilot, joined NASA in 1988.\n\n\"Suni Williams has been a trailblazer in human spaceflight, shaping the future of exploration through her leadership aboard the space station and paving the way for commercial missions to low Earth orbit,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in the statement.\n\nWilliams went on three missions to the International Space Station, the first of which was in 2006 and in which she was carried aboard the space shuttle Discovery, NASA said.\n\nBut it was the most recent, in 2024, in which the planned one-week stay stretched from June until March 2025 because of concerns over Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, which was on a test mission.\n\nStarliner launched June 5, 2024, taking Williams and Butch Wilmore to the space station on its first crewed flight. But there were problems with the capsule's thrusters during the docking process, and eventually, in September, NASA decided to return the capsule with no one on board.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore spent 286 days aboard the International Space Station.\n\nA SpaceX Dragon capsule was then sent up to bring the pair, as well as two other astronauts who were wrapping up a six-month mission, back to Earth. The Dragon capsule left the space station on March 18 and splashed down in the ocean off Florida.\n\nOver her career, Williams logged 608 days in space, which is the second-longest cumulative time in space in NASA history, the space agency said.\n\nShe also logged the most spacewalk time of any female astronaut, at 62 hours and 6 minutes, which is the fourth-most time of any NASA astronaut, it said.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore have said they enjoyed their extended time living and working at the orbiting outpost, even though it was longer than expected.\n\n\"The plan went way off for what we had planned, but because we’re in human spaceflight, we prepare for any number of contingencies,” Wilmore said in late March, after they returned to Earth. “This is a curvy road. You never know where it’s going to go.”\n\nWilliams said her recovery on Earth after the longer-than-intended space stay was helped by her previous space flights.\n\n“Though it was longer than any flight either one of us have flown before, I think my body remembered,” she told NBC News in an interview alongside Wil\n\nWilliams called her career and the opportunities to serve at NASA an \"incredible honor.\"\n\n\"Anyone who knows me knows that space is my absolute favorite place to be,\" she said in NASA's statement.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The astronauts evacuated last week from the International Space Station say a portable ultrasound machine came in “super handy” during the medical crisis.\n\nDuring their first public appearance since returning to Earth, the four astronauts refused Wednesday to say which one of them needed medical attention and for what reason. It was NASA's first medical evacuation in 65 years of human spaceflight.\n\nNASA’s Mike Fincke said the crew used the onboard ultrasound machine once the medical problem arose Jan. 7, the day before a planned spacewalk that was abruptly canceled. The astronauts had already used the device a lot for routine checks of their body changes while living in weightlessness, “so when we had this emergency, the ultrasound machine came in super handy.”\n\nIt was so useful that Fincke said there should be one on all future spaceflights. “It really helped,” he said.\n\n“Of course, we didn't have other big machines that we have here on planet Earth,” he added. “We do try to make sure that everybody before we fly are really, really not prone to surprises. But sometimes things happen and surprises happen, and the team was ready ... preparation was super important.\"\n\nThe space station is set up as well as it can be for medical emergencies, said NASA's Zena Cardman, who commanded the crew's early return flight with SpaceX. She said NASA “made all the right decisions” in canceling the spacewalk, which would have been her first, and prioritizing the crew's well-being.\n\nJapanese astronaut Kimiya Yui said he was surprised how well all the preflight training paid off in dealing with the health concerns.\n\n“We can handle any kind of difficult situation,” Yui said. “This is actually very, very good experience for the future of human spaceflight.”\n\nJoining them on what turned out to be a 5 1/2-month mission — more than a month shorter than planned — was Russia's Oleg Platonov. They launched last August from Florida and splashed down in the Pacific off the San Diego coast last week.\n\nWelcoming them back to Houston were their replacements, who aren't due to launch until mid-February. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the flight.\n\n“We were hoping to give them hugs in space, but we gave them hugs on Earth,” Fincke said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "description": "We still don't know what happened.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this month, NASA announced that it had to cancel a scheduled spacewalk, citing a “medical situation” affecting a “single crew member who is stable” on board the International Space Station.\n\nThe mystery illness eventually led to the space agency staging the first medical evacuation in 25 years of continuous operation on board the aging orbital outpost, rushing four astronauts back to Earth in a move that brought the station’s number of occupants from seven to a skeleton crew of just three.\n\nWhile the medical incident only affected a single astronaut, who has yet to be identified for privacy reasons, all four members of the Crew-11 mission cut their time on board the ISS short by weeks, safely splashing down off the coast of San Diego early Thursday morning.\n\nThe four astronauts were airlifted to the Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego via helicopter for a “planned overnight stay at a local medical facility for additional evaluation,” according to a January 16 statement. After being “released as expected,” they continued their journey to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will “continue standard postflight reconditioning and evaluations.”\n\nDo you know anything about what caused the evacuation from the ISS? Drop us a line at tips@futurism.com. We can keep you anonymous.\n\n“All crew members remain stable,” the space agency reassured. “To protect the crew’s medical privacy, no specific details regarding the condition or individual will be shared.”\n\nIt’s an exceedingly rare event, highlighting the challenges inherent to providing healthcare in space. While hundreds of miles above the surface, specialized care is hard, if not impossible, to execute. While astronauts undergo rigorous EMT-level training so they can respond to emergencies on board the station, they aren’t full-blown medical professionals, and can only do so much under the direction of doctors back on Earth.\n\nThere’s a lot to still learn about providing care during medical emergencies, particularly when it comes to long-duration space exploration missions into deep space. According to a 2022 study, there still are plenty of “gaps in knowledge regarding the potential for unanticipated in-flight medical events to affect crew health and capacity, and potentially compromise mission success.”\n\nAs researchers from Northumbria University in Newcastle point out in a recent essay for The Conversation, medical emergencies are remarkably rare on the ISS, despite being expected to occur on average every three years. Studies have shown that the most common health issues astronauts experience are skin irritation, congestion, disruptions to sleep, and in-flight injuries — most of which are ironically caused by exercise, which is designed to protect astronauts’ long-term health.\n\nSpending prolonged periods in a microgravity environment has also been shown to affect astronauts’ vision and blood pressure.\n\nNow that there’s finally been a medical emergency on the station, though, it’s unclear whether the public — or even the broader medical community — will ever find out any details.\n\nMore on the evacuation: Entire Space Station Down to Skeleton Crew After NASA Evacuation",

    "description": "Near-weightless conditions can mutate genes and alter the physical structures of bacteria and phages, disrupting their normal interactions in ways that could help us treat drug-resistant infections.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nBacteria and the viruses that infect them, called phages, are locked in an evolutionary arms race. But that evolution follows a different trajectory when the battle takes place in microgravity, a study conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) reveals.\n\nAs bacteria and phages duke it out, bacteria evolve better defenses to survive while phages evolve new ways to penetrate those defenses. The new study, published Jan. 13 in the journal PLOS Biology, details how that skirmish unfolds in space and reveals insights that could help us design better drugs for antibiotic-resistant bacteria on Earth.\n\nIn the study, researchers compared populations of E. coli infected with a phage known as T7. One set of microbes was incubated aboard the ISS, while identical control groups were grown on Earth.\n\nThe analysis of the space-station samples revealed that microgravity fundamentally altered the speed and nature of phage infection.\n\nWhile the phages could still successfully infect and kill the bacteria in space, the process took longer than it did in the Earth samples. In an earlier study, the same researchers had hypothesized that infection cycles in microgravity would be slower because fluids don't mix as well in microgravity as they do in Earth's gravity.\n\n\"This new study validates our hypothesis and expectation,\" said lead study author Srivatsan Raman, an associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nOn Earth, the fluids bacteria and viruses exist within are constantly being stirred by gravity — warm water rises, cold water sinks, and heavier particles settle at the bottom. This keeps everything moving and bumping into each other.\n\nIn space, there is no stirring; everything just floats. So because the bacteria and phages weren't bumping into each other as often, phages had to adapt to a much slower pace of life and become more efficient at grabbing onto passing bacteria.\n\nExperts think understanding this alternative form of phage evolution could help them develop new phage therapies. These emerging treatments for infections use phages to kill bacteria or make the germs more vulnerable to traditional antibiotics.\n\n\"If we can work out what phages are doing on the genetic level in order to adapt to the microgravity environment, we can apply that knowledge to experiments with resistant bacteria,\" Nicol Caplin, a former astrobiologist at the European Space Agency who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. \"And this can be a positive step in the race to optimise antibiotics on Earth.\"\n\nWhole-genome sequencing revealed that both the bacteria and the phages on the ISS accumulated distinctive genetic mutations not observed in the samples on Earth. The space-based viruses accumulated specific mutations that boosted their ability to infect bacteria, as well as their ability to bind to bacterial receptors. Simultaneously, the E. coli developed mutations that protected against the phages' attacks — by tweaking their receptors, for instance — and enhanced their survival in microgravity.\n\nThen, the researchers used a technique called deep mutational scanning to examine the changes in the viruses' receptor-binding proteins. They found that the adaptations driven by the unique cosmic environment may have practical applications back home.\n\nWhen the phages were transported back to Earth and tested, the space-adapted changes in their receptor-binding protein resulted in increased activity against E. coli strains that commonly cause urinary tract infections. These strains are typically resistant to the T7 phages.\n\n\"It was a serendipitous finding,\" Raman said. \"We were not expecting that the [mutant] phages that we identified on the ISS would kill pathogens on Earth.\"\n\n—Antibiotic found hiding in plain sight could treat dangerous infections, early study finds\n\n—How fast can antibiotic resistance evolve?\n\n—Antibiotic resistance makes once-lifesaving drugs useless. Could we reverse it?\n\n\"These results show how space can help us improve the activity of phage therapies,\" said Charlie Mo, an assistant professor in the Department of Bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"However,\" Mo added, \"we do have to factor in the cost of sending phages into space or simulating microgravity on Earth to achieve these results.\"\n\nIn addition to helping fight infections in Earthbound patients, the research could help yield more effective phage therapies for use in microgravity, Mo suggested. \"This could be important for astronauts' health on long-term space missions — for example, missions to the moon or Mars, or prolonged ISS stays.\"",

    "description": "Earth and its neighbors orbit the sun on a relatively flat plane. But what's below this plane, and is anythign below the Earth?",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nIf you've seen illustrations or models of the solar system, maybe you noticed that all the planets orbit the Sun in more or less the same plane, traveling in the same direction.\n\nBut what is above and below that plane? And why are the planets' orbits aligned like this, in a flat pancake, rather than each one traveling in a completely different plane?\n\nI'm a planetary scientist who works with robotic spacecraft, such as rovers and orbiters. When my colleagues and I send them out to explore our solar system, it's important for us to understand the 3D map of our space neighborhood.\n\nEarth's gravity has a lot to do with what people think is up and what is down. Things fall down toward the ground, but that direction depends on where you are.\n\nImagine you're standing somewhere in North America and point downward. If you extend a line from your fingertip all the way through the Earth, that line would point in the direction of \"up\" to someone on a boat in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nIn the bigger picture, \"down\" could be defined as being below the plane of the solar system, which is known as the ecliptic. By convention, we say that above the plane is where the planets are seen to orbit counterclockwise around the Sun, and from below they are seen to orbit clockwise.\n\nIs there anything special about the direction of down relative to the ecliptic? To answer that, we need to zoom out even farther. Our solar system is centered on the Sun, which is just one of about 100 billion stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way.\n\nEach of these stars, and their associated planets, are all orbiting around the center of the Milky Way, just like the planets orbit their stars, but on a much longer time scale. And just as the planets in our solar system are not in random orbits, stars in the Milky Way orbit the center of the galaxy close to a plane, which is called the galactic plane.\n\nThis plane is not oriented the same way as our solar system's ecliptic. In fact, the angle between the two planes is about 60 degrees.\n\nGoing another step back, the Milky Way is part of a cluster of galaxies known the the Local Group, and — you can see where this is going — these galaxies mostly fall within another plane, called the supergalactic plane. The supergalactic plane is almost perpendicular to the galactic plane, with an angle between the two planes of about 84.5 degrees.\n\nHow these bodies end up traveling paths that are close to the same plane has to do with how they formed in the first place.\n\nThe material that would ultimately compose the Sun and the planets of the solar system started out as a diffuse and very extensive cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. Every particle within the solar nebula had a tiny amount of mass. Because any mass exerts gravitational force, these particles were attracted to each other, though only very weakly.\n\nThe particles in the solar nebula started out moving very slowly. But over a long time, the mutual attraction these particles felt thanks to gravity caused the cloud to start to draw inward on itself, shrinking.\n\nThere would have also been some very slight overall rotation to the solar nebula, maybe thanks to the gravitational tug of a passing star. As the cloud collapsed, this rotation would have increased in speed, just like a spinning figure skater spins faster and faster as they draw their arms in toward their body.\n\nAs the cloud continued shrinking, the individual particles grew closer to each other and had more and more interactions affecting their motion, both because of gravity and collisions between them. These interactions caused individual particles in orbits that were tilted far from the direction of the overall rotation of the cloud to reorient their orbits.\n\nFor example, if a particle coming down through the orbital plane slammed into a particle coming up through that plane, the interaction would tend to cancel out that vertical motion and reorient their orbits into the plane.\n\nEventually, what was once an amorphous cloud of particles collapsed into a disc shape. Then particles in similar orbits started clumping together, eventually forming the Sun and all the planets that orbit it today.\n\nOn much bigger scales, similar sorts of interactions are probably what ended up confining most of the stars that make up the Milky Way into the galactic plane, and most of the galaxies that make up the Local Group into the supergalactic plane.\n\nThe orientations of the ecliptic, galactic and supergalactic planes all go back to the initial random rotation direction of the clouds they formed from.\n\nSo there's not really anything special about the direction we define as \"down\" relative to the Earth, other than the fact that there's not much orbiting the Sun in that direction.\n\nIf you go far enough in that direction, you'll eventually find other stars with their own planetary systems orbiting in completely different orientations. And if you go even farther, you might encounter other galaxies with their own planes of rotation.\n\nThis question highlights one of my favorite aspects of astronomy: It puts everything in perspective. If you asked a hundred people on your street, \"Which way is down?\" every one of them would point in the same direction. But imagine you asked that question of people all over the Earth, or of intelligent life forms in other planetary systems or even other galaxies. They'd all point in different directions.\n\nThis edited article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.",

    "fullText": "Scientists have discovered a large bar‑shaped cloud of iron atoms in space that could offer clues about the future of Earth.\n\nThe structure, which was found inside the Ring Nebula - a famous, colourful cloud formed when a dying sun-like star released its outer layers - was roughly 500 times wider than Pluto's orbit and sits 2,283 light‑years away.\n\nAstronomers from Cardiff University, as well as University College London, detected the iron bar using a new telescope instrument called the WHT Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer (Weave).\n\nScientists observing it say its origin is unclear, but their theories about how it formed suggest it could hint at the Earth's future.\n\nThe first theory is the cloud may have formed during the nebula's creation, as the parent star collapsed.\n\nAlternatively, experts believe it could be space plasma, left behind from a rocky planet that was destroyed as the star expanded. If true, it could offer a preview of Earth's future as the sun - Earth's parent star - expels its outer layers in a similar way, engulfing Earth, in a few billion years.\n\nThe team said it was planning further observations to unravel precisely what the iron bar was, where it came from, and what it could tell them.\n\nDying star images show details never seen before\n\nThe amazing images taken by the $10bn telescope\n\nLead author Dr Roger Wesson, based jointly at Cardiff University and UCL, said although the Ring Nebula had been studied using many different telescopes and instruments, Weave had allowed them \"to observe it in a new way, providing so much more detail than before\".\n\nHe said: \"By obtaining a spectrum continuously across the whole nebula, we can create images of the nebula at any wavelength and determine its chemical composition at any position.\n\n\"When we processed the data and scrolled through the images, one thing popped out as clear as anything – this previously unknown 'bar' of ionized iron atoms, in the middle of the familiar and iconic ring.\"\n\nCo-author Prof Janet Drew added: \"We definitely need to know more – particularly whether any other chemical elements co-exist with the newly-detected iron, as this would probably tell us the right class of model to pursue.\"\n\nWeave is set to carry out eight surveys over the next five years, targeting everything from nearby white dwarfs - a type of dead star - to very distant galaxies.\n\nWesson added: \"It would be very surprising if the iron bar in the Ring is unique.\n\n\"So hopefully, as we observe and analyse more nebulae created in the same way, we will discover more examples of this phenomenon, which will help us to understand where the iron comes from.\"\n\nHealth and safety rules 'don't really apply' to Michelin restaurants, says food critic\n\nTV doctor says ADHD and OCD diagnoses have 'changed my life'\n\nGavin and Stacey stars reveal details of their new TV comedy",

Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data.

    "title": "Senator Cruz wants commercial space stations up and manned before ISS retires",
    "description": "It comes up almost every time that I see him. Continuous human presence and no gap.\"",
    "fullText": "In remarks this week to a Texas space organization, a key Senate staff member said an “extension” of the International Space Station is on the table and that NASA needs to accelerate a program to replace the aging station with commercial alternatives.\n\nMaddy Davis, a space policy staff member for US Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, made the comments to the Texas Space Coalition during a virtual event.\n\nCruz is chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and has an outsized say in space policy. As a senator from Texas, he has a parochial interest in Johnson Space Center, where the International Space Station Program is led.\n\nDavis said Cruz has repeatedly reaffirmed that one of his core priorities is establishing a continuous human presence in low-Earth orbit, with “no gap” in that capability. That means he wants commercial space stations operating before the International Space Station is de-orbited, which is currently scheduled for 2030.\n\n“He’s very painfully clear,” Davis said. “It comes up almost every time that I see him. Continuous human presence and no gap.”\n\nTo that end, Davis said she has been pressing NASA to accelerate the program to develop private space stations, known as Commercial LEO Destinations, or CLDs. In this program, NASA has previously provided funding to four different companies to develop space station concepts. The CLD program will soon enter “Phase 2,” in which these and other companies will compete for larger amounts of funding—at least hundreds of millions of dollars. One or two companies are likely to win these larger contracts. They will then build their stations with a mix of public and privately raised funding.\n\nTo kick off this competition, NASA is due to issue a long-delayed “request for proposals,” or RFP.\n\n“Earlier today, I was having a briefing with NASA and begging for—we really needed that RFP released for CLDs like nine months ago,” Davis said. “But here we are still begging for it.”\n\nThe program has largely been stuck in neutral over the last year as the space agency’s leadership has been in flux. Interim NASA Administrator Sean Duffy threw a grenade of sorts into the process last August by issuing a new directive that changed the rules for private space stations. This appeared to favor some of the companies over others. But this directive is now being reviewed by new NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman and his team, and the requirements for these stations may well shift again.\n\nThe delays and different directives “added a lot more gray” to the process, Davis said. “It’s not very helpful for these CLDs that are trying to bring on investors,” she added.\n\nGiven that the International Space Station is now scheduled to be decommissioned in fewer than five years, Davis was asked whether Cruz would consider extending the life of the space station beyond 2030. This is a proposal favored by Boeing, which has the contract to operate the station. However, there are serious questions about the viability of the aging station, elements of which are now more than two and a half decades old.\n\n“It’s completely dependent on the development of the CLD platforms,” Davis said of a possible extension. “And that’s not a ding or any sort of a shrouded threat there. You know, these are very highly complicated platforms, and we haven’t had much direction from NASA on it. So to answer the question, maybe. If it starts to look like we’re creeping into a situation where we are not going to have any sort of a platform or capability in LEO for humans, extension is not off the table. The chairman did that last time—it certainly is within his wheelhouse.”\n\nCruz also played a key role in the confirmation process of Isaacman, whose nomination passed through the Commerce Committee. At times, it looked like Cruz was slow-walking the nomination, but Davis said she has liked what she’s seen from NASA’s new leader since he was sworn in to the top job about three weeks ago.\n\n“I have high hopes,” she said. “And I think the way that he’s responded to the Crew 11 situation has been refreshing. It’s clear that he is taking it very seriously, and their communication has been almost in near real-time with us, and very clear and concise. So that has been really lovely. And then it’s clear that he wants to make sure that Artemis II goes off not just as quickly as possible but as safely.”",

    "title": "'Death by a thousand cuts': James Webb Space Telescope figures out how black hole murdered Pablo's Galaxy",
    "description": "\"It points to a slow starvation rather than a single dramatic death blow.\"",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nAstronomers have discovered that a young galaxy was gradually starved by its central supermassive black hole, in what was effectively a cosmic \"death by a thousand cuts.\"\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) studied this unfortunate galaxy, known as GS-10578 or by the slightly snappier nickname \"Pablo's Galaxy\" in honor of the first astronomer to study it in detail. The light from Pablo's Galaxy has taken around 11 billion years to reach us, meaning the JWST and ALMA allow astronomers to see it as it was just 3 billion years after the Big Bang. For such an early galaxy, it is exceptionally massive, containing as much mass as around 200 billion suns.\n\nThe majority of the stars in Pablo's Galaxy seem to have formed between 12.5 billion and 11.5 billion years ago. However, this galaxy seems to have stopped forming stars and has exhausted its supply of star-forming cold gas despite its relatively young age. As astronomers define the cessation of star formation and the transition into quiescence as the \"death\" of a galaxy, that means Pablo's Galaxy \"lived fast and died young.\"\n\nThe team behind this study first released results concerning Pablo's Galaxy back in Sept. 2024, using the JWST alone, finding that the supermassive black hole at its heart is pushing away huge amounts of gas at speeds as great as 2.2 million miles per hour (3.5 million km/h). That's fast enough to allow this star-forming matter to escape the gravitational influence of Pablo's Galaxy entirely.\n\nAdding ALMA, an array of 66 radio telescopes located in the Atacama Desert region of northern Chile, the researchers observed Pablo's Galaxy for a further seven hours searching for carbon monoxide, which they could use as a way to trace cold hydrogen gas, the stuff that forms stars. However, this search turned up empty-handed.\n\nBut this in itself was telling.\n\n\"What surprised us was how much you can learn by not seeing something,\" team member Jan Scholtz from Cambridge University in the UK said in a statement. \"Even with one of ALMA's deepest observations of this kind of galaxy, there was essentially no cold gas left. It points to a slow starvation rather than a single dramatic death blow.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a further 6.5 hours of observations with the JWST revealed that Pablo's Galaxy is losing about 60 suns' worth of mass in gas each year. At that rate, the galaxy's fuel for star formation could have been exhausted in a timescale of between 16 million and 220 million years. If that seems like an incredibly long period of time, consider that scientists normally estimate that it takes as long as a billion years to exhaust their fuel for star-formation in a galaxy such as this.\n\n\"The galaxy looks like a calm, rotating disc,\" team co-leader Francesco D'Eugenio of the Kavli Institute for Cosmology said. \"That tells us it didn't suffer a major, disruptive merger with another galaxy. Yet it stopped forming stars 400 million years ago, while the black hole is yet again active.\n\nThe team reconstructed the star formation history of Pablo's Galaxy, finding that fresh gas has been prevented by the black hole pushing gas outward from falling back into the galaxy. This prevents allowing the \"fuel tanks\" for star birth from being refilled. They also discovered that the supermassive black hole in this young galaxy didn't push away all of its gas at once, but has been experiencing repeated cycles of gas expulsion.\n\n\"So the current black hole activity and the outburst of gas we observed didn't cause the shutdown; instead, repeated episodes likely kept the fuel from coming back,\" D'Eugenio added.\n\nThe team's findings could help to explain why the JWST has been discovering lots of old-looking galaxies in the early universe.\n\n\"You don't need a single cataclysm to stop a galaxy forming stars, just keep the fresh fuel from coming in. Before Webb, these were unheard of,\" Scholtz said. \"Now we know they're more common than we thought — and this starvation effect may be why they live fast and die young.\"\n\nWith the effectiveness of the ALMA/JWST telescope tag-team established, astronomers hope that further observations of Pablo's Galaxy can reveal more about the mechanism used by the supermassive black hole to prematurely starve this galaxy to death.\n\nThe team's research was published on Tuesday (Nov. 25) in the journal Nature Astronomy.",

    "description": "China has broken a record by installing a massive hypergravity machine that can \"compress\" time and space for the benefit of important experiments.",
    "fullText": "After holding onto the record for possessing the world's most powerful centrifuge (or hypergravity machine) for close to three decades, the U.S. ceded that title to China in 2025. When China's new hypergravity machine — the CHIEF1300 — came online in September 2025, it yanked the title from the centrifuge installed in the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center's (ERDC) Centrifuge Research Complex (CRC) located at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The CHIEF1300's (CHIEF is short for Centrifugal Hypergravity and Interdisciplinary Experiment Facility) reign at the top, however, would only last a few months. In December 2025, China commissioned another even more powerful centrifuge, the CHIEF1900, which is currently the world's most powerful centrifuge.\n\nHypergravity centrifuges are machines designed to produce gravitational forces thousands of times stronger than that of the Earth. They do this by rotating at extremely high speeds and, in the process, creating artificial gravity. These machines have been used by agencies like NASA and ESA for various research purposes, ranging from earthquake simulations, dam failures, and the impact of a high gravity environment on living things. In contrast to hypergravity centrifuges, there are also machines that simulate gravity lower than Earth's.\n\nChina on Monday launched the world's largest centrifuge in terms of capacity, capable of generating 300 times Earth's gravity for a load up to 20 tonnes. The machine, coded CHIEF1300, is one of the core components of the Centrifugal Hypergravity and Interdisciplinary Experiment... pic.twitter.com/3ljFrx334o\n\n— China Science (@ChinaScience) September 29, 2025\n\nAs for the claim that these machines compress space and time, it doesn't actually work the way you may have imagined. One of the purposes of these machines is to test small models of huge structures like dams or foundations. Under high gravity, these tiny models feel the same forces a real-world structure would feel, so a small setup behaves like something much larger. Higher gravity also makes slow processes like soil settling or water flow accelerate, so years of real-world behavior can be observed in days or weeks. This is how hypergravity machines can \"compress\" space and time.\n\nThe capacity of large centrifuges is measured using a unit called g·tonnes (gravity-tonnes). A centrifuge that most people use in their daily lives is a typical washing machine, which, during its fastest spin cycle, generates close to 2 g.tonnes of effective force. The long-time record-holding U.S. centrifuge at Vicksburg was rated at 1,200 g·tonnes — already hundreds of times more powerful than anything encountered in everyday life. China's CHIEF1300 pushed that to 1,300 g.tonnes. The current record holder — the CHIEF1900 — takes it much further, and if not evident already, it is rated to generate up to 1,900 g.tonnes of force.\n\nBoth of China's record-breaking hypergravity centrifuges are located at the CHIEF facility, which is part of the Zhejiang University campus in Hangzhou and has been under construction since 2019. The facility is located 49 feet below ground — a move aimed at minimizing vibrations that could be generated while operating these centrifuges.\n\nWhile the CHIEF1900 has just been installed, its predecessor — the CHIEF1300 — has already been used for several experiments. Notable among these is a study that measured the amount of seismic energy a hydropower-focused dam foundation can withstand. Another group of scientists used it to study the effect of large waves on the seabed. These included looking at the impact of 13-foot high wind-driven waves and a massive 65-foot tsunami on the seabed. The aim of this study was to ascertain if the chosen site is a good candidate to install an offshore wind farm. The CHIEF1300 was also able to reproduce the extreme pressure experienced at depths of around 2000 meters (6500 feet) in the ocean.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "Stephen Hutyra was inspired by a Facebook post to build a pub in his backyard. He spent $61,000 and created the space of his dreams.",
    "fullText": "Stephen Hutyra was scrolling Facebook in November 2020 when a post caught his attention.\n\nIt showed a couple in England who'd built a small pub in their backyard. Their design was simple, but inspiring.\n\nThe 42-year-old program analyst, who lives in the small town of West, Texas, immediately started imagining what it'd be like to have his own.\n\n\"We have a saying that everything is bigger and better in Texas,\" he told Business Insider. \"So I wanted our pub to be bigger and better than the one I saw in the picture.\"\n\nHutyra asked his wife if she'd be on board, and as soon as she said yes, he began buying furniture on Facebook Marketplace — despite not having a structure yet.\n\nHe later took out a bank loan, enlisted a contractor, and spent months perfecting his dream space. Now, Hutyra is the proud owner of The Thirsty Goat, a private pub built right in his backyard.\n\nHutyra told Business Insider that he'd joined the Navy right after high school and was first stationed in England. He lived in the seaside town of Newquay, where he'd frequent its various nightlife spots.\n\n\"I fell in love with all the pubs, and walking down the street to hang out with both Navy and local friends I'd made,\" he said. \"I'd really missed that part of my life.\"\n\nSo when he saw a Facebook post about a UK couple building a small pub in their backyard, a lightbulb went off: Hutyra could create his own in his Texas backyard.\n\nFor years, the grassy area had been Hutyra's space to store wood and let the family dogs play.\n\nAs soon as he envisioned a backyard pub, though, he knew the open land was the perfect spot.\n\n\"I almost immediately started making floor plans, buying tables and chairs off Facebook Marketplace, decor off Amazon, and bar items on eBay,\" he said.\n\nHutyra also started to virtually design the future pub. He spent hours on Facebook, Pinterest, and Google, where he found inspiration and added ideas to a PowerPoint presentation.\n\n\"My wife and I were driving back from a vacation in Port Aransas on the Texas coastline, and I said we had to make a pit stop at a bank to sign some loan papers,\" Hutyra said. \"She asked what for, and I said, 'The pub. You gave me your blessing a long time ago.'\"\n\nShe laughed, Hutyra entered the bank, and the couple later left with a $44,320 loan. They also got a permit to build the structure.\n\nA month later, in August 2023, the Hutyras had a contractor on-site who broke ground and began building.\n\nHutyra had never taken on a project of this size, so hiring a contractor was crucial.\n\nHe first paid them $600 to draw actual building construction plans, inspired by the PowerPoint presentation Hutyra had put together.\n\nFrom there, the team helped run vital water and electricity lines, create the pub's concrete base, and craft its shell, framing, and roof. They also added foam insulation.\n\nContractors worked until November 2023, at which point the pub was turned over to Hutyra.\n\nHe got to work with the help of his son and father, who Hutyra described as a master carpenter and overall handyman, to complete the build.\n\nTogether, they installed ceilings, painted walls, stained wood, added shelving, built the pub's bar, and more.\n\n\"I had about three years to plan, so when the time came, I knew where I wanted everything to be,\" Hutyra said. \"I had it planned down to the light switches.\"\n\nWhen you enter the pub, you're greeted by a dark-wood bar with string-light decor and matching stools.\n\nThere are also tables and chairs throughout, televisions above the door, and framed photos around the room.\n\nA chalkboard tells you which drinks are available, and if you visit during the holidays, you'll see glowing Christmas trees.\n\nSimilar to the rest of the bar, the bathroom has dark-wood panelling, framed photo decor, and running water.\n\n\"All the shelving that goes around the top of the pub, I did myself, but the bar was probably the biggest challenge for me,\" Hutyra said. \"I had to make a lot of cuts at different angles, and make sure it was straight and level. It was a lot of work.\"\n\nHutyra has spent 24 years in the Navy and currently serves as a chief petty officer. Naturally, the inspiration behind his pub's name came from his years of service.\n\n\"The goat is kind of like the official mascot for the Navy,\" he said. \"In the earlier days of the service, goats were kept aboard ships to provide fresh meat and milk to the crew. Other livestock didn't fare as well.\"\n\nThe area where the goats were kept was named the Goat Locker, he said, and the phrase has stuck around for more than 200 years. Now, it's the name for the chief's working quarters.\n\nWith that in mind, he named his pub The Thirsty Goat.\n\n\"I've been in the reserves the last 19 years now, and I've traveled the world and seen a lot of different places and things,\" Hutyra said. \"But I've always returned to my hometown. After buying a house here, I've really started to feel that family connection.\"\n\nSo he wanted to feel it in his pub, too. Hutyra has a jar from 1903 that belonged to his great-grandmother, which now sits on his bar as a tip jar. The bar itself also has ties to his ancestors.\n\nAs Hutyra was building his pub, a nearby homestead barn — built and owned by his great-great-great-grandfather around 1880 — was being demolished, so he salvaged some materials.\n\n\"The wood was actually in a remarkable condition,\" Hutyra said. \"I took floorboards from the second-story hayloft, which were under the roof of the barn, so they were out of the rain and weather.\"\n\n\"My father and I brought the wood back to his woodworking shop just across town, a few miles from my childhood home, where he still lives today,\" he added.\n\nTogether, they turned that wood into the top of Hutyra's bar, which is now the focal point of his pub.\n\nHutyra said that he and his wife always dreamed of owning a big house where they could have parties and host friends and family.\n\nNow, their personal pub has become that dream spot.\n\n\"We find ourselves sitting out here in the middle of the week until midnight, or until 2 or 3 a.m. on the weekends with family and friends,\" he said. \"We've thoroughly enjoyed it since finishing back in August, but we're only just starting to see how much we're going to use it.\"",

    "description": "Apple Wallet taking up 4GB on your iPhone? Here’s why it happens, what causes the storage spike, and how you can fix it safely.",
    "fullText": "We use the Wallet app without thinking too much about it. It holds our cards, tickets, and passes, and it usually stays out of the way. You check Settings > General > iPhone Storage and see something that makes no sense: Wallet shows nearly 4GB in Documents and Data. You delete your passes, remove cards, even delete and reinstall the app, but the number stays the same.\n\nIf you feel stuck, you are not alone. People have reported Wallet storage that looks wildly out of proportion to what the app does.\n\nWallet does more than store a few cards. It also holds local files tied to passes and payment features. That storage can add up, especially if something goes wrong.\n\nIn short, you did the right first steps. If Wallet still shows 4GB after a reinstall, you need to force iOS to rebuild whatever Wallet keeps locally.\n\nWork through these in order. You will usually get results before the last step.\n\n1) Restart your iPhone\nA restart sounds basic, but it can flush stuck indexing and temporary caches. After you restart, re-check iPhone Storage to see if Wallet drops.\n\n2) Update iOS, then check storage again\nIf you run an older build, update first. Storage bugs often ride along in iOS releases and Apple fixes them quietly. After the update finishes, give your phone a few minutes on Wi-Fi and power, then check Wallet storage again.\n\n3) Remove Wallet content the “full” way\nEven if you already deleted passes, do a clean sweep:\n\nThen restart again and re-check storage.\n\n4) Sign out of iCloud and sign back in\nThis step often forces iOS apps that sync data to rebuild local databases.\n\nThen check Wallet storage again.\n\n5) Back up, then reset as the “break glass” fix\nIf Wallet still sits at multiple gigabytes, treat it like a system-level storage bug. You see similar behavior in other Apple apps when their Documents and Data gets stuck, and the most reliable fix becomes a full reset after backup.\n\nThis takes longer, but it gives iOS a clean slate. In many “storage won’t clear” cases, it is the only step that truly resets the hidden cache.\n\nA big Wallet number does not automatically mean someone hacked you. People who never use Wallet still see some Wallet storage, and Apple Support forum threads show that small amounts can appear even when you do nothing with the app.\n\nThe issue here is scale. Gigabytes usually mean a stuck cache, a database that never compacts, or a system bug that keeps re-growing the same files.",

NASA is targeting a date no earlier than January 17, with the exact day depending on the weather and on the possible need for additional time to address technical issues.Artemis 2 is the first crewed mission to the moon since the Apollo program’s final flight in 1972. The 10-day mission will have four astronauts on board who’ll be testing if Orion’s critical life support systems can sustain human passengers on future longer duration missions. They will first orbit the Earth twice before making their way 4,700 miles beyond the far side of the moon. If the SLS and Orion system is rolled out as planned, NASA intends to conduct a wet dress rehearsal at the end of January.

    "title": "We run our bakery out of shipping containers. It was an unexpectedly cost-effective solution to scaling our business.",
    "description": "Chrissy Traore and her husband Ben started a bakery in New York. When they needed more space, they turned to shipping containers as the solution.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chrissy Traore, 41, who opened See & Be Kitchen with her husband Ben Salif Traore in Cairo, New York, about 40 miles from Albany, New York. When their business expanded quickly, they began running parts of it out of shipping containers on their property. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBen and I met while I was a chef and he was a baker. We worked at the same restaurant — they had a bakery and a restaurant right next door, and I was their pizza chef and he was their head baker. I had to mix my pizza dough in his mixer and that's kind of how we met.\n\nBefore, I worked on Madison Avenue in marketing and brand strategy, and in 2008, the economy crashed and my job crashed too. When that happened, I moved into food. I took a job on an ice cream truck and just fell in love with food work.\n\nI was in the food industry in various ways in New York City from about 2008 until 2017.\n\nWhile working in the industry, I was unhappy with the way that they treated employees. I was in management at the time, so I could see the full round numbers.\n\nI thought, \"There has to be a better way, but it's not my job to change this business owner or this business.\"\n\nBen and I talked a lot about it, and we were going upstate frequently — I was working at a place upstate as their first chef.\n\nI said, \"We should really move upstate.\" It's more our speed. We like the outdoors. We like having space. The quality of life is better. We love farming and being close to what's happening on the ground, literally. In 2017 we said, let's get out of the city.\n\nWe didn't have a ton of money, and we had to be scrappy and thoughtful about how we deployed the resources that we had saved. We wanted a place where we could live and work, so we wanted property and land — that was important to us.\n\nWe found a property in Cairo, New York, and it had been a bar and a hotel, so it was already grandfathered in on DOH, and had some structures there. We have 11 acres, and the house was practically falling apart, so we could afford it. We paid $189,900, and that was it. We went all in.\n\nWe knew we wanted to open our own place and we were trying to discover what that was. We knew it would involve Ben's bread and my cooking.\n\nWe started renovating the property and doing farmers markets, and that's how we got to know the community that we were in.\n\nWe came in quietly, like, \"Let's see what's already here and get to know people before we just bash them over the head with what we do.\" Let's see what they want, because ultimately we're entering a community that's not necessarily ours yet.\n\nWe were moving from Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn, and part of the reason we moved out was we saw that happening. People were moving in and they would say, \"We need to fix this. This is broken.\" And I'm like, \"What is broken? This is a wonderful community. Please stop.\"\n\nSometime in 2018, we turned into See & Be. Then, from there, we really got some traction at farmers markets.\n\nWe were doing porch pickups — people could pick up their orders at a local massage therapist's house — so we had started operating, but we didn't have a physical space yet.\n\nWe were still building out the cafe in the very small already existing structure on our property. We had one oven, with one proofer, a little cooktop that I would do the sandwiches on, and a coffee station with this beautiful wooden bar that people could sit at. And we opened that in February of 2019. Ben baked everything; I ran the front of house.\n\nWe had a five-year plan and it went into overdrive. Soon, we needed more space, and I could not get a building up fast enough. With traditional buildings, we looked at it and we thought it was going to take a year and a half to two years. We couldn't do that. We needed space like tomorrow.\n\nI had worked for a company while in Brooklyn that was actually my first shipping container job. That was at the DeKalb Market, and it was all built out of shipping containers.\n\nI realized there was no way to get a building through the planning board and everything quickly enough — but I could get a shipping container.\n\nI looked at Ben and I said, \"The fastest way we can do this is to get a shipping container.\" And he said, \"Are you kidding?\" I said, \"No.\"\n\nWe really bootstrapped our business from day one. We had a $10,000 investment in building out the space over time. We costed it out, and we could afford it with what we had already made in the business.\n\nWe got our approval and I was so excited. I posted it on our Facebook page and we got over 4,000 interactions. We couldn't not open.\n\nOur first shipping container was a regular shipping container — a 40' by 20' high cube. We placed it on wooden rail ties, which was not great — those degraded over the years, especially with heavy usage.\n\nWe thought of ourselves as scrappy: \"Well, we did the cafe, we can do this ourselves. So why would I pay to have a spray foam? We'll do that ourselves.\" That was terrible idea.\n\nI think we bought every spray foam insulation canister in a 200-mile radius of here from Home Depot and Lowe's. We didn't know what we were doing. We were just trying to figure it out. The walls were uneven and it worked, but it wasn't a great solution.\n\nThen we pushed out of that shipping container and needed even more space. At that point, we needed more cold storage. I started doing more research into shipping containers and came across decommissioned reefers.\n\nThey're pre-insulated and have steel walls. And unlike a regular shipping container that has a wood floor, this has a steel flat floor. So it's already food-ready.\n\nWe bought the first container for $6,000 painted and delivered. And then we spent another couple thousand dollars in spray foam. God only knows how much the labor was, because we did it ourselves and that took forever.\n\nWe have running water and electric in the containers, but most of the mixing happens in our original building.\n\nThat following year, as our business grew and began to quickly scale, we kept outgrowing our space and needing more and more room. Once we saw how quickly we could get a shipping container in place — about a month — it was easy to go, \"OK, well, gee, trucks can double my space in a month.\"\n\nThe second container was much faster and easier to set up. I bought that directly through a broker at the port. We paid $8,500 for that one.\n\nWhen we installed the second container, we leveled the ground, put in concrete pillars, and the cranes came in and moved the original container and did that whole process. Then, with the third container, it was very easy to attach it because the ground was already graded and leveled.\n\nIt cost about $7,500 to $15,000 per container at the end of the day, because we had to get the crane to get them moved, and we had to get them welded together.\n\nIt's always funny when someone comes up to the building for the first time, and they're just like, \"What is this? Where is the bakery?\" And then they knock on a shipping container door.\n\nPeople are always shook to see that it's a real production. They think we're winging this or pretending because there's these shipping containers. But when you walk in, you forget you're in a shipping container.",

    "description": "\"In fact, at first I was skeptical about the signal as it was too strong to be real.\"",
    "fullText": "While peering into some of the oldest regions of the known universe — dating back to just 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang — an international team of astronomers made a puzzling discovery.\n\nAs detailed in a paper published the journal Nature, they discovered an extremely hot galaxy cluster that’s far hotter and older than current theories allow.\n\nIn other words, the discovered cluster is, under our current best understanding of cosmology, impossible — which could upend our current understanding of how the early universe evolved.\n\n“We didn’t expect to see such a hot cluster atmosphere so early in cosmic history,” said lead author and University of British Columbia PhD candidate Dazhi Zhou in a statement about the finding.\n\n“In fact, at first I was skeptical about the signal as it was too strong to be real,” he added. “But after months of verification, we’ve confirmed this gas is at least five times hotter than predicted, and even hotter and more energetic than what we find in many present-day clusters.”\n\nThe astronomers’ best theory is that the cluster somehow got a massive head start — previously unimaginable even to top thinkers — thanks to black holes lurking at its core.\n\n“This tells us that something in the early universe, likely three recently discovered supermassive black holes in the cluster, were already pumping huge amounts of energy into the surroundings and shaping the young cluster,” added coauthor and Dalhousie University professor Scott Chapman, “much earlier and more strongly than we thought.”\n\nConventional theories suggest that galaxy clusters gain energy as the gases inside are pulled together and squeezed due to intensifying gravitational forces. The latest research, however, suggests there’s more to how these clusters evolve — perhaps even a separate source beyond these gravitational forces.\n\nThe team found the strange readings when they analyzed observations by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Atacama desert in Chile that examined a “baby” galaxy cluster called SPT2349-56.\n\nThe cluster, which dates back to around 12 billion years, is huge: its core alone measures around half a million light-years across. That’s roughly the size of the halo that circles our own Milky Way galaxy, a vast region that contains globular clusters and older stars — yet it spawns stars more than 5,000 times faster.\n\nThe astronomers are hoping to figure out what allowed it to get so incredibly hot, a source of energy that defies our current models. The research suggests galaxy clusters evolve in a far more explosive manner than previously thought, aided by gravitational interactions between multiple supermassive black holes.\n\n“We want to figure out how the intense star formation, the active black holes and this overheated atmosphere interact, and what it tells us about how present galaxy clusters were built,” Zhou explained in the statement. “How can all of this be happening at once in such a young, compact system?”\n\n“Understanding galaxy clusters is the key to understanding the biggest galaxies in the universe,” Chapman said. “These massive galaxies mostly reside in clusters, and their evolution is heavily shaped by the very strong environment of the clusters as they form, including the intracluster medium.”\n\nMore on galaxy clusters: Scientists Intrigued by Bridge of Dark Matter Inside Huge Galaxy Cluster",

    "fullText": "Despite writing ubiquitous hits like \"You Belong With Me\" and \"Love Story\" earlier in her career (which peaked at No. 2 and No. 4, respectively), \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" was Swift's first-ever song to top the Hot 100.\n\nThe country-pop crossover smash was released as the lead single from Swift's fourth album, \"Red.\" It rose from No. 72 to No. 1 in its second week of tracking and remained atop the chart for two more weeks.\n\n\"Shake It Off\" was released as the lead single from Swift's fifth album, \"1989.\" It became her first No. 1 debut on the Hot 100.\n\n\"Blank Space,\" the second single from \"1989,\" debuted at No. 18 on the Hot 100.\n\nIt rose to No. 13 before soaring to No. 1 in its third week — dethroning \"Shake It Off\" and making Swift the first woman in history to replace herself in the chart's top spot.\n\n\"Blank Space\" went on to become one of Swift's biggest hits, reigning atop the chart for nearly two months.\n\nDespite mixed reactions from critics, Swift's lead single from \"Reputation\" rose to No. 1 after its first full week of tracking, breaking the weekly streaming record for a song by a woman.\n\nOnce again, Swift's music video broke the record for most views within 24 hours, racking up 43.2 million views in its first day.\n\nSwift announced the arrival of her eighth album, \"Folklore,\" just one day in advance. The second track, \"Cardigan,\" was released at the same time as the album and promoted with a whimsical music video.\n\n\"Folklore\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 while \"Cardigan\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, making Swift the first artist in history to open atop both charts in the same week.\n\nJust five months after \"Folklore,\" Swift repeated her pandemic-era strategy and surprise-released her ninth album, \"Evermore,\" alongside its lead single.\n\nAgain, \"Willow\" debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 while \"Evermore\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\n\"Red (Taylor's Version)\" was the second rerecorded album Swift released. It was accompanied by the long-awaited 10-minute version of \"All Too Well,\" a fan-favorite track from the original album.\n\n\"All Too Well (Taylor's Version)\" was promoted with a self-directed short film and plenty of theories about the song's most likely muse.\n\nIt debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, becoming the longest song in history to top the chart. The record was previously held by Don McLean's \"American Pie (Parts I & II)\" at 8 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\n\"Anti-Hero\" was released alongside Swift's 10th album, \"Midnights,\" and promoted as the lead single.\n\nIt dominated the Hot 100 for eight weeks, surpassing the high-water mark set by \"Blank Space.\"\n\nThe same week that \"Anti-Hero\" debuted at No. 1, Swift became the first and only artist in history to occupy the entire top 10 on the Hot 100. The hit single was flanked by \"Lavender Haze\" (No. 2), \"Maroon\" (No. 3), \"Snow on the Beach\" (No. 4), \"Midnight Rain\" (No. 5), \"Bejeweled\" (No. 6), \"Question...?\" (No. 7), \"You're On Your Own, Kid\" (No. 8), \"Karma\" (No. 9), and \"Vigilante Shit\" (No. 10).\n\n\"Cruel Summer\" was originally released as the second track on Swift's 2019 album \"Lover.\"\n\nAlthough it was identified early as a fan favorite, the song was never promoted as a single and debuted modestly at No. 29 on the Hot 100.\n\nFour years later, Swift transformed \"Cruel Summer\" into a showstopping spectacle on the Eras Tour. Streams of the song began to surge, and it reigned atop Billboard's Pop Airplay chart for two months. Swift's label sent the song to pop radio in June 2023.\n\nFinally, following the release of \"The Cruelest Summer\" EP — which includes a live version of the song and a remix by LP Giobbi — the song reached No. 1 on the Hot 100, marking Swift's milestone 10th chart-topper.\n\n\"Is It Over Now?\" was released as the final vault track on \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" a rerecording of her beloved fifth album.\n\nAlthough it wasn't initially slated as a single, its enthusiastic reception from fans pushed Swift's team to serve the song to pop radio.\n\n\"Is It Over Now?\" debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, dethroning \"Cruel Summer.\" Swift remains the only woman in history to replace herself in the top spot, a feat she's now achieved twice.\n\n\"Fortnight,\" a duet with Post Malone, was released alongside \"The Tortured Poets Department\" and promoted as the album's lead single.\n\nThe song debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 while \"Poets\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\nFor the second time in her career, Swift managed to occupy the entire top 10 of the Hot 100. In fact, the top 14 positions on the chart were occupied by \"Poets\" tracks, including \"Down Bad\" (No. 2) and \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart\" (No. 3), all the way through to \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" (No. 14).\n\n\"Fortnight\" returned to No. 1 on the Hot 100 for a second consecutive week.\n\n\"The Fate of Ophelia\" was released alongside Swift's 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" and promoted as the lead single.\n\nThe Shakespeare-inspired pop song debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, while \"Showgirl\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, breaking a record for the biggest sales week of all time.\n\nAll 12 tracks on the album debuted within the Hot 100's top 12 spots, making Swift the first and only artist to dominate the chart's top 10 on three separate occasions. \"The Fate of Ophelia\" was joined in the top five by \"Opalite\" (No. 2), \"Elizabeth Taylor\" (No. 3), \"Father Figure\" (No. 4), and \"Wood\" (No. 5).\n\n\"The Fate of Ophelia\" remained atop the Hot 100 for eight straight weeks after its release. After falling to lower positions during the holiday season, it returned to No. 1 for its ninth week, surpassing \"Anti-Hero\" as Swift's longest-leading hit to date.",

Knowing that a messy space can negatively impact your productivity and overall mental health, I reasoned that this would actually serve the purpose of making me a more efficient, peaceful person, so I took it seriously. One major issue was quickly apparent: My kitchen is tiny, which meant it was disorganized and more or less useless when it came to its primary function, which is to facilitate my cooking. It took some creativity (and money), but I figured out what to do—and now I'm learning to cook and bake better for one of this year's resolutions.\n\nMy kitchen is a little over three feet wide and five feet long. (I live in NYC, where this is the norm.) There is no counter space; all there is along one side is a sink and an oven. The first thing I had to do was manufacture counter space, which I did by adding cubed storage shelving. (I did this years ago, but only truly organized the cubes last year. We're getting to that.) It looks like this:\n\nThe main things I thought of, besides organizing the cubed storage, were how I could better utilize what space I did have, which is why anything and everything possible is now hanging vertically on under-cabinet wine glass racks, utensil holders, or a towel rack, plus hooks all over. What I'm most excited for is the impending delivery of this big peg board, which is going to allow me to hang more utensils and cookware on the wall.\n\nOther, smaller improvements became more obvious to me as I worked through organizing the big stuff. Once I cleared out and designated a suitable spot for my Nespresso, I figured out I needed a vertical, adhesive-backed holder for the pods, since there wasn't enough room in the cubes to hold them in their retail boxes. I finally bought a big ladder so I could actually use my cupboards. I then set about organizing the cupboards with acrylic risers, the same way I organized my perfume and makeup. For the area under the sink, I bought a pull-out shelf to give me easy access to cleaning materials. The boxes containing my various grains and oats were too unwieldy to keep in my cupboards, which led me to a rotating rice dispenser. It went on that way for a while, with me paying tribute to the Amazon gods every few days, but it was all because I had a bigger plan.\n\nYou may not want a giant peg board or need to hang all your spatulas upside-down. Maybe you have lots of drawers. That's cool. You still need a plan for organizing whatever you've got and a plan for figuring out what you, specifically, need.\n\nThroughout the organizing process, I kept a key principle in mind. It's called the Organizational Triangle and it's a set of three rules: Everything needs a place, similar items must be stored together, and for every new thing that comes in, one should go out. I ignored the last rule, for the most part, because what I was bringing in was meant to store what was already there better, but those first two were crucial. Prior to using the OT, not everything had a place. Some bowls and mugs lived in the sink. Not everything was stored together, either, which made it a pain to attempt to cook. By grouping similar items and designating each of them a spot, I could assess the volume of each category, get rid of what I didn't need, and better organize everything. By organizing smaller batches of things that would fit into one cube or on one hanging rack, I ended up organizing the whole thing, big-picture-style.\n\nOther cleaning and organizing techniques, like SIMPLE and Core 4, were also instrumental. Both of these advise that you need containers for your things. Again, this helps you assess actual volume and make sharper decluttering choices, but it also keeps everything neat. I got a little abstract in my interpretation, considering my hanging organizers \"containers,\" but also used boxes and the aforementioned grain dispenser to meet those requirements.",
