    "description": "IonQ says its Seed Innovations acquisition will help optimize quantum performance at scale. SiliconSnark translates what that actually means.",
    "fullText": "IonQ woke up on January 28, 2026 and chose acquisition. Again.\n\nThis time, the “world’s leading quantum platform company” (a phrase that reads like it was assembled by a committee of synonyms) announced a definitive agreement to acquire Seed Innovations, a Colorado-based AI-software and technology R&D firm.\n\nIf you’re new here, IonQ’s whole vibe right now is “full-stack quantum platform,” which is a bit like saying you’re building a “full-stack unicorn”—majestic, aspirational, and technically not illegal to claim on a website. The pitch: Seed’s machine learning, cloud architecture, and software expertise will join IonQ’s Quantum Infrastructure team to “optimize performance” and “scale enterprise-ready solutions” across IonQ’s platforms.\n\nTranslation: IonQ is buying grown-ups who can make the quantum toys behave in the real world.\n\nSeed Innovations, founded in 2013, describes itself as a Women Owned Small Business specializing in full lifecycle software development, cloud migration, and R&D. Their staff includes software architects, SREs, and “Doctorates in machine learning,” which is an extremely polite way of saying: “We are the people you bring in when your system is haunted and your timeline is already a crime scene.”\n\nIonQ says Seed has done work for the “Department of War (DoW),” the Intelligence Community, and commercial customers. Now, I’m not here to nitpick acronyms, but “Department of War” is either (a) an aggressively metal rebrand, (b) a typo that slipped past fifteen approvals, or (c) the most honest naming convention in federal procurement history. Either way: points for transparency.\n\nThe deal is expected to close January 30, 2026—two days after the announcement—because nothing says “smooth integration” like speedrunning M&A like it’s a weekend hackathon.\n\nBecause quantum computing doesn’t fail in exciting sci-fi ways. It fails in normal ways. It fails like:\n\nIonQ’s press release basically admits that the next bottleneck isn’t only physics—it’s operating the physics like a product. They specifically call out building “enterprise grade, AI-driven software layers” for “managing and scaling complex quantum workloads.”\n\nThat’s not glamorous. That’s not a photogenic qubit. That’s Jira tickets. That’s reliability. That’s “we need dashboards.” That’s the point in the quantum journey where someone says, “Cool demo. Can I get an API?”\n\nAnd honestly? This is the most believable part of the whole thing.\n\nIonQ lists three focus areas for Seed after the acquisition. Let’s lovingly decode them.\n\nIonQ says Seed will use ML to analyze system data, predict behaviors, and drive continuous improvement.\n\nIn practice, this likely means: take a mountain of hardware/control/operations data and build models that help tune, diagnose, and forecast performance. The good version is “faster iteration, better uptime, fewer mysterious bad days.” The cynical version is “we added AI to the slide deck so procurement stops asking hard questions.”\n\nStill, ML for ops is real—especially when your machine is so sensitive that the universe itself feels like an adversarial test set.\n\nThey’re talking DevOps and automated scaling architecture.\n\nThis is the part where quantum becomes a service business: provisioning, orchestration, CI/CD, reliability, security controls, audit trails, customer-facing SLAs… all the boring enterprise stuff that customers absolutely demand, right up until they write you a check.\n\nYes, it’s hilarious to imagine “DevOps for qubits,” but it’s also how every advanced technology becomes a product: you wrap it in systems that make it usable by normal humans with normal deadlines.\n\nSeed brings cloud migration and microservices experience to make IonQ available “across all major cloud providers.”\n\nThis is less “seamless” and more “someone is about to spend a year building secure, reliable interfaces so enterprises can pretend quantum is just another SKU.” But to be fair, IonQ already distributes services via major clouds, and expanding that footprint is how you meet customers where they live: inside procurement portals and account teams.\n\nThis acquisition is also part of IonQ’s broader “we are building everything” campaign: quantum compute, networking, sensing, security—the whole stack.\n\nAnd it’s happening alongside a frankly sporty list of acquisitions IonQ has been stacking like trading cards: Oxford Ionics, Vector Atomic, Lightsynq, Capella Space, Qubitekk, a majority stake in ID Quantique, and Skyloom, among others.\n\nTwo days earlier—January 26, 2026—IonQ also announced a deal to acquire SkyWater Technology in a roughly $1.8B cash-and-stock transaction, framing it as vertical integration and a trusted U.S. semiconductor supply chain.\n\nSo in the span of a week, IonQ’s storyline reads like:\n\nAs strategies go, it’s coherent: if you want to be the platform, you need control over the weird, expensive, failure-prone parts—manufacturing, networking, sensing, security—and the glue that makes it all usable: software infrastructure.\n\nHere’s the SiliconSnark truth: enterprise software is where ambitious technologies go to either (a) become inevitable or (b) die slowly in a backlog.\n\nIonQ is betting on (a). Seed Innovations is the kind of team that doesn’t just build demos; they build systems that survive contact with reality, compliance, and the person who forwards your email to “IT Security” with no context.\n\nAlso, IonQ has been public about pushing performance milestones—like its claim of 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity and related technical disclosures in late 2025.\nWhether you’re bullish, skeptical, or spiritually allergic to quantum timelines, you can at least see the company trying to connect the physics story to the “we can operate this at scale” story.\n\nAnd that’s what Seed represents here: not more qubits, but more operability. Less “behold the future,” more “here is the monitoring and automated scaling architecture so the future doesn’t page you on Christmas.”\n\nA quantum company acquiring a software and cloud R&D specialist is the corporate equivalent of finally buying the boring kitchen appliances after years of collecting artisanal knives. Not exciting. Not sexy. Extremely necessary.\n\nIf IonQ really wants to sell “enterprise-grade” quantum—especially across multiple cloud providers—then integrating a team that lives and breathes ML, architecture, DevOps, and migration is… almost suspiciously sensible.\n\nSo yes: make your jokes about “AI-driven software layers” (I did). But if you’re looking for a signal that IonQ is trying to turn quantum from science project into product, this is it.\n\nNow please, for the love of all that is holy and scalable, tell me the “Department of War” thing was intentional.",

    "description": "Record-breaking experiment shows that a cluster of thousands of atoms can act like a wave as well as a particle.",
    "fullText": "Schrödinger’s cat just got a little bit fatter. Physicists have created the largest ever ‘superposition’ — a quantum state in which an object exists in a haze of possible locations at once.\n\nA team based at the University of Vienna put individual clusters of around 7,000 atoms of sodium metal some 8 nanometres wide into a superposition of different locations, each spaced 133 nanometres apart. Rather than shoot through the experimental set up like a billiard ball, each chunky cluster behaved like a wave, spreading out into a superposition of spatially distinct paths and then interfering to form a pattern researchers could detect.\n\n“It’s a fantastic result,” says Sandra Eibenberger-Arias, a physicist at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin.\n\nQuantum theory doesn’t put a limit on how big a superposition can be, but everyday objects clearly do not behave in a quantum way, she explains. This experiment — which puts an object as massive as a protein or small virus particle into a superposition — is helping to answer the “big, almost philosophical question of ‘is there a transition between the quantum and classical?’,” she says. The authors “show that, at least for clusters of this size, quantum mechanics is still valid”.\n\nThe experiment, described in Nature on 21 January1, is of practical importance, too, says Giulia Rubino, a quantum physicist at the University of Bristol, UK. Quantum computers will ultimately need to maintain perhaps millions of objects in a large quantum state to perform useful calculations. If nature were to make systems collapse past a certain point, and that scale was smaller than what is needed to make a quantum computer, “then that’s problematic”, she says.\n\nPhysicists have long debated how the classical, everyday world emerges from an underlying quantum one. Quantum theory “never states it stops working above a certain mass or size”, says Sebastian Pedalino, a physicist at the University of Vienna and a co-author of the study.\n\nIn 1935, the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger showed the absurdity of common interpretations of quantum mechanics with his famous cat-based thought experiment. The cat is put into a box with vial of poison, which will be released if a radioactive atom decays. If the box remains isolated from its environment, the atom exists in a superposition of both decayed and not-decayed, and until observed, the cat is an undefined state of both dead and alive.\n\nIn the real world, objects eventually become too complex or interact too much to maintain a superposition, an idea known as decoherence. But there are also extensions to quantum mechanics, known as collapse theories, that suggest that beyond a certain point, a system will inevitably reduce to a classical state, even in isolation. These theories were picked by 4% of researchers as their favourite interpretation of quantum mechanics in a 2025 Nature survey. “The only way to answer this question is by scaling up” quantum experiments, says Rubino.\n\nTo do this, Pedalino and his team generated a beam of clusters at 77 degrees kelvin (−196 ºC) in an ultra-high vacuum. The researchers put the beam through an interferometer consisting of three gratings constructed with laser beams. The first channelled the clusters through narrow gaps, from which they spread out and travelled in sync as waves; they then passed through a second set of slits that made the waves interfere in a distinctive pattern, which could be detected using the final grating.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00177-9\n\nRead the related News & Views: Quantum effect observed for biggest objects yet\n\nPedalino, S. et al.

    "fullText": "PC; Inkle\nThe UK game developer’s latest is a database mystery constructed from an archive of fictional books. Their combined contents threaten to crack the code of reality\n\nBletchley Park: famed home of the Enigma machine, Colossus computer, and, according to the premise of TR-49, an altogether stranger piece of tech. Two engineers created a machine that feeds on the most esoteric books: treatises on quantum computing, meditations on dark matter, pulp sci-fi novels and more. In the mid-2010s, when the game is set, Britain finds itself again engulfed by war, this time with itself. The arcane tool may hold the key to victory.\n\nYou play as budding codebreaker Abbi, a straight-talking northerner who is sifting through the machine now moved to a crypt beneath Manchester Cathedral. She has no idea how it works and neither do you. So you start tinkering. You input a four-digit code – two letters followed by two numbers. What do these correspond to? The initials of people and the year of a particular book’s publication. Input a code correctly and you are whisked away to the corresponding page, as if using a particularly speedy microfiche reader. These pages – say, by famed fictional physicist, Joshua Silverton – are filled with clues and, should you get lucky, further codes and even the titles of particular works. Your primary goal is to match codes with the corresponding book title in a bid to find the most crucial text of all, Endpeace, the key to understanding the erudite ghosts of this machine.\n\nHidden within this rhizomatic network of information is a mystery so intriguing and elegant that it can unfold naturally from any individual player’s investigations – no matter which titles or authors you see first, or where your particular curiosities lead you thereafter. Connections can cascade, tumbling like a waterfall, before swerving in unexpected directions, defying the traditionally linear logic of mystery fiction. TR-49 gives you an in-game notepad to keep track of everything; I recommend also keeping an actual pen and paper beside you.\n\nYou might imagine TR-49 as a comment on the rise of AI large language models (LLMs) which “scrape” data as this game’s machine feeds on writing. Actually, its concerns are broader and more ambitious, recalling the heady recent books of Chilean author Benjamín Labatut (When We Cease to Understand the World and The Maniac). Like Labatut, TR-49 brims with awe, scepticism and horror at the reality-shredding possibilities of scientific and technological advances made in the 20th century, all while pushing these concepts into a playful, fantastical space.\n\nLess compelling are conversations that play out between Abbi and her companions on the other end of a radio transmission. Where the mystery told through the machine itself is lavishly detailed, what happens outside it feels too thin: Abbi’s reasons for being there; the nature of the conflict raging above, which is sketched in frustratingly vague terms.\n\nStill, the interactive heart of TR-49 resides in trawling this codebreaking device for secrets. And in this regard, the game is an unqualified success; TR-49’s database mystery rivals Sam Barlow’s games Her Story and Immortality, though it is of an unashamedly literary nature compared to those more filmic works.\n\nCloser to TR-49’s beginning, you may feel crushed by this mass of inscrutable writings. Quickly, you will swim elegantly amid it, conversant in its many, many peculiarities. Across a handful of evenings, I relished disappearing into this archive, cavorting from log to log, title to title, following threads and losing track of time. Each scrap of paper, water-damaged periodical and rare first edition threatened to solve this mystery, yet none could in isolation. Just as the fictional maker of the archive fell under the spell of these records and materials, I too was seduced.",

    "fullText": "I'm reporting from Davos, Switzerland, where thousands of business leaders and politicians have arrived at the World Economic Forum to shake hands, talk shop, and maybe even eke out a few ski runs.\n\nSome executives I've spoken to this week had some big concerns about AI, but none of them had anything to do with a potential bubble.\n\nRaj Sharma, EY's global managing partner of growth and innovation, said there's not enough talk about AI security — specifically, the management of AI agents and their lifecycle.\n\n\"It has access to your data. It has no name, so there is no identity or anything associated with that,\" Sharma said.\n\nCompare that to humans, where every computer system and piece of data they touch is often tracked.\n\n\"We have to build industrial-level security for AI agents in that particular area. To me, that's still a gap that somebody needs to work on,\" Sharma said. \"Everybody's talking a good game. But if you look under the covers, it's still not mature.\"\n\n\"That keeps me up at night,\" Sharma added.\n\nHe's not alone. Tim Walsh, the CEO of KPMG US, told me the biggest issue he talks to CEOs about regularly is cyber risk, specifically related to AI.\n\nAI agents are the latest twist in executives' ongoing concerns over cybersecurity, and it's proving to be an incredibly challenging problem. Somewhat ironically, the only way to fight the threat is with … more AI.\n\nIn some cases, the risk has gotten so big that it's shifting timelines on companies' AI plans.\n\n\"It's not that they're not moving forward, but they are taking a moment to make sure that their environment is secure, and perhaps even leaving data on-prem a little bit longer so they're confident that got their data security in place,\" Walsh told me.\n\nWalsh said another \"real concern\" is the threat of quantum computing from a security perspective.\n\nWhile he acknowledged we're still a few years out from the tech being fully developed, its power is incredible.\n\n\"Quantum breaks everything,\" Walsh said. \"I mean, all encryption.\"\n\nThat's led companies to look at their systems and reencrypting things, no easy task.\n\n\"We're spending quite a bit of time as well, helping companies think through: What does that look like? How do you structure it? How long will it take?\" Walsh said.",

    "description": "Bitcoin likely already reached its post-halving peak at $126,000 last year, Jefferies' global head of equity strategy wrote in a note.",
    "fullText": "A longtime crypto bull is ditching bitcoin for gold.\n\nChristopher Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, said he just cut bitcoin out of his firm's long-term model portfolio, where the token has accounted for around 5%-10% of the portfolio's allocation for the last five years.\n\nThat's because the price of the crypto has likely peaked, but also because there's an existential threat he sees jeopardizing the bitcoin ecosystem: quantum computing.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Wood pointed specifically to CRQCs, or cryptographically relevant quantum computers — supercomputers that could potentially \"steal\" bitcoin from circulation, he said.\n\nBitcoin transactions are secured with cryptography, a coding system where transactions are encrypted with public keys, and access to the bitcoin itself is controlled by a private key. It would take supercomputers today \"trillions of years\" to derive a private key from a public one, given how complex the computations are, Wood said. But CRQCs could potentially reduce that time to something like several hours to several days, he speculated.\n\nCRQCs don't yet exist, but chatter about the potential risks is already spreading across the bitcoin community, Wood said, pointing to a report from ChainCode Labs that estimated as much as 10 million tokens, or 50% of all bitcoin in circulation, could be accessed by a CRQC.\n\nSome in the crypto community are arguing that the risk from CRQCs means \"vulnerable coins\" in the bitcoin ecosystem should be burned, Wood bited.\n\n\"While GREED & fear does not believe that the quantum issue is about to hit the Bitcoin price dramatically in the near term, the store of value concept is clearly on less solid foundation from the standpoint of a long-term pension portfolio,\" Wood said of his recent portfolio change. He added that he believed bitcoin reached its peak in the post-halving cycle at $126,000 last year.\n\nWood's team has replaced the allocation to bitcoin in the model portfolio with a 10% allocation to gold and gold mining stocks. The portfolio now has a total 45% allocation to physical gold, a 25% allocation to gold mining stocks, and a 30% allocation to Asian equities, excluding Japan.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the existential issue raised by quantum as regards Bitcoin can only be long-term positive for gold since it remains the historically stress tested store of value. Meanwhile, gold is also the best hedge, if not the only one, on the ever-rising geopolitical risks,\" Wood said.\n\nIt's been a rough few months for bitcoin, with the crypto tumbling into a bear market in late 2025 amid a broader risk-off move that was exacerbated by weak liquidity and concerns about the yen-carry trade.\n\nMeanwhile, the case for owning gold has only grown stronger since its stunning rally in 2025. The metal saw its best performance since 1979 and continues to hover near a record high as investors seek protection from geopolitical conflict and inflationary pressures.",

    "description": "Albert Einstein was right about a shocking among of things, but not necessarily everything.",

The decade—prefaced by the stunning confirmation of Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, thanks to the solar eclipse in May of 1919—saw the confirmation of the existence of other galaxies, the discovery of penicillin, and the birth of modern quantum mechanics. A complete banger of a decade, scientifically speaking.\n\nHowever, this plethora of science knowledge came with some understandable disagreements. For example, it was becoming increasingly clear that Einstein’s elegant theories that appeared to govern the universe on a macro scale didn’t perfectly square with the quantum weirdness being discovered at the subatomic scale. One of the most famous debates of the decade involved arguably two of the greatest physicists of the century: Einstein himself and Neils Bohr, the world-famous Danish theoretical physicist who is a foundational figure in quantum mechanics. The matter in question was the idea of “complementarity,” which stated (in simple terms) that a photon’s particle and wave nature can’t be measured at the same time.\n\nEinstein believed that, by using a complicated double-slit experiment involving a spring that recoils when a photon enters, one could learn about that photon’s particle nature based on which slit it entered and its wave nature based on the interference pattern. Bohr disagreed, stating that the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle essentially made this detection impossible.\n\nNow, in two back-to-back experiments—both published in the journal Physical Review Letters—scientists at MIT and the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) have seemingly settled the matter in favor of Bohr. Earlier this year, Wolfgang Ketterle (along with colleagues at MIT) created what the study authors call an “idealized version of the double slit experiment,” in which they used individual atoms as slits and weak beams of light so that those atoms scattered only one photon. Ketterle and his team essentially discovered an inverse relationship between the photon’s two states: the more information that was obtained about the photon’s path (i.e. particle nature), the lower the visibility of the interference pattern (i.e. wave nature).\n\nThe USTC experiment, which probes the same debate through different means, used a rubidium atom held in place by optical tweezers. The team then used lasers and electromagnetic forces to control the atom’s quantum properties and scattered light in two directions. They also found that Bohr’s assertion held out.\n\n“Seeing quantum mechanics ‘in action’ at this fundamental level is simply breathtaking,” Chao-Yang Lu told New Scientist. “Bohr’s counterargument was brilliant. But the thought experiment remained theoretical for almost a century.”\n\nLu and his team hopes to use their experimental set-up to explore more, lesser-known aspects of the quantum realm, including the nature of the relationship between decoherence and entanglement.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "Quantum computing has long promised transformative advances in data analysis, yet practical quantum machine learning has remained elusive due to fundamental obstacles such as a steep quantum cost for the loading of classical data and poor trainability of many quantum machine learning algorithms designed for near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we show that one can overcome these obstacles by using a linear Hamiltonian-based machine learning method which provides a compact quantum representation of classical data via ground state problems for k-local Hamiltonians. We use the recent sample-based Krylov quantum diagonalization method to compute low-energy states of the data Hamiltonians, whose parameters are trained to express classical datasets through local gradients. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the methods by performing experiments on benchmark datasets using up to 50 qubits of an IBM Heron quantum processor.",

It's similar to investing in early-stage biotechs, where there are some promising results, but nothing indicative of true future success. Couple that with how many companies are competing for quantum computing dominance, and it turns into a very difficult area to invest in.\n\nFurthermore, this industry has a lot of hype around it, and some of the pure-play stocks, like IonQ and Rigetti Computing, are seeing their stocks rapidly rise and fall in line with the risk tolerance of the market.\n\nMany investors may want to shy away from this industry because of the volatility and lack of a clear leader, which is fine. However, I think there's a smarter way to invest in the quantum computing realm without needing to expose yourself to high-risk investment that has a huge chance of paying off.\n\nHow? Through an investment in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nAlphabet is a large conglomerate of companies, but it's mainly centered around the Google ecosystem. While Google Search and the ad revenue it generates are the core of Alphabet's business, it's more diversified than that segment.\n\nAlphabet also owns a cloud computing business, Google Cloud. Google Cloud uses computing units from other providers, such as Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), to rent out computing capacity to customers for a wide variety of tasks. However, it has to purchase those GPUs from Nvidia, which is expensive.\n\nGoogle also developed the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) in-house in collaboration with Broadcom, which is a step closer to fully building its own computing hardware. However, Alphabet has chosen to develop its quantum computing hardware entirely on its own, which could pay off big-time for its cloud computing business if it succeeds.\n\nIf Alphabet can win the race to build the first commercially viable quantum computer, then clients will flock to Google Cloud to utilize this cutting-edge technology. This would have other trickle-down effects, such as more clients using its generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, Gemini. Quantum computing technology is expected to greatly reduce the cost of running artificial intelligence training and inference, which would make Gemini the go-to model if Alphabet can develop a quantum computing advantage.",

    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThe Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) paradox describes how quantum theory cannot be described by local realistic descriptions.\n\nA study takes this GHZ paradox to new heights to see just how non-classical the quantum world can get.\n\nIn the process, their experiment included photons in 37 dimensions, taking science even further down this strange quantum rabbit hole with the hopes of finding applications in these high-dimensional systems.\n\nClassical and quantum mechanics don’t really get along as the science of the subatomic can get, well, weird. Take, for instance, quantum entanglement, which says that the state of one particle can be determined by examining the state of its entangled pair regardless of distance. This strange fact flies in the face of classical physics, and even led Albert Einstein to famously describe this quantum quirk as “spooky action at a distance.”\n\nThis is what is known as “quantum nonlocality,” where objects are influenced across distances (seeming beyond the speed of light) whereas classical physics follows local theory, the idea that objects are influenced by their immediate surroundings. This is a pretty sharp divide as explained by the famous no-go theorem known as the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) paradox, which essentially details how quantum theory cannot be described by local realistic description.\n\nNamed for the physicists who described the paradox in 1989, GHZ-type paradoxes show that when particles can only be influenced by proximity they produce mathematical impossibilities. As New Scientist reports, the paradox can even be expressed through a calculation where 1 equals -1. This paradox is useful in showing how quantum properties can not be described using classical means, but a new paper published in the journal Science Advances, decided to see just how strange these paradoxes could get.\n\nEssentially, an international team of scientists wanted to see how un-classical particles of light could get—and the results were maybe stranger than the authors originally anticipated. This extremely technical experiment produced photons, or particles of light, that existed in 37 dimensions. Just as you and I exist in three dimension—plus an additional temporal dimension—these photons required 37 similar reference points.\n\n“This experiment shows that quantum physics is more nonclassical than many of us thought,” Technical University of Denmark’s Zhenghao Liu, a co-author of the study, told New Scientist. “It could be [that] 100 years after its discovery, we are still only seeing the tip of the iceberg.”\n\nPulling this off is not an easy thing to do as Liu and his team needed to feed a version of the GHZ paradox into coherent light—even in color and wavelength—so that they could easily manipulate the photons. This essentially resulted in the most “nonclassical effects in the quantum world” that’s ever been created, Liu told New Scientist.\n\n“We believe that this work has opened several avenues for future research,” the authors write. “We hope our findings can be used to build even stronger quantum advantages in high-dimensional systems.”\n\nIn other words, if we’ve only discovered the tip of the iceberg, just imagine what quantum breakthroughs are lurking just below the surface.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nUsually, when something gets warmed up, heat tends to spread outward before eventually dissipating. But things are a little different in the world of superfluid quantum gas.\n\nFor the first time, MIT scientists have successfully imaged how heat actually travels in a wave, known as a “second sound,” through this exotic fluid.\n\nUnderstanding this dynamic could help answer questions about high-temperature superconductors and neutron stars.\n\nIn the world of average, everyday materials, heat tends to spread out from a localized source. Drop a burning coal into a pot of water, and that liquid will slowly rise in temperature before its heat eventually dissipates. But the world is full of rare, exotic materials that don’t exactly play by these thermal rules.\n\nInstead of spreading out as one would expect, these superfluid quantum gasses “slosh” heat side to side—it essentially propagates as a wave. Scientists call this behavior a material’s “second sound” (the first being ordinary sound via a density wave). Although this phenomenon has been observed before, it’s never been imaged. But recently, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) were finally able to capture this movement of pure heat by developing a new method of thermography (a.k.a. heat-mapping).\n\nThe results of this study were published in the journal Science, and in an university press release highlighting the achievement, MIT assistant professor and co-author Richard Fletcher continued the boiling pot analogy to describe the inherent strangeness of “second sound” in these exotic superfluids.\n\n“It’s as if you had a tank of water and made one half nearly boiling,” Fletcher said. “If you then watched, the water itself might look totally calm, but suddenly the other side is hot, and then the other side is hot, and the heat goes back and forth, while the water looks totally still.”\n\nThese superfluids are created when a cloud of atoms is subjected to ultra-cold temperatures approaching absolute zero (−459.67 °F). In this rare state, atoms behave differently, as they create an essentially friction-free fluid. It’s in this frictionless state that heat has been theorized to propagate like a wave.\n\n“Second sound is the hallmark of superfluidity, but in ultracold gases so far you could only see it in this faint reflection of the density ripples that go along with it,” lead author Martin Zwierlein said in a press statement. “The character of the heat wave could not be proven before.”\n\nTo finally capture this second sound in action, Zweierlein and his team had to think outside the usual thermal box, as there’s a big problem trying to track heat of an ultracold object—it doesn’t emit the usual infrared radiation. So, MIT scientists designed a way to leverage radio frequencies to track certain subatomic particles known as “lithium-6 fermions,” which can be captured via different frequencies in relation to their temperature (i.e. warmer temperatures mean higher frequencies, and vice versa). This novel technique allowed the researchers to essentially zero in on the “hotter” frequencies (which were still very much cold) and track the resulting second wave over time.\n\nThis might feel like a big “so what?” After all, when’s the last time you had a close encounter with a superfluid quantum gas? But ask a materials scientist or astronomer, and you’ll get an entirely different answer.\n\nWhile exotic superfluids may not fill up our lives (yet), understanding the properties of second wave movement could help questions regarding high-temperature superconductors (again, still at very low temperatures) or the messy physics that lie at the heart of neutron stars.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "A long-standing physics mystery has been solved with the discovery of emergent photon-like behavior inside a strange quantum material. The finding confirms a true 3D quantum spin liquid and unlocks a new way to study deeply entangled matter.",
    "fullText": "A global research team led by Rice University physicist Pengcheng Dai has verified the presence of emergent photons and fractionalized spin excitations in an unusual quantum spin liquid. Reported in Nature Physics, the work points to the crystal cerium zirconium oxide (Ce2Zr2O7) as a clean three-dimensional example of this exotic state of matter.\n\nQuantum spin liquids have fascinated physicists for years because they could eventually support transformative technologies, including quantum computing and dissipationless energy transmission. Unlike ordinary magnets that settle into an orderly pattern, these materials avoid conventional magnetic order. Instead, their magnetic moments remain strongly quantum-entangled and in constant collective motion at temperatures close to absolute zero, producing behavior that resembles emergent quantum electrodynamics.\n\n\"We've answered a major open question by directly detecting these excitations,\" said Dai, the Sam and Helen Worden Professor of Physics and Astronomy. \"This confirms that Ce2Zr2O7 behaves as a true quantum spin ice, a special class of quantum spin liquids in three dimensions.\"\n\nCleaner Measurements With Polarized Neutron Scattering\n\nTo pin down these elusive signatures, the researchers relied on advanced polarized neutron scattering. This approach helped them isolate the magnetic scattering they cared about while filtering out other signals, even as the system approached the zero temperature limit.\n\nTheir measurements also revealed emergent photon signals near zero energy -- a defining trait that separates quantum spin ice from more familiar phases found in conventional magnets. Additional evidence came from specific heat measurements, which supported the idea that these predicted emergent photons follow a dispersion resembling the way sound moves through a solid.\n\nEarlier attempts to confirm this kind of behavior were often undermined by technical noise and incomplete data. The Rice-led team addressed those challenges through improved sample preparation and high-precision instruments, supported by an international effort involving major laboratories across Europe and North America.\n\nFirst-of-Its-Kind Observation With Big Implications\n\nIn this three-dimensional candidate material, the researchers observed both emergent photons and spinons -- key hallmarks of quantum spin ice. The result resolves a long-running debate in condensed matter physics and gives scientists a strong platform for studying next-generation quantum phenomena and potential technology pathways.\n\nBin Gao, a research scientist in Rice's Department of Physics and Astronomy and the study's first author, said the findings back up decades of theoretical expectations.\n\n\"This surprising result encourages scientists to look deeper into such unique materials, potentially changing how we understand magnets and the behavior of materials in the extreme quantum regime,\" Gao said.\n\nCo-authors of this study include Félix Desrochers and Yong Baek Kim of the University of Toronto; Rice alumnus David Tam of the Paul Scherrer Institut; Silke Paschen, Diana Kirschbaum and Duy Ha Nguyen of Vienna University of Technology; Paul Steffens and Arno Hiess of the Institut Laue-Langevin; Yixi Su of Jülich Centre of Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum; and Sang-Wook Cheong of Rutgers University.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Robert A.
