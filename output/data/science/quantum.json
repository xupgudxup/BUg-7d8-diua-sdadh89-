    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nIn 1927, Albert Einstein and Neils Bohr debated the nature of what’s known as complementarity—the idea that a photon’s dual wave-like and particle natures can’t be measured at the same time.\n\nNow, two unrelated-but-similar experiments confirm that, in a double-slit experiment, detection of a photon’s path (its particle nature) would wash out its interference pattern (its wave nature), proving Bohr right.\n\nUsing these experimental set-ups could help scientists probe other questions of the quantum realm, including the nitty-gritty details of the interaction between decoherence and entanglement.\n\nThe 1920s were an incredible time for science. The decade—prefaced by the stunning confirmation of Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, thanks to the solar eclipse in May of 1919—saw the confirmation of the existence of other galaxies, the discovery of penicillin, and the birth of modern quantum mechanics. A complete banger of a decade, scientifically speaking.\n\nHowever, this plethora of science knowledge came with some understandable disagreements. For example, it was becoming increasingly clear that Einstein’s elegant theories that appeared to govern the universe on a macro scale didn’t perfectly square with the quantum weirdness being discovered at the subatomic scale. One of the most famous debates of the decade involved arguably two of the greatest physicists of the century: Einstein himself and Neils Bohr, the world-famous Danish theoretical physicist who is a foundational figure in quantum mechanics. The matter in question was the idea of “complementarity,” which stated (in simple terms) that a photon’s particle and wave nature can’t be measured at the same time.\n\nEinstein believed that, by using a complicated double-slit experiment involving a spring that recoils when a photon enters, one could learn about that photon’s particle nature based on which slit it entered and its wave nature based on the interference pattern. Bohr disagreed, stating that the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle essentially made this detection impossible.\n\nNow, in two back-to-back experiments—both published in the journal Physical Review Letters—scientists at MIT and the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) have seemingly settled the matter in favor of Bohr. Earlier this year, Wolfgang Ketterle (along with colleagues at MIT) created what the study authors call an “idealized version of the double slit experiment,” in which they used individual atoms as slits and weak beams of light so that those atoms scattered only one photon. Ketterle and his team essentially discovered an inverse relationship between the photon’s two states: the more information that was obtained about the photon’s path (i.e. particle nature), the lower the visibility of the interference pattern (i.e. wave nature).\n\nThe USTC experiment, which probes the same debate through different means, used a rubidium atom held in place by optical tweezers. The team then used lasers and electromagnetic forces to control the atom’s quantum properties and scattered light in two directions. They also found that Bohr’s assertion held out.\n\n“Seeing quantum mechanics ‘in action’ at this fundamental level is simply breathtaking,” Chao-Yang Lu told New Scientist. “Bohr’s counterargument was brilliant. But the thought experiment remained theoretical for almost a century.”\n\nLu and his team hopes to use their experimental set-up to explore more, lesser-known aspects of the quantum realm, including the nature of the relationship between decoherence and entanglement.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

In this work, we show that one can overcome these obstacles by using a linear Hamiltonian-based machine learning method which provides a compact quantum representation of classical data via ground state problems for k-local Hamiltonians. We use the recent sample-based Krylov quantum diagonalization method to compute low-energy states of the data Hamiltonians, whose parameters are trained to express classical datasets through local gradients. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the methods by performing experiments on benchmark datasets using up to 50 qubits of an IBM Heron quantum processor.",

    "fullText": "Alphabet has a lot to gain by developing its quantum technology in-house.\n\nThe tech giant is already seeing real-world applications for its technology.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nQuantum computing is a difficult area to invest in. It's similar to investing in early-stage biotechs, where there are some promising results, but nothing indicative of true future success. Couple that with how many companies are competing for quantum computing dominance, and it turns into a very difficult area to invest in.\n\nFurthermore, this industry has a lot of hype around it, and some of the pure-play stocks, like IonQ and Rigetti Computing, are seeing their stocks rapidly rise and fall in line with the risk tolerance of the market.\n\nMany investors may want to shy away from this industry because of the volatility and lack of a clear leader, which is fine. However, I think there's a smarter way to invest in the quantum computing realm without needing to expose yourself to high-risk investment that has a huge chance of paying off.\n\nHow? Through an investment in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nAlphabet is a large conglomerate of companies, but it's mainly centered around the Google ecosystem. While Google Search and the ad revenue it generates are the core of Alphabet's business, it's more diversified than that segment.\n\nAlphabet also owns a cloud computing business, Google Cloud. Google Cloud uses computing units from other providers, such as Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), to rent out computing capacity to customers for a wide variety of tasks. However, it has to purchase those GPUs from Nvidia, which is expensive.\n\nGoogle also developed the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) in-house in collaboration with Broadcom, which is a step closer to fully building its own computing hardware. However, Alphabet has chosen to develop its quantum computing hardware entirely on its own, which could pay off big-time for its cloud computing business if it succeeds.\n\nIf Alphabet can win the race to build the first commercially viable quantum computer, then clients will flock to Google Cloud to utilize this cutting-edge technology. This would have other trickle-down effects, such as more clients using its generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, Gemini. Quantum computing technology is expected to greatly reduce the cost of running artificial intelligence training and inference, which would make Gemini the go-to model if Alphabet can develop a quantum computing advantage.",

    "description": "A new study takes the GHZ paradox, which describes how quantum theory can't be described by local realistic descriptions, to new heights.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThe Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) paradox describes how quantum theory cannot be described by local realistic descriptions.\n\nA study takes this GHZ paradox to new heights to see just how non-classical the quantum world can get.\n\nIn the process, their experiment included photons in 37 dimensions, taking science even further down this strange quantum rabbit hole with the hopes of finding applications in these high-dimensional systems.\n\nClassical and quantum mechanics don’t really get along as the science of the subatomic can get, well, weird. Take, for instance, quantum entanglement, which says that the state of one particle can be determined by examining the state of its entangled pair regardless of distance. This strange fact flies in the face of classical physics, and even led Albert Einstein to famously describe this quantum quirk as “spooky action at a distance.”\n\nThis is what is known as “quantum nonlocality,” where objects are influenced across distances (seeming beyond the speed of light) whereas classical physics follows local theory, the idea that objects are influenced by their immediate surroundings. This is a pretty sharp divide as explained by the famous no-go theorem known as the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) paradox, which essentially details how quantum theory cannot be described by local realistic description.\n\nNamed for the physicists who described the paradox in 1989, GHZ-type paradoxes show that when particles can only be influenced by proximity they produce mathematical impossibilities. As New Scientist reports, the paradox can even be expressed through a calculation where 1 equals -1. This paradox is useful in showing how quantum properties can not be described using classical means, but a new paper published in the journal Science Advances, decided to see just how strange these paradoxes could get.\n\nEssentially, an international team of scientists wanted to see how un-classical particles of light could get—and the results were maybe stranger than the authors originally anticipated. This extremely technical experiment produced photons, or particles of light, that existed in 37 dimensions. Just as you and I exist in three dimension—plus an additional temporal dimension—these photons required 37 similar reference points.\n\n“This experiment shows that quantum physics is more nonclassical than many of us thought,” Technical University of Denmark’s Zhenghao Liu, a co-author of the study, told New Scientist. “It could be [that] 100 years after its discovery, we are still only seeing the tip of the iceberg.”\n\nPulling this off is not an easy thing to do as Liu and his team needed to feed a version of the GHZ paradox into coherent light—even in color and wavelength—so that they could easily manipulate the photons. This essentially resulted in the most “nonclassical effects in the quantum world” that’s ever been created, Liu told New Scientist.\n\n“We believe that this work has opened several avenues for future research,” the authors write. “We hope our findings can be used to build even stronger quantum advantages in high-dimensional systems.”\n\nIn other words, if we’ve only discovered the tip of the iceberg, just imagine what quantum breakthroughs are lurking just below the surface.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "Scientists have imaged heat traveling as a wave, called \"second sound,\" in superfluid quantum gas. It may unlock mysteries of neutron stars and superconductors.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nUsually, when something gets warmed up, heat tends to spread outward before eventually dissipating. But things are a little different in the world of superfluid quantum gas.\n\nFor the first time, MIT scientists have successfully imaged how heat actually travels in a wave, known as a “second sound,” through this exotic fluid.\n\nUnderstanding this dynamic could help answer questions about high-temperature superconductors and neutron stars.\n\nIn the world of average, everyday materials, heat tends to spread out from a localized source. Drop a burning coal into a pot of water, and that liquid will slowly rise in temperature before its heat eventually dissipates. But the world is full of rare, exotic materials that don’t exactly play by these thermal rules.\n\nInstead of spreading out as one would expect, these superfluid quantum gasses “slosh” heat side to side—it essentially propagates as a wave. Scientists call this behavior a material’s “second sound” (the first being ordinary sound via a density wave). Although this phenomenon has been observed before, it’s never been imaged. But recently, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) were finally able to capture this movement of pure heat by developing a new method of thermography (a.k.a. heat-mapping).\n\nThe results of this study were published in the journal Science, and in an university press release highlighting the achievement, MIT assistant professor and co-author Richard Fletcher continued the boiling pot analogy to describe the inherent strangeness of “second sound” in these exotic superfluids.\n\n“It’s as if you had a tank of water and made one half nearly boiling,” Fletcher said. “If you then watched, the water itself might look totally calm, but suddenly the other side is hot, and then the other side is hot, and the heat goes back and forth, while the water looks totally still.”\n\nThese superfluids are created when a cloud of atoms is subjected to ultra-cold temperatures approaching absolute zero (−459.67 °F). In this rare state, atoms behave differently, as they create an essentially friction-free fluid. It’s in this frictionless state that heat has been theorized to propagate like a wave.\n\n“Second sound is the hallmark of superfluidity, but in ultracold gases so far you could only see it in this faint reflection of the density ripples that go along with it,” lead author Martin Zwierlein said in a press statement. “The character of the heat wave could not be proven before.”\n\nTo finally capture this second sound in action, Zweierlein and his team had to think outside the usual thermal box, as there’s a big problem trying to track heat of an ultracold object—it doesn’t emit the usual infrared radiation. So, MIT scientists designed a way to leverage radio frequencies to track certain subatomic particles known as “lithium-6 fermions,” which can be captured via different frequencies in relation to their temperature (i.e. warmer temperatures mean higher frequencies, and vice versa). This novel technique allowed the researchers to essentially zero in on the “hotter” frequencies (which were still very much cold) and track the resulting second wave over time.\n\nThis might feel like a big “so what?” After all, when’s the last time you had a close encounter with a superfluid quantum gas? But ask a materials scientist or astronomer, and you’ll get an entirely different answer.\n\nWhile exotic superfluids may not fill up our lives (yet), understanding the properties of second wave movement could help questions regarding high-temperature superconductors (again, still at very low temperatures) or the messy physics that lie at the heart of neutron stars.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "A long-standing physics mystery has been solved with the discovery of emergent photon-like behavior inside a strange quantum material. The finding confirms a true 3D quantum spin liquid and unlocks a new way to study deeply entangled matter.",
    "fullText": "A global research team led by Rice University physicist Pengcheng Dai has verified the presence of emergent photons and fractionalized spin excitations in an unusual quantum spin liquid. Reported in Nature Physics, the work points to the crystal cerium zirconium oxide (Ce2Zr2O7) as a clean three-dimensional example of this exotic state of matter.\n\nQuantum spin liquids have fascinated physicists for years because they could eventually support transformative technologies, including quantum computing and dissipationless energy transmission. Unlike ordinary magnets that settle into an orderly pattern, these materials avoid conventional magnetic order. Instead, their magnetic moments remain strongly quantum-entangled and in constant collective motion at temperatures close to absolute zero, producing behavior that resembles emergent quantum electrodynamics.\n\n\"We've answered a major open question by directly detecting these excitations,\" said Dai, the Sam and Helen Worden Professor of Physics and Astronomy. \"This confirms that Ce2Zr2O7 behaves as a true quantum spin ice, a special class of quantum spin liquids in three dimensions.\"\n\nCleaner Measurements With Polarized Neutron Scattering\n\nTo pin down these elusive signatures, the researchers relied on advanced polarized neutron scattering. This approach helped them isolate the magnetic scattering they cared about while filtering out other signals, even as the system approached the zero temperature limit.\n\nTheir measurements also revealed emergent photon signals near zero energy -- a defining trait that separates quantum spin ice from more familiar phases found in conventional magnets. Additional evidence came from specific heat measurements, which supported the idea that these predicted emergent photons follow a dispersion resembling the way sound moves through a solid.\n\nEarlier attempts to confirm this kind of behavior were often undermined by technical noise and incomplete data. The Rice-led team addressed those challenges through improved sample preparation and high-precision instruments, supported by an international effort involving major laboratories across Europe and North America.\n\nFirst-of-Its-Kind Observation With Big Implications\n\nIn this three-dimensional candidate material, the researchers observed both emergent photons and spinons -- key hallmarks of quantum spin ice. The result resolves a long-running debate in condensed matter physics and gives scientists a strong platform for studying next-generation quantum phenomena and potential technology pathways.\n\nBin Gao, a research scientist in Rice's Department of Physics and Astronomy and the study's first author, said the findings back up decades of theoretical expectations.\n\n\"This surprising result encourages scientists to look deeper into such unique materials, potentially changing how we understand magnets and the behavior of materials in the extreme quantum regime,\" Gao said.\n\nCo-authors of this study include Félix Desrochers and Yong Baek Kim of the University of Toronto; Rice alumnus David Tam of the Paul Scherrer Institut; Silke Paschen, Diana Kirschbaum and Duy Ha Nguyen of Vienna University of Technology; Paul Steffens and Arno Hiess of the Institut Laue-Langevin; Yixi Su of Jülich Centre of Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum; and Sang-Wook Cheong of Rutgers University.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Robert A.
