    "fullText": "The demolition of Hawai’i’s Aloha Stadium is finally underway after several delays.\n\nOnce home to the NFL Pro Bowl, college football’s Hawaiʻi Bowl and University of Hawaiʻi football, Aloha Stadium is transitioning into a new scaled-down stadium with an accompanying entertainment district.\n\nAs part of the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District (NASED) project, the new stadium is set for a projected grand opening in March 2029, and is expected to have a seating capacity of 22,500, less than half of the previous 50,000 seats it held.\n\n“The demolition/dismantling of Aloha Stadium has begun,” Aloha Stadium Authority chairman Eric Fujimoto said at the NASED monthly meeting on Dec. 18. The removal of furnishings and the subsequent dismantling of the facility are expected to take approximately 10 months.\n\nThe beginning of the demolition process marks a major milestone for a plan that has been repeatedly delayed. The reopening of the stadium was initially scheduled to be on time for the Rainbow Warriors’ football season in 2028, but was pushed back to 2029 in August of this year.\n\nBefore its final closing after years of maintenance issues, Aloha Stadium was an innovative steel-constructed venue with movable seating sections for different sports and events.\n\nHowever, the stadium, also known as the Metal Mecca, met its downfall because of that very design structure.\n\nThe steel structure was not a good match for Hawai’i’s humid climate, which led to severe, damaging rust that required frequent repairs.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the stadium with a costly history was put to rest.\n\nWith the demolition now in full swing, attention turns to the broader vision of the NASED project. The construction of the new, smaller stadium and the surrounding entertainment district is expected to cost the state $350 million.\n\nThe new Aloha Stadium’s entertainment district is expected to include 4,000 to 4,500 housing units, multiple hotels, retail and dining spaces and cultural attractions. Residential construction is projected to take place shortly after the opening of the newly renovated Aloha Stadium, as early as 2029 or 2030.\n\nDiego Rivera - The Sporting Tribune\n\nThe University of Hawai'i Rainbow Warriors celebrate linebacker Jalen Smith's (3) fumble recovery during an NCAA football game against the Utah State Aggies, Saturday, October 11, 2025.\n\nAfter playing its home games at the Clarence T.C. Ching Athletics Complex since the closing of Aloha Stadium, University of Hawai’i football is set to move back into the new facility in 2029 under a license agreement negotiated with Hawai’i Athletics Director Matt Elliott.\n\n“While there is still much work ahead, the progress being made gives all of us reason to be optimistic,” Elliott said in a September press release. “We are excited to see momentum building and remain committed to doing our part to bring this long-awaited vision to life.”\n\nAs demolition progresses and construction plans take shape, the NASED project ushers in a new era for Hawai’i sports.",

    "title": "Mitch Albom: 3 types of Lions fans can all agree — 2025 was a loser",
    "description": "What kind of Detroit Lions fan are you? Die-hard? Realist? SOL? All three have to be disappointed in the way this season went down.",
    "fullText": "“This may have been our only shot.”\n\nDan Campbell said that nearly two years ago, right after the Detroit Lions blew a 17-point lead in the NFC championship game. At the time, I thought the coach was being bravely honest and emotionally raw.\n\nI didn’t think he was being a prophet.\n\nJEFF SEIDEL: Honeymoon's over for Lions GM Brad Holmes and Dan Campbell\n\nBut the Lions’ Super Bowl chances have gone steadily downhill ever since. Last year, they crapped out in a divisional-round playoff upset. This year, with eight losses already, they’re missing the playoffs altogether.\n\nNow, I can’t tell Campbell how to coach. I can’t tell Jared Goff how to elude pressure. I can’t teach an offensive lineman how to not miss his block, or show a defensive back how to play smarter coverage.\n\nI can’t do that, and neither can you, because we are not professional players or coaches.\n\nBut we are fans. So I can offer the following three scenarios for how to deal with the latest Lions’ disappointment in the months to come — as a fan — depending on your type.\n\nDAVE BIRKETT: Lions need to 'give the city a team that they're proud of again'\n\nIf you are this breed of fan, then you will point out the positives. The Lions have some terrific players under contract. Campbell is an exceptionally good coach. General manager Brad Holmes has had great drafts before. And neither man is likely to sit still this offseason.\n\nBoth Campbell and Holmes have been humbled by the 2025 campaign. The loss to Minnesota on Thursday, Dec. 25, was the low point. Campbell, who prides himself on having his teams ready, didn’t get that done. The Lions looked worse than a Vikings team with nothing to play for, a third-string quarterback and multiple absences on the offensive line.\n\nMeanwhile, Holmes had to be cringing watching his second- and third-stringers perform like Not Ready For Prime Time Players.\n\nThese two proud men, The Die-hard Fan says, will surely right the ship. “Remember the start of the season? When the Lions went 4-1, had a bazooka offense, and an MVP candidate in Goff? We can do that again!”\n\nThe Die-hard Fan believes the injuries were fluky-bad this season — most of the O-line, the tight ends, and the defensive backfield. \"That can’t happen again,\" he says. \"We still have Goff, Sam LaPorta, great running backs and great receivers, right?\"\n\nThe Die-hard Fan points to the Kansas City Chiefs, last year’s Super Bowl participants, who are now sitting with a 6-10 record. Does anyone believe they will never be back?\n\n“Playoffs next year,” The Die-hard Fan says. “Bigger and better. On we go!”\n\nThis fan wants to believe, but also understands a few truths about NFL football: A.) Windows open and close. B.) Other teams also want to win.\n\nThe latter is the kind of thing that got forgotten in 2025, particularly in the November game against Minnesota, the Thanksgiving game against Green Bay and the Week 16 home game against Pittsburgh. The narratives going into those contests — the Vikings were bad and starting a raw quarterback; the Lions wanted revenge against the Pack; the Lions faced a must-win against a Steelers team with a bad defense — all favored Detroit.\n\nBut too often in Motown, we act like the Lions are the only determinant in the game — that all they have to do is want it enough to win.\n\n“Hey,” The Realist says, “the other team wants it, too. Their players want to look good. They have guys who play hard. Unless you come in every week fully charged, healthy and in domination mode, you will always have a battle in the NFL. And a handful of plays will determine the outcome.”\n\nThe Realist admires what Holmes did in 2022 (picking Aidan Hutchinson, trading up to get Jameson Williams) and 2023 (drafting LaPorta, Jahmyr Gibbs, Jack Campbell and Brian Branch) but he also sees that 2024 and 2025 haven’t come close to producing such talent, and Holmes’ inactivity at trade deadlines and free agency reveals a too-stubborn valuing of draft picks over desperately needed fixes.\n\nThe Realist looks at the NFC North and sees Chicago on the rise, Green Bay not going anywhere, and a Minnesota team that often gives the Lions fits. The Realist can’t ignore the Lions are last in their division.\n\nBut The Realist still watches with hope. He doesn’t deny the Lions' successes. He doesn’t think the 2023 postseason was a myth. He doesn’t think the 15-2 regular season last year was a mirage. He doesn’t believe in curses.\n\nThis type, “SOL” for short, believes all of this is predestined. It’s the Curse of Bobby Layne. It’s the curse of the Ford family ownership. It’s in the water. It’s in the air. It doesn’t matter how many promising players or stunning wins the Lions deliver. It will always end badly.\n\nThe SOL Fan doesn’t see silver or Honolulu Blue. He only sees gray. He thinks Holmes had a lucky draft in 2023 and has bungled everything since. He already wants Campbell fired. He sees Goff as a one-dimensional quarterback who can’t do anything once he’s chased from the pocket. He says Hutchinson is overrated and now overpaid. He says the Lions’ training staff should all be fired, because all they produce is a M*A*S*H* unit, year after year.\n\nThe SOL Fan watches the present but only sees the past. He sees Aaron Rodgers killing the Lions' chances as a Packer and then again as a Steeler. He sees the 2023 Lions reach the NFC championship game and wither just like the 1991 Lions did, not to return for three decades.\n\nThe SOL Fan predicts doom, expects doom, and often gets it. Right now, nothing about the 2025 season surprises him, other than the fact that anyone expected otherwise.\n\n“This is who the Lions are,” The SOL Fan moans. “Expect heartbreak. Get heartbreak. They never disappoint.”\n\nSo which are you? Die-hard? Realist? SOL? Or something in between?\n\nWherever you land, just know that fans in 16 other cities are going through the same thing right now, some in shock (Kansas City, Cincinnati, Washington), some in mild surprise (Tampa Bay, Dallas), some because they absolutely expect it (Cleveland, the Jets).\n\nThat’s the only thing that every type of fan can agree on.\n\nContact Mitch Albom: malbom@freepress.com.

    "fullText": "Lakers' JJ Redick hints at possible lineup change originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are enduring one of the bleakest stretches of their early season, and Thursday's blowout loss to the Houston Rockets may have been the wakeup call head coach JJ Redick and his staff needed to make a change.\n\nRedick came out of Saturday's infamous \"uncomfortable\" practice with enough evidence to seriously consider impactful rotational changes moving forward.\n\n\"In terms of lineups, our guys upstairs have told us 250 minutes is like the sort of target number for when lineup data starts to set and normalize,\" Redick told the media after Saturday's practice. \"So you can look at a lineup (that has played) 11 minutes, 'Oh, look at this 11 minutes!' Yeah, we played small-ball for one game and they played well that game. You can't take a ton from that. But there's certainly trends that we're looking at and we've kind of made some decisions on about where we're gonna go.\"\n\nLos Angeles' most-used lineup this season has been its starting lineup of Luka Dončić, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, LeBron James and DeAndre Ayton, which has played seven games and 85 total minutes together. This lineup has also churned out the Lakers' worst plus-minus (-29).\n\nRemoving Reaves, who will be out at least four weeks with a calf strain, and inserting Marcus Smart (a fan-favorite to replace Hachimura should Redick make a change) makes for Los Angeles' second-worst lineup by plus-minus (-28).\n\nLooking through the lineups, there are two common denominators -- Hachimura and James. James will never be benches, which leaves us with Hachimura. If there were ever a change to be made, it would be moving the sharpshooting forward to a bench role in place of more defensive reinforcements.\n\nThe Lakers take on the Sacramento Kings on Sunday.",

Kiffin managed to draw laughs with a grocery store moment. But he took a new step in winning over a rabid fanbase with an action involving Malik Nabers and the Texas Bowl.\n\nKiffin pulled into the Saturday bowl game his future team was playing in. Amid the LSU versus Houston contest, he spotted the legendary Tigers wide receiver.\n\nKiffin managed to draw new likes, retweets and comments — by snapping this photo.\n\n⁦@LSUfootball⁩ pic.twitter.com/r4iidDEQMD\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) December 28, 2025\n\nWhile considered a simple photo, it’s still enough for Kiffin to draw new interest among a curious group of fans. Kiffin clearly wants to have good relations with LSU — and that includes interacting with beloved Tiger players like Nabers.\n\nBefore taking on the nation’s No. 21 team, Kiffin and LSU dealt with one roster departure.\n\nLeft tackle Tyree Adams opted to enter the College Football Transfer Portal on Saturday morning. Adams rises as a pivotal early loss for the incoming head coach — with the offensive lineman surrendering zero sacks in 11 starts. He has two years of eligibility left.\n\nKiffin will need to hit the portal to find his replacement. Or he can insert incoming freshman Brysten Martinez as the blindside protector moving forward. He was a local signing for the 2026 class out of Gonzalez, La., and heads to Baton Rouge as a four-star signing.\n\nLSU, meanwhile, engaged in a close contest with the Big 12 representative as UH led 28-21 before the start of the fourth quarter.",

    "fullText": "Playing without Alperen Şengün should change the math for the Houston Rockets. On Saturday night, it only changed the look- and not in a way Cleveland was ready for.\n\nWith Şengün sidelined by a calf issue, Houston didn’t try to replace his production possession by possession. They redistributed responsibility. The offense flattened out, the pace stayed controlled, and the hierarchy became simple: defend first, move the ball early, and let Kevin Durant dictate when scoring was needed.\n\nWithout Houston’s usual post hub on the floor, Durant became both the pressure point and the release valve. He scored early, drew attention without forcing shots, and punished Cleveland for never fully committing to a double. He didn’t play hero ball, but he did ensure structure was maintained and embraced his role within it.\n\nSteven Adams anchored the paint, controlled the glass, and kept Cleveland from getting second chances. Tari Eason brought disruption and energy in the gaps. Reed Sheppard spaced the floor and punished late rotations. Everyone stayed in their lane.\n\nDefensively, the Rockets looked even more locked in. Without Şengün’s playmaking responsibilities to manage, Houston simplified reads, stayed connected, and turned stops into rhythm without rushing. And Cleveland never found a clean way to speed the game up.\n\nSaturday night proved that not only can Houston survive without Şengün- they can toggle styles when needed by leaning on defense, rebounding, and discipline, instead of flow. That kind of adaptability is the difference between a good team and a serious one.",

    "fullText": "Xabi Alonso is approaching the midpoint of his first season in charge at Real Madrid, and the early stretch has offered a clearer picture of what is working and what still needs reinforcement. Midfield has emerged as a key talking point, with the club reportedly keeping close tabs on PSG standout Vitinha.\n\nAny attempt to land the Portuguese midfielder would come with obvious challenges. PSG relied heavily on Vitinha alongside Fabián Ruiz and João Neves during a dominant 2024–25 campaign that delivered Ligue 1, the UEFA Champions League, and the Coupe de France.\n\nStill, Madrid’s spending power could complicate matters. A serious offer might prompt PSG to listen, opening the door to discussions that could extend to Vitinha himself and whether a move away from París is worth considering.\n\nAccording to Cadena SER, Real Madrid have identified Vitinha as a potential target if Vinicius Jr. departs during the summer window. The club would aim to free up significant salary space from such an exit and redirect those funds toward a move for the PSG midfielder.\n\nDespite being tied to PSG until 2029, Vitinha wouldn’t rule out a future move to Spain during a recent interview with O Jogo.\n\n“La Liga is fantastic and suits my style of play better,” Vitinha said (h/t Le10Sport). “I would like to play there one day. But it’s difficult to set goals. You have to take things step by step.”\n\n“I’ve already played in the Premier League, but at Wolverhampton I didn’t get as much playing time as I would have liked, especially during the Covid period, which prevented me from fully enjoying the atmosphere in the stadiums.”",

    "fullText": "New Michigan coach Kyle Whittingham resets football culture with inspiring message originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines hiring Kyle Whittingham isn't just a breath of fresh air. It's the definition of a complete foundational rebuild.\n\nWhittingham was announced as the team's coach Friday, replacing Sherrone Moore. Whittingham was previously the coach of the Utah Utes for over two decades before accepting the Wolverines' job. Upon accepting the position, Whittingham made it clear what his intentions are centered on, leading consistently.\n\n\"Michigan fans, coach Kyle Whittingham,\" Whittingham said in a video on 'X. ' \"Honored to be here, honored to be the football coach of this great university. Can't wait to get working with our players, getting to know them and getting Michigan football to where it should be.\"\n\nWhittingham released a much longer statement, too, further emphasizing where he'd like to see the program head.\n\n\"We are honored to lead the outstanding student-athletes, coaches, and staff who represent Michigan Football each day,\" Whittingham said. \"Michigan is synonymous with tradition and excellence—both on the field and beyond—and our entire program is committed to upholding those values while striving for greatness together. My family and I are thrilled to join the University of Michigan community, and we look forward to helping our players grow, develop, and reach their highest potential—on the gridiron, in the classroom, and as leaders. It’s a privilege to be part of something that inspires pride in every Wolverine fan. Go Blue!”\n\nAD Warde Manuel echoed those words.\n\n“Kyle Whittingham is a well-respected and highly successful head coach who is widely recognized as a leader of exceptional character and principled leadership,\" Manuel said. \"Throughout our search, he consistently demonstrated the qualities we value at Michigan: vision, resilience, and the ability to build and sustain championship-caliber teams. Kyle brings not only a proven track record of success, but also a commitment to creating a program rooted in toughness, physicality, discipline and respect—where student-athletes and coaches represent the university with distinction both on and off the field. We are excited to welcome Kyle to the University of Michigan family as he takes the helm of our football program.”\n\nUltimately, it seems the Wolverines are happy with how they view Whittingham. Whether it translates to wins, though, is a different story.",

    "title": "Packers Snap Counts: Rashan Gary down to DE3 in Week 17 vs. Ravens",
    "description": "Both Kingsley Enagbare and Lukas Van Ness finished with more snaps played than Rashan Gary on Saturday.",
    "fullText": "The Green Bay Packers got banged up against the Baltimore Ravens. Quarterback Malik Willis (shoulder), receiver Dontayvion Wicks (concussion), defensive tackle Jordon Riley (Achilles), cornerback Nate Hobbs (knee), cornerback Kamal Hadden (ankle) and safety Zayne Anderson (ankle) all got injured and didn’t return to action for the Packers. On top of that, there were injuries coming into the game, and Green Bay played the reserve offense to end the second half, as they were already down 41-24 in the closing minutes of the game.\n\nSo let’s go through the Packers’ snap counts against the Ravens, which might have been Green Bay’s last game at Lambeau Field this year, and talk through what happened in the game position-by-position.\n\nObviously, starting quarterback Jordan Love missed this game due to a concussion. Willis stepped in and played well, but suffered a non-contact reaggravation of his shoulder injury from last week, which forced practice squadder Clayton Tune into the lineup. After the game, head coach Matt LaFleur said that Willis could have been sent back in, and also that Love hasn’t passed the concussion protocol yet.\n\nIt sure seems like the Packers are taking it easy with Josh Jacobs, even when the division was still on the line. Jacobs has been battling a multi-month knee injury at this point and was out-snapped by both Chris Brooks, usually a blocking back, and Emanuel Wilson, the team’s route-runner. I’m going to go ahead and assume that Jacobs won’t be getting many opportunities against the Minnesota Vikings this week.\n\nWith Dontayivion Wicks getting injured early and Savion Williams being out with an illness, Bo Melton again had to play offense in this game. The thin depth chart also helped get Matthew Golden on the field more. On 24 plays, Golden finished with one reception for 12 yards.\n\nWith John FitzPatrick suffering a season-ending Achilles injury, the Packers brought up practice squadder Drake Dabney for this game. He got most of his playing time in garbage time, though. Instead, Josh Whyle really served the role of the starting tight end in a rotation with Luke Musgrave.\n\nThe starting unit was Rasheed Walker, Aaron Banks, Sean Rhyan, Anthony Belton and Jordan Morgan (left to right) with Zach Tom still dealing with knee and back injuries. Kinnard only got in on two plays as an extra tight end, with one of them being the first play of the game: A deep shot to receiver Romeo Doubs. Both Jacob Monk and Donovan Jennings were on the bench watching the offense until garbage time.\n\nIt sure seems like Rashan Gary got benched! Even without Micah Parsons in the mix, Gary only played 33 snaps in this game, fewer than either Kingsley Enagbare or Lukas Van Ness. In total, Gary only played 45 percent of the Packers’ defensive snaps in this game. This was probably his last game in green and gold at Lambeau.\n\nRookie draft picks Collin Oliver and Barryn Sorrell were both healthy scratches in this game.\n\nThe Packers had five defensive tackles up for this game, but rookie Nazir Stackhouse was a healthy scratch. It sure seems like Stackhouse is now DT6 on the depth chart, which would be DT7 if Devonte Wyatt were healthy. Green Bay is basically redshirting him this year, hoping that he takes the next step next summer.\n\nThe Packers played an extra defensive tackle on 16 plays to try to stop the Ravens’ rushing attack. The extra body did not help.\n\nGreen Bay only had four linebackers up, following the placement of Kristian Welch on the injured reserve. To make up for that, both Edgerrin Cooper and Quay Walker had to play a lot more special teams snaps for the team this week. Isaiah McDuffie was on the field nearly two-thirds of the time, as Baltimore was fine playing a heavy-on-heavy game against the Packers.\n\n57: Carrington Valentine (2 SPT)\n\nThe physicality of Carrington Valentine, when facing running back Derrick Henry, was a major problem in this game. The Packers first tried to bench Valentine situationally to get Nate Hobbs on the field. Then Hobbs got hurt.\n\nThen the Packers benched Valentine to get Kamal Hadden on the field. Then Hadden got hurt.\n\nGreen Bay is now down to three healthy cornerbacks on the 53-man roster, and one of them is Bo Melton, who has only played receiver and special teams this year.\n\nBefore the Nate Hobbs injury, the Packers were trying to get Javon Bullard some snaps at safety to help stop the run, which displaced Evan Williams. After the Hobbs injury, though, Bullard had to move back into the slot, in place of Hobbs, and Bullard and Williams shared the safety position situationally.\n\nAnderson also went down with an injury. Everyone is hurt. This team is very banged up.",

    "description": "Down at halftime of the Gator Bowl, Virginia swung momentum with a 19-yard, 10-minute march. Here's a closer look at the touchdown drive.",
    "fullText": "Chandler Morris long ago lost count of all the drives from a college football career that has carried him to Oklahoma, TCU, North Texas and now Virginia.\n\nBut Virginia's graduate quarterback, now a day past his 25th birthday, said he's never experienced a marathon march quite like the one that earned a place in the annals of the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl.\n\n\"That was my first,\" Morris said. \"Out in the Florida heat, I guess, we haven't been too used to it, too.\"\n\nThe bowl doesn't maintain complete records for longest drive in its 81-year history, but the Morris-led march of 19 plays, 75 yards, 10 minutes and 7 seconds to open the second half of the Cavaliers' 13-7 win against Missouri on Dec. 27 will rank among the most important.\n\nThis was football for the tortoise, not the hare. Just the way Virginia head coach Tony Elliott wanted.\n\n\"That's an offense on the other sideline that can get going at any time, that can rip off big runs for touchdowns, that can find big plays in the passing game,\" Elliott said. \"So we wanted to try and control the game a little bit where we could, and see if we could possess the ball.\"\n\nOpening the half with a 7-3 deficit on its own 25, Virginia embarked on a gritty, grinding slow-motion drive through the Jacksonville night. Nine running plays gained 4 yards or fewer. The possession looked spoiled from the start: Missouri (8-5) drove Harrison Waylee backward for a loss of 2 on first down and Morris threw incomplete on second.\n\nBut after three third-down conversions, two fourth-down conversions, two direct snaps to a tailback and even a variant of the swinging-gate formation, Waylee plunged in from 2. The EverBank Stadium end zone. The lead.\n\n\"What I'm thinking is, 'Thank you for bailing me out [on the fourth-down gambles],'\" Elliott said.\n\nAt Virginia, Elliott said, they call it \"Polecat.\"\n\nFrom an unorthodox formation — three linemen split wide, spreading the defense in unpredictable ways — Morris caught the confused Tigers off guard and fired a strike to tight end Sage Ennis at the Mizzou 12, the biggest play in a procession of small ones.\n\nMorris completed 7 of 9 passes for 52 yards on the drive, spreading the ball among five different Cavalier pass-catchers. Four different rushers kept the chains moving, and frustrated the Tigers.\n\n\"It was just execution on our parts, nothing we hadn't prepared for,\" Missouri linebacker Nick Rodriguez said.\n\nNo. 21 Virginia (11-3) changed up its offense, and really had no choice. Leading receiver Trell Harris (59 catches, 847 yards) missed the game with a knee injury, and top running back J'Mari Taylor (1,062 yards rushing, 14 TD) never took the field in an apparent bowl opt-out.\n\nSlow. Steady. A drive that won't ignite a viral highlight wildfire online. But Virginia wouldn't be taking a bowl title back to Charlottesville, or celebrating a first-ever 11-win season, without it.\n\n\"To be able to go out there and really take over the line of scrimmage and punch it in the end zone, putting seven points on the board that drive was really big,\" Morris said.\n\nVirginia's 19-play Gator Bowl drive\n\nFirst and 10, Virginia 25: Harrison Waylee run for loss of 2.\n\nSecond and 12, Virginia 23: Chandler Morris pass incomplete.\n\nThird and 12, Virginia 23: Morris pass to Eli Wood for 13.\n\nFirst and 10, Virginia 36: Morris pass to Waylee for 4.\n\nSecond and 6, Virginia 40: Morris run for 2.\n\nThird and 4, Virginia 42: Morris run for 2.\n\nFourth and 2, Virginia 44: Morris pass to Cam Ross for 6.\n\nFirst and 10, 50: Morris pass to Kameron Courtney for 3.\n\nSecond and 7, Missouri 47: Davis Lane Jr. run for 2.\n\nThird and 5, Missouri 45: Waylee run for 2.\n\nFourth and 3, Missouri 43: Morris pass to Waylee for 5.\n\nFirst and 10, Missouri 38: Morris pass incomplete.\n\nSecond and 10, Missouri 38: Xay Davis run for 8.\n\nThird and 2, Missouri 30: Davis run for 3.\n\nFirst and 10, Missouri 27: Morris pass to Sage Ennis for 15.\n\nFirst and 10, Missouri 12: Morris run for 2.\n\nSecond and 8, Missouri 10: Morris pass to Ross for 6.\n\nThird and 2, Missouri 4: Waylee run for 2.\n\nFirst and goal, Missouri 2: Waylee touchdown run for 2.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Florida Times-Union: Virginia football's 19-play drive at Gator Bowl",

    "fullText": "After beating the Indianapolis Colts on Monday night at Lucas Oil Stadium, the San Francisco 49ers are back in action on Sunday for another primetime matchup, this time against the Chicago Bears at Levi's Stadium.\n\nWith these two teams still fighting for playoff seeding, this game will have everyone's attention for the national broadcast, but fantasy owners will be just as glued in because this is the championship in most leagues.\n\nBefore the Sunday night showdown, let's take a look at what fantasy owners should be doing with their 49ers this week to try and win a title:\n\nPurdy threw for five touchdowns against the Colts and is coming off winning NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. This year, only seven quarterbacks have averaged more fantasy points per game than Purdy, and one of those is Patrick Mahomes, who won't be playing in Week 17. Even possibly without two of his best weapons this week, he should get the start.\n\nChicago may be a top-10 defense against opposing running backs in fantasy football, but McCaffrey's usage is simply too much to leave him on the bench.\n\nJennings has been a WR3 or flex play this year, but he's found the end zone in six of his last seven games, scoring twice against the Tennessee Titans in Week 15. As the team's primary receiver, he should probably get the start.\n\nKittle didn't finish last week's battle with the Colts due to an ankle injury that he tried to play through. He didn't practice all week, and with the playoffs in just a few weeks, they may not try to push it. Even if he's active, he may be more of a decoy than anything.\n\nNew Bears head coach and offensive playcaller Ben Johnson can present plenty of problems for the 49ers defense, which is without their two best players. After getting carved up by 44-year-old Philip Rivers last week, it's hard to have must confidence in the group right now.\n\nMore 49ers: RB Christian McCaffrey cracks top 10 in 49ers rushing yards\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: 49ers vs. Bears: Fantasy start/sit recommendations for San Francisco",

Tijjani Reijnders opened the scoring yesterday in the 48th minute before Omari Hutchinson equalised for Forest six minutes later. Rayan Cherki scored the winner for Pep Guardiola’s side in the 83rd minute of yesterday’s match. The City players and staff celebrated hard at the final whistle after they saw off Sean Dyche’s determined and well-organised team. City picked up a massive three points yesterday but Manchester City’s win over Nottingham Forest felt bigger than that come the final whistle.\n\nNottingham Forest didn’t allow Manchester City to be at their free-flowing best yesterday. Sean Dyche’s side were well-organised defensively and their threat on the counter and in the final third was ever-present throughout yesterday’s match. Pep Guardiola’s side had to fight, scrap, and rely on their mentality to overcome a determined opponent. A magical second-half display from Rayan Cherki did help City pick up a massive win. But the mentality of this Manchester City squad did help them overcome a tough opponent yesterday.\n\nWhile City picked up a vital three points yesterday to keep in touch with Premier League leaders Arsenal, their win over Nottingham Forest felt bigger than that. It was Manchester City’s eighth consecutive win in all competitions. But the confidence and belief that this City team should gain from yesterday’s win could prove to be invaluable. It isn’t out of the realm of possibility that Manchester City’s win yesterday could be looked back upon as a pivotal point in Manchester City’s season.\n\nSpeaking after his team’s win over Nottingham Forest, Pep Guardiola said that his team’s win over Sean Dyche’s side was a massive victory. He had high praise for Nottingham Forest and the fact that City overcame them meant the win City picked up yesterday was a big one. He explained: “Winter time, Nottingham Forest away… I know the memory is weak, but when we won one of the six Premier Leagues this type of game happens a lot. Three points, but it’s a massive three points, mainly for the quality of the opposition.”\n\nPep Guardiola also praised his team’s mentality. City weren’t at their best but they found a way to win yesterday. Guardiola added: “We talked about that; we needed an incredible mentality. It’s more important how you suffer and defend, accept you can be better and be in the game, otherwise, no chance will you win, that game last season we lost. Since then, a long time the team want to do it and of course, the last game of the first leg of the season it’s good to finish with this important three points.”\n\nManchester City picked up a massive win yesterday over Nottingham Forest. City’s win felt bigger than simply picking up three valuable points. Yesterday’s result felt like a big moment in Manchester City’s season and the confidence and belief City will take from the match yesterday could prove to be invaluable as this season progresses. This Manchester City side has a strong mentality and that stood out yesterday as they dug deep to beat Sean Dyche’s side. That mentality is the foundation of this City side and it could potentially form the backbone of any success City achieve this season.",

    "description": "Atkinson is running out of ways to describe his team’s poor performances.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Cavaliers reached a new low on Saturday as they dropped their game with the Houston Rockets 117-100.\n\nThe fact that the Cavs lost wasn’t necessarily cause for alarm. The Rockets are one of the best teams in the Western Conference and pose significant matchup disadvantages for Cleveland. How they lost was the issue.\n\nThe Cavaliers came out of the gates flat, as if just showing up was enough to win them the game. This was a red flag for Cavs’ head coach Kenny Atkinson, who seemingly knew the outcome just a few minutes after tip-off.\n\n“I rarely say this, but I thought the game was over in the first quarter,” Atkinson said postgame. “Their physicality, we weren’t ready for the fight tonight. I don’t know how else to say it.”\n\nAnything bought from the links helps support Fear the Sword. You can find this comfortable Cuyahoga Valley National Park hoodie HERE. All of of Homage’s Cavs gear can be found HERE.\n\nAtkinson’s assessment was accurate. The Cavaliers weren’t ready for this game and didn’t come out with the energy and effort they needed to. This is a team that hasn’t been able to turn the momentum around if they don’t come out as the aggressors. That said, it’s surprising to hear a head coach admit that after yet another disappointing loss.\n\nA lack of preparation and focus reflects poorly on the head coach. And while it’s unfair to blame Atkinson entirely for this group’s issues, it’s undeniable that the team isn’t playing hard for him on a nightly basis like they were last season.\n\nThe most frustrating part of Saturday’s game for the Cavs is the fact that it came on the heels of what was a good week. They won two straight games with convincing victories over the Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans, before playing well enough to defeat the New York Knicks, but ultimately failing to do so due to poor late-game execution.\n\n“I was encouraged after the Knicks game, because we were ready for the fight,” Atkinson said. “It wasn’t the same team that played the other night against the Knicks.”\n\nThe loss brings the Cavs’ record to 17-16. And while there’s still plenty of games left in the regular season, they’re running out of time to show that this group is capable of rallying and making a playoff push. Cleveland now sits eighth in the Eastern Conference and is eight games behind the Detroit Pistons for the top spot.",

    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Bengals host the Arizona Cardinals at Paycor Stadium on Sunday, Dec. 28, in the penultimate game of the season in Week 17.\n\nThe Bengals (5-10) are coming off a 45-21 win over the Miami Dolphins and the Cardinals (3-12) are coming off a 26-19 loss to the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nCincinnati will finish third in the AFC North and Arizona will finish last in the NFC West this season.\n\nBengals awards Ja'Marr Chase Ja'Marr Chase: Earning Pro Bowls will never get old\n\nBengals Cardinals Joe Burrow Christmas 7 gifts Joe Burrow received for Christmas\n\nQuarterback Joe Burrow will lead the Bengals' offense and is 2-2 since returning from a turf toe injury in Cincinnati's win over the Baltimore Ravens on Thanksgiving.\n\nThe game can be seen on FOX-TV (Channel 19) and is on the Bengals radio network WLW-AM (700), WCKY-AM (1530) and WEBN-FM (102.7). Kickoff is scheduled for 1 p.m.\n\nHere are the keys to a Bengals' victory:\n\nBurrow and the offense had their full complement of weapons with wide receiver Tee Higgins returning from concussion protocol in the Week 16 win over the Dolphins. The result was Burrow being named the FedEx Air & Ground Player of the Week alongside Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence.\n\nBurrow was 25-for-32 passing for 309 yards and four touchdowns. If the Bengals can keep close to that pace on offense, it'll be hard for the Cardinals to keep up.\n\nThe Bengals also led time of possession in Week 16, which helps the defense.\n\nThe Bengals had a historically bad defense through the first half of the season. They lost back-to-back games this year when scoring 38 and 42 points, respectively, to the New York Jets and Chicago Bears and couldn't get stops when needed to clinch games.\n\nFast forward the Week 17 and the Bengals still have the most missed tackles in the NFL (155), but have moved into second worst in the league for total yards and points allowed.\n\nThe Bengals need to get stops against the Cardinals' offense and get Burrow and the offense more opportunities to score points.\n\nThe Bengals have two games left in the 2026 season and suffering a major injury at this point could put the start of next season in question.\n\nKansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes injured his ACL and LCL in Week 15, but is expected to be ready for Week 1 of the 2026 NFL season.\n\nThe Bengals need to stay healthy and have a full offseason for their key players to have a regular start to next season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Keys for the Bengals to beat the Arizona Cardinals",

    "fullText": "Updated Fantasy Football Start 'Em, Sit 'Em Week 17: Who should I start, Championship Week lineup advice, best matchups, DFS picks originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWelcome to the Week 17 edition of fantasy football starts and sits from The Sporting News.\n\n\"The Decider\" is your one-stop shop for fantasy start/sit lineup advice in 2025 -- a unique mashup of rankings and matchup breakdowns to help you make those tough decisions on whom to play and not to play:\n\nThere are several high-drafted fantasy players who should be in lineups every week when they're active. Those are the \"regular starts.\"\n\nFor those borderline options with favorable matchups, they are \"stronger starts,\" while the recommended sits are \"weaker starts.\"\n\nWe're also basing our advice on 12-team, half-point PPR to split the difference between shallow and deep leagues and full-PPR and standard formats.\n\nGoing beyond the redraft league starts and sits, \"The Decider\" also includes some DFS picks for different styles of daily fantasy sports games on DraftKings and FanDuel.\n\nKeep scrolling for how to put the best fantasy football lineups on \"the field\" for your critical Week 17 game with tips on starts and sits this week.\n\n➕ UPGRADE YOUR TOOLS FOR THE PLAYOFFS: \nJacoby Brissett, Cardinals (at CIN)\n\nMatthew Stafford, Rams (at ATL)\n\n9. Brock Purdy, 49ers (vs. CHI): Purdy is on fire after ripping the Colts to shreds on Monday night and he'll come back home to roast the Bears, too.\n\n10. Baker Mayfield, Buccaneers (at MIA): Mayfield needs a get-well game overall and the running game will facilitate that on the road.\n\n11. Trevor Lawrence, Jaguars (at IND): There's no way you can sit him in the championship with the kind of heater he's on over the past month-plus.\n\n12. Caleb Williams, Bears (at SF): Purdy and the Niners will force him into plenty of effective passing volume on Sunday night.\n\n13. Tyler Shough, Saints (at TEN): Shough is getting better every week under Kellen Moore and the matchups also are aligning with giving him more productive confidence.\n\n14. Geno Smith, Raiders (vs. NYG): This might feel weird to put him up this high but he should need to throw a ton opposite Dart in a sneaky but sloppy high-scoring game.\n\nJaxson Dart, Giants (at LV, $5,400 on DraftKings, $7,100 on FanDuel): Dart was headed to bad things against the Vikings' defense last week and now gets out of the MetLife elements to deliver his running and passing rookie fun again.\n\n15. Justin Herbert, Chargers (vs. HOU): He might be still seeing ghosts from Christmas past given how the Texans ripped him in last year's playoffs.\n\n16. C.J. Stroud, Texans (at LAC): The Chargers were rather good in containing Prescott on the road and Stroud is meh in tougher matchups.\n\n17. Jared Goff, Lions (at MIN): Goff can't get it done one-dimensionally against a tough pass defense on the road.\n\n18. Bo Nix, Broncos (at KC): Nix should have limited volume in a low-scoring game where a fourth-quarter comeback will not be required.\n\n19. Sam Darnold, Seahawks (at CAR): The Seahawks should be relentless running the ball in this revenge game to attack the Panthers' big weakness on the road, playing off the defense.\n\n20. Aaron Rodgers, Steelers (at CLE): He probably will be Myles Garrett's record-breaking sack victim even in a run-heavy game plan.\n\n🗒️ BEST PICKUPS: Week 17 Waiver Wire\n\nSaquon Barkley, Eagles (at BUF)\n\nChristian McCaffrey, 49ers (vs. CHI)\n\nBijan Robinson, Falcons (vs. LAR)\n\nBucky Irving, Buccaneers (at MIA)\n\nJonathan Taylor, Colts (vs. JAX)\n\nDe'Von Achane, Dolphins (vs. TB)\n\nJaylen Warren, Steelers (at CLE)\n\nJavonte Williams, Cowboys (at WAS)\n\nTravis Etienne, Jaguars (at IND)\n\nAshton Jeanty, Raiders (vs. NYG)\n\nJosh Jacobs, Packers (if he plays, at BAL)\n\nTreVeyon Henderson, Patriots (if he plays, vs. NYJ)\n\nWoody Marks, Texans (if he plays, at LAC)\n\n22. Michael Carter, Cardinals (at CIN): Get Carter into lineups as the volume lead against a bad Bengals run defense.\n\n23. Kenneth Gainwell, Steelers (at CLE): Gainwell is living up to his last name game and the Steelers should lean plenty on the backs with no DK Metcalf.\n\n24. Kenneth Walker III and 25. Zach Charbonnet, Seahawks (at CAR): The Panthers are still weak against the run and this duo should be busy for a run-heavy team.\n\n26. Tyrone Tracy Jr., Giants (at LV): Tracy should be busy as the Giants go back to another great matchup for run and pass.\n\n27. Rhamondre Stevenson, Patriots (at NYJ): He's an even better smash play if Henderson can't go but he still have some good cleanup FLEX appeal.\n\n28. Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Commanders (vs. DAL): \"Bill\" should find the end zone and get like 50 yards with it.\n\nJaylen Warren, Steelers (at CLE, $6,600 on DraftKings, $7,400 on FanDuel): Warren is on a heater again in a lead role and the Browns are wilting against the run late.\n\nTony Pollard, Titans (vs. NO, $5,500 on DraftKings, $6,100 on FanDuel): Pollard is coming alive with Cam Ward providing some real offensive flash and it happens again here this time with a TD.\n\n29. Omarion Hampton, Chargers (vs. HOU): He was limited in a great matchup in a blowout last week so we're down on his expectations against the much better defense from Texas.\n\n30. RJ Harvey, Broncos (at KC): The Chiefs contained him well the first time and he won't get that TD to deliver as a RB2.\n\n31. Rico Dowdle, Panthers (vs. SEA): You can't trust the situational split in a bad matchup.\n\n32. David Montgomery, Lions (at MIN): The Vikings have been tough vs. the inside run and the Lions went into the tank on the ground.\n\n33. Kyle Monangai, Bears (at SF): The Niners are still tough against the run so don't start two backs against them.\n\n34. Isiah Pacheco, Chiefs (vs. DEN): This also goes for Kareem Hunt as the running game will disappear in a negative game script.\n\n35. Jordan Mason, Vikings (vs. DET): The Vikings need to draft a true reliable feature back and they won't follow the Steelers' committee rushing success.\n\n👮 PROTECT YOUR BACKFIELD: RB handcuff rankings and depth charts\n\nJa'Marr Chase, Bengals (vs. ARI)\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks (at CAR)\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown, Lions (at MIN)\n\nMike Evans, Buccaneers (at MIA)\n\nGeorge Pickens, Cowboys (at WAS)\n\nMichael Wilson, Cardinals (at CIN)\n\nDavante Adams, Rams (if he returns. at ATL) Adams is doubtful for Week 17.\n\nStefon Diggs, Patriots (at NYJ)\n\nJakobi Meyers, Jaguars (at IND)\n\nJaylen Waddle, Dolphins (vs. TB)\n\nJameson Williams, Lions (at MIN)\n\nTerry McLaurin, Commanders (vs. DAL)\n\nLadd McConkey, Chargers (vs. HOU)\n\nJustin Jefferson, Vikings (vs. DET)\n\nTetairoa McMillan, Panthers (vs. SEA)\n\nJauan Jennings, 49ers (vs. CHI)\n\nCourtland Sutton, Broncos (at KC)\n\nBrian Thomas Jr., Jaguars (at IND)\n\nDeebo Samuel, Commanders (vs. DAL)\n\n27. DeVonta Smith, Eagles (at BUF): Take a shot on him because Hurts should downfield a few times.\n\n28. Zay Flowers, Ravens (vs. GB): He's actually been viable with either QB with more upside with the tight ends disappearing.\n\n29. Wan'Dale Robinson, Giants (at LV): He should find himself open often for a nice volume game on intermediate passes.\n\n30. Jayden Reed, Packers (vs. BAL): The Willis-Reed connection seems to be the best since the Knicks' heyday.\n\n31. Alec Pierce, Colts (vs. JAX): He seems like the guy again with Josh Downs being the No. 2 with the massive QB change.\n\n32. Rashee Rice, Chiefs (if he returns. vs. DEN): Let's see about clearing concussion protocol for Thursday night, but it's so hard to sit their best receiver regardless of the bad QB situation.\n\nChris Olave, Saints (at TEN, $7,200 on DraftKings, $8,100 on FanDuel): Olave has been feeling it with a chucking Shough of late and the Titans cannot cover him.\n\nStefon Diggs, Patriots (at NYJ, $5,800 on DraftKings, $6,500 on FanDuel): Diggs got going again last week in a pristine matchup with the Ravens and the Jets offer no resistance.\n\nJakobi Meyers, Jaguars (at IND, $5,300 on DraftKings, $6,800 on FanDuel): Meyers will be the key go-to guy and carve up the Colts with his sharp route-running often.\n\n33. Michael Pittman Jr., Colts (vs. JAX): Whether it's Riley Leonard or Philip Rivers, Pittman is being overlooked for other Indy receivers.\n\n34. Troy Franklin, Broncos (at KC): He has been a solid No. 2 but not feeling it here.\n\n35. Chris Godwin, Buccaneers (at MIA): Between Godwin, Emeka Egbuka and Jalen McMillan, it's hard to piecemeal another good play away from Evans.\n\n36. Quentin Johnston, Chargers (vs. HOU): The Texans' pass rush and coverage says no deep balls.\n\n37. Adonai Mitchell, Jets (vs. NE): We're out trying to force a Jets receiver this late.\n\n38. Khalil Shakir, Bills (vs. PHI): Cooper DeJean says de-no.\n\n↕️ Fantasy Rankings for Week 17\n\nTrey McBride, Cardinals (at CIN)\n\nBrock Bowers, Raiders (vs. NYG)\n\nGeorge Kittle, 49ers (if he plays, vs. CHI)\n\nJake Ferguson, Cowboys (at WAS)\n\nHarold Fannin Jr., Browns (vs. PIT)\n\n9. Theo Johnson, Giants (at LV): He's feeling it with Dart against easier pass defenses and this matchup in Vegas qualifies as such. Johnson has been ruled OUT due to illness.\n\n10. Brenton Strange, Jaguars (at IND): He came through with nice score in Denver and Indy stinks more vs. the tight end.\n\n11. Kyle Pitts, Falcons (vs. LAR): He cooled off a little with Cousins last week but still scored and has a nice floor on MNF.\n\n12. Dalton Schultz, Texans (at LAC): You can go there because he's been so locked in with C.J. Stroud.\n\n13. Colston Loveland, Bears (at SF): The 49ers do have some voids in this coverage minus Fred Warner and the wide receiver injuries help Loveland.\n\n14. Juwan Johnson, Saints (at TEN): You can deploy two tight ends from this team given he's more of the No. 2 wideout to boost Olave.\n\nTrey McBride, Cardinals (at CIN, $7,500 on DraftKings, $8,000 on FanDuel): McBride had a shocking 4 for 27 clunker to stop his dominant run against the Falcons but now the best young tight end overall gets the best matchup overall for tight ends in 2025. Take it and run.\n\n15. Darren Waller, Dolphins (vs. TB): He's too old for this with a rookie QB.\n\n16. Oronde Gadsden II, Chargers (vs. HOU): Can't really feel like extending much vs. this defense.\n\n17. Dallas Goedert, Eagles (at BUF): He's hot but the Bills are a classic tight end eraser.\n\n18. Dalton Kincaid, Bills (vs. PHI): It's tough to also use this position well on the Eagles.\n\n19. Mark Andrews and 20. Isaiah Likely, Ravens (at GB): It's really hard to know what happened here and to the entire offense with either QB.\n\n21. Colby Parkinson, Rams (at ATL): So much for expanding his role, they just involved more people without Adams last week.\n\n.🧰 NEW - FANTASY TOOLS: NFL Player Stats | NFL Transactions | NFL Depth Charts | Fantasy Injury Reports\n\nNew York Giants (at LV, $2,900 on DraftKings, $3,700 on FanDuel): The Giants have some good pass rushers and the Raiders have been given to teams of late and there can be some mistakes and sacks to go with Smith's volume production.\n\n🎙️LISTEN: Get more of Vinnie Iyer's weekly fantasy football analysis five days a week by subscribing to the Locked On Fantasy Football podcast.",

    "fullText": "Whether it was underdog heroics in World Cup qualifying, England winning Euro 2025, or United States President Donald Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino becoming best buds, international football played a big role in 2025 — and a men’s World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico is just 165 days away.\n\nIn the club game, there were some honest truths from managers, incredible free kicks, the rise of long throws, and shock wins.\n\nBut away from the pitch, we could not look back on 2025 without touching on a more serious and tragic note — the death of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva.\n\nHere, Nick Miller, Caoimhe O’Neill, Megan Feringa, Stuart James and Carl Anka review the year.\n\nJames: Wimbledon, 1988. You can’t snap opponents like Vinnie Jones did, but this long-throw obsession is wild.\n\nAnka: Twelve months of “Absolute Cinema” as the top level of the sport further transforms it into a content delivery machine, overshadowing everything else.\n\nO’Neill: Let it all work out. Let it all work out. Ousmane Ballon d’Or. \n\nFeringa: Blissfully chaotic at its best, pining for something lost at its worst. Also trigger alert: long throws.\n\nMiller: I don’t think I’ll remember much actual football, but I do remember being quite tired and my brain being hammered for most of the year.\n\nMiller: This choice is significantly influenced by the fact that I was there to see it happen, but Cape Verde qualifying for the World Cup. At the time, only Iceland had done it with a smaller population (Curacao have superseded them), but the unfiltered and uncomplicated joy in the stadium that day is something I’ll never forget.\n\nO’Neill: Sunderland making it back to the Premier League through the play-offs in the most majestic, last-gasp way. And then actually being a really good top-tier side. It was a long eight years out of the top flight, which included four weary seasons in League One. But Sunderland have bounced all the way back and then some.\n\nFeringa: All of us making it through the 2026 World Cup draw in one piece and with most of our sanity intact.\n\nJames: Crystal Palace beating Manchester City to win the FA Cup (the first major trophy in their 164-year history) was pretty special — huge credit to their manager Oliver Glasner and the players. But the most magical thing about that day by far was the reaction of the Palace supporters at the final whistle. People, young and old, sobbing in a mixture of disbelief and joy. It was genuinely heart-warming — football touching the soul.\n\nAnka: The Lionesses winning their second European Championship title. England entered the tournament in a transitional state, battled through tricky turbulence in three of their five matches, but still emerged victorious. In the 21st century, the tournament has been won either by Germany or a team managed by Sarina Wiegman. The Dutchwoman is a brilliant manager who is constantly asking us to reassess what we mean by “Good leadership”. She has excellent taste in music, too.\n\nMiller: Scott McTominay. One of football’s great glow-ups — from being a solid, arguably slightly boring, taken for granted 7/10 Manchester United midfielder, to title-winning, hard-partying, cigar-smoking, Pope-meeting, bicycle-kick-scoring, Serie A MVP.\n\nO’Neill: It is always Marta. This year, next year, forever. Oh, and Troy Parrott.\n\nFeringa: Any hero on the pitch is someone else’s villain. But Michelle Agyemang really wore that cape in Switzerland: 138 minutes, two goals, twice seizing England from the clutches of “reigning champions dumped out” headlines. To accomplish it while being just 19 years old and at her first major tournament with England was sensational, not to mention against a backdrop of racist abuse aimed at her team-mate Jess Carter.\n\nJames: Stephen Crean, the 61-year-old Nottingham Forest fan who courageously intervened during a mass stabbing on a train from Doncaster to London last month. Crean had been making his way home from Forest’s 2-2 draw against Manchester United at the City Ground when he was caught up in the train attack in Huntingdon, which led to a man being charged with 11 counts of attempted murder.\n\nForest fans gave Crean a rapturous ovation when he returned to the City Ground for their home game against Leeds United. “It meant the world to me. I could see people clapping, applauding and I just thank them so much,” he said. “I would have been happy with a few quid to go down the pub. I didn’t expect anything.”\n\nAnka: The two biggest games of McTominay’s 2025 saw him score bicycle kicks — one to help Napoli win a league title, the other to help secure Scotland’s qualification for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nI undervalued his talent at Manchester United, and I have spent the year happily eating humble pie while applauding his success.\n\nAlso, a quick word on Calvin Bassey — because I don’t think there’s a centre-back on the planet who is having more fun in the men’s game. The Fulham and Nigeria defender had good moments in 2025 as well as bad ones, but he’s always found a way to crack a smile, cheer up his team-mates and remind us all that football is meant to be a laugh.\n\n“That ball has gone to AFCON before us!” 🤣 pic.twitter.com/emg89MR4nz\n\n— Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) December 15, 2025\n\nMiller: It won’t do to overcomplicate these things, so it’s a toss-up between two.\n\nEither Gianni Infantino, who has seemingly spent the year sleeping in a little bed in the Oval Office, like a particularly dutiful dog, hopping up now and then to hand Donald Trump something shiny.\n\nOr Jim Ratcliffe, for… well, claiming to understand the needs of the fans while jacking up ticket prices, making hundreds redundant while squandering millions himself, his undisguised contempt for Manchester United Women — take your pick really.\n\nFeringa: A toss-up between whoever signed off on Sky Sports’ Halo and Joey Barton.\n\nJames: Infantino. Where to start? The farce of the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize. Where to end? The absolute scandal of ticket prices at the 2026 World Cup. And there’s plenty in between, too.\n\nAnka: If a series of ghosts had visited Sir Jim Ratcliffe over the cold Christmas nights, it would do us all the world of good.\n\nMiller: Troy Parrott’s miracle hat-trick against Hungary. For not one minute did I think that the Republic of Ireland were going to come back and win that game, but when they did, my word: I can’t remember the last time I so enjoyed a moment for a team with whom I have no emotional connection.\n\nO’Neill: The fallout after Mary Earps released her book or Arsenal Women winning the Champions League. And not forgetting Burna Boy and Sarina Wiegman linking up on stage at England’s Euro 2025 victory parade. That was iconic.\n\nFeringa: Gotham’s victory in the NWSL Championship. Winning it two seasons ago as the No 6 seed — a league-record low — was one thing. But lifting the trophy again two years on? This time as the No 8 seed? That’s silly script stuff that no one believes in until it happens.\n\nJames: Well, I certainly didn’t expect Chelsea to turn over Paris-Saint Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final in New Jersey in July. The way Liverpool’s 2025-26 season has unravelled, including Mohamed Salah’s outburst, was another big surprise. And who could have predicted that Sunderland would not just return to the Premier League but make a real splash. From a personal perspective, Snoop Dogg coming on board at Swansea City as a minority owner was a surreal moment. If only he could play right-back.\n\nAnka: Ajax letting the 2024-25 Dutch league title slip through their fingers. They were nine points clear of PSV in mid-April before a four-game winless run allowed their rivals to snatch the Eredivisie trophy on the last day of the season.\n\nMiller: Chloe Kelly scoring the winning penalty for England at Euro 2025. Even though she had missed a penalty a few days earlier (before tucking in the rebound), there was absolutely no chance she was missing that one. She seems to enjoy those moments of crushing pressure: she is, in the nicest possible way, a freak.\n\nO’Neill: Robbie Williams singing a duet with Nicole Scherzinger at the World Cup draw. Pretty sure I predicted that a year ago…\n\nFeringa: England winning Euro 2025. I really don’t know why everyone kept panicking. You don’t come back from the dead that many times and not win the whole lot. Also, Chloe Kelly is kind of inevitable at this point.\n\nJames: Ange Postecoglou and Nottingham Forest being a brief and unhappy marriage. It was, quite simply, never going to work at the City Ground, which makes you wonder why on earth Evangelos Marinakis, Forest’s owner, and Postecoglou signed up for the 39-day eight-game farce that followed.\n\nAnka: Chelsea winning the Conference League, and I mean that as a compliment. Chelsea are at their most compelling when they turn up and snatch the footballing dreams away from others (ask Bayern Munich fans about 2012), and they did so brilliantly in 2025.\n\nMiller:  Cristiano Ronaldo being let off his three-game suspension for a red card, thus opening the door for him to play in the first two games of the World Cup.\n\nO’Neill: Not letting Robbie Williams sing Angels at the World Cup draw.\n\nFeringa: The decision to simultaneously broadcast most of the Women’s Super League matches for the 2025-26 season at 12pm local time (and then 11.55am).\n\nJames: Steve Parish would like to answer this question. Back in July, the Crystal Palace chairman said that UEFA’s decision to remove his Premier League team from the Europa League, for breaching multi-club ownership rules, is “the biggest injustice in the history of football”.\n\nUEFA’s judgement was harsh but I wouldn’t go that far.\n\nAnyway, with my football pyramid hat on, I’ll always struggle with the idea that being runners-up in the National League, which is the gateway to the Football League, gets you nothing other than a play-off spot. Last season, York City finished 23 points above Oldham after 46 matches. But it was Oldham who won promotion.\n\nYeah, I know — everyone knows the rules at the start of the season. But still.\n\nAnka: The Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final in July saw Nigeria battle from a 2-0 deficit to defeat Morocco 3-2. However, they scored their first goal after the VAR decided Moroccan defender Nouhaila Benzina handled the ball inside the box, and before the VAR later overturned a penalty that was awarded to Morocco after they believed a possible handball from Nigeria’s Oluwatosin Demehin was accidental. The Confederation of African Football would later receive a formal complaint from Morocco’s federation, calling the match decisions “refereeing injustices”.\n\nMiller: Not the best from a technical point of view, but by a distance my moment of the year was James Tarkowski’s stoppage-time equaliser in the final men’s Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, followed as it was by some fabulously undignified scenes from the Liverpool contingent and then a glorious, life-affirming singalong to I Guess That’s Why They Call It The Blues by the Everton fans that simply did not want to leave.\n\nThe latest in a long line of Goodison Park heroes, James Tarkowski 🎬 pic.twitter.com/31v3dCZfQH\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) February 15, 2025\n\nO’Neill: I wasn’t there to watch it live but it has to be the final Liverpool goal from the late, great and dearly missed Diogo Jota.\n\nIt came against Everton in the Merseyside derby at Anfield in April and proved to be the winner. It was so Jota. Off the bench and on to come up with the goods for Liverpool just when they needed him to. A weaving move and a wonderful finish at the Kop end.\n\nFeringa: I was in the Spanish end for their Euro 2025 semi-final against Germany when Aitana Bonmati scored the winning goal in the dying moments of extra time. The celebrations were visceral.\n\nAitana's turn for the goal 🥵 #WEURO2025 pic.twitter.com/WbwTRCbyfJ\n\n— UEFA Women's EURO (@WEURO2025) July 23, 2025\n\nClose second: Jack Grealish’s first for Everton against Crystal Palace. It was pretty grubby. But the limbs. I was convinced I’d be tumbling down the Hill Dickinson Stadium stands and taking at least four with me.\n\nJames: Paris Saint-Germain’s third goal in the Champions League final against Inter was glorious and felt almost symbolic in terms of how it represented their team, their way of playing, and their coach, Luis Enrique. Vitinha was effortlessly weaving beautiful patterns inside his own half before driving forward with the ball, Ousmane Dembele’s backheel was exquisite and then Desire Doue applied the coup de grace. Magnificent.\n\nThe results are in for the best play of the year!\n\nThe winner is… @PSG_inside, with a stunning goal by Désiré Doué in the @UEFA @ChampionsLeague final!\n\nThank you for voting, the fun doesn’t stop here — more games and surprises are coming soon on https://t.co/HPYRKgym8v. Stay… pic.twitter.com/4SVAEDoPZg\n\n— Ballon d'Or (@ballondor) September 26, 2025\n\nJosh Tymon’s volley, for Snoop’s Swansea against Oxford United, deserves a mention too. Postage stamp.\n\nAnka: I prefer my Goal of the Month contenders to be long-range pingers rather than well-coordinated team goals so…\n\nIn real life? Amad’s edge-of-the-box volley to rescue a 2-2 draw for Manchester United against Nottingham Forest at the start of November. Bonus points for how Matthijs de Ligt dips his neck as it flies past him, as he rightfully understands the strike would have taken his head off.\n\nOutrageous technique from Amad 😱 pic.twitter.com/gmZaBTkG37\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) November 1, 2025\n\nWatching live on the telly? Declan Rice’s perfect free kick against Real Madrid. His continual growth and improvement since the 2019-20 season are remarkable.\n\nMiller: “To be really honest, every time we have a defeat like that, I’m going to be like that. I’m going to say sometimes I hate my players and sometimes I love my players. Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years.”\n\nIt’s hard not to love Ruben Amorim, speaking here after Manchester United lost to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup… while at the same time desperately wanting to give him a hug and tell him to just stop being so honest.\n\nO’Neill: I joined Goal Diggers FC on their march to Wembley in May after the Football Association announced a ban on transgender women from women’s football. One of the people I met was Sammy Rees.\n\n“I spent some time playing men’s football. But it really wasn’t my bag. I felt very uncomfortable and it was not the nicest environment. Then I joined Goal Diggers and I’ve never looked back. It’s changed my life completely. These people have such open hearts. Since coming out, football has been my escape. We (trans people) wake up every day to more disgusting news about us: people vilifying us, people questioning our identity and our existence.\n\n“Football means that for two or three hours a week, I can switch my brain off. I can have a moment where I don’t care about the news. It’s my escape, and the fact that it’s trying to be taken away from us is not fair.”\n\nFeringa: “Sometimes they kill off the main character.”\n\nAnge Postecoglou doled out some dimes during his Tottenham Hotspur tenure, but this, after overseeing the Europa League final triumph against Manchester United, was very prescient.\n\nJames: “It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus.”\n\nSurely Salah’s post-match bombshell at Leeds has to go straight in at No 1 in this category? Elite players just don’t say things like that.\n\nAs for No 2, I’ll go for Amorim’s assessment of his Manchester United team back in January.\n\n“We are the worst team, maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you (reporters) want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and change that. Here you go: your headlines.”\n\nIf only more managers showed that level of consideration to journalists.\n\nAnka: Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy had a bumpy start to life in Scotland.\n\n“People might think I’m an idealist as a person but not at all. I know exactly who I am and exactly where I want to go. And I know at this moment, yeah, my a** is burning! But stay strong and do what you need to do to be better.”\n\nMiller: Manchester United are going to be actively good — not just “good in comparison to the dreck they’ve served up before”. Actively good. I can feel it.\n\nO’Neill: Liverpool do not reclaim their Premier League title but win the Champions League instead. The Republic of Ireland qualify for the World Cup and win their opening match. Tranmere Rovers somehow make the League Two play-offs and are promoted to League One. What do you mean, ‘It’s just me and John Aldridge manifesting all this’?\n\nFeringa: Craig Bellamy will get Wales to the World Cup. Less prediction, more a burning prayer.\n\nJames: Donald Trump will lift the World Cup before the winning captain/Harry Kane* has the chance to do the same at MetLife Stadium on July 19.\n\nAnka: Noni Madueke will finally receive his Club World Cup winners’ medal.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, Everton, Nottingham Forest, England, Scotland, Republic of Ireland, SSC Napoli, Premier League, Champions League, International Football, Serie A, Championship, Women's Soccer, FIFA Men's World Cup, League One, League Two, National League\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "description": "Cam Thomas is finally back on the Brooklyn Nets roster, and he immediately showed why he is one of the most impressive scorers in the league.",
    "fullText": "Day'Ron Sharpe praises Cam Thomas' elite scoring in his Brooklyn Nets return originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets have quietly been one of the NBA's best teams in December. They have a 7-3 record in the month, which is an impressive tally for a team that is 13th in the Eastern Conference standings. Before December, they had a 3-16 record, so reaching a 10-19 tally after that horrible start is impressive work.\n\nNets head coach Jordi Fernandez has done a magnificent job leading this team to success. Michael Porter Jr. has been superb as the star player, especially with the absence of Cam Thomas. Against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Thomas finally made his return, and he made sure to stamp his comeback with a good game.\n\nAfter 20 games on the sidelines, Thomas is finally back on the active roster. He was dealing with a hamstring strain, so he needed some time to fully recover, considering it is a lower-body injury.\n\nIn his return against the Timberwolves, Thomas looked lively. He caught fire in his return, as he scored 30 points, grabbed three rebounds, and dished out four assists. Considering he only played 20 minutes, that was an amazing performance from Thomas.\n\nMore: Michael Porter Jr. is lighting it up in the month of December\n\nAfter the game, the praise for Thomas was well-deserved, as he proved that he can continue emerging as one of the best scorers. He did so on a minute restriction, and he came off the bench. Since they were playing against the Timberwolves, this was an even more impressive result for Brooklyn.\n\n\"It was great to see him on the court tonight. He brings elite scoring at all three levels that we need as a team. I already knew what he was going to do, I've seen it every day since I got here, we came in together. It felt good having him on the court with us tonight,\" Day'Ron Sharpe said after the big win against Minnesota.\n\n\"We got these two elite scorers in Mike and CT, and we continue to play defense that we've been doing, the sky is the limit.\"\n\nMoving forward, Fernandez and the Nets front office have a good foundation. Porter is involved in trade talks as one of the most enticing players in the league. They could pull the trigger on a trade and get back valuable assets. However, it might be worth it to at least consider sticking with the same roster.\n\nThey have done well in December, and if they can maintain this form throughout the season, Sharpe is correct with his assessment of the Nets' potential. It will be difficult to ignore the trade talks for Porter, but the Nets have options that they did not have before.\n\nProposed trade sees Nets' Michael Porter Jr. land with Warriors\n\nNets get good Cam Thomas injury update ahead of Timberwolves matchup\n\nMichael Porter Jr. praises Egor Demin after second career 20-point game\n\nLakers' JJ Redick hints at possible lineup change\n\nSuns head coach Jordan Ott reacts to the Jose Alvarado and Mark Williams altercation",

    "description": "Packers QB Malik Willis produced over 300 total yards and scored three TDs before exiting Sunday's loss to the Ravens.",
    "fullText": "It came in a losing effort, but Green Bay Packers backup quarterback Malik Willis shined on Saturday night against the Baltimore Ravens before exiting in the fourth quarter with an injury.\n\nIn his first start of the 2025 season, Willis completed his first 11 passes and finished 18 of 21 passing for 288 yards and a touchdown, and he rushed for 60 yards and two more scores. Willis got the Packers within three points at 27-24 in the second half and was driving to cut into the Ravens' 10-point lead in the fourth quarter when he aggravated a right shoulder injury and exited the game.\n\nPackers coach Matt LaFleur said Willis, who went back to the locker room but eventually returned to the sideline, could have played late had the game still been within reach. Willis injured his throwing shoulder last Saturday in Chicago, and he also missed practice reps this week while battling an illness.\n\nWillis still finished with 348 total yards despite playing only 7.5 drives.\n\n\"He was dialed in,\" LaFleur said.\n\nWillis averaged 13.7 yards per attempt and hit four different receivers for completions of at least 30 yards. He also scored rushing touchdowns of 22 yards and 11 yards, and his dazzling 12-yard run converted 3rd-and-9 on a scoring drive.\n\nHighlights from Willis' performance against the Ravens:\n\n\"He made play after play after play out there. He was one of the few brights spots on the night,\" LaFleur said.\n\nAfter Willis exited, backup Clayton Tune threw an interception, and the Ravens eventually extended the lead to 41-24 late. With the game out of reach, Willis stayed out and Tune finished the contest.\n\nWillis has impressed during every opportunity to play for LaFleur and the Packers over the last two seasons. A 2022 third-round pick, Willis will be an unrestricted free agent when his rookie deal expires in March.\n\n\"I think it's a credit to him and the amount of work he's put in and the type of player he is. He's shown everybody who he is and what he can be,\" LaFleur said. \"So I thought he did a lot of great things tonight.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: Packers QB Malik Willis shines vs. Ravens before exiting with injury",

    "fullText": "Is Joel Embiid playing today vs. Thunder? Final status for 76ers star originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers will look to stop a two-game skid when they travel to Oklahoma City to take on the Thunder on Sunday afternoon.\n\nUnfortunately for the Sixers, beating the defending-champion Thunder is easier said than done, as Oklahoma City has lost just five times total this season, with three of those losses coming against the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nMaking matters even more difficult for the Sixers will be the fact that they’ll be without star center Joel Embiid, who has been ruled out of the game due to a right ankle sprain and right knee injury management.\n\nEmbiid missing time is nothing new for the Sixers this season, as the big man has appeared in just 13 games on the current campaign. In those appearances Embiid has averaged 21.8 points, 6.5 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.3 blocks in 27.0 minutes per performance.\n\nMore Philadelphia 76ers news: Dwyane Wade embraces comparisons to young 76ers star\n\nThe former league MVP being out on the floor hasn't necessarily translated to winning for the Sixers, either. The Sixers are 0-4 in games that Embiid, Tyrese Maxey and Paul George have played in together. That's obviously a small sample size, but it's still a concerning stat nonetheless.\n\nOn the season, the Sixers are 16-13, which is good for sixth in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\nThe game in Oklahoma City is the second of a five-game road trip for Philadelphia that also includes stops in Memphis, Dallas and New York. Embiid's status for the remaining games on the road trip is yet to be determined.",

    "fullText": "OG Anunoby didn’t have his best offensive showing on Saturday, but he was able to deliver on both ends of the court when the Knicks needed him the most.\n\nAnunoby was tremendous down the stretch as Atlanta staged a late-game comeback.\n\nAfter he committed a goaltending violation to give the Hawks the lead with just 50 seconds remaining, the forward came down with a huge offensive rebound after Jalen Brunson missed the potential go-ahead bucket.\n\nHe took contact but battled for the lay-in, then completed the and-one to put the Knicks back in front.\n\nAnunoby then locked up Trae Young coming out of a timeout on the other end, and he came up with a massive steal, and was sent right back to the line with just seven seconds remaining on the clock.\n\nHe, again, knocked them down easily to push the lead to three.\n\nMike Brown opted not to foul coming out of the timeout, but luckily things worked out, and it was Anunoby who reeled in the rebound on Nickeil Alexander-Walker’s missed three attempt to seal the victory.\n\nThe forward chipped in nine of his 15 points and five rebounds in the back-and-forth final frame.\n\nHe also contributed five assists, three steals, and a block over 38 minutes.\n\nWhile Anunoby struggled from the field (3-of-10), it was his perfect showing at the line (7-of-7) and stellar defense on Young and Jalen Johnson that made the difference.\n\nBrown feels that type of play on a nightly basis could make the 28-year-old a potential All-Star.\n\n“His size, his range, his strength, his athleticism, his feel,” the head coach said. “He can do so much out there, he just has to impose his will on the game every single play, and when he does there’s nothing he can’t do.\n\n“He didn’t shoot the ball well tonight, but he had a double-double, and to me that’s more than attainable by him on a night in and night out basis if he imposes his will on the game like he did tonight -- down the clutch he was awesome for us.”",

    "description": "Giannis Antetokounmpo wanted to set a tone and create an identity for his Bucks team with a last-second dunk. The Chicago Bulls took exception.",
    "fullText": "CHICAGO – Giannis Antetokounmpo punctuated his return to the court with a ferocious, open court windmill dunk with 1.9 seconds left in a 112-103 Milwaukee Bucks victory over the Chicago Bulls on Dec. 27 at the United Center, an action that immediately caught the ire of Chicago center Nikola Vučević and guard Coby White.\n\nThe pair immediately went to Antetokounmpo and began talking to him, and shortly after the buzzer sounded both teams, coaches and security personnel were on the court to prevent some pushing and shoving from escalating further.\n\nVučević, a 15-year veteran and former all-star, said after the game he wanted to know why Antetokounmpo would break an unwritten rule in a game that was over, which is something White said he also wanted to know because they had never seen Antetokounmpo perform such a theatric late in a clear victory.\n\nThe Bulls players said Antetokounmpo didn’t say anything to them, but in the visiting locker room afterward the Bucks star said the moment was largely symbolic for his struggling team.\n\nWhen asked why he completed the dunk, Antetokounmpo had a question in response.\n\n“What, we 11th in the East? Are we 11th in the East or 12th? Eleventh? We just gotta keep finding our identity,” he said matter-of-factly.\n\n“And if that’s to get a little bit of, you know, scrappy at the end, so be it. Like, we’re not the champs. Why should we have like, play the clock out and have respect and fair play? We’re fighting for our lives right now. This is real talk. I’ve been 13 years in the league. If we keep on losing brother it’s probably half of the team not gonna be here. We’re not going to make the playoffs (in 11th). Like, I really don’t care.\n\n“At the end of the day, I just want to be available and healthy and help my team win and if that’s what has to happen for them to; for everybody to wake up and understand we’re fighting for our lives and we gotta get our hands dirty, so be it.”\n\nSpeaking at roughly the same time in the other locker room, the Bulls players were left to guess at the intent.\n\n“I ain’t never really seen him do it either,” White said. “So I don’t really know. I guess he got out of character for a moment.”\n\nAs for his teammates, naturally they rallied around Antetokounmpo much like they did on the court.\n\n“He set the tone, so I’m not mad at it at all,” guard Ryan Rollins said with a grin. “Then I love even after the fact too when everybody tried to press him our whole team came out and backed up Giannis. So, I love it, man.”\n\nBobby Portis Jr., a former Bull who often is cheered upon his return to the United Center, was one of the more heated Bucks players and was booed roundly as he walked off the court.\n\n“I like a little confrontation,” he said with a grin. “You know I like a little confrontation. So, we’re not shying away from it. I think he said he wants to be a villain, so I guess I’m right there with him. We all right there with him. Follow his lead, man. We just here to get better each and every day and just stack wins. Stack confidence, stack good habits, and like I said when you look up you’ll be .500 and you go from there.”\n\nVučević maintained that he didn’t care for the fact that Antetokounmpo didn’t dribble out the clock, but he then used a bit of humor to perhaps explain the action.\n\n“Usually when the game is kind of over, with a couple seconds you just dribble the ball out,” he said. “I assume Giannis was mad at that report that came out that the Bulls didn’t want to trade for him so just wanted to prove a point and that was that.”\n\nIt was a deadpan answer from the 35-year-old, but back in the Bucks locker room Antetokounmpo was asked again about his happiness with the only team he’s played for following a rough start.\n\nIt was his first postgame media availability since Nov. 29. He skipped an opportunity in Washington D.C. on Dec. 1 and then was injured on Dec. 3. He spoke on Dec. 18 for an update on his calf strain, but also addressed multiple reports that he and his representation had spoken with the Bucks front office about his immediate and long-term future with the team.\n\n“I’m here,” he said in Chicago. “I’m here. Don’t ask me that question. It’s disrespectful toward myself and my teammate. I wear that jersey every single day. Disrespectful towards the organization, my coaching staff, myself and all the people that work out hard for me to come out here and say I don’t want to be here. Don’t ask me that question. I’m here.\n\n\"I’m putting on the jersey. And as long as I’m here I’m going to give everything I have, even if in the last second of the game.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Tensions rise after Giannis' ferocious windmill dunk at end of game",

    "fullText": "On Christmas Day, the Green Bay Packers clinched a spot in the NFC playoff field via the Detroit Lions' loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Two days later, the Packers suffered a blowout loss to the Baltimore Ravens at Lambeau Field and are now locked into the No. 7 seed in the NFC.\n\nThe 41-24 loss to the Ravens clinched the NFC North title for the Chicago Bears, who will host at least one playoff game at Soldier Field. The Bears are the favorite to become the No. 2 seed, which would set up a third game between the Packers and Bears in the NFC Wild Card Round.\n\nWhile the Bears have the best chance to be the No. 2 seed, the Packers could also play the Los Angeles Rams, Seattle Seahawks, San Francisco 49ers or Philadelphia Eagles to open the postseason based on the results of the final two weeks.\n\nThe Packers entered Saturday night with a chance to stay alive in the NFC North race. But Matt LaFleur's team ended up allowing over 300 rushing yards and were dominated by the Ravens from start to finish on Saturday night at Lambeau Field, giving the Bears the one result needed to clinch the division title.\n\nThe Packers will be the No. 7 seed in the NFC playoffs for the third consecutive season. In 2023, the Packers shocked the second-seeded Dallas Cowboys, becoming the first No. 7 seed to win a playoff game. Last season, the Packers lost 22-10 to the Philadelphia Eagles, the eventual Super Bowl champions.\n\nPer The Athletic's playoff simulator, here are the teams with the best chance to secure the No. 2 seed and host the Packers in the first round of the NFC playoffs:\n\nThe Packers and Bears split their season series, with Green Bay holding on for a 28-21 win at Lambeau Field in Week 14 and Chicago coming back from a 16-6 deficit in the fourth quarter to win 22-16 in overtime at Soldier Field in Week 16.\n\nThe Packers lost to the Eagles 10-7 at Lambeau Field in Week 10. Green Bay did not play the Rams, Seahawks or 49ers in 2025.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: Packers locked into No. 7 seed in NFC playoff field after loss to Ravens",

    "fullText": "Since arriving in France in January 2025, Valentín Barco’s career has finally begun to feel like it’s heading in the right direction. After a frustrating loan spell at Sevilla, his first taste of European football, the former Brighton man left the English south coast for the banks of the Rhine. Strasbourg took him on a loan-to-buy deal worth around €10m, a move that would soon prove a turning point.\n\nBarco’s story began far from Europe’s spotlight, in the youth team of local side Norberto de la Riestra, about 200 kilometres from Buenos Aires. He made the move to the capital, joining Boca Juniors’ academy in 2014, one of the biggest and most successful clubs in Argentine football. Although he started out in more attacking roles, he gradually transitioned to left-back, a switch that would define his career. His rise was rapid: in July 2021, at just 16, he made his senior debut for Boca, becoming their second-youngest debutant after ex-PSG and Roma midfielder Leandro Paredes.\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion, well known for unearthing young talent, moved quickly and signed him in January 2024 for around €10m. It seemed like the perfect next step. But breaking into the Premier League proved difficult. After a handful of appearances he was sent on loan to Sevilla for the 2024/25 season. Minutes were scarce, and the loan was cut short, leaving Barco considering his options.\n\nThe option that was chosen would be Strasbourg in February 2025. Under Liam Rosenior, Barco immediately looked at home, slotting into a young, energetic side and delivering the consistency he had struggled to find elsewhere. His performances helped Strasbourg finish seventh in Ligue 1, and by July the club had seen enough; they exercised their purchase option and tied him down until 2029 for a fee in the region of €10m.\n\nSince then, Barco has wasted no time proving the Strasbourg hierarchy right. Mostly deployed at left-back but occasionally stepping into midfield, he has offered a mix of aggression, creativity, and composure. His first goal came in a commanding 3–0 win over Auxerre, a match where he also provided an assist and dominated the left side. It remains his standout performance: full of smart recoveries, incisive passing, and relentless energy.\n\nNow, settled and thriving, Barco looks like a player reborn. After several years of searching for the right environment, Strasbourg seems to have given him exactly what he needed: trust, stability, and a stage to show just how good he can be. Still only aged 21, the sky is the limit for him if he continues to perform as well as he has done so far for the Alsatian team.\n\nBarco has quickly become one of the most watchable young fullbacks in Ligue 1. He is the kind of player who seems to operate in fast-forward while everyone else moves at normal speed. The numbers back up the eye test. Like many modern defenders in teams playing in UEFA competitions, the statistics show a player deeply involved in build-up play, completing more than 82% of his passes and posting medium and short-range completion figures comfortably above 86%. Those aren’t just safe sideways balls either; they reflect a defender who actively wants to progress attacks.\n\nWhat makes Barco stand out is the balance in his game. He’s as aggressive without the ball as he is with it. He has a busy defensive output for someone who also spends so much time driving forward. His success rate in duels, hovering around 62%, shows he doesn’t shy away from physical battles despite his relatively slight frame of 170cm.\n\nWhile the young Argentine has many strengths, he’s not without areas to improve. His relative inexperience at the top European level can sometimes show in positional awareness against strong or more savvy opposition. He occasionally gets caught out of place when pushing forward or tracking back too slowly. Physically, he isn’t the most imposing defender, winning an aerial duel every other game on average, putting him in the bottom quarter of left-backs in Europe’s top 5 divisions. Yet Barco manages these weaknesses with intelligence and effort: he reads the game proactively to anticipate danger, relies on his speed to recover, and uses smart positioning rather than brute force. Over time, these adjustments have allowed him to turn potential vulnerabilities into manageable aspects of his otherwise dynamic game.\n\nBarco’s time at Strasbourg already feels like the moment his career finally clicked into place; the point where raw talent started turning into something more polished and reliable. The exciting part is that he’s still only 21, with his best years comfortably ahead of him. What comes next will depend on how he handles this new phase of stability and regular football, something he didn’t always get in England or Spain.\n\nIf he keeps developing at this pace, it’s easy to imagine bigger clubs calling. His blend of energy, creativity and tactical awareness fits the direction top clubs are heading in, especially those who want fullbacks who can drift into midfield and dictate play. It doesn’t seem like it will be long before Champions League regulars start casting their eyes onto him, with high-quality, balanced left-backs in short supply.\n\nFor now, the focus is on building consistency and sharpening the parts of his game that already stand out. The sense around him is that the foundations are finally solid, and that the peak of his career isn’t just a distant prospect, but something he’s actively growing toward.",

    "fullText": "Score prediction: Sunderland 2 Leeds 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Brian Brobbey\n\nLeeds have been in good form recently, especially at home, but so have we – and we’ll be targeting this game as one from which we can get another three points to add to our already impressive total.\n\nDespite being without our AFCON bunch, we’ve still got a very strong team, and a raucous home crowd should see us preserve our unbeaten stadium of light record this season.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 2 Leeds 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Omar Alderete\n\nLeeds have been decent of late, so this probably is a poor time to play them from our perspective, but we are very solid at home, and the sell-out home crowd are now the 12th man. I witnessed many times back at Roker Park, which makes a hell of a difference.\n\nBrentford had to settle for a draw when Leeds visited them two weeks ago, but I think we will go one better and pinch this by the odd goal. Leeds’ form isn’t great on the road compared to how strong it is in general, which we hope will continue today.\n\nOmar is due a goal after several close changes, though both strikers will be keen to notch with the window about to open and our scoring streak far from ideal.\n\nA narrow win for us is the call for me, and Omar opening our account with a thundering header.\n\nA nice seven-point gap over the unwashed for the start of 2026, too. Beautiful.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 2 Leeds 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Granit Xhaka\n\nA classic fixture amongst all the festivities is just what we’re all looking for. We have plenty of history with Leeds, so it should be a fun match, as well as an opportunity to banish the “we finished miles ahead” of you rubbish, which is all but dispelled after our amazing first half of the season.\n\nI felt we coped well away at Brighton after our AFCON departures, looking the stronger side for the majority despite losing pivotal figures in Sadiki and Reinildo.\n\nLeeds are not as good a side as Brighton and also have the disadvantage of coming to the Fortress of Light, where we have really excelled.\n\nI think our position compared to our goals for/against will sum up this game. We don’t score as many as those in the top ten, but we are a steel trap defensively, and I think Leeds will struggle to find a way through that.\n\nCaptain Xhaka to lead us to our final win of the calendar against Leeds.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 1 Leeds 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Granit Xhaka\n\nOne more push before the new year.\n\nLeeds come into this full of confidence, scoring goals and looking like they’ve found some rhythm again. They’ll back themselves to cause problems, and we’ll definitely have to be on it from the first minute. But home is where we’ve been strongest, and the Stadium of Light has become a proper place to play again.\n\nWhat stands out with this side is how composed we are. We don’t lose our heads, we don’t give silly goals away, and we stay in games even when momentum swings. That’s going to matter against a team who like to attack in waves.\n\nI don’t see this being open or free-flowing. It feels like one of those games where space is limited, and chances are earned rather than gifted. If we stay patient and keep our discipline, frustration could start to build for them.\n\nWe won’t need much at the other end. A set piece or a loose ball on the edge of the box might be enough – and if it falls to Xhaka, you’d back him to make it count.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 1 Leeds 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Wilson Isidor\n\nAll I want for Christmas is a Sunderland home win.\n\nLeeds will be coming into this in a buoyant mood, given they’re unbeaten in four games, scoring eleven goals.\n\nTheir away form, however, is horrendous. One win from eight on the road, and that came against Wolves in September.\n\nUnbeaten at home vs awful away. In years gone by, we would all know what to expect.\n\nBut this team, this manager, isn’t like that. They’re made of far sterner stuff.\n\nI feel another defensive masterclass from our boys at the back, and us nicking a late goal to snatch all three points..\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 2 Leeds 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Brian Brobbey\n\nIn this, the most festive of times, I need to find solace in football after all of the food I’ve eaten has driven me delirious.\n\nAs it stands, I like the way Leeds play, and they’re not to be sniffed at when they visit on Sunday. Since they went two up top, or at least had someone up there alongside Calvert-Lewin, they’ve been capable of scoring every time they attack.\n\nObviously, big Dan Ballard will have something to say about it and will put in a performance akin to that of prime Jaap Stam.\n\nI think we’ll nick it, but I don’t think it’s as straightforward as I want it to be.\n\nGranit will have one of the best games he’s had for us in this, though. They leave huge gaps in the middle, and Sadiki would have been perfect for this one.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 1 Leeds 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Omar Alderete\n\nMatches around the Christmas period can often generate some peculiar results, so I’m hoping the Lads haven’t tucked into too many mince pies, or spent more than the one evening session at Ally Pally!\n\nLeeds have had a great December with 2 wins, 2 draws and 11 goals scored – a month that included games against Chelsea and Liverpool. Three of those games were at home, though, where they are particularly strong. With our home record and in front of a packed-out stadium, in good spirits for this festive fixture, I think we can edge a tight contest.\n\nI was encouraged by what I saw away at Brighton in our first look at the AFCON-less lineup, and I’m expecting us to once again keep things extremely tight. Goals aren’t coming easy to us, and I’m going for an outside bet as first goalscorer in Omar Alderete, likely from a set piece, and that will hopefully settle it.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 2 Leeds 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Big Dan Ballard\n\nLeeds have turned a corner of late, beating Chelsea and Palace and drawing with Liverpool and Brentford, scoring 11 goals in the process.\n\nOur defence needs to be on point for this one. Thankfully, we are in the top 6 of the clean sheet stats, seeing as we’ve only scored the same amount of goals as West Ham and Burnley.\n\nHowever, the above is just me padding out my bit and making it look like I’ve researched some stats.\n\nSunderland win 2-1 and sign off an amazing 2025 in style – I’m coming up for it, and I can’t wait.\n\nThe lads ground out a creditable draw against Brighton at The Amex before the visit of Santa, carrying on the points tick over which we need to secure our Premier League berth as soon as we can.\n\nOmar, Romaine and Dan Ballard all came close, but to be fair, if Brighton’s players could keep the ball down for the shots they created, several more saves would have been needed by Roefs too.\n\nA respectable draw with sort of a dominant half or so each meant for me the shared points was the right outcome.\n\nOnly three of the lads went for a draw, but we see our first 4 pointer for some time come in for Gary, accurately calling last shown on Match of the Day due to the 0-0, as it was.\n\nA point each for Martin and Will gives them a wee boost ahead of Leeds and the new year fixtures too.\n\nThe table approaches the end of 2025 with a very tight situation for all, barring our mate Gair.\n\n3 points separate top and 7th, with a gap then opened up down to Gair, who is yet to make double figures.\n\nWhen one of his outlandish predictions comes in, which it surely will one time soon, we could have a proper tight table top to bottom.\n\nJust a quick reminder of how we allocate points to our match-by-match predictions:\n\nCorrect outcome (but not correct score) = One point\n\nCorrect first Sunderland goalscorer = One point (no goalscorer is a valid call)\n\nPossible deductions for being lazy and not submitting on time = a two-point deduction.",

    "fullText": "We acquitted ourselves well at Brighton last time out, and with a big game against Leeds today the squad will be tested again. Chris Rigg was the surprise inclusion last weekend, and while he did OK I think his inclusion was more tactical than anything else and I’d be surprised to see him in the line up for a game where we’re going to need more attacking intent. Here’s how I think we’ll line up today.\n\nAnother clean sheet for our Dutch keeper last week – and another one today would be very welcome indeed!\n\nI think it’ll be the same again in defence, with Trai Hume deputising for Reinildo at left back. With Leeds playing a back five there is a chance we could match them up, but given we’ve not got a natural wing back available I think it’d be a unnecessary risk. Ballard and Alderete are two of the most physical centre backs in the league, and it’ll be a great battle against Calvert-Lewin, who is in good goalscoring form.\n\nI thought Geertruida did excellently against Brighton, and he’ll surely keep his place in midfield today alongside Xhaka and Le Fee. With Geertruida in it allows Xhaka to push on a bit further than usual, and he’ll be critically important today. With Leeds likely to play three at the back, there could be more room in midfield for Le Fee to exploit, and hopefully he can take advantage of that.\n\nIt’s going to be a physical game today, and Brian Brobbey is tailor made for such a contest. As well as his physicality, I think he looks our most dangerous potential scorer – he gets in good positions and we need to get the ball into him more. On the wings, Simon Adingra will likely keep his place in the team, but he could move over to the right to replace Rigg, with Romaine Mundle, who’s been the next in line off the bench in recent weeks getting a start on the left. With our numbers depleted by AFCON, I can’t see many other realistic options, unless we bring Mayenda in from the cold or push Isidor out wide, and I don’t see either of those things happening today.",

    "description": "The 2025 edition of AEW Worlds End was a pay-per-view filled with highs and lows, with the Wrestling Inc. team sharing thoughts on MJF's title win and more.",
    "fullText": "The third annual AEW Worlds End pay-per-view is over, with two title changes to close out the show. As is typical for AEW, it was a four-hour marathon designed by and for \"sickos,\" some of whom might write for this very outlet.\n\nWe weren't able to cover everything here, with outcomes like Kris Statlander's successful title defense left by the wayside. However, the internal reaction here at Wrestling Inc. to the two title changes were positive for one and quite the opposite for the other, and you're in the right place if you want to find out which was which.\n\nTo get into every single thing that took place at Worlds End, and there's a lot that took place, go ahead and check out our results page. Otherwise, prepare to discover what we loved and hated about the final AEW PPV of 2025.\n\nHave you ever seen such an electrifying start to an AEW pay-per-view?\n\nThat is high praise, especially when AEW is known for pulling out all the stops when it comes to their pay-per-view matches, but it's deserved for Jon Moxley and Kyle Fletcher. Moxley, the runner-up in the Continental Classic's Blue League, took on Fletcher, the winner of the Continental Classic's Gold League, in Classic semifinals at \"Worlds' End,\" and even though it was just the second match of the night, I found myself sitting at home wondering if I had just watched the main event. This match was everything that makes an AEW match great: incredible in-ring wrestling, grueling and harrowing-to-take spots, an incredibly engaged audience, and plenty of finisher kickouts.\n\nI have to admit, Moxley has not been my favorite AEW talent in 2025. He just seemed so untouchable for how mediocre some of his performances have been, aside from honorable mentions like his Texas Death Match against \"Hangman\" Adam Page. However, this match gave him some of his edge back. Where Moxley was once content with coasting by with the help of the Death Riders to retain his title (which he kept in the shadows for whatever reason), he now faced his opposition head on, with no fear and a chipped incisor to show for it. Not only did Moxley put on one of his best performances in 2025 against Page, but he somehow – without cutting any babyface promo or having any official babyface turn – managed to get the crowd chanting his name. He managed to turn face by sheer in-ring technique alone. Everybody knows that Moxley is a guaranteed entrant AEW's inevitable Hall of Fame, but Saturday's match just added to the mountain of evidence needed to make such a claim. What a match, Moxley.\n\nDon't sleep on Fletcher, however! I don't think Moxley could have had such a match with any other competitor. Fletcher is equal parts strength and agility, and his high-octane moveset complemented Moxley's hard-hitting, decapitating strikes perfectly. Moxley put on a character work masterclass, sure, but Fletcher brought the match itself to life. Moxley might have secured his place in the AEW Hall of Fame with this performance, but Fletcher made this match into an insanely high bar to clear for the rest of the evening, if not an early Match of the Night call entirely.\n\nMoxley and Fletcher's Continental Classic semifinal might have only been the second match of the night, but if you had told me that was the \"World's End\" main event, I might have believed you. It was just a damn good wrestling match, and you'd be hard-pressed to find one like it in either man's recent repertoire.\n\nI know there were quite a few factors keeping Darby Allin and Gabe Kidd from meeting in the AEW ring until tonight, including Allin's latest injury, the one that took him out of the Continental Classic, but this match still felt like too much, too late. To make things worse, if you weren't watching the holiday episodes of AEW over the last week (and if you were smart enough to avoid social media, as well), you were probably confused to see the card. It really did feel like it was thrown on there extremely last minute.\n\nSure, Allin and Kidd have gone back and forth over the second half of 2025, including as participants in the lights out steel cage match at AEW x NJPW Forbidden door, the time that Allin put Kidd in a body bag and drug him out of the arena with his truck on an episode of \"AEW Dynamite,\" and I believe most recently, when Kidd drug Allin out of the Blood & Guts match. I'm just not sure how many fans would remember it all, as there have been weeks and even months in between their interactions, and Kidd wasn't ever the main focus of Allin's ire, it was Jon Moxley.\n\nIf AEW was going to do this, it should have been as soon as they were able, though, that may very well have been at Worlds End. It also just feels kind of strange to have Allin and Kidd in this match, an extremely bloody bout for a normal singles match, at that, when Allin is seemingly done with the Death Riders. I know most all of the faction was busy with other things tonight, but you'd think at least one of them would be ringside for Kidd if he's still their mercenary.\n\nWhile blood doesn't necessarily bother me, I'm sure this match is once again going to spark plenty of discourse online. The one thing I don't exactly understand is the constant biting, as it seems like it should be a blatant disqualification. This was yet another match, which both major companies are guilty of, where way too many finishers were traded between the competitors. Toward the end of the match, Kidd hit a piledriver which didn't keep Allin down too long at all, as he was able to win with a roll-up, despite just being injured a few weeks ago.\n\nWhile I felt like this show flowed extremely well, after a few AEW pay-per-views that felt way too long, this is still one match that I could have done without. I feel like I dislike it even more because I really have no idea where AEW goes with either man, especially Allin.\n\nAEW Worlds End 2025 was a pay-per-view that despite being almost as long as every other AEW pay-per-view this year (outside of All In Texas), flowed a lot better and didn't feel like a marathon to get through. That is obviously down to pacing, but a big aspect of it is the variety on the show, and you can't get a more varied match than the Mixed Nuts Mayhem match between The Death Riders and The Timeless Conglomeration that Roderick Strong is still trying to find a way out of.\n\nIn between the hyper-intense Continental Classic and the high stakes title matches was this absolute party of a match that, if we're being honest, no one really had any expectations for. In fact, you would be forgiven in thinking that this match was advertised for the Zero Hour pre-show because of how random it was. However, this was a classic case of a match overdelivering to the most extreme extent, which ultimately gave the fans in the building and those watching around the world a refreshing break from the super serious wrestling that had taken place prior to it.\n\nIt would be very easy to just run through a list of things that happened and leave it at that, and believe me, a lot happened in this match. From Marina Shafir chopping her own husband, something that every married person in the world probably saw and went, \"Girl, I feel you on that one,\" to Orange Cassidy and Toni Storm tango dancing while also being able to fend off Wheeler Yuta and Daniel Garcia, to Claudio Castagnoli actually giving Toni the Giant Swing, this was a riot of a match that had everyone thoroughly entertained from start to finish,\n\nEveryone will say this is a match that wouldn't look out of place on a 2010s PWG show, and you'd be right. With that said, this match actually felt more to me like a house show match that had broken out of the live circuit and landed right in the middle of a pay-per-view by accident. The Death Riders hamming up their heelish antics for comedic effect against a bunch of beloved babyfaces who aren't taking themselves too seriously, with the babyfaces coming out on top. It's a match ripped straight out of the house show playbook and it was wonderful.\n\nIf AEW did house shows, this would be the kind of outlandish main event you would get in certain towns. Since they don't you get a match like this in the middle of a pay-per-view, which in turn helped the pay-per-view flow more smoothly. It was mixed, it was nuts, and it was a match. What more could you want?\n\nIt's a rough night for NJPW exports, isn't it?\n\nWhile AEW loves showcasing the talent it has acquired from its incredibly successful partnership with NJPW, tournament tycoon and NJPW darling Kazuchika Okada and current IWGP World Heavyweight Champion Konosuke Takeshita have stood out from the rest. Both men have been booked incredibly well on AEW programming: Okada's 647-day run with the AEW Continental Championship saw him go over household names like Claudio Castagnoli, Will Ospreay, Kenny Omega, and Swerve Strickland, while Takeshita racked up a record-breaking 13 points in this year's Continental Classic Blue League — four whole points ahead of other semifinalists Okada, Jon Moxley, and Kyle Fletcher. Okada and Takeshita have been some of the strongest booked talent in AEW this year, NJPW or not, and yet at \"World's End,\" it seems that the two could not end 2025 in such a satisfying manner.\n\nWe all knew that Takeshita was not going over when he stood across the ring from then-AEW Continental Champion Okada in Saturday's opener, but the manner in which he lost is almost unbecoming of both men, and that's even before we even get to the controversial finish. I don't claim to know every nook and cranny of Okada and Takeshita's match repertoire (even though I should: they're two amazing wrestlers), but I couldn't help but feel like Okada and Takeshita were off their game in Saturday's Continental Classic Semifinal match. Their strikes just didn't have the same bite. They moved slowly around each other, electing to clunk into the other man instead of steamrolling through him. There's no reason for them to be moving so carefully around each other. They are bitter rivals in a fierce struggle for the power-hungry Don Callis' attention. Why are they hitting each other so gently? To the finish: I understand what AEW might have been going for. I understand that, by forcing the great technician Okada to turn to Don Callis' screwdriver, Takeshita is simultaneously set up for face turn whilst being put over (like Okada can't beat him without weaponry). However, Okada turning to the screwdriver is just so unbecoming of him, that it makes Okada's subsequent loss even more embarrassing.\n\nOkada progressed to Continental Classic finals, where he squared off against one Moxley. I get that Moxley had an incredible match just moments prior, where he amazingly turned face by in-ring performance alone, but when Okada's main storyline surrounds tensions within the Don Callis Family, I don't see a whole lot of reason to suddenly put Moxley over. Moxley dethroning Okada for the Continental title shocked me, and if this is setting up for an International title loss for Okada...NJPW's alumni are in for a rough time.\n\nGoing into this event I had delusions of a Kyle Fletcher versus Kazuchika Okada Continental Classic final, the Death Riders sick of their leader's failings and turning on Jon Moxley much in the same way they had with Bryan Danielson. I was wrong and I don't really care because what happened instead turned out to be really, really good. Okada went through over Konosuke Takeshita, making use of a screwdriver we would later learn was intended for Fletcher to use against Moxley, and thus effectively screwed Fletcher out of screwing Moxley out of the win; screwdrivers aside, Moxley and Fletcher was immensely good, match of the year candidacy good.\n\nSo it was Moxley and Okada in the final, facing one another in singles action for the first time. This wasn't as good of a match as the one with Fletcher but maybe that's because the one with Fletcher had informed much of the story; Moxley had sustained damage to the knee, with a proven susceptibility in recent weeks to submissions, and thus Okada sought to target and punish that for the majority of the bout.\n\nMoxley was wrestling in a way more befitting his babyface character, overcoming Okada's dirty plays with his own – a low-blow for a low-blow, for example – but ultimately the emphasis was on his overcoming. When all was said and done, Moxley pinned Okada effectively clean in the middle of the ring – no interference, no asterisk, with every rule-break answered in kind – and become only the third-ever Continental Champion. All in all, Moxley wrestled around 43 minutes of action tonight, chipped a tooth in the first match, got dropped on his head a fair few times and still managed to become champion. If that wasn't enough to scream face turn, then he took to the microphone afterward to thank the crowd and all of the participants of the Continental Classic – he basically turned face, whether that is actually the case or not is yet to be seen.\n\nMoxley's story as champion is as interesting heading into the reign as it was unfolding during Worlds End. Claudio Castagnoli beat him in the league stage, and very well could have been the one standing in Moxley's position. Daniel Garcia was holding the title as if it was his own. There's just a lot of ground to cover that may not have been possible with Okada; he gets to proceed with his feud against Takeshita, and more than likely Fletcher, with the International Championship.\n\nThere was something to be enjoyed in every match and the way they fed into one another made for an altogether great show. Moxley is champion again and I love it.\n\nIn 2023, AEW was bogged down with the awful Devil storyline with MJF. At Worlds End of that year, Samoa Joe defeated MJF to become Men's World Champion. Two years later at the same pay-per-view, MJF pinned Joe to become a two-time World Champion. MJF had no business being in this match in the first place, but he continuously falls up and had a contract that he could cash in (mind you, the whole reason he joined the Hurt Syndicate was to get his Triple B back).\n\nJoe prematurely ended Hangman Page's title reign at Full Gear last month (with the help of HOOK & for what exactly?). He then lost his title in his second title defense. If this was his last reign as World Champion before retiring, it was a complete waste. MJF should've just beaten Hangman for the title tonight. It seems like they just wanted MJF to defeat Joe to get him back from two years ago. Most people have tried to forget The Devil storyline even happened, yet here we are being forced to remember it.\n\nThe last time MJF was champion, he held the title for 406 days. During that reign, he tried to avoid wrestling as much as possible and his whole personality was \"The Bidding War of 2024\", where he consistently referenced WWE. We already spent eight months with the title locked in a briefcase when Jon Moxley was champion. I really hope that we don't have a repeat of MJF's first reign. He's already got a title defense at Maximum Carnage against Bandido, where he'll make a stipulation to get his Dynamite Diamond Ring back and become more insufferable. More wrestling and less mic time is all I can really hope for with this reign (other than it not being another long reign). And for the love of wrestling goddesses, please build up new challengers for the title picture.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at the key questions going into the divisive Battle of the Sexes-style match between Aryna Sabalenka and Nick Kyrgios on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Love it or loathe it, the Battle of the Sexes-style event between Aryna Sabalenka and Nick Kyrgios has caused quite the stir.\n\nSabalenka, the women's world number one, faces 2022 Wimbledon finalist Kyrgios in an exhibition match on 28 December.\n\nThe event will be shown live on BBC One from 15:45 GMT.\n\nBBC Sport looks at the key questions going into the divisive match.\n\n'Battle of the Sexes' will not damage women's sport - Sabalenka\n\n'Mine was for social change, this is not' - King on Battle of the Sexes\n\nIf any women's player is going to beat Kyrgios, then you would expect it to be Sabalenka.\n\nThe 27-year-old Belarusian won four titles - including the US Open - and reached five other finals in a productive 2025 season.\n\nSabalenka has been one of the most effective servers this season, sitting in the top five for service games won, and has powerful groundstrokes.\n\nThe four-time major singles champion has the ability to hit through opponents, though she is still prone to being erratic from the baseline.\n\nOver the past season, where she won 59 of her 71 matches, Sabalenka has looked to introduce more variety into her game with drop-shots and coming forward to the net.\n\n\"I feel I will be more prepared than this guy,\" she told BBC Sport.\n\nThe exhibition will be the best of three sets, with a 10 point tie-breaker if it goes to a decider.\n\nAccording to organisers Evolve, data shows women players move about 9% slower on average than men, so the dimensions of Sabalenka's side of the court will be 9% smaller.\n\nEach player will only receive one serve in an attempt to restrict Kyrgios' power and speed advantage. He thinks that is the biggest leveller.\n\n\"You're taking my strength completely out of it,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Obviously she has a great serve herself, but from the back of the court things are a bit more even.\n\n\"The men's game is heavily reliant and dominated by first serve percentage and holding serve quite easy.\n\n\"So if you take that away the game becomes a bit more of a grind from the baseline and I think that slightly goes in her favour.\"\n\nSome see the match as harmless entertainment that will attract a newer, younger audience in the age of social media.\n\nOthers believe it is a misguided venture and, if Sabalenka loses, will create an opportunity for women's tennis to be belittled.\n\n\"I am not putting myself at any risk. We're there to have fun and bring great tennis. Whoever wins, wins,\" she said.\n\n\"It's so obvious that the man is biologically stronger than the woman, but it's not about that.\n\n\"This event is only going to help bring women's tennis to a higher level.\"\n\nCritics have questioned Kyrgios' suitability as the male protagonist, given he admitted assaulting an ex-girlfriend in 2021 and has made a series of comments which have been considered misogynistic.\n\nKyrgios says he has not given \"one thought\" about the event potentially fuelling criticism of women's sport, and insists he is not concerned about losing.\n\n\"I'm never worried. I know how I've responded with things in my life,\" the former world number 13 said.\n\n\"This is all a bonus. I've lost tennis matches before, so it's not really a big deal.\"\n\nWith his booming first serve, easy power from the baseline and creative shot-making, Kyrgios' talent has never been in doubt.\n\nHis temperament has been questioned - as has his fitness in recent years.\n\nKyrgios missed most of the 2023 season and the entire 2024 campaign with a wrist injury that the Australian's surgeon thought would end his career.\n\nThe 30-year-old returned to action at January's Australian Open but has not played an ATP Tour singles match since March because of a knee injury.\n\n\"In the past year I've had to have some serious conversations with myself about how much I want to dedicate myself,\" he said.\n\n\"I was asking myself if I really wanted to put myself in a pressure cooker – every time I go out there is a lot of expectation.\n\n\"But I feel great. Now I'm in my 30s, I have to start looking after my body a little better.\n\n\"I know if I can play best of three with a tie-break that's a long way from where I was a year and a half ago.\"\n\nCynics have wondered exactly what the point of the event is.\n\nSabalenka and Kyrgios insist it is to attract a different audience to the sport, with an emphasis on fun, entertainment and celebrity culture.\n\n\"There are question marks - and that scares people,\" Kyrgios said.\n\n\"For us, it is exciting and gives us that thrill. I think events like this need to happen \n\nThe event, being held at the 17,000-seater Coca-Cola Arena, is on track to be sold out.\n\nTickets range from about £100 in the upper tier stands to upwards of £600 on courtside benches.\n\n\"Sport and entertainment is the same thing – people come to watch sport for the unknown, that's why it is not played on paper,\" Kyrgios said.\n\n\"Whether it's good or bad, they want to remember something they are going to see in everyday life.\"\n\nBillie Jean King, who beat Bobby Riggs in the second Battle of the Sexes match in 1973, hopes it will be a \"great\" match but says it is \"not the same\" as her era-defining event.\n\nKing's victory over former Wimbledon champion Riggs - a 55-year-old self-proclaimed chauvinist - was a landmark moment in the fight for gender equality and laid the path for equal pay at the top of the game.\n\n\"Ours was about social change; culturally, where we were in 1973. This one is not,\" King told BBC Sport.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

The X-rays didn’t reveal any structural damage, which is good news.\n\nOf course it’s easy to say it’s a minor injury when it’s not your ankle.\n\nThe worst part of it is that Knueppel has been an absolute revelation for Charlotte. No one, not even most Duke fans, expected him to play this well this early in his career. But he’s been rock-solid and has emerged as the player the Hornets are most likely to build around.

    "fullText": "Three weeks is a short amount of time. It’s a tiny amount of time when it’s the total time you spend employed at a job. And it happens to be the exact amount of time I spent at my most recent job.\n\nApril 2025. A post about a new app landed on my Bluesky via repost from a friend. The app was for something that I’m very into. I used it for a few days. While it was in early stages, it was fun and promising. I immediately thought; “This is something I would love to help build.” After a quick search I saw it was a single person startup. Too early for them to be growing a team, but that would come later. I emailed the founder to tell them how much I was liking the app, and a general intro to plant the seed for a conversation to grow in the future.\n\nAt the time I was working at Summer. I started there in November 2023. Things were going well. We were building good product, customer conversations were moving, and we all worked well together as a team. I wasn’t looking to make any moves. My plan was to keep helping build the product and company. But, that exciting new app and company, that seemed like it would be a perfect fit for me, was quietly in the back of my mind.\n\nThen, in June 2025, I saw the company put up their first job posts. There were two. One was for a role that was not for me. The other was for a role that was exactly me. I responded to the email thread I had with the founder and told them so and asked if they wanted to meet to talk it through. They did. So we did.\n\nMy first day at the company was July 21st, 2025. Within 48 hours I was fairly certain I’d made a mistake. I tried to chalk it up to normal discomfort around starting something new. Told myself to give it time. Two weeks went by. It was not only clear that it wasn’t normal new job jitters, it was crystal clear that I’d made a mistake. Because I was the first hire, it was critical that the founder and I be able to work well together. We did not. This wasn’t gonna work. My last day was August 11th, 2025.\n\nI’ve left out specifics because they’re really not interesting or important to this story. Specifics about the company. What may have been done or not done. What may have been said or not said. What’s important is what I decided to do in response to it. If you really wanna know, buy me a beer sometime, I’ll spill all the tea.\n\nIn the days leading up to me leaving, a question kept popping up in my head: “Why do I keep working for these people?!” That sounds a bit petulant. Let me expand.\n\nGoing into any work situation with the attitude of: “Why don’t they just listen to me?”, “If they would just do what I say…”, “I know more than them.” etc. etc. is never a good approach. That’s not what I was thinking here. I’ve been lucky to work with smart and talented people throughout my career. Including the short stint in this case. My question was prompted by a career of building other peoples’ ideas. Realizing other peoples’ visions. What I was really asking was: “Why don’t I build my own ideas?”, “Why don’t I realize my own visions?”, “Why don’t I work for myself?”\n\nThis wasn’t the first time I’ve asked these questions. In the past, I’ve always gotten hung up on what I thought should be the first step. I’ve always thought: “Once I have a good product idea, then I’ll start a company to build it.” Well, that clearly hasn’t happened. So, I decided to flip it. Start a company first and then work out what to build.\n\nThat’s what I did. Within a week of leaving, I’d decided on a name, formed a C Corp, bought domains, set up most of the various SaaS tools I’d need, and started the process of researching and prototyping what I might build first.\n\nA lot of that was busy work. Which is exactly what I needed at the time. Having the job fall apart was a blow. I was bummed. I was pissed. It was important that I not just sit and stew, but instead get busy doing things I knew I’d eventually need.\n\nMy corporation is Latchbolt Inc. I let myself nerd out on a holding page at latchbolt.tech. Latchbolt isn’t a single product. It’s a place where I can build anything I’m inspired to. What I’m inspired to build right now is software for niche audiences. Software that’s made with care for caring people. Software that, hopefully, brings a smile to at least one person’s face. We need that right now. That does describe the side projects I build when left to my own devices. The difference is, I’ll charge money for things under the Latchbolt banner.\n\nLatchbolt’s first product is an iOS app for modern collage. It’s moving along slow, but it’s moving along. I’ll have details and a build out for initial testing next month.\n\nIf you have thoughts about this post, send me an email at me@tylergaw.com.",

    "fullText": "A1 mobile Serbia is a mobile provider in Serbia that imposes poor password rules.\n\nTranslation: \"Length of the password must be between 8 and 20 characters and can only have letters and digits.\"\n\nThe password must not contain your first name, surname or username.\nThe allowed special characters are: ! @ # % ^ & * _.\n\nForced to change the password during the first login. At least they could use proper grammar in their rule list.\n\nYour password needs to be between 8 and 16 characters long - no special characters allowed.\n\nThis is the online customer portal of the German health insurance company AOK. They have an extensive set of rules for both passwords and usernames. The password rules are:\n\nThe rules for the username are:\n\nBetween 8 and 16, so I can't go up to 20.\n\nYour password needs to be between 8 and 20 characters long - at least 1 number, 1 lower case letter, 1 upper case letter, 1 special character.\n\nThe only special characters allowed are underscores and hyphens.\n\nRestrict the inclusion of a % character.\n\nPassword must be between 4 and 16 characters long\n\nPhew, too many rules, because why not, if Ma thinks AI stands for Alibaba Intelligence, then password rules can be equally intelligent too.\n\nAlso, this gibberish if you intentionally left the \"confirm password\" field empty and that's even after a en_US redirection.\n\nAmeli.fr (French national health insurance)\n\nThis was very painful to find a password that works with this one and that I can actually remember (I ended-up using my bank-account number because everything else failed). It took me maybe one hour and I thought I would become crazy (and yes, the session expires frequently while you are actually thinking about a password).\n\nTheir site says \"All information is kept safe and secure.\" Just not as secure as you'd like.\n\nUser Password must be between 6 and 14 characters and contain 1 numerical value.\n\nSometimes I forget that caps-lock is on, glad it doesn't matter.\n\nYour password needs to be between 6 and 12 characters long, must contain only letters and numbers.\n\nCan't contain 3 or more consecutive identical characters, nor can it be more than 63 characters long.\n\nService for managing employment documents of the German company Datev.\n\nOnly the following character categories are allowed: Letters, numbers and this special characters set: !#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_`{|}~äöüßÄÖÜ\n\nYour password contains characters not listed. Therefore, they do not match.\n\nMust be different from the last 3 passwords used. Your password must contain at least an uppercase and lowercase letter and number. Must contain at least one special symbol.\n\nUsername is your national ID (easy to find) and your password must have up to 6 alphanumeric characters only. For a bank account with all your money in one of the largest financial institutions in the world.\n\nUsername is randomly generated, example: 'H2487414'. The password must have 6 digits only.\n\nPassword can only be changed from the mobile application:\n\nPlease nominate a password which contains UPPERCASE, lowercase, numbers and symbols. Password should not be the same as the user ID. Avoid using consecutive characters such (ex. abc, DEF, 678) and invalid characters such as [!#$%^&';\"].\n\nPassword requires at least one special character but disallows backtick ```, backslash \\, vertical bar |, and underscore _.\n\nAlthough the prompt suggests good things, after many failed attempts to set a new password, it turns out you can ONLY use the special characters shown in the prompt\n\nPasswords may only include ASCII characters, not even extended ASCII.\n\nOnline banking portal of Banca Intesa Serbia has some password restrictions. This is the translation of the requirements:\n\nNo special characters, minimum number of characters is 8, maximum number of characters is 22, minimum number of upper case letters is 1, lower case also 1, numeric characters is 2, first character must be a upper or lower case letter and maximum number of character repeats is 2.\n\n8 to 15 chars. No special chars allowed but requires special chars. Also requires lowercase, uppercase, and numbers. Consecutive chars are prohibited. Did I mention the page hangs while you type? That eye icon tho.\n\nBanco Nacional (Costa Rica National Bank)\n\nMust have 4 numbers and 4 letters.\n\nMust not contain same letter or number in consecutive order.\n\nCan't contain vowel letters neither the letter Ñ.\n\nPassword can't be the same as the previous 6 used.\n\n20 character max and lots of special character restrictions. Bank of America - keeping your money safe.\n\nAlso: If you paste a password greater than 20 characters, the form truncates it without telling you or giving an error.\n\nYou have to enter your password using this very Frenchy keypad. You don't have lowercase letters, the blanks are not spaces but just non-clickable gaps, but as a compensation you have some weird symbols that your keyboard does not have a key for (e.g. µ).\n\nNo accessible version available.\n\n8 to 16 characters, at least one number and one letter and last but not least NO special characters, and can't have a password that looks like your username too. Oh, and passwords are NOT case sensitive. A real time travel adventure through the password rules of 2005!\n\n12 to 25 characters, only these special chars allowed: @+/'!#$^?:,.(){}[]~-. Also, security questions.\n\nYou can enter whatever password you like! But you probably don't want to make it too long, because you'll break us and you'll never be able to login again.\n\nBetween 10 and 16 letters and/or digits. No special characters are allowed. Must be renewed at least every 180 days, but you can configure to let the password expire sooner. When changing the password, the new password cannot be too similar to the existing password.\n\nThey force you to enter a password that has 8, 9, or 10 characters, then they lecture you on how to create a strong password.\n\n16 characters maximum, no . , - | / = or _ allowed.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield Massachusetts\n\n16 maximum and no special characters. Protecting your US healthcare information.\n\nBoligøen (Danish resident renting bureau)\n\nRed text: \"Your password has to be at least 6 characters, but NOT over 20 characters.\"\n\n\"To ensure the highest level of security, your password must have... 8 digits\". And it must be entered using a funny keypad with the digits in the wrong order.\n\nCAF (French Family Allowance Fund)\n\nYou have to enter your 8-digit password using this Frenchy keypad.\n\nYour password can meet all the requirements in the list and still be invalid due to an unspecified rule: any \"special characters\" that are not listed in the help text are not allowed. Worse, it provides no useful feedback other than the \"New Password\" field is red.\n\nCan't use any special characters except @ $ # ? _ * &\n\nCWT Business Travel Management Company\n\nCalifornia Department of Motor Vehicles\n\nThey also prohibit pasting into the password field by using a JavaScript alert() whenever you right-click or press the Ctrl button, so you can't use a password manager.\n\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce\n\nLetters and numbers only, no symbols. Also an undocumented maximum of 12 characters!\n\nDoes not show number of characters in the max character limit.\n\nSo many bad ideas: a low maximum length, requiring six specific character types while not accepting common symbols, plus a weird restriction that makes random generation harder.\n\nYour password is too long. But how long can it be? Oh, we won't tell you.\n\nPrevents spaces and a set list of characters, limits to 30 characters and can only change your password twice per day.\n\nHere are the (only fairly poor) rules for a new password. Enter 64 character password that matches all the rules (notice no rules on maximum length). That password you entered looks good! But we didn't change it. And your old password doesn't work. Or the new one. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nA max of 12 characters... Can't handle most symbols (only 5 supported). At least they have two factor auth via email or sms sigh\n\nThe password should be of at least 8 characters and must include a number, special character, an upper as well as a lowercase letter\n\nDoes not allow simple characters and sequences such as '4587' or 'efgh' in password & necessarily requires numeric values.\n\nPassword must be 9-30 characters with at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one number and one special character (no spaces) and be different than your username.\n\nOnly a staggering 8-12 characters allowed with prescribed selection of special characters.\n\nYour password should be difficult to guess as long as it's not over 16 characters long.\n\nAnother financial institution with short password requirements. They also block pasting in to the field, making it a pain to use a password manager.\n\nCopart: \"The security of our members is extremely important to us.\" Also Copart: \"We're gonna need you to keep your password between 5-10 characters.\"\n\nLocal Utility with a password restriction of 30 characters. Better than some for sure, but still dumb.\n\nI wonder if they cooperate with NSA to enforce the password rules.\n\nDue to Costco's short max password length of 16 characters, I strongly recommend using a password manager to make a random password to satisfy all of these conditions below:\n\nFor the record, at least Costco.com has greatly improved after the summer of 2021 - before that, the site used to prohibit copying and pasting passwords, which prevented password managers from working properly. I believe the max password length was also longer before the summer of 2021 (either 20 or 32 characters), but I cannot confirm this since I never took a screenshot.\n\nPassword has to be between 6 and 10 characters, can't contain any punctuation and you have to give characters from it on the phone to confirm identity.\n\nNo minimum character limit meaning you can go as low as 5 characters for a password\n\nPassword must be between 7 and 10 characters, contain both an uppercase and a lowercase letter and have at least one number.\n\nYou have to enter your 6-digit password using this Frenchy keypad.\n\nPassword must be 10-16 characters with at least one letter, one number and no special character.\n\nThe symbol \\ is banned without a notice, it'll probably escape whatever you'll put in, just why...\n\nMax password length is 15 characters\n\nThe only special characters that can be used are !\"#$%\n\nOkay at least 6, that's alright I guess.\n\nOh at least one number and one letter, bit dumb but hey not that dumb.\n\nBut hiding the fact that it has a max of 20, now THAT is dumb!\n\nRules that are completely arbitrary that basically make all safe passwords wrong, instead forcing pseudo-safe password combinations.\n\nIt's a good thing they don't store personal information such as your passport number... oh wait.\n\nPasswords for the online banking web frontend do not have a max length constraint, but using the same password to log in to the official iOS DKB app requires the password to be no longer than 38 characters.\n\nMust be between 8 and 40 characters, uppercase and lowercase, one number, one special character... whatever.

    "title": "Using Cursor for Importing Data into Notion",
    "description": "Notion has great UX for manipulating tabular data but getting data formatted into a Notion Database is time consuming. It turns out, using Cursor for writing throwaway data manipulation scripts is a great solution for this.",
    "fullText": "Notion is my preferred tool for manipulating tabular data because of its clean UX. In the past, the most time consuming part of using Notion has been structuring data into a Notion Database. Notion has a great built-in CSV file importer that lets you cleanly map a CSV’s columns to Notion Property Types, but I’ve found that even getting a cleanly formatted CSV file to be time consuming.\n\nSurprisingly, it turns out Cursor (and Claude Code) are a great way of getting data into Notion. And I’ve used this setup for everything from vacation planning to sales prospecting to even hacky evaluations on AI prompts and models.\n\nCursor and Claude Code are both tools featuring AI Coding Agents intended for developers building software. But the same AI Coding Agents are also great at writing throwaway scripts for pulling data down from APIs, cleanly formatting the data, and uploading it into a Notion Database.\n\nThe most obvious path is using Cursor or Claude Code to format data into a CSV and then manually upload it to a Notion Database. But, I’ve found simply prompting Cursor/Claude Code to use the Notion Javascript SDK works well enough and lets me be completely hands-off in this data ingestion process.\n\nThe workflow for this is dead simple. I create a throwaway directory with a single .env file with my Notion Internal Integration Secret and whatever API keys I happen to need.\n\nThe rest is just writing the prompt within Cursor that includes:\n\nThe rest of this post describes how to get Notion set up so you can programatically interact with it using the API and a few concrete examples I’ve used in my personal life and in my work as an early stage founder.\n\nI’m planning a Summer 2026 backpacking trip with some friends and picked up “Backpacking Washington: Overnight and Multiday routes” to get a curated list of recommendations and trail notes.\n\nWithin the book is a great tabular index of all the hikes in the book, over 80 of them in total!\n\nI’m still using the physical book for its valuable trail notes, but I want to quickly filter down the list based on mileage and season while also collaborating on this selection process within Notion. Manually getting these into Notion would be painfully tedious, so I create a throwaway directory with pictures of all the pages with this table.\n\nIt takes some back and forth with Cursor to get the right mapping from the pictures of the table to proper Notion Properties, but end to end it takes me less than 30 minutes.\n\nOne of the tricks I’ve used for Sales Prospecting is using Google X-Ray searches. Among other things, it let’s you restrict the domain you’re searching against.\n\nFor example, one of the earlier product ideas I worked on was a tool for businesses using Notion. These businesses often use Notion for their job postings and since they’re publically listed, you can specifically search for them using a Google X-Ray Search.\n\nHere’s what the Google X-ray search results look like when only searching across published Notion Pages: site:notion.site \"job board\":\n\nTo get this Google Search Results programatically, I use SerpAPI.\n\nMy temporary directory starts out like this:\n\nI prompt Cursor to hit the SerpAPI with the site:notion.site \"job board\" query and save the results to a JSON. Then I tell Cursor to get that JSON data into a Notion table.\n\nGrabbing the results from an X-ray search is the first step and I’m still manually qualifying these potential leads, so Notion’s UX helps me out in this manual process.\n\nOutside of Google X-ray searches from SerpAPI, I’ve also used Exa’s Web Search API for searches where I don’t have exact keywords or domains nailed and Firecrawl to fetch the content on the links themselves.\n\nIf this workflow of using 3rd party data providers to hydrate a table feels familiar, it’s because I’m basically frankensteining Notion + Cursor to be a stand in for Clay.com or freckle.io. Use those tools if this data enrichment workflow is something you’re using every day, but since I’m only occasionally building these kinds of lists, this hacky setup works well enough for me and saves me from paying an extra subscription.\n\nWhen building out AI features, you often need to manually evaluate results before eventually having more elaborate scoring and judging systems in place. This is probably the most hacky usage of Notion, but, I like being able to easily tag rows with a Multi-Select Notion Property.\n\nIn this instance, I’m running my product locally and testing the feature against multiple inputs to compare the output of different models. I’m then getting this into Notion just to have a quick and dirty evaluation.\n\nThis is admittedly a tortured example, so here are much better alternatives for LLM Prompt Engineering and Evaluation:\n\nThis section is on setting up Notion if you want to use the Notion SDK approach. If you just want to upload CSV into a Notion Database, you don’t need to do this.\n\nHere’s the official Notion documentation on how to set up an integration:\n\nhttps://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#getting-started\n\nRegardless, I’ll summarize the steps here too…\n\nGetting a Notion Integration Key\n\nOpen up your Workspace Settings from the left Sidebar. Navigate “Settings” > “Connections” > “Develop or manage integrations”\n\nFrom this page, create a new integration with Type “Internal”.\n\nOnce you’ve created the integration, you can copy the “Internal Integration Secret” which we’ll put into our .env in the directory we’ll open with Cursor.\n\nBefore we can start interacting with Notion via the API, we need to enable the integration per Page we want to manipulate.\n\nWithin the page we want to manipulate, we go into the Page Settings then “Connections” and then we find our newly created integration.\n\nYou’re now good to go. Make sure to feed this page’s URL into the Cursor prompt so it knows where to create a new database for your data upload.\n\nNotion has its own MCP Server with tools that cover most of the basic functionality you might want: https://developers.notion.com/docs/mcp-supported-tools. Depending on your use case, you might be better off connecting the Notion MCP to your regular ChatGPT / Claude account without reaching for a developer-facing product like Cursor or Claude Code.\n\nIf you’re planning to use the Notion SDK, Notion has a rate limit of ~3 requests/second and currently doesn’t have a bulk Page Create API (see Page Create API here), so you’ll want to Rate Limit your API requests by using something like ratelimit-js. For non-technical folks reading this, it’s usually sufficient to prompt Cursor/Claude Code to rate limit requests without intervention.",

    "fullText": "Motif is a graphical user interface (GUI) widget toolkit for Unix-like operating systems using X11. Motif's look and feel is distinguished by its use of rudimentary square and chiseled three-dimensional effects for its various user interface elements.\n\nClosely related to Motif is the Motif Window Manager (MWM).\n\nMotif is the toolkit for the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) and thus became the standard widget toolkit for the commercial UNIXes that adopted CDE. CDE was part of the UNIX 98 Workstation Product Standard, so Motif was part of that standard.[1] It was also the toolkit for the IRIX Interactive Desktop.\n\nAfter many years as proprietary software, Motif was released in 2012, as free software under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL-2.1-or-later).[2]\n\nMotif was created by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) to be a standard graphical user interface for Unix platforms.[3] Rather than create a new interface from scratch, OSF opened a Request For Technology (RFT) in 1988 to solicit existing technologies from third parties. OSF intended to either adopt an existing interface wholesale, or create one using a combination of technologies from multiple existing products. Forty products were submitted, from which OSF selected twenty-three finalists.[4] Among the finalists were Adobe Inc.'s Display Postscript, Sun Microsystems' OPEN LOOK, Digital Research's GEM, IXI Limited's X.desktop, Apollo Computer's Open Dialogue, Carnegie Mellon University's Andrew User Interface System, Digital Equipment Corporation's XUI, and Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft's CXI and PM/X. Ultimately, OSF selected a combination of the look and feel, window manager and Common User Access compliance from HP and Microsoft's CXI, along with the widget toolkit API and User Interface Language (UIL) from DEC's XUI.[5][6] Motif was first shipped by OSF in 1989.[3]\n\nMotif is the basic building block of the Common Desktop Environment, which was the standard desktop for commercial Unix.\n\nThe IEEE 1295 standard (now withdrawn[7]) defines the \"Motif API\".[8] As of version 2.1, Motif supports Unicode, which made it widely used in several multilingual environments.\n\nMotif was originally made available under a license requiring royalty payments.\n\nA version called Open Motif (substantially the same codebase under a different license)[9] was released on May 15, 2000, under a license which allowed royalty-free distribution of Open Motif if the platform upon which it is used was open source[10] – but was not an open source license itself. The name was criticized by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation for likelihood to mislead people into thinking it was proper open source or free software, particularly for the Open Group's statement that they had \"released the source code of Motif to the Open Source community\".[11] The initial release of Open Motif was version 2.1.30 in May 2000; Open Motif 2.3 was released in June 2007, followed by a 2.3.1 bug fix release in September 2008 and a 2.3.2 bug fix release in March 2009.\n\nDuring the time when Motif was closed source software, the LessTif project was created with the aim of creating a free software implementation, under the LGPL.\n\nIn October 2012, Motif was released as a source code distribution under the GNU LGPL-2.1-or-later.[12] Motif's source code is available on SourceForge.",

    "description": "Nicola Elliott is founder of Single Variety Co, an award-winning premium preserves brand that’s challenging the way food businesses grow.",
    "fullText": "There couldn’t have been any better validation for Nicola Elliott to launch her food business in 2016 than winning a gold award just one month after producing her first ever batch of Seville marmalade. “It gave me the confidence to go forward if the marmalade was that good,” recalls Elliott, founder of Single Variety Co.\n\nShe went one better this year. At the same World Marmalade Awards, her Amalfi lemon marmalade went to the final round of tasting and then scooped double gold and top accolade in an emotional moment for the British entrepreneur. “To do it at the scale that we are making it says we are doing everything right,” says Elliott.\n\nIn the early throes of her single-fruit preserves startup, Elliott was making 25 jars at a time with six pans going simultaneously and two part-time staff, as well as family and friends helping out.\n\nFrom selling her jams on a Balham market stall to owning her production facility, having shunned mass supermarket listings to retain independent quality, Single Variety Co now produces 5,000 jars per week and is set for latest annual revenues of £1.7m.\n\nIt is all a far cry from seven years ago when Elliott received her first export order to Germany for 8,000 jars of raspberry preserve. “I said ‘yes’ thinking I would be making 25 jars at a time. Somehow we did it over six weeks. We didn’t make any money on the order but it was the turning point for us.”\n\nThe business lesson led to Elliott reluctantly outsourcing production for a few years until her husband — a “people person”, former personal trainer and tennis coach — joined the business and the couple moved to Bristol and a £200,000 outlay to set up their jam factory five years ago.\n\nIn her former career as a fresh foods product developer at the likes of Sainsbury’s, Elliott cut a frustrated figure in a role she admits was cost-focussed and in which quality wasn’t a priority. She left her supermarket career to set her sights on a short shelf-life product.\n\n“When you mass-produce, quality has to give way. I was determined to make the quality what we aimed for,” she admits.\n\nAt the time, Elliott noticed that premium jams had champagne added to the strawberries or bay leaves to blackberries and “no one was making just great-tasting strawberry jam.”\n\nIt hasn’t all gone according to plan. Elliott once purchased the wrong second-hand jam kettle, at £12,000, instead of an electric kettle, which her husband still reminds the working mother of today.\n\nNow with a staff of 12, she works directly with UK fruit farmers for her products. These include seasonal limited edition jams such as traditional rhubarb from Yorkshire, which grows in the dark and is picked by candlelight.",

    "fullText": "Once a mall staple and a go-to department store for generations of families since 1902, JCPenney has endured turbulent years marked by bankruptcy, mass store closures, and restructuring efforts. Now, as the retailer continues its long road to recovery, another major setback has emerged.\n\nIn July 2025, JCPenney entered into a $947 million all-cash deal with private equity firm Onyx Partners Ltd., agreeing to transfer the ownership of 119 store locations. The deal was executed through Copper Property CTL Pass-Through Trust, the entity created during JCPenney's bankruptcy to hold and dispose of its real estate assets.\n\nCopper Property disclosed that the amendment became effective on July 23 and was non-refundable, thereby guaranteeing the transaction, according to the trust's press release. Once completed, the trust planned to distribute the proceeds to investors.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, the properties were subject to a triple-net master lease, under which JCPenney remains responsible for all operating costs, including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. The lease also included limited termination rights for individual locations in specific circumstances, such as property damage or condemnation proceedings.\n\nDespite these arrangements, the trust cautioned that the transaction was contingent on meeting several closing conditions and could not be guaranteed. At the time, all 119 JCPenney stores remained open and operational.\n\nThe deal was initially expected to close on September 8, with the trust obligated to sell all properties by January 2026. However, repeated delays ultimately led to an unexpected outcome.\n\nMonths later, Copper Property revealed that the nearly $1 billion agreement had failed to close. In a Form 8-K filing dated December 22, the trust issued a notice to Onyx Partners confirming that the agreement would be terminated if the buyer did not complete the transaction by December 26, 2025.\n\nThe filing does not specify what would happen to the 119 stores, and JCPenney has yet to issue a public statement addressing the failed deal or the next steps.\n\nThis attempted sale dates back to JCPenney's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in May 2020. While the company cited the COVID-19 pandemic as a key factor, it had not been profitable for nearly a decade prior.\n\nAs part of its restructuring, CPenney secured $450 million in debtor-in-possession financing to continue operating while reorganizing its business.\n\nThe retailer was eventually acquired by Simon Property Group (SPG) and Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) for $1.75 billion, transferring ownership of its retail and operating assets.\n\nCopper Property was created during this process to assume ownership of 160 retail properties and six warehouses. Managed by an affiliate of Hilco Real Estate LLC., the trust is responsible for owning, leasing, and selling those assets.\n\nAt the time of its bankruptcy filing, JCPenney closed over 200 stores nationwide. Earlier this year, the retailer confirmed plans to shutter seven additional locations.\n\nNewmark previously owned 121 JCPenney store properties across 35 states. In early 2025, it sold two of those properties, one in Florida and one in Pennsylvania, to the Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management.\n\nAnalysts attribute JCPenney's decline to a major rebranding effort in 2011 under the then-newly appointed CEO, Ron Johnson, who introduced a new logo and redesigned stores to promote a more modern department store concept.\n\nAt the same time, JCPenney abandoned its long-standing promotional pricing strategy, replacing frequent sales and coupons with everyday low pricing. It also reduced its private-label offerings to focus on national brands.\n\nThe change failed to resonate with its core customers and instead created a perception of higher prices.\n\n\"For the JCPenney shopper, the brand experience wasn't just about the final price paid,\" said Marketing Expert Roy Harmon. \"It was about the psychological thrill of the hunt. Customers loved the sense of 'winning' by stacking coupons and catching a great sale. By removing the discounts, Johnson removed a key source of perceived value and delight. Customers, confused and alienated by the new approach, fled in droves.\"\n\n62-year-old retail chain is quietly closing stores across the US\n\nPopular women’s fashion brand closes dozens of stores nationwide\n\n124-year-old retail chain announces rare store closure\n\nAs foot traffic and sales declined and competitors got ahead, JCPenney's debt continued to mount.\n\n\"The JCPenney case illustrates the complex dynamics of branding in the modern retail environment,\" said Attorney Schuyler Reidel. \"While aspirations for revitalization are commendable, they must be grounded in a deep understanding of customer expectations and market realities to achieve successful outcomes.\"\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic further added to JCPenney's challenges, disrupting its supply chain and forcing temporary store closures during an already uncertain time.\n\nTraditional brick-and-mortar retail continues to shrink. Rising operating costs and the rapid growth of e-commerce have reshaped consumer behavior, leaving empty mall storefronts and shuttered stand-alone locations across the country.\n\nWith 84.3% of Americans shopping online, U.S. e-commerce spending reached $1.34 trillion in 2024 and is projected to surpass $2.5 trillion in 2030, according to Capital One Shopping.\n\nIn 2024, U.S. online sales accounted for 22.3% of global e-commerce spending, up nearly 1.5% from the year prior, and are expected to reach $1.47 trillion in 2025.\n\nRetailers announced 67% more store closures in 2025 than the previous year, according to CoreSight Research.\n\nMacy's: Plans to shutter around 150 underperforming stores by 2026 \n\nInditex: Closed 132 stores in 2025 \n\nClaire's: Closed nearly 300 U.S. stores after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2025 \n\nVictoria's Secret: Has shuttered 30 U.S. locations since the beginning of 2025",

    "description": "The chain once operated more than 700 locations across the country.",
    "fullText": "There was a time in America when a big night out for a good steak dinner meant hitting up Sizzler.\n\nBut that time seems long ago now, and the once-popular chain has seen its numbers dwindle in recent years. Founded in 1958, Sizzler once had more than 700 locations across the country. It now has just 74.\n\nAnd the road from 770-plus to 74 has not been pretty. Two bankruptcies — the first in 1996 and the second in 2000 — have taken place on that journey, but Sizzler has somehow survived.\n\nAnd now there is a plan for a comeback.\n\nQSR Magazine’s Danny Klein recently spoke with Sizzler’s Chief Growth Officer Robert Clark about the chain’s plan for a rebirth. Clark has been with Sizzler 41 years and has seen previous plans to revitalize the chain fail.\n\n“Our current leadership is much more focused on hey, let’s take the best of Sizzler and let’s make it even better,” Clark told QSR.\n\nSo, what’s the plan to make Sizzler a big-time player in the steak game again?\n\nWell, per the QSR story, the chain focused on remodeling its stores and has seen positive results from that. That includes sales increases of around 47% in the remodeled locations. The chain is looking to continue making the updates.\n\n“We feel like we have a really great brand here,” Clark told QSR. “And our results have been very solid. We constantly pup up in pop culture. I think what we’re trying to do with the remodel is really stay relevant and have facilities and assets that meet our reputation. We understand that remodeling is probably the single biggest driver of guests in the restaurant. It’s the most important thing I think we could do aside from a lot of other operational things we’re doing as well.”\n\nAnd, while the remodeling is key, getting back to its roots is also a major part of the plan.\n\n“Everything we did was trying to dig into what made Sizzler so great in the first place,” Sizzler VP of Marketing Sasha Shennikov told QSR. “Why we have some restaurants that have stood the test of time through different rebirths; why people keep coming back.”",

    "fullText": "A trail camera in a Minnesota forest captured an intense scene between two elusive but fiercely territorial predators.\n\nThe clip, shared by Northern News Now, was taken from a trail camera at the Chik-Wauk Museum and Nature Center in northern Minnesota. (Viewers are advised to lower the volume before watching the video, as it shows a pair of lynxes getting into a loud verbal tussle.)\n\nBoth of the big cats let it all out in a series of ear-piercing screams. The video ends with a close-up of the presumed victor, showing a little flick of its tail before it slinks out of view.\n\nAs the name suggests, Canada lynxes are found all across Canada and are marked by the IUCN Red List as \"least concern\" as much of their historic range remains intact. However, the American population is small and scattered — only around 200 remain in northern Minnesota. Because of their elusive nature and nocturnal hunting habits, they're very seldom seen in the United States.\n\nSometimes mistaken for the bobcat (which is part of the lynx family), the easiest way to tell the animals apart is the lynx's distinctive ear tufts and oversized paws. Like bobcats, lynxes play an important role in the boreal ecosystem. They protect the forests directly by keeping prey populations under control and indirectly through the \"ecology of fear,\" according to Rewilding Britain. Essentially, the pungent scent of the lynx's urine and feces keeps its prey on the move and prevents overgrazing.\n\nThe footage captured shows the utility of trail cameras for unobtrusively monitoring an area's wildlife. Lynxes are usually solitary animals, so observing a territorial dispute could be valuable to researchers seeking to better understand their behavior.\n\nThis type of footage can also be helpful in shaping an accurate picture of the species' numbers, thereby better informing conservation measures at the local level. Trail cameras are a key tool in measuring the progress of reintroduction efforts too.\n\nThe video's commenters were quite amused by the verbal joust. \"It kind of sounds like my kids in the car,\" one commenter joked. Another viewer said, \"Imagine walking through the woods alone at night and hearing this!\" A similar comment added, \"That is freaky.\"\n\nOne viewer noted the lynx's similarity to the bobcat went beyond looks: \"Kind of sounds like bobcats.

    "description": "The country is in an unusual economic moment, with a weakening labor market and above-target inflation levels. Those factors are keeping mortgage rates from moving much.",
    "fullText": "For weeks now, mortgage rates have barely budged. There’s a good chance they won’t move much in the new year either.\n\nMortgage rates have hovered in a remarkably narrow range of 6.2% to 6.3%, roughly year-to-date lows, since mid-September. Those levels have been enticing enough to spark some gains in refinancing activity and homebuying in the fall, but are still elevated enough to keep many aspiring buyers priced out of the market.\n\nThe recent stability at relatively high levels can be explained by the country’s unusual economic moment — the labor market is weakening, but inflation remains relatively high — combined with government shutdown disruptions that have made it harder to parse where those trends are headed. A number of economic reports that typically influence mortgage rates were delayed, canceled, or only partially released since the shutdown, giving rates few catalysts to move much either way.\n\n“The shutdown just blurred everything,” said Hector Amendola, president of Panorama Mortgage Group in Las Vegas. “I think everyone’s on the edge of their seat for January numbers to see how the trend looks and where it’s going to go.”\n\nFactors including future Federal Reserve actions, trends in government bond yields, and demand for mortgage-backed securities help determine mortgage rates. But on a basic level, mortgage rates are usually lower when the labor market is weaker and inflation is minimal and higher when the opposite is true.\n\nIn recent months, the Federal Reserve has been cutting benchmark interest rates amid signs that the labor market is slowing. But it has been doing so at a time when inflation has been running higher than its 2% target, and the members of the rate-setting committee have signaled that they’re divided over the future direction of interest rates.\n\nThat mixed economic and policy backdrop is part of the reason most economists and industry professionals expect only minor fluctuations in rates next year. The Mortgage Bankers Association sees mortgage rates stuck in a narrow range between 6% and 6.5% “over the next few years.” Similarly, economists at Realtor.com and Redfin expect mortgage rates to average 6.3% — near current levels — in 2026, while the National Association of Realtors and Fannie Mae see a slightly bigger dip, to around 6%, by the end of next year.\n\n“I don’t think they’re going to drop substantially, unless something big happens in the economy one way or another,” said Melissa Abramovich, a loan officer at A+ Mortgage Services in Muskego, Wis.\n\nAnd what the Fed does ultimately has only an indirect effect on mortgage rates. In most scenarios, including this year, mortgage rates begin to drift lower before the Fed begins cutting interest rates. Over the summer, mortgage rates dropped from the high 6% range to the low 6% range, and then barely reacted when the Fed delivered three rate drops at its September, October, and December meetings.",

    "fullText": "Pete Hegseth’s bomb-first, question-later approach to alleged narcoterrorists is reportedly helping those same terrorists get off scot-free.\n\nA Hegseth-directed bombing on a boat allegedly carrying drugs from Ecuador destroyed the evidence that was crucial to the prosecution of the survivors, according to a damning Washington Post report.\n\nAndrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, a 42-year-old Ecuadorian native with a drug-trafficking record, was one of two survivors of an Oct. 16 U.S. strike on a submarine that the Pentagon alleges was carrying drugs overseas. Two others were killed in the strike, and the fourth was extradited to Colombia.\n\nThe U.S. military captured Chila, then sent him back to Ecuador to be prosecuted. However, the U.S. provided the Ecuadorian government with no evidence that could lead to Chila’s arrest. Any evidence proving that Chila was committing a crime on that boat, such as seized drugs, GPS records, or cell phones, was blasted to the bottom of the sea.\n\nThe Ecuadorian government was forced to let Chila go, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe failure to even apprehend an alleged narcoterrorist is at extreme odds with the 45-year-old Defense Secretary’s tough-on-narcoterrorism rhetoric.\n\n“If these people were drug traffickers and deserving of death, how is it that you would pick them up and just let them go?” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), a member of the House intelligence and foreign affairs committees, told the Post.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“We have consistently said that our intelligence did indeed confirm these boats were trafficking narcotics destined for America. That same intelligence also confirms that the individuals involved in these drug operations are/were narco-terrorists, and we stand by that assessment,” the Pentagon stated in a statement to The Post.\n\nHegseth has staked his reputation and potentially his job on the effectiveness of the boat strikes. Hegseth recently landed in hot water for an alleged “kill them all” order on a Venezuelan drug boat, killing survivors of an initial September 2 strike that critics have labeled a potential war crime.\n\nWhen reports of the order surfaced in late November, Hegseth boasted, “Biden coddled terrorists, we kill them.”\n\nThe “double tap” incident was Hegseth’s most serious controversy in a year full of embarrassments, leading to speculation he would soon face the axe.\n\nPresident Trump, 79, dumped responsibility for the attack on Hegseth, saying, “I didn’t know about the second strike. I didn’t know anything about people. I wasn’t involved.” However, he has also vocally supported Hegseth through the ordeal.",

    "fullText": "Game result: The Texans beat the Chargers 20-16 on Saturday to clinch a playoff berth. They remain behind the Jaguars in the AFC South, but they cannot be eliminated from division contention if the Jaguars win on Sunday. The Chargers have already clinched a playoff berth, but the loss officially eliminates them from AFC West contention. They drop to the No. 7 seed and with Houston holding the tiebreaker over them, it’s unlikely they get much higher in the seeding.\n\nHouston jumped out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter and looked like they might cruise to victory. They never fell behind, but LA fought back and cut the lead to one possession late in the fourth quarter. Special teams miscues once again cost them in the loss. They cut the lead to 20-16 and then missed a field goal. They made a key illegal contact penalty on a third down sack and couldn’t get the ball back.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers have already clinched a playoff spot.\n\nThe Houston Texans can join them this weekend, starting when the two teams meet Saturday at SoFi Stadium.\n\nHere is where both the Chargers and the Texans stand in the AFC playoff race.\n\nFor the Texans, 2025 has been a tale of two seasons. Houston began the year with three straight losses and went 3-5 over the first half of the season, but a seven-game winning streak has the Texans on the cusp of a playoff berth.\n\nHouston will clinch a playoff spot with a win or a tie in that game against the Chargers.\n\nHowever, even if the Texans lose to the Chargers, they can still clinch a playoff spot on Sunday. Houston is in the playoffs if the Indianapolis Colts lose or tie against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. And speaking of the Jaguars, Houston remains alive in the race for the AFC South title. With wins in their final two games and one loss from the Jaguars down the stretch, the Texans are AFC South champions.\n\nAs for the Chargers, they locked up a playoff spot when the Indianapolis Colts lost to the San Francisco 49ers on Monday Night Football.\n\nBut Los Angeles remains alive in the AFC West race. The Denver Broncos moved one step closer to claiming the division title on Christmas night with a win over the Kansas City Chiefs. But with a win over the Texans, the Chargers can wrap up the division title in Week 18, as they take on the Broncos in the final game of the season. A loss or a tie against Houston would eliminate the Chargers from the AFC West race.\n\nHere are the current AFC standings following Denver’s win on Thursday night:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nThis game could have an impact on seeding between the two teams, under the NFL’s tiebreaker formula. As you can see above, right now the Chargers are the No. 5 seed with an 11-4 record, but the Texans are 10-5, down in the No. 7 spot.\n\nIf Houston wins, the two teams would have matching 11-5 records. The Texans’ win would give them a tiebreaker advantage over the Chargers should they finish tied at the end of the season. However, if Houston, Los Angeles, and Buffalo all finish tied at the end of the year, then their respective conference records will be the determining factor. Entering Week 17, the Chargers have an 8-2 record in AFC games, as do the Texans, while Buffalo is 8-3.",

    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts (8-7) have been eliminated from AFC playoff contention. They won seven of their first eight games before the schedule toughened, quarterback Daniel Jones suffered two injuries and the defense sometimes struggled late.\n\nHere are the 10 players who will count the most toward their 2026 salary cap — which won't be known until the spring but is project to be in the $304 million range.\n\n(2026 salary cap hit, per Spotrac, with final season of current contract)\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $29 million, 2026\n\n2025 performance: The sixth-year veteran led the Colts with 76 catches and 7 receiving touchdowns through 15 games. He averaged 10 yards per catch. He had 9 receptions in a game twice.\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $26.6 million, 2026\n\n2025 performance: The 10th-year veteran has missed five games with a neck injury and was placed on season-ending IR; it's the second straight season he missed at least five games. Through 15 weeks, he had 27 tackles 4 sacks and 13 quarterback hits.\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $24.2 million, 2026\n\n2025 performance: Another year, another Pro Bowl. The left guard has been so honored in all eight seasons, and he has been an All-Pro three times.\n\n2026 salary, final year of current contract: $20.2 million, 2027\n\n2025 performance: The 8th-year player signed for 3 years up to $54 million in the offseason. However, his 2025 was interrupted three times by concussions.

    "fullText": "We are nearing the end of the 2025 NFL season and the playoff picture is coming into focus. With that comes the matchups that will be set soon and the playoff opponents for each team.\n\nAs we enter Week 17, the results of these games will shift who plays who, and we will track that all here.\n\nThe number one see gets a first-round bye and home-field advantage through the playoffs.\n\nEntering Week 17, the Denver Broncos have a chance to clinch the number one seed but it’s going to take a lot of work. It is likely to stretch to Week 18.\n\nPittsburgh can clinch the four seed with a win OR a Ravens loss.\n\n2. New England Patriots (12-3)* host 7. Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)*\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4)* host 6. Houston Texans (11-5)*\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6) host 5. Buffalo Bills (11-4)*\n\nThe NFC bracket is wide open entering Week 17, but the Seahawks can clinch the one seed with a win and some NFC West help.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers can clinch the four seed with a win and a Buccaneers loss.\n\n2. Chicago Bears (11-4)* host 7. Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)\n3. Philadelphia Eagles (10-5)** host 6. Los Angeles Rams (11-4)*\n4. Carolina Panthers (8-7) host 5. San Francisco 49ers (11-4)*\n\n*: Clinched playoff berth\n**: Clinched division title\n***: Clinched no. 1 seed\n\nSaturday 4:30 p.m. result: The Texans beat the Chargers 20-16 to punch their ticket to the playoffs and keep their AFC South hopes alive. They cannot be eliminated from division contention this week if the Jaguars win on Sunday. The result also secured the AFC West title for the Broncos and leaves open the door for the Broncos to clinch the No. 1 seed. Denver is guaranteed can clinch home field through the AFC bracket if the Patriots, Jaguars, and Bills all lose on Sunday.\n\nChristmas 8:30 p.m. result: Denver’s win moved the Broncos one step closer to locking up the AFC West, and perhaps the No. 1 seed in the conference. Denver can clinch the AFC West on Saturday if the Chargers lose or tie against the Houston Texans. The Broncos can also clinch the No. 1 seed in the conference this weekend, but they will need a lot of help to accomplish that goal. Denver locks up the No. 1 seed with a Patriots loss to the Jets, a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans, a Jaguars loss or tie against the Colts, and a Bills loss or tie against the Eagles.\n\nChristmas 4:30 p.m. result: The Lions lost to the Vikings, which officially clinched a berth for the Packers and eliminated the Lions. That solidifies all but one team in the playoff field. The Packers currently hold the final wild card berth, but still have an outside shot at the NFC North title. The seeding is not set for the six teams already in the field. The final team to join the field will be the NFC South champion, and that team is all but certain to be the No. 4 seed.\n\nWe will update as more Week 17 results come in.",

    "description": "A once-promising Colts season that included a 7-1 start, has ended without a postseason berth, sparked by a historic late-season collapse.",
    "fullText": "The Colts’ season has come to an all too familiar ending for a fifth consecutive year. But in 2025, an Indianapolis franchise led by general manager Chris Ballard and head coach Shane Steichen did so in historic fashion.\n\nWith two games left to play, Indianapolis – once holder of the best record in the NFL at 7-1 – has been eliminated from the playoffs by Houston’s 20-16 road win over the Chargers on Saturday.\n\nEntering Week 17, the Texans held a two-game lead on the Colts for the AFC’s final wild card playoff spot. In order to snap a four-year postseason drought, the Colts needed their AFC South divisional foes to lose out, combined with winning out themselves and getting help elsewhere around the league to avoid a historic collapse.\n\nWith Saturday’s result, the Colts become just the sixth team since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 to miss the playoffs after starting 7-1. Three of those previous teams – the 1975 Dolphins, the 1987 Chargers and the 1988 Saints – missed out when the NFL’s playoff format only included four (Dolphins) or five (Chargers and Saints) teams from each conference.\n\nHouston started 0-3 and will be the first team since the 2018 Texans (and second since 1999) to make the playoffs after that start since the AFL-NFL merger. Teams were 245 of the 252 teams to start 0-3 missed the playoffs in that timeframe.\n\nHere are the eight biggest factors that led to the Colts missing the playoffs for the fifth straight season – a postseason-less campaign brought on by a skid that will go down in the NFL’s history books.\n\nThe overarching theme to the Colts’ hot-and-cold season through Week 16 has been the team’s struggle to beat playoff-caliber teams consistently or win high-pressure games down the stretch. Following the team’s come-from-behind home win in Week 2 over a Broncos squad that could land the No. 1 seed in the AFC, the Colts have gone just 1-6 against teams that have clinched a playoff spot or are still in the running.\n\nThe Colts started 2-1 in such games – including a resounding road win, 38-24, over the Chargers – but also lost in Week 4 on the road to the Rams and in Week 9 in Pittsburgh. The Colts’ six losses against playoff-caliber teams this year have seen the offense that was once considered historically dynamic score just a tick under 20 points per game.\n\nThe Colts are also 3-5 in one-score game this year, including wins against the lowly Cardinals (31-27) and Falcons (31-25).\n\nThe beginning of the end came near the end of the first quarter in Jacksonville when starting quarterback Daniel Jones planted his foot awkwardly and fell to the ground untouched as he released the ball. Instantly, Jones grasped for his lower right leg, unstrapped his helmet, yanked it off and slammed it to the ground. He’d suffered a torn Achilles tendon, an injury with an unprecise recovery timeline famous for taking away a player’s explosiveness for a season after the injury – doubly concerning for a quarterback who signed with the Colts this offseason on a one-year deal.\n\nJones’ torn Achilles forced the Colts to think outside the box and look to Philip Rivers, a quarterback who last led the Colts to the playoffs in 2020, but who retired after that season and had been coaching high school football and training draft prospects in the half-decade since.\n\nFor a 44-year-old off-the-couch quarterback, Rivers’ performance has been commendable, including throwing for 277 yards and two touchdowns Monday night in a game largely lost by a woeful defensive performance. His 120-yard, one-touchdown performance in Week 15 helped manage the game and was about as good as the Colts could’ve hoped for.\n\nThere’s reason to think a healthy Jones quarterbacks the Colts to at least two or three wins during the team’s five-game losing streak.\n\nNow, the Colts’ quarterback questions that have persisted since Andrew Luck retired more than six years ago, will continue.\n\nThe Colts’ cornerback injury woes began in training camp with rookie third-round pick Justin Walley – who looked primed to start – went down with a torn ACL during a joint practice.\n\nThe Colts released third-year corner JuJu Brents, a 2023 second-round pick, after Brents struggled with a hamstring injury. The team’s former starter, 2023 seventh-round pick Jaylon Jones, also had hamstring issues throughout the summer and again in Week 1, sidelining him until early-November.\n\nThe Colts were forced to look outside the organization late in the summer to fill a key spot alongside major offseason signing Charvarius Ward, an All-Pro corner signed to a three-year deal in the spring. Four games into a return to the field, however, former Dolphins corner Xavien Howard retired after he was targeted and exploited routinely against the Broncos and Rams.\n\nThe Colts – plagued further by injury as Ward missed six of the team’s first 10 games due to a series of concussions – were forced to return to a combination of Mekhi Blackmon, acquired from the Vikings for a sixth-round pick in the preseason, undrafted rookie Jonathan Edwards and Cameron Mitchell, added to the practice squad in October.\n\nThe team traded for All-Pro corner Sauce Gardner at the deadline for two first-round picks and receiver Adonai Mitchell, but Gardner would play just two full games with Indianapolis before a calf injury two plays into a Week 13 game against Houston. Thinking they’d locked down the best corner tandem in the league for the stretch run, the Colts saw Ward and Gardner share the field for a single game. By the time Gardner returned to practice this week, Ward had been lost for the year with his third concussion.\n\nThe Colts secondary has given up the second-most passing yards per game in the league this year (250.7) while it's tied for 21st in yards gained per pass attempt allowed (7.2) and tied for 22nd in yards per completion allowed (11.2).\n\nThough he's second in the league in rushing yards in 2025, what was once on pace to be a historic 2025 campaign for Colts running back Jonathan Taylor has turned far more pedestrian of late.\n\nSince the Colts’ Week 11 bye – which followed Taylor’s 244 rushing yards and three touchdowns in Berlin against the Falcons – the Colts’ tailback has just 350 yards in five games while averaging a paltry 3.5 yards per carry. Taylor was averaging 6.0 yards per rush at the season’s halfway mark.\n\nWhat’s worse is Indianapolis’ run game has lost its explosiveness . Before the Colts’ bye, significant chunks of Taylor’s 1,139 rushing yards had come off “explosive runs” – carries of 10 yards or longer, which the sixth-year back was achieving nearly 15% of the time.\n\nIn the five games – and 99 carries – since, Taylor has just eight such carries, with only one of them even hitting 15 yards (an early-game 27-yard carry against the Chiefs). In only one game since the Colts’ bye has Taylor even averaged 4.0 yards per carry (on 21 carries for 85 yards against the Texans), and he picked up just 2.9 yads per carry on Monday against the 49ers – one of the 10 worst games of his career.\n\nDeForest Buckner, a captain for the Colts and the soul of its defense, missed five games due to a herniated disc in his neck and a compressed nerve suffered in the Colts’ Week 9 loss in Pittsburgh. The Colts went 1-4 during his absence, which corresponded with a downturn in the defense’s ability to put pressure on the quarterback and defend the run.\n\nIn the five games Buckner missed, the Colts defense registered just 10 sacks – seven coming against the Falcons and Chiefs. Of those 10 sacks, four have been by linebackers or safeties. A defense that with Buckner ranked top 6 in sacks is now tied for 13th, a slip due to offenses no longer having to double Buckner and an Indianapolis defense line often incapable of winning one-on-one battles.\n\nDuring the Colts’ time without Bucker, the Colts defense also gave up 109.8 yards per game on the ground, a figure that would rank 14th-best over the course of the season. Before he was sidelined, the Colts were one of the best run-stopping units in the league.\n\nBackup quarterback Anthony Richardson fractured his orbital bone after he was struck in the face by an apparatus that snapped after the third-year quarterback had attached a stretching band to it in the locker room to begin his pre-game warmups ahead of the Colts’ Week 6 home game against the Cardinals. He required surgery and only returned to practice ahead of the team’s Week 16 game against the 49ers.\n\nBut Richardson has vision issues that have kept the Colts coaching staff and front office from returning him to the active roster.\n\nWhen Jones went down one quarter into the game in Jacksonville, the Colts were forced to look to rookie sixth-round pick Riley Leonard. He played the first meaningful snaps of his NFL career that afternoon in rain and at a stadium the Colts had not won at in a decade. His performance was valiant – 18-for-29 for 145 yards, an interception and a rushing score – but it wasn’t enough in a 36-19 rout.\n\nIt’s no guarantee having Richardson would’ve guaranteed a win. But having a dynamic, experienced quarterback under center in Jacksonville could’ve brought a bit of a spark, and not needing to ground-and-pound in the same manner in Seattle with Rivers might’ve led to just enough offense to tack on another win in 2025.\n\nIn what had already been a rocky, up-and-down tenure with the Colts, Adonai Mitchell didn't hold onto the football through the goal line on a runaway touchdown catch-and-run against the Rams.\n\nDown three in the second half of the Week 4 game with the Rams, Mitchell was on the final steps of a career-play – what should’ve been a 76-yard touchdown. Instead, the ball slipped out of his fingertips as he attempted to change hands as he prepared to cross the goal line. The ball rolled through the back of the end zone and was instead ruled a 75-yard catch, fumble and touchback.\n\nInstead of going up four points early in the third quarter, the Colts defense stumbled to the finish, giving up a pair of touchdowns in the final four minutes to lose 27-20 against a team that now has an argument as one of the best in the league.\n\nHad Mitchell not dropped that ball, there’s a real chance the Colts could’ve started 8-0 and come out of their Week 11 bye 9-1. It doesn’t mean they’d be sitting any better than 9-6 at this point, but at minimum, the Colts could’ve still had a chance to keep their playoff hopes alive in Week 17 with a potential win-and-in Week 18 matchup in Houston.\n\nThree plays later, the Colts were across midfield, and within four plays – and with just over 2:30 left on the clock – Indianapolis sat on the Houston 32 with 1st and 10. A one-yard run and a pair of incomplete passes later, the home squad faced 4th-and-long on the 31. Had Badgley connected on his earlier extra point, the Colts could’ve lined him up and attempted a 49-yard game-tying field goal.\n\nThat missed PAT, instead, required a touchdown, with an incomplete pass turned the ball over on downs. It was Badgley's third missed PAT in his seven games with the Colts and Badgley was waived the next day.\n\nJoel A. Erickson and Nathan Brown cover the Colts all season.

    "fullText": "Lamar Jackson injury history: A complete timeline of injuries for Ravens QB originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere is no doubt Baltimore Ravens QB Lamar Jackson is one of the most electrifying players in the NFL when healthy, but keeping him 100% healthy has been a challenge at times.\n\nBetween MVP campaigns in 2019 and 2023, Jackson ended two seasons on the sidelines due to injury, and 2025 quickly began to get away from the Ravens when another injury struck.\n\nIt’s likely no coincidence Jackson’s fully healthy seasons have been far and away his best. After recovering from injury in 2022, Jackson returned to MVP form, winning his second MVP award in 2023 before putting together an even more impressive campaign the following season from a statistical standpoint.\n\nHere’s a look back at Jackson’s injury history and how many games he has missed due to injury.\n\nMORE:Explaining the Lamar Jackson trade rumors\n\nAfter missing one game for a pre-playoff break in 2019 and another due to COVID-19 in 2020, Jackson missed his first games because of injury in 2021.\n\nWhile a non-COVID illness initially cost him a game against the Chicago Bears in 2021, Jackson went on to miss the Ravens’ final four games of the season with a significant ankle sprain. He suffered the injury early in a loss to the Cleveland Browns in Week 14, and Baltimore limped to an 0-5 finish and missed the playoffs with Jackson out of the mix.\n\nJackson struggled to match his MVP production in 2022, throwing 10 touchdowns over his first three starts but just seven over his final nine before going down with a sprained PCL in his knee.\n\nDespite being labeled week to week and hoping for a playoff return, Jackson missed the final five games of the regular season and the Ravens’ wild-card matchup with the Cincinnati Bengals. Baltimore went 3-3 without Jackson, including a playoff loss, and some wondered whether he had played his last down as a Raven with his contract set to expire after the season.\n\nAfter plenty of speculation about his future, Jackson agreed to a five-year, $260 million contract extension to remain in Baltimore long term.\n\nMORE:Inside Lamar Jackson's family tree\n\nJackson suffered a hamstring injury against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 4 of the 2025 season and didn't return for a month, missing games against the Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Bears with a bye week sandwiched in-between.\n\nThe injury cost Jackson a bit longer than he hoped, as the Bears game had been targeted by the Ravens as his potential return date, but he looked every bit like himself in his return against the Miami Dolphins. Unfortunately for Jackson, that momentum did not last.\n\nAfter returning from a hamstring injury, Jackson struggled to play anything like he did in 2024, throwing four touchdowns and five interceptions across seven starts following his return against the Dolphins.\n\nIn the meantime, Jackson battled various ailments that kept him out of practices. Jackson missed practice time with injuries to his ankle, toe and knee, also missing a practice due to illness. While those injuries never kept him out of a game, his performance appeared to be impacted by them.\n\nJackson exited a prime-time game against the New England Patriots with a back contusion and did not return. He was summarily ruled out of the Ravens’ Week 17 game against the Packers. While Jackson did not receive a formal diagnosis beyond a “deep tissue bruise,” the injury was painful enough that he could not return to a pivotal game against an AFC contender.\n\nMORE: Where does Lamar Jackson rank among the 13 greatest Ravens of all time?\n\nBefore his back contusion deep into the 2025 season, Jackson missed 17 games over eight NFL seasons, including the playoffs. Here is the complete breakdown:\n\nJackson's 17 missed games include two due to pre-playoffs rest and two due to illness. His longest injury-related absence spanned six games, as Jackson missed the Ravens' final five regular season games and a playoff game with a sprained PCL in his knee in 2022.",

Well, the Texans took care of business today and defeated the Chargers, which has clinched the AFC West for the Denver Broncos.\n\nAFC WEST CHAMPS.\n\nGoal No. 1 ✅\n\nAnd we’re still climbing. pic.twitter.com/yHbSmyw8Ww\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) December 28, 2025\n\nThis is the Broncos’ 16th AFC West Championship, their first since 2015, and the first for Head Coach Sean Payton and quarterback Bo Nix.\n\nThe Broncos have been on a magical run this season, and after starting the season 1-2, they ripped off 11 straight wins and are now AFC West champions and the favorites for the number one seed in the AFC. They have been led by their elite defense and second-year quarterback Bo Nix, who has improved as the season went on and has led multiple 4th quarter comebacks and game-winning drives.\n\nWith a postseason berth and now the AFC West locked up, the Broncos will set their sights on the number one seed in the AFC. They can clinch the one seed as early as tomorrow, but they will need a lot of help for that to happen. They will need the Patriots to lose to the Jets, the Bills to lose to the Eagles, and the Jaguars to lose to Grandpa Phillip Rivers and the Colts. All three of those scenarios playing out tomorrow are highly unlikely, so the Broncos will likely need to win next weekend, at Mile High, vs. the Chargers.\n\nThe Broncos are back where they belong. Three years ago, the team fired Nathaniel Hackett the day after Christmas and just signed quarterback Russell Wilson to a contract that would age poorly. Now, three years later. Sean Payton has led the Broncos back to being Super Bowl contenders, and Bo Nix is your franchise quarterback.\n\nTIME TO CELEBRATE BRONCOS COUNTRY, THE DENVER BRONCOS ARE YOUR 2025 AFC WEST CHAMPIONS!",

The Houston Texans beat the Los Angeles Chargers on Saturday, which precludes Jacksonville from clinching the division title on Sunday if they beat the Colts. However, a win over Indianapolis would leave Jacksonville in first place holding a one game lead over Houston heading into Week 18.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars clinched a playoff berth this past week, but can clinch something more important in Week 17. They are in control of their fate in the AFC South and clinch the division title as soon as this week. They need a win and some help from their Houston division-mates.\n\nThe Jaguars face the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday and are 5.5-point favorites. Jacksonville will be without right guard Patrick Mekari due to a back injury, while center Robert Hainsey is questionable with a groin injury. The Colts will be without center Tanor Bortolini (concussion) and defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (back). Their list of questionable players includes cornerback Sauce Gardner (calf) and right guard Dalton Tucker (shoulder).\n\nIf the Jaguars clinch the AFC South, it would be their first playoff appearance and division title since 2022. That year, they beat the Chargers in the Wild Card round and then lost to the Chiefs in the Divisional Round. They have won their division four times prior to this sesason.\n\nThe Jaguars can clinch the AFC South with a win and a Texans loss or tie against the Chargers on Saturday.

They could clinch the top seed with some more help on Sunday, but for now they’re guaranteed a top three seed in the 2026 NFL Playoffs.\n\nUpdate (Christmas night): Denver’s win over the Chiefs on Christmas night keeps both of their scenarios alive for Week 17. The Broncos will clinch the AFC West with a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans on Saturday night. Denver can also clinch the No. 1 seed in the conference with a Patriots loss to the Jets, a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans, a Jaguars loss or tie against the Colts, and a Bills loss or tie against the Eagles.\n\nThe Denver Broncos travel to GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas night to take on the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAnd the Broncos can make it a wonderful Christmas for themselves and their fans with a win over their division rivals, and a little bit of help from around the rest of the league. Denver can clinch both the AFC West, and the No. 1 seed in the AFC, here in Week 17.\n\nThe Denver Broncos last won the AFC West back in 2015.\n\nPeyton Manning — yes, the guy from the commercials — was their starting quarterback.\n\nBut Denver can clinch the AFC West title this week, officially bringing to an end the Kansas City Chiefs’ reign atop the division. With a win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, and a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie against the Houston Texans on Saturday, the Broncos are AFC West champions.\n\nDenver can also clinch the AFC West with a tie against the Chiefs, provided the Chargers lose to the Texans.\n\nNot only can Denver clinch the AFC West this weekend, but the Broncos also have a narrow path to clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC, something that again the team has not accomplished since that 2015 season.\n\nHowever, Denver would need a lot of help to wrap that up this weekend.\n\nFirst, the Broncos would need to win against the Chiefs on Thursday night. Then, the Broncos would need the New England Patriots to lose to the New York Jets, the Chargers to lose or tie against the Texans, the Jacksonville Jaguars to lose or tie against the Indianapolis Colts, and the Buffalo Bills to lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nSo you’re saying there’s a chance …\n\nHere are the full AFC standings heading into Week 17:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nAFC West standings entering Week 17\n\nHere are the full AFC West standings with two weeks left in the season:\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x",

    "description": "Coach JJ Redick said he calmly delivered a message to his players that it was time for \"reconnection\" with the team's second-leading scorer sideline at least a month.",
    "fullText": "After the Lakers’ third straight loss Thursday, JJ Redick promised things would get “uncomfortable.” The second-year coach, frustrated after the team delivered a lump of coal in a Christmas Day blowout by the Houston Rockets, said he couldn’t stand to rewatch the same tired story. Leaning his elbow on the table at his postgame news conference, Redick called out players who don’t give enough effort on defense or play hard.\n\nTwo days later he stood in front of reporters with a different tone.\n\n“Recalibration,” Redick said calmly of the message he delivered during Saturday’s team meeting. “Reconnection.”\n\nRedick has cooled, but the Lakers still are under fire. Not only are they trying to snap a season-high three-game losing streak at home Sunday against the Sacramento Kings (6:30 p.m.), but also the Lakers (19-10) still are looking for their first home win in December and must navigate this defining moment without guard Austin Reaves.\n\nReaves was diagnosed with a grade 2 strain in his left calf Friday and will be reevaluated in four weeks. The latest setback comes less than two weeks after he was sidelined because of a “mild” strain in the same calf that kept him out for three games.\n\nReaves is averaging career highs in points (26.6), assists (6.3) and rebounds (5.2) and his ascent from undrafted rookie to potential first-time All-Star was one of the team’s feel-good stories of the season. Reaves scored a career-high 51 points against Sacramento in October, rescuing the Lakers in a game without LeBron James or Luka Doncic and showing Reaves’ potential in a starring role.\n\nNow without their second-leading scorer, the Lakers are looking for their supporting cast to step up.\n\n“We just need our guys to be stars in their roles,” Redick said. “Certainly from a top-end talent standpoint, it diminishes that. But it doesn't change the non-negotiables or how we're trying to play.”\n\nAfter losing the last three games by an average of 20.7 points per game, the Lakers needed to get reacquainted with their non-negotiables during Saturday’s meeting. The session was uncomfortable in the way confronting truth can be uncomfortable, Redick said. It wasn’t just coaches lecturing, but also players speaking up.\n\nThe top priority was creating more clarity, Redick said. The team needed to get back to building its defensive fundamentals after so many lineup changes because of injuries. The Lakers have used 16 different starting lineups in 29 games and have to readjust their rotation again in Reaves’ absence.\n\n“Togetherness is going to have to be emphasized to where it looks like an exaggeration,” center Deandre Ayton said, “where it becomes a habit. And that's what winners do. And it's pretty easy for this team. It's just that there's always a different group out there and we're going to get it for sure.”\n\nForward Rui Hachimura said coaches reminded players of the team’s three pillars that again were displayed on a screen in the practice gym Saturday — championship habits, championship communication, championship shape.\n\n“We just talk about everybody, players, coaches, we just gotta kind of tighten up,” Hachimura said. “We had a good stretch in the beginning and now we kind of, I don't know, we relaxed or we kind of got tired of winning, you know, but we just stopped doing what we're supposed to do.”\n\nThe Lakers are 29th in the NBA in defensive rating in the last 15 games, giving up 122.2 points per 100 possessions. It’s a significant drop from their rating of 113.7 in the first 14 games in which they went 10-4.\n\nSince James returned from, the Lakers’ preferred starting lineup — Doncic, Reaves, James, Ayton and Hachimura — has a net rating of minus-19.9 in seven games.\n\nOffensively the Lakers have lacked organization since James came back, Redick acknowledged. James declined to speak to reporters after practice.\n\n“Too many random possessions,” Redick said. “That's on me.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "ORLANDO (AP) — Jovesa Damuni scored on a 4-yard run with two minutes remaining and No. 12 BYU rallied from an 11-point deficit in the second half for a 25-21 win over No. 24 Georgia Tech on Saturday in the Pop-Tarts Bowl.\n\nDamuni’s scoring run capped a nine-play, 70 drive by the Cougars (12-2), who were led by freshman quarterback Bear Bachmeier. Bachmeier passed for 57 yards in the drive.\n\nBachmeier was 27 for 38 passing for 325 yards with a touchdown and an interception as the Cougars piled up 426 total yards. It was the freshman’s third 300-yard passing game of the season.\n\nGeorgia Tech (9-4) had a chance to tie the game when senior quarterback Haynes King found Eric Rivers down the sideline with a 66-yard pass on fourth-and-15 to the BYU 18-yard line with 35 seconds to play. Facing fourth down, King threw to the end zone for Jamal Haynes, but BYU’s Evan Johnson intercepted the pass in the end zone to secure the victory.\n\nKing was 23 for 41 passing for 254 yards, two touchdowns and the game-ending interception.\n\nThe Cougars fell 11 points behind due to a 10-second scoring binge by the Yellow Jackets.\n\nGeorgia Tech took a 14-10 lead on a King pass to Rivers with 5:28 to play in the first half. Cody Hagen muffed the ensuing kickoff and the Yellow Jackets recovered the fumble. One play later, King found tight end J.T. Byrne for a 6-yard TD pass.\n\nThe game was defined by red zone troubles.\n\nBYU took the opening drive and went for it on fourth and one, but Enoch Nawahine was stopped at the 1-yard line. The Cougars were 4 for 6 in the red zone, throwing an interception in the end zone in the third quarter.\n\nGeorgia Tech converted early, but ended the game 3 for 6 in the red zone, too. The Yellow Jackets fumbled the ball after a short catch in the third quarter at the 11-yard line. Aiden Birr’s 35-yard field goal late in the third quarter was blocked.\n\nThe game ended on a BYU interception in the end zone.\n\nWith a throw late in the second quarter, King set a Georgia Tech record for completions in a career. King finished his career with 676 completions in three seasons with the Yellow Jackets, passing Reggie Ball’s mark of 662 completions.\n\nKing also became the second player in Yellow Jackets’ history with 10,000 total yards, joining Joe Hamilton, who played at Georgia Tech from 1996-99 and tallied 10,640 yards.\n\nKing finished his career with 10,184 yards of total offense.\n\nGeorgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets ended a breakthrough season with Brent Key in disappointment, losing their final three games to miss out on the ACC championship game and College Football Playoff.\n\nBYU: The Cougars scored another bowl victory and won their 12th game of the season, the first time BYU has won 12 games in a season since 2001.\n\nGeorgia Tech is to open its 2026 season at home against Colorado on Sept. 5.\n\nBYU will open the 2026 season at home against Utah Tech on Sept. 5.",

    "fullText": "Sorry, NBC. For your late-season game streamed exclusively* on Peacock, you were expecting Jordan Love vs. Lamar Jackson with playoff implications. Instead, you’re getting Malik Willis vs. Tyler Huntley instead.\n\n*Except in the Green Bay, Milwaukee, and Baltimore markets, which will get the game on local NBC stations.\n\nTo be sure, Willis vs. Huntley is pretty darn good as backup quarterback matchups go. Willis has been excellent for the Packers in the last two years when called upon to fill in for Love, while Huntley has been much the same as Jackson’s backup for five of the last six seasons. In fact, Huntley somehow even made a Pro Bowl in 2022, albeit as the sixth quarterback option for the AFC.\n\nIn any case, the game still has significant potential postseason implications for both of these teams. The losing team in this game will be eliminated from division contention with a loss, with Baltimore being eliminated from the playoffs outright if the Packers win. Green Bay is in the postseason already, but a loss locks them into the #7 seed instead.\n\nBoth teams still need considerable help to win their divisions, however, and even with a win could be knocked out with a single result going awry for them on Sunday.\n\nJoin us here at Acme Packing Company to discuss everything happening in and around tonight’s game!\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers will square off against the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday in Week 17, and Matt LaFleur's squad will be without starting quarterback Jordan Love.\n\nLove left the Packers' Week 16 defeat to the Chicago Bears early due to a concussion and was ruled out for Saturday's contest versus the Ravens. That means Malik Willis will take over as the starter for Green Bay.\n\nWillis has made a few appearances for the Packers over the last two years, but let's get to know Green Bay's reliable backup quarterback.\n\nWills began his college career at Auburn, but transferred after just two seasons with the Tigers due to a lack of playing time. The dynamic signal-caller committed to Liberty, where he tossed 47 touchdowns and 18 interceptions with 27 scores on the ground as well.\n\nAfter the 2021 season, Willis entered the 2022 NFL Draft and was selected in the third round by the Tennessee Titans.\n\nEntering the league, Willis had a ton of hype around him, but his tenure with the Titans was short-lived and underwhelming. He spent just two years in Tennessee, making three starts and never throwing a touchdown pass.\n\nAfter the 2024 preseason, where he showed improvement and promise, Willis was traded to the Packers to be Love's backup.\n\nThough he wasn't expected to play a pivotal role, Willis was thrown into the fire during Weeks 2 and 3 of the 2024 season after Love went down with an injury. In those two starts, Willis dazzled, winning both games against the Indianapolis Colts and his former team, the Titans.\n\nWillis finished the 2024 campaign with three touchdown passes, no interceptions, and a 74.1% completion rate. He also added a rushing touchdown.\n\nSo far in 2025, Willis hasn't made a start, but he's still played well when tasked to fill in for Love. The 26-year-old is now set for his first start of the season against the Ravens in a game Green Bay must win to stay alive in the NFC North division race.\n\nLions rumor opens door for Detroit to hire new OC from rival\n\nFred Warner injury update is exciting news for 49ers\n\nJoe Burrow expected to be subject of offseason trade calls\n\nSteelers injury updates offer good and bad news for Week 17\n\nMax Brosmer made NFL history that will make Lions fans sick",

    "fullText": "The NFL has fined Chicago Bears defensive end Austin Booker for a couple of illegal hits on Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love in last Saturday night's game, according to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\n\nBooker was fined $11,636 total for his two hits on Love, including one that knocked Love out of the game with a concussion. It was the more controversial call of the two considering Love lowered his helmet to initiate helmet-to-helmet contact. But Booker was flagged, and now penalized, regardless.\n\nWhen Love exited the game, the Bears defense struggled against backup quarterback Malik Willis, whose mobility proved to be an issue. But Chicago's bend-don't-break defense, coupled with quarterback Caleb Williams' fourth-quarter heroics, was able to pull off an improbable 22-16 overtime win.\n\nMeanwhile, the NFL did not fine Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon for his late hit on wide receiver DJ Moore early in the first quarter. But Moore got the last laugh as he scored the game-winning touchdown in overtime with Nixon draped over him in the end zone.\n\nFollow Bears Wire on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears DE Austin Booker fined for two hits on Packers QB Jordan Love",

    "fullText": "Chargers playoff picture: How loss to Texans impacts AFC wild-card race, LA's postseason chances originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers have emerged as a contender in a crowded AFC, but after a loss to the Houston Texans on Saturday, they can start packing their bags for their first playoff game.\n\nLos Angeles dropped its Week 17 matchup against Houston, falling to 11-5 on the season and ceding the AFC West crown to the Denver Broncos, who had already clinched the division earlier in the week. The Chargers have secured a playoff spot for the second straight season, but will now do so as a wild-card team.\n\nThe loss to the Texans, who were fighting for their own playoff lives, locks the Chargers into a road game in the wild-card round, likely as the fifth or sixth seed in the AFC bracket. While Jim Harbaugh’s team entered Week 17 with a slim but viable chance to claim the coveted AFC West title and host a home game, the defeat eliminates that possibility and shifts the focus entirely to the final regular-season matchup.\n\nHere’s where the Chargers stand in the AFC playoff picture.\n\nNFL Week 17 picks against the spread\n\nThe Chargers have officially cemented their place in the postseason, but after the tough Week 17 loss to the Texans, the AFC West title is officially out of reach. That loss, which dropped the Chargers to second place in the division, means the Denver Broncos (13-3) have officially clinched the AFC West crown for the first time since 2015.\n\nJim Harbaugh's team will now shift its focus to securing the best possible Wild Card seed as they prepare for a road trip in the opening round of the playoffs. The Chargers now hold the tiebreaker for the top Wild Card spot over the 11-4 Buffalo Bills due to a better conference record, but Buffalo can take sole possession of that spot with a win over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.\n\nWhile winning the AFC West is no longer an option, the Chargers' Week 18 matchup against the division-champion Broncos remains critical. The outcome of that game will determine whether the Chargers can maintain their hold on the No. 5 seed or drop to the No. 6 seed, which would dictate their Wild Card opponent and likely a tougher travel schedule.\n\nAfter securing their playoff ticket, the Chargers now focus on building momentum for the postseason, where they will try to make a run at the AFC Championship and the Super Bowl from the Wild Card position.\n\nCurrently, the Chargers sit at the No. 6 seed in the AFC.\n\nWith a win in Week 18, the Chargers would clinch at least the No. 6 seed. They need the Bills to lose to either the Eagles or the Jets to remain in the 5 seed.\n\nSix of the seven teams in the AFC playoffs have clinched, with the AFC North spot being the one up in the air. The Bills can still catch the Patriots for the AFC East and the Texans can catch the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nMORE: Meet Chargers QB Justin Herbert's family",

The Colts are a 5.5-point home underdog against the Jaguars while the Texans are a 1.5-point road underdog against the Chargers.\n\nThe Colts eliminated themselves from AFC South contention in Week 16 when they lost to the 49ers on Monday Night Football. That race is down to the Jaguars and Texans.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: 11-4 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nThe Colts only chance at a playoff berth requires them winning their final two games and the Texans losing their final two games. This would move the Colts into seventh place and they would hold the final wild card spot. In Week 17, the Texans face the Chargers on Saturday at 4:30 p.m. ET. If the Texans win or tie against the Chargers, the Colts are eliminated.

That collapse means they have now gone five straight seasons without a playoff berth.\n\nTheir last trip to the postseason came after the 2020 season. That was Philip Rivers' last full season in the NFL and the Colts coaxed the quarterback out of retirement a couple of weeks ago after Daniel Jones tore his Achilles. Rivers has played better than most people would have predicted, but the results haven't changed and the Colts will be left to ponder what might have been.\n\nThey'll also be left without their next two first-round picks to help shore up the roster. They sent both those selections to the Jets in a trade for cornerback Sauce Gardner and the first of those picks will be coming a lot earlier in the 2026 first round than originally anticipated as a result of the late season swoon in Indianapolis.",

    "fullText": "In banking, telecom, and payments, reliability is not a nice to have. It is table stakes. The most reliable systems I have worked on reduce entire classes of bugs before the code even runs. Functional programming and Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) let you push correctness into the type system, so illegal states cannot be constructed in the first place.\n\nMost production incidents are not due to complex algorithms. They are due to the code entering a state that should never have been possible. If you have been on call, you have seen variants of these:\n\nFunctional programming helps by modeling the domain with types that make invalid states unrepresentable. Pure functions and immutability keep behavior predictable and testable.\n\nProduct types combine fields, think \"and\". Sum types choose one of several cases, think \"or\". Together they model your domain rules.\n\nWith this shape, \"paypal\" cannot exist as a Payment. The compiler refuses the value.\n\nWhen you pattern match on a sum type, the compiler can force you to handle every variant. If you later add a new case, every non exhaustive match becomes a compilation error or warning. This is how refactors become safe by default.\n\nAdd a new Crypto method and both code bases will point out every place you must update.\n\nIncident story\n\nA payout worker retries on network timeouts and calls settle() twice. The table allows pending = false and settled = true twice with the same ledger id. Reconciliation finds duplicates and accounting needs a manual fix.\n\nWhy it happened\n\nState is spread across booleans and strings. The database does not express the lifecycle. The application code does, but only by convention and tests.\n\nTransitions become total functions. You can return a Result when a transition is not allowed.\n\nNow the illegal transitions are blocked by construction. Test coverage still matters, but the shape of the model prevents a class of bugs.\n\nRefactor safety\n\nWhen product adds Chargeback, the compiler highlights every match that ignores it. You cannot ship with a half handled lifecycle.\n\nEvery switch on TxnState now requires a chargeback branch. This is free guidance from the compiler.\n\nIncident story\n\nThe call detail record pipeline generates billing events whenever it sees a Connected event. Under jitter and retries, some sessions never receive Completed. The billing system charges based on the wrong boundary and customers complain.\n\nWhy it happened\n\nThe call lifecycle is implicit across many services. A connected session with no end was still billable because there was no type that separated non billable states from billable ones.\n\nNow a connected but never completed call cannot produce a billable duration. The shape forbids the bug.\n\nIncident story\n\nA cache TTL is stored in an environment variable. Someone sets CACHE_TTL_SECS=30s. In JavaScript, Number(\"30s\") yields NaN and your code treats it as zero, disabling caching in production.\n\nThe ambiguity disappears. The code must handle absence and parse errors explicitly.\n\nDo not use null to mean \"maybe\". Do not throw exceptions for expected errors.\n\nThese types make the happy path and the error path equally explicit.\n\nMutable shared state is a common source of heisenbugs under concurrency. Prefer immutable data and pure functions. When you need to update, create a new value.\n\nYour tests become simple. Given the same inputs, the function returns the same output.\n\nNumbers are not self describing. Create types that carry meaning.\n\nYou stop mixing milliseconds with seconds or dollars with cents by accident.\n\nKeep the domain logic pure and push IO to the edges. This makes unit tests cheap and fast.\n\nStart small and make continuous progress. Here is a practical order for a team new to these ideas.\n\nReplace pairs of booleans with a sum type\n\nReplace string enums with discriminated unions\n\nReplace nullable fields with Option\n\nReplace thrown control flow with Result\n\nIntroduce newtypes or branded types for units and ids\n\nPattern matching compiles to simple branches. Discriminated unions in TypeScript are just plain objects. The main cost you will feel is validation at the boundaries in smart constructors. This is a trade worth making. The compiler then protects the interior of the system.\n\nReliability is designed. With Algebraic Data Types, pattern matching, Option and Result, immutability, and smart constructors, you encode domain rules directly in your types. Illegal states cannot compile. This is why industries that cannot afford failure, such as banking and telecom, gravitate to functional ideas.\n\nIf you work on code that touches money, minutes, or public availability, adopt these patterns now.\n\nYour on call shifts will be quieter, and your users will notice the difference.",

    "fullText": "Lars,\nNiklas Hehenkamp and\nMarkus\n\nReports of GNSS interference in the Baltic Sea have become almost routine — airplanes losing GPS, ships drifting off course, and timing systems failing. But what happens when a group of engineers decides to build a navigation system that simply *doesn’t care* about the jammer?\n\nSince 2017, we’ve been developing **R-Mode**, a terrestrial navigation system that uses existing radio beacons and maritime infrastructure to provide independent positioning — no satellites needed. In this talk, we’ll share our journey from an obscure research project that “nobody needs” to a system now seen as crucial for resilience and sovereignty. Expect technical insights, field stories from ships in the Baltic, and reflections on what it means when a civilian backup system suddenly attracts military interest.\n\nSince 2017, our team at DLR and partners across Europe have been working on an alternative to satellite navigation: **R-Mode**, a backup system based on terrestrial transmitters. Our main testbed spans the Baltic Sea — a region now infamous for GNSS jamming and spoofing.\n\nWe’ll start by showing what GNSS interference actually means in practice: aircraft losing navigation data, ships switching to manual control, and entire regions facing timing outages — such as the recent disruption of telecommunications in Gdańsk during Easter 2025.\n\nThen we’ll take you behind the scenes of building R-Mode: designing signals that can coexist with legacy systems, installing transmitters along the coast, and testing shipborne receivers in rough conditions. We’ll share personal moments — like the first time we received a stable position fix in the middle of the Baltic.\n\nFinally, we’ll talk about perception and politics: how a “research curiosity” became a critical infrastructure project, why ESA now wants to build a *satellite* backup (with the same vulnerabilities), and how it feels when your civilian open-source navigation system suddenly becomes strategically relevant.\n\nLicensed to the public under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\n\nThis Talk was translated into multiple languages.

Ulster, meanwhile, were undermined by ill-discipline with seven penalties conceded ensuring they had precious little territory to speak of across the first half hour.\n\nTwo of those transgressions came on their own feed at the scrum with the latter of those punished by a Gilbert penalty.\n\nIn what was their first attack of any note, Zac Ward reduced the arrears seven minutes before half-time after the ball was moved well through the hands of Kok and Jacob Stockdale, although Connacht were adamant that Juarno Augustus had knocked on at the prior ruck.\n\nIt was Connacht then falling foul of the referee's whistle and, after another penalty, Ward was in for his second with the last play of the half after more good work from the industrious Kok.\n\nUlster changed both props at half-time, bringing on Angus Bell and Tom O'Toole and, only two minutes into the half, Irish centres Bundee Aki and Stuart McCloskey were both shown a yellow card for a scuffle after the whistle.\n\nWith both sides down to 14, Ulster were in for their third with Kok this this time on the end of another slick interchange of passes.\n\nJust as Aki and McCloskey returned, Connacht were shown their second yellow card of the game with Joe Joyce sent to the sin bin and shipping a penalty try for illegally stopping an Ulster maul.\n\nThe discipline from both sides - there were 26 penalties in the first hour of the game alone - robbed the contest of any real rhythm and Connacht spurned a key opportunity to get back into the game with another ball lost in contact just prior to the conclusion of Joyce's yellow card.\n\nNumber eight Jansen did cut the deficit with Connacht's second with just under a quarter of an hour to play and, when scrum-half Devine scrambled over from close range 10 minutes later, a grandstand finish was in store.\n\nAfter an important aerial take from Jacob Stockdale, however, Ulster saw out the game with Murphy adding another penalty in the final minute.\n\nConnacht: Gilbert; Ryan, Forde, Aki, Treacy; Carty, B Murphy; Buckley, Heffernan, Bealham; Joyce, O'Connor; J Murphy, Prendergast, Jansen.\n\nReplacements: Tierney-Martin, Duggan, Barrett, Murray, O'Brien, Devine, Ioane, Gavin.\n\nUlster: Stockdale; Kok, Hume, McCloskey, Z Ward; Crean, Stewart, Wilson; Sheridan, Izuchukwu; McCann, Timoney, Augustus.\n\nReplacements: Andrew, Bell, O'Toole, Hopes, B Ward, Doak, Flannery, Postlethwaite.\n\nYellow cards: Murphy, McCloskey",

    "fullText": "As a football idealist, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has specific beliefs about how the game should be played - and the best way to win.\n\nBut his usual philosophy was not the one that brought the Christmas present of a 1-0 Premier League win over Newcastle.\n\nFor one thing, there was the formation switch.\n\nAmorim joked in September that not even the Pope could persuade him to change, but for the first time since he took charge 13 months ago, he fielded a back four.\n\nFor another, victory was achieved with 33.4% possession, their lowest in any game this season. It was United's lowest percentage of possession in a victory since the 29.4% they had when beating against Manchester City in January 2023.\n\nThey had nine shots at Old Trafford compared to Newcastle's 16. The visitors had 43 touches in their opponents' box. Amorim's men had 15.\n\nYet it was Manchester United who prevailed, thanks to a combination of Patrick Dorgu's first goal for the club - which was a sublime first-half volley from the edge of the area - and only a second clean sheet of the season.\n\nIt wasn't pretty. But even for Amorim, sometimes there are days when substance trumps style.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the unequivocal reply when asked if this was one of the 'most satisfying' wins of his, at times, tortuous 13 months in charge.\n\n\"The feeling is good. If you compared to other games, we suffered so much more today but in certain moments we put everything on the line.\n\n\"We are defending every cross. Especially if you see the second half, sometimes we managed to defend with a back six.\n\n\"We had so many games when we controlled the opponent so much better, but it is a good feeling to have a clean sheet. We suffered together. If we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games.\"",

    "description": "A deep dive into Claude Code 2.0 features, Opus 4.5 workflows, and context engineering. Learn sub-agents, MCP servers, hooks, skills, and practical tips to boost your AI-assisted coding productivity.",
    "fullText": "This post is a follow-up to my post from July'25 - My Experience With Claude Code After 2 Weeks of Adventures. If you are new to Claude Code or just want a quick refresh, I am once again asking you to go through it. It covers some lore, my workflow back then and then 80-90% of the Claude Code standard workflow. You may choose to skip the intro although I recommend you read it. Lore is important man.\n\nA short recap - we had covered CLAUDE.md, scratchpad, using task tool (now sub-agents), the general plan + execute workflow, tips for context window management, Sonnet 4 vs Opus 4 (not relevant now), using shortcuts like ! and using Shift + ? to show shortcuts, memory basics, /resume to restart conversation and short discussion on custom commands.\n\nI got a great response on my Opus 4.5 vibe-check tweets and still receieving good feedback on my July blog post (despite being somewhat poorly written). This shows there's clearly a demand for in-depth resources around Claude Code.\n\nI noticed that lots of people, both technical and many non-technical or less hands-on people i.e technically-lite people have started to try Claude Code (CC). CC is more of a general agent - you can use it for tasks other than coding as well - like making an excel invoice, data analysis, errands on your machine etc. And of course everything I talk about is by default meant for coding too.\n\nIf you can learn even 3-4 ideas that help you with using Claude Code (or other tools like Codex/Gemini CLI/OpenCode) or improve your understanding of LLMs, it would be a win for me.\n\nI don't want this post to be a prescription (map). My objective is to show you what is possible and the thought processes and simple things you can keep in mind to get the most out of these tools. I want to show you the map but also the territory.\n\nClaude Code dominated the CLI coding product experience this year and all the CLI products like Codex, OpenCode, Amp CLI, Vibe CLI and even Cursor have heavily taken inspiration from it. This means learning how things work in Claude Code directly transfers to other tools both in terms of personal usage and production grade engineering.\n\nKarpathy sensei posted this which caused the Twitter timeline. This led to a lot of discussion and there were some really good takes - some which I have written about too.\n\nIt's a reasonable crashout - the technology is evolving at a mindblowing pace and it's difficult to keep up for most of us and especially for senior folks and people with high quality standards. Nevertheless, I think if you are reading this post, it's scary but also exciting time to build stuff at speeds never possible before.\n\nInstead of thinking in terms of \"keeping up\", a better framing is how can I improve myself with help of these tools i.e augment.\n\nIn my opinion, there are 3 components to augment yourself:\n\nStay updated with tooling - What Karpathy sensei mentioned. Use these tools regularly and keep up with releases. I have been doing this regularly; it can be draining but I enjoy the process and I have the incentive that it helps me at my job. For the technically lite, even weekly/monthly updates would help.\n\nUpskill in your domain - It's a great time to spread both vertically (domain depth) and horizontally (adjacent areas). The more you know, the better you can prompt - converting unknown unknowns to known unknowns. Experience builds judgement and taste - that's what differentiates professional devs from vibe-coders. Since implementation is much faster now, you can spend more time on taste refinement.\n\nFor software engineering folks, this might mean getting better at good practices, system design, planning - where more thinking is involved. Ask more questions, run more experiments (since you can iterate fast), spend more time on understanding requirements. Using good software engineering practices to create better feedback loops for LLMs (good naming, refactoring, docs, tests, typed annotations, observability etc.). Review code. Please don't forget to come back to my post lol but I liked Addy Osmani's take on this.\n\nThe idea is to let the LLM perform things with input, get output and see errors.\n\nAs an aside, getting better at articulating thoughts via writing helps. One may also try touch typing/writing using speech-to-text tools to operate faster.\n\nThis post will act as a guide for things Karpathy said but you'll need to play around, build intuition and achieve outcomes with help of these tools yourself. The good news is it's fun.\n\nI am having a great time with Claude Code 2.0 since the launch of Opus 4.5 and it's been my daily driver since then. Before we go all lovey-dovey about Claude, I wanted to quickly go through the timeline and lore. I love yapping in my blog and I feel it's important to set the context here.\n\n2025 saw release of many frontier models by OpenAI and Anthropic. Also, it's super under-talked but OpenAI actually caught up to Anthropic in code-generation capability - intelligence wise, context window effectiveness, instruction following and intent detection.\n\nIt's been a wild year and honestly speaking I got tired of trying out new releases by OpenAI every 2 weeks.\n\n>no swe-bench-verified comparison\n>no comparison against opus 4.5\n>\"we are topping in cybersecurity\"\n>mfw i realise i am the fucking eval https://t.co/4oDG3yj6CP pic.twitter.com/aUfJfwROCf\n\nThere have been several Open Source competitors like GLM-4.7, Kimi-K2, Minimax-2.1. The space is very competitive and there is definitely an audience that uses the cheaper priced but high performant Chinese models for low-medium difficulty tasks.\n\nThat said, I still think Anthropic/OpenAI lead over Chinese Frontier models. The latter have contributed \n\n(Note: I am talking with respect to personal coding usage, not production API usage for applications).\n\nI was using Claude Code as my main driver from late June to early September. I cancelled my Claude Max (100 USD/month) sub in early September and switched to using OpenAI Codex as my main driver. Switch was driven by two factors -\n\nclaude code is more enjoyable as a product and has more features. i have always felt to try out more things related to automation in cc as compared to codex. once they drop a new iteration i would consider getting a max sub again if its better than gpt-5-codex\n\nAnthropic also had tonne of API outages and at one point of time they had degradation due to inference bugs. This also was a major driver for several people to move to the next best alternative i.e Codex or GPT-5.1 on Cursor.\n\nI was using Codex (main driver) and Cursor (never cancelled) until late October. Claude Sonnet 4.5 had released on 29th September along with Claude Code 2.0.. and I did take a 20 USD sub from another email account of mine to try it out (I had lots of prompting work and Claude models are my preferred choice) but GPT-5/GPT-5-codex were overall better despite being slow.\n\nSonnet 4.5's problem was fast and good but it would make many haphazard changes which would lead to bugs for me. In other words, I felt it to be producing a lot of slop in comparison to GPT-5.1/GPT-5.1-codex later.\n\nAround October 30, Anthropic sent an email saying we are offering the 200 USD max plan to users who cancelled the subscription and obviously I took it.\n\nchat please remind me to cancel after 28 days😂 pic.twitter.com/TSGidVJ2xo\n\nMy Claude Code usage was still minimal but on 24th November, they launched Opus 4.5 and I had 5 days to try out Opus 4.5. I used the hell out of it for my work and also wrote this highly technical blog with the help of it discovering several of its capabilities.\n\nI had done a similar tweet when I had switched to GPT-5.1 which had gotten half the response of this one. This indicated to me that more people resonated with Opus 4.5 (at least on Twitter) back then. Also, many people were just not able to realise GPT-5.1's capabilities tbh.\n\nOther than the above State of the Art at the coding benchmarks like SWE-bench-verified (code-generation), Tau Bench (agentic stuff), Opus 4.5 was faster, at-par in coding, super collaborative and good at communication. These factors led to my conversion. It had good vibes. More comparison points later in the post.\n\nAs I described in the screenshot, Opus 4.5 was roughly at same code-gen capability with GPT-5.1-Codex-Max.\n\nToday, in my experience I think GPT-5.2-Codex exceeds Opus 4.5 in raw capability by a small margin. Still, Opus 4.5 has been my main driver since release.\n\nI think first reason is it's faster and can do similar difficulty tasks in much lesser time than Codex. Also, it's overall\na much better communicator and pair-programmer than Codex which can even ignore your instructions at times (and go and make changes). Opus has better intent-detection as well.\n\nOne nice-use case shown here by Thariq on creating a background async agent to explain changes to a non-technical person leveraging Claude's explanation abilities.\n\nTo further demonstrate the difference, here's a CC vs Codex comparison\n\nFor the same prompt, see the outputs. Codex tends towards super concise while Claude matches my expectation.\nYou can modify the verbosity in Claude's case but Codex won't budge. Another thing I want to highlight is\nthe UI itself - Claude has more saturated white color on black whereas Codex's text is thinner/less readable\nand the thinking traces are shown in even lighter shade which I don't like.\n\nBecause of being faster not only in terms of lesser thinking to perform task but throughput wise also, it unlocks\nmuch faster feedback loops for your tasks. This makes progress feel more visceral even though capability wise, GPT-5.1/Codex were at par even in November.\nThe only downside with faster loop is if you are cautious, you end up micro-managing for long hours.\n\nOpus 4.5 is a great writer and comes closest to humans so I have always preferred Claude models for customizing prompts.\n\nBesides the model, obviously the Claude Code Product goes a long way to make things magical.\n\nAs a product it's a mile ahead of Codex in QoL features. The harness, prompts and the model make for a magical experience. The model is amazing but there is a massive amount of tasteful engineering that has gone into UX/UI and just the code/prompts to let Claude feel comfortable in the harness and make function calling accurate. We will explore this \n\nBefore we move ahead - my previous post somehow reached Hackernews #5 and I was facing allegations that my post was sponsored by Anthropic. I was like bro are you serious? Anthropic doesn't sponsor random users like me. Anthropic doesn't even think about me (meme.jpeg) besides from a user point of view.\n\nBesides praise, I have been snarky, made fun of outages, made a lot of fun of Sonnet 4.5 slop. I have expressed what I have felt over time and it's led to good discourse on the timeline as well.\n\nAll this said, Claude Code has been one of the most enjoyable product experiences I have ever had. I am grateful and highly respect the engineering and research team behind it.\n\nThat's enough yapping. In the next few sections, I will talk about useful features that I didn't talk about in my previous blog and notable features introduced in the iterations from Claude 2.0 - 2.074.\n\ncurrently using Claude Code for the first time, I can officially put \"Technical-lite\" on my resume now\n\nI am assuming several technical-lite people are gonna read this. Few concepts to help comprehension later in the blog -\n\nMore specifically, context is the input tokens. The context window refers to the maximum amount of tokens that an LLM can see and process at once during a conversation. It's like the model's working memory. Opus 4.5 has a 200K context window which is approximately 150,000 words.\n\nTool calling - Learn about tool calling. Here's a good resource. You know that LLMs can generate text but what if you want the LLM to perform an action - say draft an email or lookup the weather on the internet or just do google search. That's where tools come in. Tools are functions (in code or skills) defined by the engineer that do these exact things. We define tools and we let the LLM know about it in the system prompt and it can decide which tool to call when you are chatting with it! Once the tool call i.e the action is performed, the results are relayed back to the LLM.\n\nAgent - The simplest definition is an LLM that can pro-actively run tools to achieve a goal. For a more sophisticated definition, I like the one by Anthropic\n\n\"Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.\" from Building Effective Agents.\n\n\"Agentic\" - refers to the tool calling capabilities of the model - how pro-active, how accurate the tool calling is (detecting user's intent to perform the action, choosing the correct tool, knowing when to stop)\n\nHarness/scaffolding - Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5 are the models. They need to be provided with lots of \"scaffolding\" / layers of code, prompts, tool calls and software packaging/environment to make them work in a semi-autonomous fashion. Note that Claude Code is not a harness, it's a product (think the TUI, integrations etc.). Claude Code has a harness.\n\nClaude Code has had lots of AI features and quality of life improvements since July. Let's look at the ones that I found to be useful. You can see all changes in the Changelog.\n\nAsk mode options - Another thing I like is Option 3 when it asks questions in the syntax highlighting image above - \"Type here to tell Claude what to do differently\". Fun fact: All these are really prompts for the model whose output is parsed by another tool call and shown in this way.\n\nUltrathink - I like to spam ultrathink for hard tasks or when I want Opus 4.5 to be more rigorous e.g. explaining me something, self-reviewing its changes\n\nThinking toggle - Tab to toggle thinking on/off was a good feature. They changed it to Alt/Option + Tab recently but there's a bug and it does not work on Mac. Anyways CC defaults to thinking always true if you check in your settings.json\n\nPrompt history search - Search through prompts using Ctrl + R (similar to terminal backsearch). I have it in 2.0.74. It can search across project wide conversations. Repeatedly do Ctrl + R to cycle through results.\n\nCursor cycling - When you reach beginning/end of prompt, press down/up to cycle around\n\nMessage queue navigation - It's possible to navigate through queued messages and image attachments (2.0.73) now (idk if it's possible to display image attachment as well).\n\nFuzzy file search - File suggestion is 3x faster and supports fuzzy search (2.0.72)\n\nLSP support was added recently. Access via plugins.\n\nThere have been new integrations too like Slack Integration, Claude Web (beta), Claude Chrome extension. These are pretty obvious and I won't cover these. I think Claude Web would be interesting for many particularly (since you can launch tasks from iOS/Android too).\n\nNext few sub-sections are all about most used features.\n\nI didn't cover commands properly in my previous blog post. You can use / to access the built-in slash commands. These are pre-defined prompts that perform a specific task.\n\nIf these don't cover a specific task you want, then you can create a custom command. When you enter a command, that prompt gets appended to the current conversation/context and the main agent begins to perform the task.\n\nCommands can be made on a project level or global level. Project level resides at .claude/commands/ and global one at ~/.claude/commands.\n\nOften when the context window starts getting full or I feel the model is struggling with a complex task, I want to start a new conversation using /clear. Claude provides /compact which also runs faster in CC 2.0 but sometimes I prefer to make Claude write what happened in current session (with some specific stuff) before I kill it and start a new one. I made a /handoff command for this.\n\nIf you find yourself writing a prompt for something repetitively and instructions can be static/precise, it's a good idea to make a custom command. You can tell Claude to make custom commands. It knows how (or it will search the web and figure it out via claude-code-guide.md) and then it will make it for you.\n\nYou can find a bunch of commands, hooks, skills at awesome-claude-code though I recommend to build your own or search for one only when it's really required.\n\nI have a command called bootstrap-repo that searches the repo with 10 parallel sub-agents to create a comprehensive doc. I rarely use it these days and so many parallel sub-agents lead to the Claude Code flickering bug lol.\n\nAnyways, notice the \"Explore\" sub-agent and \"running in background\".\n\nSub-agents were introduced shortly after I published my last blogpost. Sub-agents are separate Claude instances that are spawned if the main agent wishes so or you explicitly tell it to do so. These powers are defined already in system prompt and sometimes you just have to remind... Understanding these features will help you micro-manage Claude haha.\n\nYou can also define your custom sub-agents. To create one:\n\nOr just use /agents to manage and create sub-agents automatically - recommended approach.\n\nThe \"Explore\" thing in above pic is a sub-agent. You can tell Claude \"Launch explore agent with Sonnet 4.5\" if you want it to use Sonnet instead of Haiku (I found this by just trying things out but we will see how this happens)\n\nThe Explore agent is a read-only file search specialist. It can use Glob, Grep, Read, and limited Bash commands to navigate codebases but is strictly prohibited from creating or modifying files.\n\nYou will notice how thorough the prompt is in terms of specifying when to use what tool call. Well, most people underestimate how hard it's to make tool calling work accurately.\n\nThis is the Explore agent prompt from 2.0.56 and it should be similar now too. Reference. These are captured by intercepting requests. Reference video.\n\nIn case of Explore sub-agent, it starts with a fresh slate which makes sense. It does not inherit any context from main agent. Many tasks involve searching through large amounts of digital media or code to filter for something relevant. Often the individual parts are independent of each other when you want to filter for something so launching parallel agents makes sense.\n\nIf I am trying to understand a feature or just looking up simple things in the codebase, I let Claude do the Explore agent searches. Explore agent passes a summary back to the main agent and then Opus 4.5 will publish the results or may choose to go through each file itself. If it does not, I explicitly tell it to.\n\nIt's important that the model goes through each of the relevant files itself so that all that ingested context can attend to each other. That's the high level idea of attention. Make context cross with previous context. This way model can extract more pair-wise relationships and therefore better reasoning and prediction. Explore agent returns summaries which can be lossy compression. When Opus 4.5 reads all relevant context itself, it knows what details are relevant to what context. This insight goes a long way even in production applications (but you only get it if someone tells you or you have read about self-attention mechanism).\n\nCodex does not have a concept of sub-agents and it's probably a conscious decision by the devs. GPT-5.2 has a 400K context window\nand according to benchmarks, it's long context retrieval capabilities are a massive improvement. Although people have tried\nmaking Codex use headless claude as sub-agents haha. You can just do things.\n\nThe general-purpose and plan sub-agent (separate from plan mode) inherit the context. With respect to user defined sub-agents, I am not sure but I think they start with clean slate.\n\nFrom the reverse engineered resources/leaked system prompt, it's possible to see that the sub-agents are spawned via the Task tool.\n\nTurns out you can ask Claude too. (I think the developers are allowing this now?). It's not a hallucination. The prompt pertaining to pre-defined tools are there in the system prompt and Claude code dynamically injects reminders/tools often to the ongoing context.\n\nTry these set of prompts with Opus 4.5\n\nYou will get the output something like below (click) but to summarise -\nIt defines 5 agent types: general-purpose (full tool access, inherits context), Explore (fast read-only codebase search), Plan (software architect for implementation planning), claude-code-guide (documentation lookup), and statusline-setup. Notice how each sub-agent is defined with its specific use case and available tools. Also notice the \"When NOT to use\" section - this kind of negative guidance helps the model avoid unnecessary sub-agent spawning for simple tasks.\n\nI want you to focus on the tool schema. The Task tool prompt above is detailed guidance on how to use the tool that resides in the system prompt. The tool schema defines the tool or the function.\n\nThe main agent calls the Task tool to spawn a sub-agent, using its reasoning to decide the parameters. Notice the model parameter - when I say \"Use Explore with Sonnet\", the model makes the tool call with model: \"sonnet\".\n\nTill August'25 or so, Claude Code used to show the Task tool performing actions in the TUI but now TUI shows the sub-agent name instead.\n\nNotice the run_in_background parameter. It decides whether to send a sub-agent to run in the background. I like the background process feature - it is super helpful for debugging or just monitoring log outputs from process. Sometimes you have a long running python script that you wanna monitor etc.\n\nModel usually automatically decides to put a process in background but you can explicitly tell it to do so. Note that \"Background Tasks\" is different. Using an & sends a task to Claude Web (should have named it Claude Cloud haha). I am yet to get this to work properly.\n\nI have a pretty simplish/task based workflow: CC as the main driver, Codex for review and difficult tasks, and Cursor for reading code and manual edits. I rarely use Plan Mode. Instead, once requirements are clear enough, I explore the codebase to find the relevant files myself.\n\nOpus 4.5 is amazing at explaining stuff and makes stellar ASCII diagrams. The 2025 Aug knowledge cutoff helps here too. So my exploration involves asking lots of questions—clarifying requirements, understanding where/how/why to make changes. It might be less efficient than Plan Mode, but I like this approach.\n\nOnce I have enough context, I spam /ultrathink and ask it what changes are required and then if things look ok, I start the execution closely monitoring the changes - basically micro-managing it. I sometimes ask Codex's second opinion here lol.\n\nFor difficult new features, I sometimes use a \"throw-away first draft\" approach. Once I understand what changes are needed, I create a new branch and let Claude write the feature end-to-end while I observe. I then compare its output against my mental model as to how close did it get to my requirements? Where did it diverge? This process reveals Claude's errors and the decisions/biases it made based on the context it had. With the benefit of this hindsight, I run another iteration, this time with sharper prompts informed by what I learned from the first pass. Kinda like Tenet.\n\nFor backend-heavy or just complex features specifically, I'll sometimes ask Codex xhigh to generate the plan instead.\n\nI maintain a few custom commands, use CLAUDE.md and scratchpad extensively. No custom sub-agents. I use MCP sometimes if need shall arise (e.g for docs. I have tried Playwright and Figma MCP so far) but in general not a fan. I have used hooks for simple stuff in the past and need-basis. skills/plugins are something that I am yet to use more regularly. I often use background agents for\nobservability (monitoring log / error) purposes. I rarely use git worktrees.\n\nIt's worth noting that the harness is so heavily engineered that Claude knows which sub-agent to spawn, what command/tool call/skill to run, what to run in async manner. It's able to heavy carry the agent loop that your task is mainly to use your judgement and prompt it in right direction. The next generation of models will get better and the relevant scaffolding will reduce for existing feature and increase for newer features. (Re: contrasting to Karpathy sensei's latest tweet shown at beginning)\n\nIt's not at all required to know the features in depth to be honest. However knowing how things work can make you a better micro-manager if the need arises like telling the Explore agent to use Sonnet.\n\ngetting claude opus 4.5 changes reviewed by gpt-5.1-codex-max high pic.twitter.com/A4tYN3W3Q6\n\nFor reviewing code and finding bugs, I find GPT-5.2-Codex is superior. Just use /review. Better than code review products too.\n\nIt's able to find bugs and mention severity like P1, P2. It's less likely to report false-positives and more trustable when it comes to confusing changes as compared to Claude. This Claude for execution and GPT/o-series model for review/bugs dynamic has been pretty constant for me for probably a year.\n\nNow is a good time to take a breath and refresh your context window. Before we get to the next set of features, it's worth\ngoing through context management fundamentals. Things might get a bit difficult for the technically-lite folks.\nDon't give up. Read through the post. Even ask Claude to explain stuff you don't understand.\n\nAn agent in a harness can pro-actively do a lot of tool calls to read your codebase and other inputs, edit stuff, make writes etc. In this process, they can produce a lot of data which gets added to the running conversation i.e the context window. Anthropic refers to this art and science of curating what will go into the limited context window from this information as context engineering.\n\nYou may ask how are tool calls adding tokens to the context window? The flow works like this:\n\nThe key thing to note here is that both the tool call and the tool call outputs are added to the context so that the LLM can know the results. This is because LLMs are stateless. They don't have memory outside the context window. Let's say you have n messages in a conversation. When you send the next message, the request will again process n + 1 messages in the LLM ~ single context window.\n\nIf you don't add information about the chosen tool call was, LLM won't know and if you don't plug the output, then it won't know\nthe outcome. The tool call results can quickly fill your context and this is why agents can get super expensive too.\n\nI quote directly from effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents\n\nContext refers to the set of tokens included when sampling from a large-language model (LLM). The engineering problem at hand is optimizing the utility of those tokens against the inherent constraints of LLMs in order to consistently achieve a desired outcome. Effectively wrangling LLMs often requires thinking in context — in other words: considering the holistic state available to the LLM at any given time and what potential behaviors that state might yield.\n\nContext engineering is about answering \"what configuration of context is most likely to generate our model's desired behavior?\"\n\nEverything we have discussed so far comes under context engineering. Sub-agents, using a scratch, compaction are obvious examples\nof context management methods used in Claude Code. Some notes around why context engineering is needed -\n\nLimited context window - The context retrieval performance of LLMs degrades as every new token is introduced. To paraphrase the above blog - think of context as a limited \"attention budget\". This is a consequence of the attention mechanism itself as it gets harder to model the pairwise relationships - think of it like getting harder to focus on things far apart.\n\nGPT-5.2 has a context window of 400K input tokens. Opus 4.5 has 200K. Gemini 3 Pro has a 1M context window length. Now the effectiveness of these context windows can vary too, just the length doesn't matter. That said if you want to ask something\nfrom a 900K long input, you would be able to most reliably do that only with Gemini 3 Pro.\n\nContext rot article goes deep into some experiments which showed performance\ndrops with length and not task difficulty.\n\nA rough corollary one can draw is effective context windows are probably 50-60% or even lesser.\nDon't start a complicated task when you are half-way in the conversation. Do compaction or start a new one.\n\nEverything being done in prompts and code we have seen so far has been to -\n\nThe next few sections showcase features and implementation that are designed for\nbetter context management and agentic performance.\n\nI am personally not a fan of MCP servers but we gotta cover it. MCP servers are servers that can be hosted on your machine or remotely on the internet. These may expose filesystem, tools and integrations like CRM, Google Drive etc. They are essentially a way for models to connect to external tools and services.\n\nIn order to connect to MCP server, you need a host (Claude) which can house the MCP client. The MCP client\ncan invoke the protocol to connect. Once connected, the MCP client exposes tools, resources, prompts provided by server.\n\nThe tool definitions are loaded upfront into the context window of host bloating the context window.\n\nI like the idea of Code Execution with MCP even though it's propanda for more token consumption.\n\nQuoting Code execution with MCP:\n\nAs MCP usage scales, there are two common patterns that can increase agent cost and latency:\n\nMCP usage scale implies more MCP clients ~ more tool call definitions in context window.\n\nMCP Code exec suggests instead of direct tool calls, expose code APIs rather than tool call definitions and give Claude\na sandbox execution environment with a filesystem. Then let it write code to make the tool calls.\nIt is an elegant idea and is pretty similar to skills in the sense it's \"prompt on demand\"\n\nQuoting from Manus's Context Engineering Lesson blog:\n\nManipulate Attention Through Recitation\n\nIf you've worked with Manus, you've probably noticed something curious: when handling complex tasks, it tends to create a todo.md file—and update it step-by-step as the task progresses, checking off completed items.\n\nThat's not just cute behavior—it's a deliberate mechanism to manipulate attention.\n\nA typical task in Manus requires around 50 tool calls on average. That's a long loop—and since Manus relies on LLMs for decision-making, it's vulnerable to drifting off-topic or forgetting earlier goals, especially in long contexts or complicated tasks.\n\nClaude Code has todo lists but they don't show them now. Now you know part of the logic for it.\n\nClaude Code also tries something similar via plugging reminder tags into user messages and tool results. Some of them are mentioned in tool descriptions, other reminders are added at runtime via code.\n\nI asked Claude about what system reminders are present in the system prompt.\n\nFor reference, an older version of CC 2.0.56 used to have this detailed reminder system-reminder-plan-mode-is-active.\n\nI think Armin talks about this in his post What Actually Is Claude Code’s Plan Mode? when he refers to recurring prompts to remind the agent.\n\nIf you look at the leaked prompts, you will notice there are like 2-3 prompts for plan mode and 2-3 tool schemas like ENTRY_PLAN_MODE_TOOL, EXIT_PLAN_MODE_TOOL. The latter would write down the output into a markdown file\nwhich you can access via /plan. Everything is a markdown.\n\nAnthropic introduced Agent Skills recently and these got recently adopted by Codex too. A skill\nis a folder containing a SKILL.md file, other referenceable files and code scripts that do some user-defined task.\n\nThe SKILL.md contains some meta-data via which LLM can know what skills are available (meta-data is added to system prompt)\nIf Claude feels the skill is relevant, it will perform a tool call to read the contents of skill and download the\ndomain expertise just like Neo in Matrix 1999. The code scripts may contain tools that Claude can use.\n\nNormally, to teach domain expertise, you would need to write all that info in system prompt and probably\neven tool call definitions. With skills, you don't have to do that as the model loads it on-demand.\nThis is especially useful when you are not sure if you require those instructions always.\n\nThe popular frontend-design plugin is actually a skill. You can check here\n\nHooks are available in Claude Code and Cursor. They allow you to observe when a certain stage in the agent loop\nlifecycle starts or ends and let you run bash scripts before or after to make changes to the agent loop.\n\nThere are hooks like Stop, UserPromptSubmit etc. For instance Stop hook runs after Claude finishes responding and the UserPromptSubmit hook runs when user submits a prompt before Claude processes it.\n\nThe first hook I created was to play an anime notification sound when Claude stopped responding. I was obviously inspired\n\nOne funny use case to run Claude for hours might be running a \"Do more\" prompt when Claude finishes current task\nvia the Stop hook.\n\nI came across this post during my research for this blog post. This person beautifully combined the concepts and features we discussed so far. They combine hooks to act as reminders for skills. If the utility/requirement arises, there's a lot of space for customization. You might not need such heavy customization but can at least take inspiration. (Speaking for myself lol)\n\nAnthropic recommends to keep skill.md under 500 lines so they divided it into separate files and combined with hooks and\nreduced the size of their CLAUDE.md.\n\nHopefully you learnt a bunch of things from this super long post and will apply the learnings not only in CC\nbut other tools as well. I feel a bit weird writing this but we are going through some transformative times.\nThere are already moments when I almost feel like a background agent and then other times when I feel smart when the models couldn't solve a particular bug.\n\nclaude and codex to me when i realise i am the background agent pic.twitter.com/wkihYFQmQM\n\nI no longer look forward to new releases because they just keep happening anyways (shoutout to OpenAI). Deepseek and Kimi K3 are in the queue.\n\nI am expecting improvements in RL training, long context effectiveness via maybe new attention architectures, higher throughput models, lesser hallucination models.\nThere might be a o1/o3 level reasoning breakthrough or maybe something in continual learning in 2026. I look forward to these but at the same time\nI find it scary because more significant capability unlock will make the world unpredictable haha.\n\nIf you found this useful, try one new feature from this post today. Happy building!\n\nThanks for reading. Please like/share/RT the post if you liked it.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Rees-Zammit 2, Moroni, Heward, Ravouvou, Oghre Cons: Jordan 2, Williams\n\nTries: McCallum, Spencer 2, Leatherbarrow Cons: Connon 2 Pens: Connon\n\nBristol Bears' second-half strength saw them overcome Newcastle 36-27 as the Red Bulls saw a chance to end their wait for a Prem win slip through their fingers.\n\nThe victory sees Bristol move up to second in the table before the remaining weekend games, with Louis Rees-Zammit crossing twice and Matias Moroni, Kalaveti Ravouvou, Noah Heward and Gabriel Oghre also scoring.\n\nNewcastle led for most of the time until the 56-minute mark, and left with their first point of the campaign after an impressive Oli Spencer double, plus tries from Murray McCallum and Ollie Leatherbarrow, earned them a try bonus point.\n\nBut the dam burst once the hosts nudged ahead and while Bristol indiscipline saw them finish with 13 players on the field, they had enough to clinch their fifth win in their past six Prem games and confine Newcastle to a 19th consecutive Prem loss.\n\nAfter showing signs of promise during the first half of their defeat by Bath six days ago and with two European Challenge Cup wins under their belt this month, Red Bulls came out fast, playing Bristol at their own high-speed attacking game.\n\nMcCallum barrelled over on six minutes to cap a slick passage of varied attacking play, before Spencer made it 10-0 as the winger scooped the ball off the ground and dived past Ravouvou to touch down with one hand.\n\nBristol showed how quickly they can turn things around though with two tries in two minutes as space opened for Rees-Zammit, who had time to raise his arm in the air before diving over for the first.\n\nThe Welshman, playing at full-back, was almost instantly through again but although he was held as he punched a hole in Newcastle's defence, he passed to Moroni on his shoulder to run in.\n\nSaracens outmuscle Gloucester to end losing run\n\nNewcastle still had the final word of the half when Leatherbarrow powered under the posts as Red Bulls charged forward in numbers to make it 17-12.\n\nBrett Connon's penalty stretched the visitors' lead to 20-12 early in the second half and it signalled time for Bears boss Pat Lam to start ringing the changes, which quickly paid off as replacement Oghre and Heward exchanged passes for the latter to score.\n\nNewcastle struck once more as Sammy Arnold made the line break, Alex Hearle slipped through two defenders and Spencer on his outside added his second for their bonus-point score.\n\nBut Bristol's fresh legs - led by a rampaging Ellis Genge - pushed them clear with three tries in 10 minutes.\n\nRavouvou ran in on the overlap, Rees-Zammit skipped past three Newcastle players for his second and Oghre scored following a driving maul, with Batley's 20-minute red card for head contact in a tackle the only major blot on their day.\n\nBristol director of rugby Pat Lam told BBC Radio Bristol:\n\n\"A hard-earned five points, well done to Newcastle they really took it to us. We made changes in the group and we weren't really getting front-foot ball, they slowed our ball up but a lot of quality came through at the end.\n\n\"It's good to get the five points and most importantly with the six-day turnaround to Sale [on 2 January] we've freshened up a few of the boys that didn't play today.\n\n\"It was one of those games where again we would score then we'd let them in, we knew they scored most of their tries if they get in there so we talked about nothing for free. Some of the penalties that we were getting pinged for which put them in there at the beginning were certainly questionable but we've got to look at ourselves.\n\n\"What was frustrating us was a lot of our line breaks they were allowed to come clearly offside in stopping some of those plays but I loved the way the boys stayed in and managed the last 10 minutes, and with 13, 14 men got the five points.\"\n\nNewcastle Red Bulls head coach Alan Dickens told BBC Radio Newcastle:\n\n\"Something we talked a lot about coming into this game was momentum.\n\n\"Against Bath we had the momentum in the first half and then we lost it, so that was something we talked about - if we do lose it, how do we get it back?\n\n\"Certainly after we scored the fourth try in the second half, Bristol had a purple patch, but we did wrestle back the momentum towards the back end of that second half.\n\n\"Granted it was a little bit of ill discipline from them that resulted in a 20-minute red card which gave us possession and then territory and we were able to pressure Bristol, but not score again to make it a tighter finish.\n\n\"When the facets of our game do come together for 60 to 80 minutes we're going to put in a good performance. Gloucester next week is another opportunity to put our best version on the pitch and that's what we want to do.\"\n\nBristol: Rees-Zammit; Heward, Moroni, Williams, Ravouvou; Jordan, Randall; Lahiff, Thacker, Chawatama; Taylor, Batley, Owen, Harding (c), Mata.\n\nReplacements: Oghre, Genge, Halliwell, Rubiolo, Ivanishvili, Wolstenholme, Worsley, Lane.\n\nSin bin: Kalaveti Ravouvou (77)\n\nNewcastle: Grayson; Spencer, Hearle, Arnold, Obatoyinbo; Connon, Benitez Cruz; Brocklebank, McGuigan (c), McCallum; Usher, De Chaves, Gordon, Christie, Leatherbarrow.\n\nReplacements: Fletcher, Hancock, Palframan, Baker, Mafi, Elliott, Hutchison, Chamberlain.",

A team like Northampton put you under massive pressure and they were very good in that second half.\n\n\"At half-time [it was] a pretty even game, we went ahead and then they applied pressure on us in that last 30.\"\n\nNorthampton Saints head coach Sam Vesty told BBC Radio Northampton:\n\n\"The mindset for 80 minutes was to just keep attacking and to just go at it, which was excellent. It didn't all go our way, but we never wavered from that attacking mindset and it brought the best out of us.\n\n\"We haven't won here since 2022 so it's a good place to come and do it. I'm just so proud of the boys to back themselves and have the confidence and mindset to go at it. I loved it.\n\n\"It's [the result] got to be up there because it's a tough place to come and win and for the boys to get over the line and to do it in such style as well.\n\n\"There's a few disallowed tries there as well so the scoreline could have been even more.\"\n\nBath: De Glanville; Cokanasiga, Lawrence, Ojomoh, Arundell; Russell, Spencer (c); Obano, Dunn, du Toit; Roux, Molony, Bayliss, Underhill, Reid.\n\nReplacements: Frost, Van Wyk, Griffin, Hill, Pepper, Carr-Smith, Carreras, Harris.\n\nNorthampton: Hendy; Todaro, Freeman, Hutchinson, Ramm; Belleau, McParland; Iyogun, Smith, Davison; Prowse, Munga, Chick (c), Graham, Pollock.\n\nReplacements: Walker, Scola, Millar Mills, Benson, Brown, James, Lumley, Sleightholme.",

    "description": "Mayer launched Dazzle after shuttering her photo and contact management startup Sunshine. Green’s investment suggests Dazzle is poised for the coming wave of new AI-infused consumer businesses.",
    "fullText": "The former Yahoo CEO, Marissa Mayer, refuses to sit on the sidelines of the generative AI revolution.\n\nAfter spending the last six years running Sunshine, a photo-sharing and contact-management startup with little success, the storied tech leader has shuttered the company to launch Dazzle, a new startup focused on building the next generation of AI personal assistants.\n\nWhile Mayer is not yet sharing specifics about Dazzle’s functionality, she has revealed that the new company has raised an $8 million seed round at a $35 million valuation. The round was led by Forerunner’s Kirsten Green, with participation from Kleiner Perkins, Greycroft, Offline Ventures, Slow Ventures, and Bling Capital. Although Mayer has admitted to investing her own capital in the startup, she emphasized that the round was led by Green, a venture capitalist with a storied record of identifying iconic consumer brands such as Warby Parker, Chime, and Dollar Shave Club.\n\nGreen’s investment suggests Dazzle is poised for the coming wave of new AI-infused consumer businesses. The founder of Forerunner Ventures previously told TechCrunch that while enterprise AI took the early lead in this tech cycle, consumer-facing AI is a “late bloomer” that’s finally ready for its breakout.\n\nEven for a founder of Mayer’s fame, landing Green as a lead investor is a significant stamp of credibility for Dazzle, especially after Sunshine was widely considered to be a flop. “I think she really has a great sense for where people and platforms are going,” Mayer said.\n\nMayer told TechCrunch that the Sunshine team began prototyping Dazzle last summer, a project that quickly eclipsed their previous work in ambition and opportunity. “We realized that this was something that we were much more excited about,” she said, noting that Dazzle has potential for “a much bigger impact” than what Sunshine was building.\n\nOriginally founded as Lumi Labs in 2018, Sunshine first launched with a subscription app for contact management dubbed “Sunshine Contacts.” Despite its founder’s high profile, the product struggled to gain traction. Privacy advocates raised alarms over the app’s practice of pulling home addresses from public databases to enrich contact lists, and the company never recovered from the initial skepticism. By 2024, the company broadened its offering by adding event management and “Shine,” an AI-powered photo-sharing tool. The new offering was widely criticized for its outdated design and similarly failed to attract widespread usage.\n\nSunshine raised a total of $20 million from investors, including Felicis, Norwest Venture Partners, and Unusual Ventures. When the company was dissolved, investors received 10% of Dazzle’s equity, Mayer said.\n\nReflecting on Sunshine’s struggle, Mayer was candid about its limitations, admitting the problems the company was tackling were too “mundane” and not large enough. “I don’t think we got it to the state of overall polish and accessibility that I really wanted it to be,” she added.\n\nMayer is now betting that the lessons from Sunshine will help her build a much more resilient and impactful business with Dazzle.\n\nBefore her tenure as Yahoo CEO, Mayer was employee number 20 at Google, where she helped design Google search ‘look and feel’, and oversaw the development of Google Maps and AdWords.\n\n“I have had the rare privilege of being at two companies that really changed how people do things,” Mayer told TechCrunch. “Yahoo, for many, defined the internet. Google, in terms of Search and Maps, changed everything. I really aspire to build a product that has that kind of impact again.”\n\nDazzle is expected to come out of stealth mode early next year.",

The creativity on display was clear.\n\n\"The best player [Wirtz] on the pitch by a country mile - the most inventive and the one who is willing to take risks,\" said ex-Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock on Final Score.\n\nFormer England forward Ellen White added: \"There's no doubting the quality that Florian Wirtz has.

Unai Emery will never say if he believes it.\n\nOne thing, however, can no longer be denied - Aston Villa must now be taken seriously as Premier League title contenders.\n\nEmery met the inevitable question about whether Villa can mount a challenge with the straightest of bats: \"Not really. We are competing very well. We are third in the league behind Arsenal and Manchester City. Wow.\"\n\nEmery demonstrated he is not only the master of strategy, but also expectation management.\n\nIt took until Villa were in sight of a dramatic victory at Chelsea, where they came from behind to win 2-1 through substitute Ollie Watkins' header six minutes from time, until the deafening songs of belief rang around Stamford Bridge.\n\nBut the evidence is compelling:\n\nVilla's victory was their 11th in succession, equalling a club record set in September 1897 and March 1914. They have now won eight consecutive top-flight games for the first time since a run of nine between October and December 1910.\n\nAt the end of matchday five this season, Villa sat 18th and were without a Premier League victory. From matchday six onwards, they have won more games and more points than any other side.\n\nVilla have never had more points after 18 games of a Premier League season than their current tally of 39.\n\nThe statistics state an eloquent case.",

At this time, 13 individuals known to have had direct contact with the dog have begun post-exposure prophylaxis, and no one is symptomatic. Additionally, owners of pets who have had contact with this dog are being notified by ARC so that appropriate quarantine periods can begin and vaccine boosters can be administered. The risk of rabies to the public and their pets is low.\n\nCDPH is reviewing how a vaccinated dog contracted rabies and will share findings as they become available. This investigation will inform public education efforts to prevent future cases.\n\nRabies is a fatal but preventable disease. It spreads from an infected animal to people through the saliva, most commonly through a bite of an infected animal. Rabies can also spread when a rabid animal’s saliva enters an open wound or the eyes, nose or mouth. For example, an infected dog licking your face or an open wound could potentially spread rabies. Rabies does not spread through contaminated materials such as clothing or bedding or by simply petting a dog.

    "fullText": "The China National Nuclear Corporation developed a first-of-its-kind power generator that uses carbon dioxide rather than steam.\n\nIt's the first commercial power source of this type and a significant step toward cleaner global energy.\n\nAs Newsweek reported, the China National Nuclear Corp.'s generator converts waste heat into useful electricity. This supercritical carbon dioxide power generator provides a clean energy solution and advances China's pollution-reduction efforts.\n\nThe company connected its generator to the grid at a steel plant in Guizhou province. There, it will capture waste heat from steel production and directly convert it into electricity.\n\nThe company expects the generator to be 50% more efficient than currently available technologies. Therefore, it also serves as a model for other power plants and industrial applications worldwide.\n\nThis energy development is encouraging because it contributes to the clean energy mix and is a substantial step forward for advanced nuclear technology. It offers high power in a small footprint, making it suitable for spacecrafts, ships, and other confined spaces.\n\n\"The Chinese are moving very, very fast. They are very keen to show the world that their program is unstoppable,\" Mark Hibbs, an expert on the nuclear sector, told The New York Times.\n\nNuclear energy is often misunderstood and controversial, yet it's an important part of the sustainable energy transition away from more polluting energy sources and toward cheaper, clear forms of energy, like wind and solar.\n\nNuclear plants are also known for radioactive leaks and producing hazardous waste. Safety and environmental concerns are valid. However, they still offer a promising shift away from pollution-heavy coal, oil, and gas.\n\nYet, recent developments from the CNNC and partner Jigang International Engineering and Technology Co. are paving the way for nuclear expansion in the country and beyond.\n\nChina is now seeking to scale up its new power-generation systems to deploy them in nuclear, steel, and solar plants.\n\nShould America invest \n\nOnly if it helps us compete with China\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Barefoot children played on chilly sand as Gaza ’s thousands of displaced people prepared threadbare tents on Saturday for another round of winter rain.\n\nSome families in the central town of Deir al-Balah said they had been living in tents for about two years, or for most of the war between Israel and Hamas that has devastated the territory.\n\nFathers braced fraying tents with old pieces of wood or inspected the ragged edges of holes torn in tarps. Inside the dim homes, daylight through tiny holes shone like stars.\n\nMothers battled the damp, slinging clothing over poles or cord to dry in the wind between the downpours that turn paths into puddles. One mother pulled a tiny child away from a mildewing patch of carpet.\n\n“We have been living in this tent for two years. Every time it rains and the tent collapses over our heads, we try to put up new pieces of wood,” said Shaima Wadi, a mother of four children who was displaced from Jabaliya in the north. “With how expensive everything has become, and without any income, we can barely afford clothes for our children or mattresses for them to sleep on.”\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, has said dozens of people, including a two-week-old infant, have died from hypothermia or after weather-related collapses of war-damaged homes. Aid organizations have called for more shelters and other humanitarian aid to be allowed into the territory.\n\nEmergency workers have warned people not to stay in damaged buildings. But with so much of the territory reduced to rubble, there are few places to escape the rain.\n\n“I collect nylon, cardboard and plastic from the streets to keep them warm,” said Ahmad Wadi, who burns the materials or uses them as a kind of blanket for loved ones. “They don’t have proper covers. It is freezing, the humidity is high, and water seeps in from everywhere. I don’t know what to do.”\n\nIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to visit Washington in the coming days as negotiators and others discuss the second stage of the ceasefire that took effect on Oct. 10.\n\nThough the agreement has mostly held, its progress has slowed. The remains of the final hostage taken during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war are still in Gaza. Challenges in the next phase of the ceasefire include the deployment of an international stabilization force, a technocratic governing body for Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and further Israeli troop withdrawals from the territory.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have accused each other of truce violations.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said that since the ceasefire went into effect, 414 Palestinians have been killed and 1,142 wounded. It said the bodies of 679 people were pulled from the rubble during the same period as the truce makes it safer to search for the remains of people killed earlier.\n\nThe ministry on Saturday said 29 bodies, including 25 that were recovered from under the rubble, had been brought to local hospitals over the past 48 hours.\n\nThe overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war has risen to at least 71,266, the ministry said, and another 171,219 have been wounded.\n\nThe ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count, is staffed by medical professionals and maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by the international community.\n\nIsrael's defense minister, Israel Katz, said in a statement Saturday that a military operation continued in a town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank a day after police said a Palestinian attacker rammed his car into a man and then stabbed a young woman in northern Israel on Friday afternoon, killing both.\n\nThe statement said the army had surrounded the town of Qabatiya, where Katz said the attacker was from, and was operating “forcefully” there. Authorities on Friday said the attacker was shot and injured in Afula. He was taken to a hospital.\n\nIt’s common practice for Israel to launch raids in the West Bank towns that attackers come from or demolish homes belonging to the assailants’ families. Israel says that it helps to locate militant infrastructure and prevents future attacks. Rights watchdogs describe such actions as collective punishment.\n\nAP video on Saturday showed Israeli bulldozers entering the town and soldiers patrolling.\n\n“They announced a strict curfew,” resident Bilal Hanash said, as he and others described main roads being closed with dirt barriers, a practice that has grown during the war in Gaza. “So basically, they’re punishing 30,000 people.”\n\nFind more of AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.",

That was a 25% increase from a year earlier. and in 2025 attacks are growing in scope and scale, even taking advantage of trusted sites like LinkedIn. One company trying to protect consumers is Push security. Mark Orlando, Push's chief technology officer joins me now. Mark, it is great to see you. So so maybe start here Mark, you know, as the year draws to a close, we're rolling into 2026, Mark. What what is the big\n\ncybersecurity themes, Mark, we should be aware of. What what are the big trends? Scale, for example, seems to be one you're highlighting.\n\nHi Josh, absolutely. Scale is uh really one of the biggest developments that we've seen not only this year but in the last few years, as the infrastructure behind these types of attacks gets easier and easier to stand up and operate. I think we can expect the scale of these attacks to continue growing exponentially. We've also seen the sophistication of these attacks uh really getting getting higher and higher. Uh you mentioned exploiting\n\nlegitimate sites and services like LinkedIn, um but we're seeing that across the board, whether it's social media networks or uh sponsored ads in Google results, attackers have come up with some very creative and sophisticated ways to deliver these scams and these attacks to unsuspecting users.\n\nIt sounds like, Mark, you're also highlighting how more attacks are are happening inside the browser. Why is that, Mark? I mean, just technically technically speaking, how does that how does that help the attacker?\n\nSure, well the browser has really evolved from a tool that we use to view web pages to, you know, essentially a platform that runs software on demand. I mean, this is where, you know, work really happens these days including, you know, where users are logging into all of the various accounts and services that we use on a daily basis. So, uh attackers realized this and they have kind of shifted away from uh different areas of the network like email uh or, you know, strictly web access that are fairly well defended into the browser, which is somewhat\n\nless well defended, certainly an area where most organizations don't have great visibility into what's going on and how users are interacting with websites. So, attackers have realized this, they've shifted focus to doing \n\nYou also highlight here, Mark, uh what sound like these LinkedIn-based fishing attacks. explain those, Mark, how do they work?\n\nSure. So, I think historically when you talk about fishing or email scams, I mean it is strictly that. It's something that's coming through email. and I think more or less that's what users have come to expect. if they're going to get scammed, it's going to be some, you know, poorly worded kind of suspicious email that comes in with an attachment or a link. And really that's uh increasingly no longer the case. So, uh you mentioned LinkedIn, we identified an attack campaign uh earlier this year where\n\nuh a an executive, a CEO in fact, uh of a company we work with was targeted through LinkedIn. He received a message from someone in his network, a first-level connection uh about something that was very relevant to that company and to his work. And so uh he clicked on the link, you know, along the lines of hey, check out this investment information, this opportunity, let me know what you think. Uh there was a lot of kind of sophisticated um\n\nkind of hoops he had to jump through to validate that it was in fact, uh him who was accessing the attacker website. and ultimately the goal was uh to gather his login information. So, in fact, it wasn't the trusted contact that had sent this message through LinkedIn, but rather someone else who had compromised his contact's uh account. So, this is a a situation where not only is the message very, very convincing, but it comes from a a trusted source, in this case, you know, a trusted known contact.\n\nSo, very, very difficult to pick out. and again, very difficult for an organization to see what's happening inside of those LinkedIn communications, much less do anything to stop it.",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen warned Saturday it would immediately respond to any military movements of separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates that undermine de-escalation efforts in the southern region of Yemen, as the United States urged diplomacy.\n\n“Any military movements that violate these efforts will be dealt with directly and immediately in order to protect civilian lives and ensure the success of restoring calm,\" said Brig. Gen. Turki al-Maliki, a coalition spokesman, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nAl-Maliki also accused the Southern Transitional Council, or STC, separatists of “serious and horrific human rights violations against civilians,” without providing evidence.\n\nThis came a day after separatists accused Saudi Arabia of targeting their forces with airstrikes, something not formally acknowledged by the kingdom, whose relations with the UAE have been strained because of STC actions.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Saturday that his country was “concerned by recent events in southeastern Yemen” and urged restraint and diplomacy to reach “a lasting solution.” He also expressed gratitude “for the diplomatic leadership of our partners, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.”\n\nYemen, engulfed in a civil war for more than a decade, has the Iran-aided Houthis controlling much of the northern regions, while a Saudi-UAE-backed coalition supports the internationally recognized government in the south. However, the UAE also helps the southern separatists who call for South Yemen to secede once again from Yemen.\n\nThe council moved earlier this month into Yemen’s governorates of Hadramout and Mahra and seized an oil-rich region. That had pushed out forces affiliated with the Saudi-supported National Shield Forces, another group aligned with the coalition in fighting the Houthis.\n\nThe coalition now demands the withdrawal of STC forces from the two governorates, with local authorities returning to oversee them, and the handover of their military camps.\n\nRashad al-Alimi, head of Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, the governing body of the internationally recognized government, said after an emergency meeting late Friday that STC movements posed “serious violations against civilians.”\n\nThe coalition said in its Saturday announcement came at al-Alimi's request to protect civilians in Hadramout.\n\nThe U.N. Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen said Saturday that it's closely following developments in Hadramout and Mahra, reiterating calls for restraint, de-escalation, dialogues and for all parties to avoid further escalation.",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Jeffrey R. Holland, a high-ranking official in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who was next in line to become the faith's president, has died. He was 85.\n\nHolland died early Saturday morning from complications associated with kidney disease, the church announced on its website.\n\nHolland, who died in Salt Lake City, led a governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which helps set church policy while overseeing the many business interests of what is known widely as the Mormon church.\n\nHe was the longest-tenured member of the Quorum of the Twelve after President Dallin H. Oaks, making him next in line to lead the church under a long-established succession plan. Oaks, 93, became president of the church and its more than 17 million-strong global membership in October.\n\nHenry B. Eyring, who is 92 and one of Oaks' two top counselors, is now next in line for the presidency.\n\nHolland had been hospitalized during the Christmas holiday for ongoing health complications, the church said. Experts on the faith pointed to his declining health in October when Oaks did not select Holland as a counselor.\n\nHis death leaves a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve that Oaks will fill in coming months, likely by calling a new apostle from a lower-tier leadership council. Apostles are all men in accordance with the church’s all-male priesthood.\n\nHolland grew up in St. George, Utah, and worked for many years in education administration before his call to join the ranks of church leadership. He served as the ninth president of Brigham Young University, the Utah-based faith's flagship school, from 1980 to 1989 and was a commissioner of the church’s global education system.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Provo university worked to improve interfaith relations and established a satellite campus in Jerusalem. The Anti-Defamation League later honored Holland with its “Torch of Liberty” award for helping foster greater understanding between Christian and Jewish communities.\n\nOaks, also a former BYU president, reflected Saturday on his more than 50 years of friendship and service with Holland, calling their relationship “long and loving.”\n\n“Over the last three decades as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, he lifted the weary, encouraged the faithful and bore a powerful witness of the Savior — even through seasons of significant personal trials,” Oaks said.\n\nHolland was known as a dynamic orator whose sermons combined scholarship with tenderness. In 2013 he spoke to church members about supporting loved ones with depression and other mental illnesses, sharing openly about times when he felt “like a broken vessel.”\n\nHolland is widely remembered for a 2021 speech in which he called on church members to take up metaphorical muskets in defense of the faith's teachings against same-sex marriage. The talk, known colloquially as “the musket fire speech,” became required reading for BYU freshmen in 2024, raising concern among LGBTQ+ students and advocates.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Latter-day Saint, said no church leader has had a more profound impact on his faith than Holland.\n\n“His words had a way of penetrating my soul like no other,” Cox said. “In times of trial or darkness, I would return to them over and over again and feel the light and peace I needed.”\n\nHolland was preceded in death by his wife, Patricia Terry Holland. He is survived by their three children, 13 grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Holland was preceded in death by his wife.",

    "description": "SUVs remain popular, but with a multitude of models, it can be hard to choose the best one. These SUVs are some of the best, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
    "fullText": "Sport utility vehicles, or SUVs, are vehicles that have the tough frame of a truck but provide enough interior room for multiple passengers and cargo. And they aren't just popular among retirees with grandchildren or people fond of bulk shopping trips to stock up on items at Costco. There were $528 billion worth of SUV transactions in 2024 across the globe, a figure that is expected to swell to just over $876 billion by 2032, per Stellar Market Research. And SUVs and trucks were the best selling vehicles of the first three quarters of 2025 in the United States, according to Car and Driver.\n\nAs a byproduct of their popularity, SUVs come in so many forms and models of varying quality that it is enough to put a car shopper into a fetal position of indecision, especially if you don't want to end up with a popular yet unreliable SUV. Fortunately, there's Kelley Blue Book, which has been a valuable source for automobile buyers since 1926. In early 2025, Kelley Blue Book came out with its Best Buy awards, which included Hyundai Kona, Honda CR-V, Kia Telluride, Ford Expedition, and Kia EV9. To give you a complete picture, we've included analyses and reviews from other online car sources in the roundup below.\n\nRated as the best subcompact SUV, the Hyundai Kona is described by Kelley Blue Book as a roomy, comfortable, fuel-efficient vehicle that can get about 31 miles for the gallon. With a starting price of about $25,900, Hyundai Kona can seat five people with just over 38 inches of leg room and can carry 25.5 cubic feet of cargo, or a maximum of 63.7 cubic feet when the second-row seats are folded down. The vehicle comes equipped with a 12.3-inch infotainment display and an optional all-wheel drive. Plus, the 2025 Kona is equipped with standard safety features such as collision warning with automatic emergency braking and blind-spot monitoring.\n\nYet according to Edmunds, the 2025 Hyundai Kona's acceleration abilities are \"underwhelming,\" while its suspension is not all that great, making it a less-than-ideal vehicle for off-roading (the model still got a 7.8 out of 10 rating). Consumer Reports, though, rated the 2025 Hyundai Kona overall reliability at 41 out of 100, about average for that model year.\n\nIn terms of costs to fix and maintain, CarEdge estimated that a Hyundai Kona will cost $8,463 over its first ten years, which is $297 more than non-luxury SUVs. As for how quickly this car can depreciate, CarEdge says it will lose 42% of its value after five years. That's better than the 53% depreciation of a Wagoneer, a popular Jeep with terrible resale value.\n\nKelley Blue Book compared the 2025 Honda CR-V — the winner of the best compact SUV category — to the brightest start in the sky for its quality, tech features, and the 76.5 cubic feet of cargo space it can provide once you fold down the rear seats. Though compact, the CR-V provides 41 inches of legroom for its rear seats along with reclining backs. And its hybrid versions can give up to 40 miles per gallon.\n\nBut where the CR-V truly excels is in its resale value, which Kelley Blue Book reports can fetch thousands of dollars more than its competitors due to the Honda brand's reputation for reliability. CarEdge agreed, putting its depreciation at just 29% over its first five years.\n\nWith a starting price of $31,495, the Honda CR-V costs $7,696 to fix and maintain in its first ten years of service, which is $530 less than the average for other popular SUV models. Also: Car and Driver called the 2025 model year a solid vehicle that's high in demand, and Edmunds gave it a 7.1 out of 10. However, this model was part of a recall ordered on Honda vehicles by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for potential fuel leaks and possibly incorrectly manufactured bad steering gearboxes.\n\nThe winner of the best midsize SUV for the sixth year in a row, the 2025 Kia Telluride has a three-row configuration that can seat eight, a Mercedez-Benz-quality dual-display infotainment touchscreen, 21 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row, and a total of 87 cubic feet with the two rear rows folded down, according to Kelley Blue Book. The model, which starts at about $37,800, also comes with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, and a host of other safety features.\n\nIn terms of reliability, Consumer Reports gives it an average with a score of 60 out of 100, although the vehicle also scored 72 out of 100 for owner satisfaction. Edmunds gives it a 7.1 out of 10 rating, while Car and Driver stated that Kia Telluride's standard features approach luxury standards. As for its resale value, the Kia Telluride will depreciate 51% in its first five years, according to CarEdge, and will cost $8,730 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $564 more than typical SUVs.\n\nThe '25 Ford Expedition took Kelley Blue Book's best full-size SUV award for its three-row spacious interior with plentiful cupholders and USB-C ports, ability to tow trailers up to 9,600 pounds, and a variety of trims, like the Expedition Tremor, that are great for transverse unpaved trails. With a starting price of $64,515, it has a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot that allows people to stream music and audiobooks as well as videos when parked. There is even a Bluetooth controller for people to play online games. The second row has tablet holders on the back of the front seat headrests, and there is a 13.2-inch infotainment touchscreen for navigation and climate control. The vehicle also comes with a safety package that includes a 360-degree camera, emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot and lane-keeping assist functions.\n\nOn the downside, according to Consumer Reports, the 2025 Ford Expedition is less reliable than the average car, with a reliability rating of 30 out of 100. It also costs $10,226 to maintain a Ford Expedition model in its first ten years of ownership, which is $2,060 more than other popular SUV models, per CarEdge. Ford Expeditions also depreciate 59% in five years, with a ranking of 164 out of 185 models analyzed by CarEdge for resale value.\n\nLarge enough to seat seven people, the Kia EV9 won Kelley Blue Book's Best Buy spot for 3-row EVs. An electric midsized SUV with prices that start at $56,395, the Kia EV9 can seat seven people comfortably, has a maximum range of 304 miles, and can get 150 miles worth of range after charging for only 15 minutes.\n\nEdmunds gave the model 8.2 out of 10, but Consumer Reports deemed the 2025 Kia EV9 less reliable than other cars of the same model year. There were also three recalls ordered by NHTSA because of a badly welded gear shift that causes the vehicle to lose power (342 vehicles for year 2025); possible missing bolts in the second and third row seats (22,883 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025); and a failing instrument panel screen for speed and other info (14,163 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025).\n\nBut if those issues are addressed by dealerships free of charge, as expected, the Kia EV9 is projected to cost $5,237 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $2,929 better than the average SUV, per CarEdge. However, in five years it will lose 52% of its value.\n\nUnlock your financial potential. Add Money Digest to your preferred sources for smart money insights!",

    "fullText": "Some metal detectorists dream of making the find that changes history and 90-year-old Dave Derby has done just that – twice.\n\nHis first major discovery was of a grand Roman villa estate near Northampton, and that was followed by an Anglo-Saxon cemetery.\n\nArchaeologist Stephen Young says Mr Derby \"embodies the best of what it means to be a metal detectorist and an archaeological enthusiast\".\n\nYet, for Mr Derby, from Kislingbury, near Northamptonshire, the greatest joy is finding ancient artefacts.\n\n\"You pick it up and think, 'What was the person like who owned it?'\" he says.\n\nHis interest in metal detecting goes back to 1964, when he was helping his father in his garden.\n\n\"All of a sudden he bent down and picked something up - and it was a coin,\" recalls Mr Derby.\n\nExperts from Northampton Museum explained it dated to the reign of George III (1760 to 1820).\n\n\"And I was hooked on what they were showing me, so I decided I was going to get a metal detector.\"\n\nOver the decades, he made many finds, but the one that first attracted international attention was the 1996 discovery at Whitehall Farm of a Roman villa estate.\n\nThe extensive complex, dating to the early 3rd to late 4th Centuries, included two bath-houses, complete with tessellated mosaic floors, and two 2nd-Century round houses.\n\n\"I was detecting in a particular field and looking around, there was pottery lying around - then I started to find Roman coins,\" says Mr Derby.\n\n\"And the farmer had come along to see how I was doing and I said, 'You have a Roman site here.'\"\n\nThey turned for advice to Mr Young, who had worked with Mr Derby since the mid-1980s.\n\n\"The site is a rare example of a late villa occupation remaining in use until the mid-5th Century, 50 years after the accepted termination of imperial Roman Britain,\" explains the former University of Northampton lecturer.\n\nThe discovery at Nether Heyford, near Northampton, developed into Clasp, a community archaeology project, which lasted until 2012, attracting students, volunteers and archaeologists from around the world.\n\nMr Derby's next massive discovery came when the same landowner offered him another field to survey.\n\n\"I went to this nice flat field and about 10 yards (9m) away from the hedge at the top, I got this fantastic signal,\" he says.\n\n\"And out came a lady's Saxon brooch, so I kept scratching around and I found a piece of metal which I thought could be part of a sword.\n\n\"I rang my son and said, 'You need to come – I've found a sword and there's a hand on the end of it!'\"\n\nThe discovery in 2003 became known as the Anglo-Saxon warrior.\n\nFurther excavations in the area unearthed five more graves and then few years later, about 23 sets of remains were discovered.\n\nAmong them were the remains of what appear to be \"feoderati\", soldiers of continental origin invited to Britain by the Romans under treaty to provide military support, says Mr Young.\n\nThe burials revealed family groupings, with some of women's remains found to be of local origin.\n\nAnalysis suggested some possibly dated back to as far as 430AD - about the time the Roman empire was collapsing.\n\nThis made it \"a seminal site of national importance for the post-Roman and early migration period of the 5th Century AD\", says Mr Young.\n\nOther finds included an early 6th-Century Mercian warrior burials and a 7th-Century mound burial of a man with a sword, whose rediscovery \"was down to Dave Derby\", he adds.\n\n\"I'm lucky to have worked with him and been able to integrate his talent and undoubted skills in enhancing our ability to understand the archaeological narrative,\" says Mr Young.\n\nMr Derby continues to love metal detecting, now accompanied by Peter, who says: \"I feel like we're modern time travellers; we dig holes in the ground and uncover something that's not seen the light, sometimes for thousands of years.\"\n\nAll the gold and silver finds more than 300 years oldare reported to Northamptonshire's finds liaison officer, in line with the law.\n\nOne of Mr Derby's favourites is a 7th-Century gold and gemstone pendant, which was returned to the landowner and is now worn by his wife.\n\n\"I'd rather find artefacts - they belong to somebody and you think 'What were they doing there?'\" he says.\n\n\"It's one of the most fantastic hobbies I've ever had.\"\n\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.\n\n'Saddest story' for owner who lost ring in 1600s\n\nAncient god, barbarian and frog come back home\n\nUnique medieval cross reveals its garnet centre",

    "description": "Here are a dozen strange and interesting tales from the medical literature.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nEach week, Live Science highlights an intriguing case report from the medical literature, where we explore unusual symptoms, rarely seen diagnoses and out-of-the-box treatments. Through this \"Diagnostic Dilemma\" series, we describe how doctors work to ultimately discover the cause of a patient's ailment. In complex cases, this diagnostic process can be quite arduous. That's part of why doctors share case reports: to help other medical professionals who might be facing the same puzzle.\n\nHere are 12 of our most intriguing Diagnostic Dilemmas from the past year. (If descriptions of medical symptoms and procedures make you squeamish, proceed with caution.)\n\nA Dutch teenager got knee surgery to treat a soccer injury, and upon waking up from anesthesia, he spoke only English — a language he'd previously spoken only in language classes at school. He kept insisting he was in the U.S., did not recognize his parents, and could not speak or understand spoken Dutch, his native language. Exams turned up no neurological abnormalities, and the doctors didn't initiate any specific treatment to address the language issue. Within 18 hours of surgery, the boy could understand some Dutch but not speak it without struggling. But then suddenly, he could both understand and speak it as normal. The doctors described the event as a strange case of \"foreign language syndrome.\"\n\nA teenager reported to a hospital with abdominal pain, and examinations soon revealed that she was nine months pregnant and that she was having contractions. When doctors examined the patient's reproductive tract, they found that she lacked a vaginal opening — a rare condition called distal vaginal atresia. Because of this, the medical team had to deliver the baby — a healthy, 6.2-pound (2.8 kilograms) boy — via cesarean section. The teenager had been seen at the same hospital about nine months prior, when an ex stabbed her after finding her fellating a new boyfriend. The wounds she incurred during the stabbing likely allowed sperm to escape her digestive tract and make their way to her reproductive tract, resulting in an unlikely pregnancy, her doctors theorized.\n\nA man was brought to a hospital by boat and helicopter after incurring an injury while fishing. He'd caught a white marlin (Kajikia albida) — a large fish with a long, pointy \"bill\" — and when he leaned over the edge of his boat to release his hook from the fish, it jumped up and struck him. At the hospital, doctors found a fragment of the fish's bill lodged in the man's throat, spinal canal and base of his skull. With an emergency surgery and antibiotics to prevent infections, the man survived the encounter without any long-term symptoms.\n\nA woman with osteoarthritis of the knee began getting acupuncture regularly when her pain medications started causing bad stomach issues. But her knees then became very sore, and she went to a hospital to be examined. X-rays revealed areas of her joints and shinbones where the bone tissue had thickened and spurs had formed. Additionally, hundreds of tiny flecks could be seen around both knee joints. It turned out that the woman's acupuncturists had left golden threads inside her knees on purpose as part of her treatment. In other cases, these threads have caused cysts and tissue damage, which can happen when they migrate through the body.\n\nA man in Michigan went to an ER with swollen eyelids and an itchy rash, and he noted that he'd also been experiencing cramps, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting over the preceding days. When doctors examined the patient, they uncovered signs of anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, and his condition quickly progressed to shock. The medical team successfully stabilized the patient, but a few days later, his condition worsened again. At that point, the doctors spotted a pattern: The symptoms arose when the man ate red meat. An allergy to meat, a condition called alpha-gal syndrome, can be triggered by the bite of certain tick species. It turned out that the man was an avid deer hunter who likely encountered an adult tick or tick larvae while hunting, his doctors concluded.\n\nA woman had her chromosomes checked following a pregnancy loss to see if there might have been an underlying genetic reason for the miscarriage. The test revealed that, at least in the woman's blood, her chromosomal profile (or karyotype) was 46,XY — the typical karyotype among males. Further tests revealed that across the rest of her tissues, her karyotype was 46,XX, the typical chromosomal profile of a female. The woman had a fraternal twin, so in this case of \"chimerism,\" the doctors concluded that the XY chromosomes likely came from her brother in the womb but somehow assimilated them only into her blood cells. The doctors suspected the \"veins and arteries of the two children became intertwined in the umbilical cord\" at some point. The woman had no overt symptoms tied to carrying these chromosomes in her blood and later went on to carry a pregnancy that resulted in the birth of a baby boy.\n\nA woman visited an emergency room with a headache, severe cramps and muscle pain, as well as an elevated pulse, breathing rate and blood pressure. She told doctors she'd attempted to get high by injecting a ground-up black widow spider (Latrodectus) into her veins in a suspension of distilled water. The doctors suspected the injected dose of black-widow venom was likely much higher than one would get from a bite, and its effects may have been exacerbated by the patient's allergic reaction to proteins in the venom. After the patient had been treated for several days in an intensive care unit, her symptoms resolved and she was discharged.\n\nA woman developed hives, swelling under her skin and trouble breathing after having sex with her partner. While receiving treatment at a hospital, she reported having a known allergy to Brazil nuts. She said that her partner ate them a few hours prior to sex but that he'd taken a bath and washed his hands thoroughly before intercourse. When the doctors conducted a skin-prick allergy test, using samples of the partner's semen, before and after he ate Brazil nuts, they found that the allergy triggers could indeed pass through the semen and set off the woman's allergy.\n\nFollowing a cancer treatment, a man developed a red rash that started out near the anus and then spread rapidly to the trunk and limbs. The rash, which looked like wavy lines all over the patient's body, appeared to migrate, with the lines starting out in one spot and later moving across the skin. A stool test revealed Strongyloides stercoralis, a parasite that can cause an infection called strongyloidiasis in humans. These worms were migrating under the man's skin, and the infection likely arose because the patient's immune system was stunted by glucocorticoids used in his cancer treatment.\n\nA rare autoimmune disorder injured a man's corneas and extensively impeded his sight. To restore vision in one eye, doctors attempted an osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis, or \"tooth-in-eye surgery.\" The procedure involves removing one of the patient's teeth and implanting it in their eye socket, where it serves as a platform for a transparent, plastic lens. The lens stands in for the injured cornea and enables light to enter the eye. The man's successful procedure was the first of its kind in Canada.\n\nA man went to a hospital because he was experiencing weakness and vomiting. There, tests revealed that his kidneys were failing and the calcium in his blood was too high. Physical exams and scans revealed abnormalities in his upper-arm and chest muscles — namely, areas of superdense calcification. It turned out that the man had previously gotten injections of silicone-like, oil-based substances to \"plump\" up the look of his muscles. In this case, the injections triggered a persistent foreign-body reaction, resulting in extensive scarring and calcification of the muscle that leached calcium into the bloodstream.\n\n—A woman kept tasting bleach — and doctors found a hidden cause in her blood\n\n—Botched penile tattoo left man with permanent semi-erection\n\n—Speed eating a 7-pound burger sent a man to ER unable to pass gas\n\nA lab worker came down with an infection that, despite medical treatment, ended up being fatal. His doctors were informed that the patient had worked with a weakened strain of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes the plague. This weakened form of the germ was thought to be noninfectious, but nonetheless, the man contracted it. Further tests revealed that the man had unusually high levels of iron in his blood. One way the plague bacteria had been weakened was that its key gene for absorbing iron had been removed — but the man's blood, which was chock-full of iron, may have enabled the germ to overcome this weakness and establish a deadly infection.\n\nFor more intriguing medical cases, check out our Diagnostic Dilemma archives.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.",

    "fullText": "Ripple Labs is doubling down on its presence in Japan, drawing on longstanding relationships with the country’s traditional financial institutions. The strategy is aimed at increasing adoption and interest in the XRP Ledger (XRPL).\n\nThis week, Asia Web3 Alliance Japan and Web3 Salon launched the Japan Financial Infrastructure Innovation Program. The initiative is designed to support Japanese startups developing next-generation, compliant digital financial solutions on the XRP Ledger.\n\nThe program opened applications on December 19 and is offering a $10,000 grant per startup. It is narrowly focused on three high-value verticals, including stablecoins, real-world asset tokenization, and credit infrastructure.\n\n\"Japan offers an overwhelming opportunity for blockchain innovation, supported by a forward-thinking regulatory framework and deep talent pool. This program represents Ripple's commitment to fostering a vibrant ecosystem where startups can leverage the speed, low cost, and reliability of the XRP Ledger to create real-world benefits and transform financial infrastructure,\" Christina Chan, Senior Director of Developer Growth at RippleX, said.\n\nAnalysts view it as a low-cost funnel for identifying candidates for Ripple’s significantly larger capital pool, including the 1 billion XRP fund dedicated to developers in Japan and Korea.\n\nThe program has secured backing from a formidable roster of establishment players, including Mizuho Bank, SMBC Nikko Securities, and Securitize Japan.\n\nDespite the initiative's high-profile corporate backing, it comes at a precarious moment for the network. While Ripple touts institutional adoption, the underlying usage of the XRPL tells a conflicting story of contraction.",

    "description": "\"We have objections but we won't appeal further.\"",
    "fullText": "Officials with the United Kingdom's Royal Navy are in hot water for pressuring a government agency to conceal information about radioactive pollution.\n\nInvestigative news outlet The Ferret obtained emails in which naval officials urged the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to keep details of the pollution secret. The Ferret made Freedom of Information Act requests in 2019, 2023, and 2024 for files regarding radioactive problems at two naval bases in Scotland. SEPA kept most of the files secret after consulting the Ministry of Defence, which cited national security concerns.\n\nThe decision was reconsidered when The Ferret took the matter to the Scottish Information Commissioner. In June, SEPA was ordered to release the files by July 28. In response, naval and MOD officials engaged in correspondence with SEPA and the commissioner, sending around 130 emails over nine days in an attempt to reverse the decision.\n\nThe Ferret made further FOIA requests to obtain the emails. They showed that naval officials went as far as to threaten legal action against SEPA if the files were released, though what kind is unclear. The MOD was flagged for the matter and called it \"deeply uncomfortable\" but added, \"We have objections but we won't appeal further.\"\n\nThe cover-up was an effort to conceal information about radioactive pollution in Loch Long on the River Clyde in Scotland. When SEPA finally released the files in August, they revealed that the Royal Navy had failed to properly maintain a network of pipes at the Royal Naval Armaments Depot at Coulport, resulting in \"unnecessary radioactive waste.\"\n\nKeeping such information from the public is dangerous, especially when it comes to health. Loch Long is a popular site for water sports, but tourists might think twice about going for a swim if they knew what lurked beneath the surface.\n\nInformation on radioactive waste in Scotland's Loch Long is now available thanks to The Ferret's investigative journalists. News outlets must continue to push for answers, even when public officials try to conceal the truth.

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s niece has added her own vitriolic words to the mountain of criticism against the president’s choice to add his own name to the Kennedy Center. “It’s this weird devolution, there used to be spaces that were reserved for seriousness of purpose and the arts—like the Kennedy Center—and, you know, the loftier ideals of humanity,” Mary Trump said on The Court of History podcast Friday. She added: “The right used to accuse the left all the time, that we were shoving our elitism down their throats, and now people like Donald and others on the right want to turn everything into NASCAR, WWE, and monster trucks. Everything, from the White House to the Kennedy Center.”",

    "fullText": "With Donald Trump expanding the travel ban inspired by his first term in the White House to 20 more countries, as well as the Palestinian Authority, on Dec. 16, a total of 39 countries from different corners of the world now face either a total ban or restrictions on entering the United States.\n\nMali, South Sudan, Niger, Burkina Faso, Syria, and the Palestinian Authority have been added to the list of nations whose citizens cannot enter the U.S. at all, first introduced in June.\n\nAngola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Ivory Coast, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia, and Zimbabwe were meanwhile added to a list of countries facing a block on student and business visas; the list that Trump put in place in June 2025 previously included Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.\n\nImmediately after their nations were added to the ban, multiple diplomats and heads of state responded with condemnation. Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne issued a statement saying that the Caribbean country's government was \"deeply disappointed\" given that the justification accusing it of loose rules for granting citizenship by investment \"does not reflect the present reality of our laws.\"\n\nTwo weeks after the expansion of the ban, the West African nation of Niger has taken the most drastic step of permanently banning any granting of new visas to U.S. visas in a reciprocal measure until the situation changes.\n\n\"Niger is completely and permanently prohibiting the issuance of visas to all U.S. citizens and indefinitely banning entry to its territory for nationals of the United States,\" a governmental representative said to the Associated Press.\n\nA landlocked country bordered by Algeria, Libya, Chad, Nigeria, Benin, Mali and Burkina Faso, Niger is a Muslim-majority nation with a population of just over 25 million people. In the document announcing the travel ban, the White House said the country has a visa overstay rate of 13.41% for business visas and 16.46% for student ones as well as \"terrorists and their supporters [that] are active in planning kidnappings.\"\n\nWhile a history of war and political instability and coups d'états means that travel into Niger from Western countries remains very low (the State Department has kept it at the \"do not travel\" advisory level for years), the latest move from its government is a major escalation in relations.",

    "fullText": "TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Saturday his country is in a full-scale war with the U.S., Israel and Europe ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s meeting Monday with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nPezeshkian said in an interview published on the website of the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday that the war is worse than Iran's deadly war with Iraq in the 1980s.\n\n“We are in a full-scale war with the U.S., Israel and Europe; they don’t want our country to remain stable,” he said.\n\nPezeshkian said the West's war against Iran is “more complicated and more difficult” compared to the 1980-1988 war with Iraq that left more than 1 million casualties on both sides.\n\nThe remarks came two days before a planned meeting between Trump and Netanyahu during Netanyahu's visit to the U.S. Iran is expected to be a key topic in the talks.\n\nIsraeli and U.S. strikes on Iran that came during a 12-day air war in June killed nearly 1,100 Iranians including senior military commanders and nuclear scientists. Retaliatory missile barrages by Iran killed 28 in Israel.",
