Houston is in the playoffs if the Indianapolis Colts lose or tie against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking of the Jaguars, while Jacksonville leads the AFC South the Texans are still alive for a division title.

    "fullText": "Game result: The Texans beat the Chargers 20-16 on Saturday to clinch a playoff berth. They remain behind the Jaguars in the AFC South, but they cannot be eliminated from division contention if the Jaguars win on Sunday. The Chargers have already clinched a playoff berth, but the loss officially eliminates them from AFC West contention. They drop to the No. 7 seed and with Houston holding the tiebreaker over them, it’s unlikely they get much higher in the seeding.\n\nHouston jumped out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter and looked like they might cruise to victory. They never fell behind, but LA fought back and cut the lead to one possession late in the fourth quarter. Special teams miscues once again cost them in the loss. They cut the lead to 20-16 and then missed a field goal. They made a key illegal contact penalty on a third down sack and couldn’t get the ball back.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers have already clinched a playoff spot.\n\nThe Houston Texans can join them this weekend, starting when the two teams meet Saturday at SoFi Stadium.\n\nHere is where both the Chargers and the Texans stand in the AFC playoff race.\n\nFor the Texans, 2025 has been a tale of two seasons. Houston began the year with three straight losses and went 3-5 over the first half of the season, but a seven-game winning streak has the Texans on the cusp of a playoff berth.\n\nHouston will clinch a playoff spot with a win or a tie in that game against the Chargers.\n\nHowever, even if the Texans lose to the Chargers, they can still clinch a playoff spot on Sunday. Houston is in the playoffs if the Indianapolis Colts lose or tie against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. And speaking of the Jaguars, Houston remains alive in the race for the AFC South title. With wins in their final two games and one loss from the Jaguars down the stretch, the Texans are AFC South champions.\n\nAs for the Chargers, they locked up a playoff spot when the Indianapolis Colts lost to the San Francisco 49ers on Monday Night Football.\n\nBut Los Angeles remains alive in the AFC West race. The Denver Broncos moved one step closer to claiming the division title on Christmas night with a win over the Kansas City Chiefs. But with a win over the Texans, the Chargers can wrap up the division title in Week 18, as they take on the Broncos in the final game of the season. A loss or a tie against Houston would eliminate the Chargers from the AFC West race.\n\nHere are the current AFC standings following Denver’s win on Thursday night:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nThis game could have an impact on seeding between the two teams, under the NFL’s tiebreaker formula. As you can see above, right now the Chargers are the No. 5 seed with an 11-4 record, but the Texans are 10-5, down in the No. 7 spot.\n\nIf Houston wins, the two teams would have matching 11-5 records. The Texans’ win would give them a tiebreaker advantage over the Chargers should they finish tied at the end of the season. However, if Houston, Los Angeles, and Buffalo all finish tied at the end of the year, then their respective conference records will be the determining factor. Entering Week 17, the Chargers have an 8-2 record in AFC games, as do the Texans, while Buffalo is 8-3.",

Patriots (12-3) Would lose the common-games tiebreaker to the Broncos.\n\n3. Jaguars (11-4) The clear favorites in the AFC South.\n\n4. Steelers (9-6) In the driver's seat in the AFC North.\n\n5. Bills (11-4) Probably won't catch the Patriots in the AFC East, but they've clinched a playoff berth.\n\n6. Texans (11-5) Clinched a playoff berth.\n\n7. Chargers (11-5) Clinched a wild card, will likely rest starters in Week 18.\n\n8. Colts (8-7) Mathematically eliminated.\n\n9.

Raiders (2-13) Mathematically eliminated.\n\n1. Seahawks (12-3) Beating the Rams gave them a leg up on the race for the No. 1 seed.\n\n2. Bears (11-4) If the Bears win one more game or the Packers lose one more game, the Bears win the NFC North.\n\n3. Eagles (10-5) Clinched the NFC East.\n\n4. Panthers (8-7) In the driver's seat in the NFC South.\n\n5. 49ers (11-4) Currently own the tiebreaker over the Rams thanks to a better record in the NFC West.\n\n6. Rams (11-4) Losing to the Seahawks means they're likely to have to win three road games, instead of two home games, to reach the Super Bowl.\n\n7. Packers (9-5-1) Clinched a playoff berth. Would need to win both their remaining games and have the Bears lose both their remaining games to win the NFC North.\n\n8. Vikings (8-8) Mathematically eliminated.\n\n9. Lions (8-8) Mathematically eliminated.\n\n10. Buccaneers (7-8) Out of contention for a wild card, but they can still win the NFC South.\n\n11. Cowboys (7-8-1) Mathematically eliminated.\n\n12.

    "fullText": "We are nearing the end of the 2025 NFL season and the playoff picture is coming into focus. With that comes the matchups that will be set soon and the playoff opponents for each team.\n\nAs we enter Week 17, the results of these games will shift who plays who, and we will track that all here.\n\nThe number one see gets a first-round bye and home-field advantage through the playoffs.\n\nEntering Week 17, the Denver Broncos have a chance to clinch the number one seed but it’s going to take a lot of work. It is likely to stretch to Week 18.\n\nPittsburgh can clinch the four seed with a win OR a Ravens loss.\n\n2. New England Patriots (12-3)* host 7. Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)*\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4)* host 6. Houston Texans (11-5)*\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6) host 5. Buffalo Bills (11-4)*\n\nThe NFC bracket is wide open entering Week 17, but the Seahawks can clinch the one seed with a win and some NFC West help.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers can clinch the four seed with a win and a Buccaneers loss.\n\n2. Chicago Bears (11-4)* host 7. Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)\n3. Philadelphia Eagles (10-5)** host 6. Los Angeles Rams (11-4)*\n4. Carolina Panthers (8-7) host 5. San Francisco 49ers (11-4)*\n\n*: Clinched playoff berth\n**: Clinched division title\n***: Clinched no. 1 seed\n\nSaturday 4:30 p.m. result: The Texans beat the Chargers 20-16 to punch their ticket to the playoffs and keep their AFC South hopes alive. They cannot be eliminated from division contention this week if the Jaguars win on Sunday. The result also secured the AFC West title for the Broncos and leaves open the door for the Broncos to clinch the No. 1 seed. Denver is guaranteed can clinch home field through the AFC bracket if the Patriots, Jaguars, and Bills all lose on Sunday.\n\nChristmas 8:30 p.m. result: Denver’s win moved the Broncos one step closer to locking up the AFC West, and perhaps the No. 1 seed in the conference. Denver can clinch the AFC West on Saturday if the Chargers lose or tie against the Houston Texans. The Broncos can also clinch the No. 1 seed in the conference this weekend, but they will need a lot of help to accomplish that goal. Denver locks up the No. 1 seed with a Patriots loss to the Jets, a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans, a Jaguars loss or tie against the Colts, and a Bills loss or tie against the Eagles.\n\nChristmas 4:30 p.m. result: The Lions lost to the Vikings, which officially clinched a berth for the Packers and eliminated the Lions. That solidifies all but one team in the playoff field. The Packers currently hold the final wild card berth, but still have an outside shot at the NFC North title. The seeding is not set for the six teams already in the field. The final team to join the field will be the NFC South champion, and that team is all but certain to be the No. 4 seed.\n\nWe will update as more Week 17 results come in.",

    "description": "A once-promising Colts season that included a 7-1 start, has ended without a postseason berth, sparked by a historic late-season collapse.",
    "fullText": "The Colts’ season has come to an all too familiar ending for a fifth consecutive year. But in 2025, an Indianapolis franchise led by general manager Chris Ballard and head coach Shane Steichen did so in historic fashion.\n\nWith two games left to play, Indianapolis – once holder of the best record in the NFL at 7-1 – has been eliminated from the playoffs by Houston’s 20-16 road win over the Chargers on Saturday.\n\nEntering Week 17, the Texans held a two-game lead on the Colts for the AFC’s final wild card playoff spot. In order to snap a four-year postseason drought, the Colts needed their AFC South divisional foes to lose out, combined with winning out themselves and getting help elsewhere around the league to avoid a historic collapse.\n\nWith Saturday’s result, the Colts become just the sixth team since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 to miss the playoffs after starting 7-1. Three of those previous teams – the 1975 Dolphins, the 1987 Chargers and the 1988 Saints – missed out when the NFL’s playoff format only included four (Dolphins) or five (Chargers and Saints) teams from each conference.\n\nHouston started 0-3 and will be the first team since the 2018 Texans (and second since 1999) to make the playoffs after that start since the AFL-NFL merger. Teams were 245 of the 252 teams to start 0-3 missed the playoffs in that timeframe.\n\nHere are the eight biggest factors that led to the Colts missing the playoffs for the fifth straight season – a postseason-less campaign brought on by a skid that will go down in the NFL’s history books.\n\nThe overarching theme to the Colts’ hot-and-cold season through Week 16 has been the team’s struggle to beat playoff-caliber teams consistently or win high-pressure games down the stretch. Following the team’s come-from-behind home win in Week 2 over a Broncos squad that could land the No. 1 seed in the AFC, the Colts have gone just 1-6 against teams that have clinched a playoff spot or are still in the running.\n\nThe Colts started 2-1 in such games – including a resounding road win, 38-24, over the Chargers – but also lost in Week 4 on the road to the Rams and in Week 9 in Pittsburgh. The Colts’ six losses against playoff-caliber teams this year have seen the offense that was once considered historically dynamic score just a tick under 20 points per game.\n\nThe Colts are also 3-5 in one-score game this year, including wins against the lowly Cardinals (31-27) and Falcons (31-25).\n\nThe beginning of the end came near the end of the first quarter in Jacksonville when starting quarterback Daniel Jones planted his foot awkwardly and fell to the ground untouched as he released the ball. Instantly, Jones grasped for his lower right leg, unstrapped his helmet, yanked it off and slammed it to the ground. He’d suffered a torn Achilles tendon, an injury with an unprecise recovery timeline famous for taking away a player’s explosiveness for a season after the injury – doubly concerning for a quarterback who signed with the Colts this offseason on a one-year deal.\n\nJones’ torn Achilles forced the Colts to think outside the box and look to Philip Rivers, a quarterback who last led the Colts to the playoffs in 2020, but who retired after that season and had been coaching high school football and training draft prospects in the half-decade since.\n\nFor a 44-year-old off-the-couch quarterback, Rivers’ performance has been commendable, including throwing for 277 yards and two touchdowns Monday night in a game largely lost by a woeful defensive performance. His 120-yard, one-touchdown performance in Week 15 helped manage the game and was about as good as the Colts could’ve hoped for.\n\nThere’s reason to think a healthy Jones quarterbacks the Colts to at least two or three wins during the team’s five-game losing streak.\n\nNow, the Colts’ quarterback questions that have persisted since Andrew Luck retired more than six years ago, will continue.\n\nThe Colts’ cornerback injury woes began in training camp with rookie third-round pick Justin Walley – who looked primed to start – went down with a torn ACL during a joint practice.\n\nThe Colts released third-year corner JuJu Brents, a 2023 second-round pick, after Brents struggled with a hamstring injury. The team’s former starter, 2023 seventh-round pick Jaylon Jones, also had hamstring issues throughout the summer and again in Week 1, sidelining him until early-November.\n\nThe Colts were forced to look outside the organization late in the summer to fill a key spot alongside major offseason signing Charvarius Ward, an All-Pro corner signed to a three-year deal in the spring. Four games into a return to the field, however, former Dolphins corner Xavien Howard retired after he was targeted and exploited routinely against the Broncos and Rams.\n\nThe Colts – plagued further by injury as Ward missed six of the team’s first 10 games due to a series of concussions – were forced to return to a combination of Mekhi Blackmon, acquired from the Vikings for a sixth-round pick in the preseason, undrafted rookie Jonathan Edwards and Cameron Mitchell, added to the practice squad in October.\n\nThe team traded for All-Pro corner Sauce Gardner at the deadline for two first-round picks and receiver Adonai Mitchell, but Gardner would play just two full games with Indianapolis before a calf injury two plays into a Week 13 game against Houston. Thinking they’d locked down the best corner tandem in the league for the stretch run, the Colts saw Ward and Gardner share the field for a single game. By the time Gardner returned to practice this week, Ward had been lost for the year with his third concussion.\n\nThe Colts secondary has given up the second-most passing yards per game in the league this year (250.7) while it's tied for 21st in yards gained per pass attempt allowed (7.2) and tied for 22nd in yards per completion allowed (11.2).\n\nThough he's second in the league in rushing yards in 2025, what was once on pace to be a historic 2025 campaign for Colts running back Jonathan Taylor has turned far more pedestrian of late.\n\nSince the Colts’ Week 11 bye – which followed Taylor’s 244 rushing yards and three touchdowns in Berlin against the Falcons – the Colts’ tailback has just 350 yards in five games while averaging a paltry 3.5 yards per carry. Taylor was averaging 6.0 yards per rush at the season’s halfway mark.\n\nWhat’s worse is Indianapolis’ run game has lost its explosiveness . Before the Colts’ bye, significant chunks of Taylor’s 1,139 rushing yards had come off “explosive runs” – carries of 10 yards or longer, which the sixth-year back was achieving nearly 15% of the time.\n\nIn the five games – and 99 carries – since, Taylor has just eight such carries, with only one of them even hitting 15 yards (an early-game 27-yard carry against the Chiefs). In only one game since the Colts’ bye has Taylor even averaged 4.0 yards per carry (on 21 carries for 85 yards against the Texans), and he picked up just 2.9 yads per carry on Monday against the 49ers – one of the 10 worst games of his career.\n\nDeForest Buckner, a captain for the Colts and the soul of its defense, missed five games due to a herniated disc in his neck and a compressed nerve suffered in the Colts’ Week 9 loss in Pittsburgh. The Colts went 1-4 during his absence, which corresponded with a downturn in the defense’s ability to put pressure on the quarterback and defend the run.\n\nIn the five games Buckner missed, the Colts defense registered just 10 sacks – seven coming against the Falcons and Chiefs. Of those 10 sacks, four have been by linebackers or safeties. A defense that with Buckner ranked top 6 in sacks is now tied for 13th, a slip due to offenses no longer having to double Buckner and an Indianapolis defense line often incapable of winning one-on-one battles.\n\nDuring the Colts’ time without Bucker, the Colts defense also gave up 109.8 yards per game on the ground, a figure that would rank 14th-best over the course of the season. Before he was sidelined, the Colts were one of the best run-stopping units in the league.\n\nBackup quarterback Anthony Richardson fractured his orbital bone after he was struck in the face by an apparatus that snapped after the third-year quarterback had attached a stretching band to it in the locker room to begin his pre-game warmups ahead of the Colts’ Week 6 home game against the Cardinals. He required surgery and only returned to practice ahead of the team’s Week 16 game against the 49ers.\n\nBut Richardson has vision issues that have kept the Colts coaching staff and front office from returning him to the active roster.\n\nWhen Jones went down one quarter into the game in Jacksonville, the Colts were forced to look to rookie sixth-round pick Riley Leonard. He played the first meaningful snaps of his NFL career that afternoon in rain and at a stadium the Colts had not won at in a decade. His performance was valiant – 18-for-29 for 145 yards, an interception and a rushing score – but it wasn’t enough in a 36-19 rout.\n\nIt’s no guarantee having Richardson would’ve guaranteed a win. But having a dynamic, experienced quarterback under center in Jacksonville could’ve brought a bit of a spark, and not needing to ground-and-pound in the same manner in Seattle with Rivers might’ve led to just enough offense to tack on another win in 2025.\n\nIn what had already been a rocky, up-and-down tenure with the Colts, Adonai Mitchell didn't hold onto the football through the goal line on a runaway touchdown catch-and-run against the Rams.\n\nDown three in the second half of the Week 4 game with the Rams, Mitchell was on the final steps of a career-play – what should’ve been a 76-yard touchdown. Instead, the ball slipped out of his fingertips as he attempted to change hands as he prepared to cross the goal line. The ball rolled through the back of the end zone and was instead ruled a 75-yard catch, fumble and touchback.\n\nInstead of going up four points early in the third quarter, the Colts defense stumbled to the finish, giving up a pair of touchdowns in the final four minutes to lose 27-20 against a team that now has an argument as one of the best in the league.\n\nHad Mitchell not dropped that ball, there’s a real chance the Colts could’ve started 8-0 and come out of their Week 11 bye 9-1. It doesn’t mean they’d be sitting any better than 9-6 at this point, but at minimum, the Colts could’ve still had a chance to keep their playoff hopes alive in Week 17 with a potential win-and-in Week 18 matchup in Houston.\n\nThree plays later, the Colts were across midfield, and within four plays – and with just over 2:30 left on the clock – Indianapolis sat on the Houston 32 with 1st and 10. A one-yard run and a pair of incomplete passes later, the home squad faced 4th-and-long on the 31. Had Badgley connected on his earlier extra point, the Colts could’ve lined him up and attempted a 49-yard game-tying field goal.\n\nThat missed PAT, instead, required a touchdown, with an incomplete pass turned the ball over on downs. It was Badgley's third missed PAT in his seven games with the Colts and Badgley was waived the next day.\n\nJoel A. Erickson and Nathan Brown cover the Colts all season.

    "fullText": "Lamar Jackson injury history: A complete timeline of injuries for Ravens QB originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere is no doubt Baltimore Ravens QB Lamar Jackson is one of the most electrifying players in the NFL when healthy, but keeping him 100% healthy has been a challenge at times.\n\nBetween MVP campaigns in 2019 and 2023, Jackson ended two seasons on the sidelines due to injury, and 2025 quickly began to get away from the Ravens when another injury struck.\n\nIt’s likely no coincidence Jackson’s fully healthy seasons have been far and away his best. After recovering from injury in 2022, Jackson returned to MVP form, winning his second MVP award in 2023 before putting together an even more impressive campaign the following season from a statistical standpoint.\n\nHere’s a look back at Jackson’s injury history and how many games he has missed due to injury.\n\nMORE:Explaining the Lamar Jackson trade rumors\n\nAfter missing one game for a pre-playoff break in 2019 and another due to COVID-19 in 2020, Jackson missed his first games because of injury in 2021.\n\nWhile a non-COVID illness initially cost him a game against the Chicago Bears in 2021, Jackson went on to miss the Ravens’ final four games of the season with a significant ankle sprain. He suffered the injury early in a loss to the Cleveland Browns in Week 14, and Baltimore limped to an 0-5 finish and missed the playoffs with Jackson out of the mix.\n\nJackson struggled to match his MVP production in 2022, throwing 10 touchdowns over his first three starts but just seven over his final nine before going down with a sprained PCL in his knee.\n\nDespite being labeled week to week and hoping for a playoff return, Jackson missed the final five games of the regular season and the Ravens’ wild-card matchup with the Cincinnati Bengals. Baltimore went 3-3 without Jackson, including a playoff loss, and some wondered whether he had played his last down as a Raven with his contract set to expire after the season.\n\nAfter plenty of speculation about his future, Jackson agreed to a five-year, $260 million contract extension to remain in Baltimore long term.\n\nMORE:Inside Lamar Jackson's family tree\n\nJackson suffered a hamstring injury against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 4 of the 2025 season and didn't return for a month, missing games against the Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Bears with a bye week sandwiched in-between.\n\nThe injury cost Jackson a bit longer than he hoped, as the Bears game had been targeted by the Ravens as his potential return date, but he looked every bit like himself in his return against the Miami Dolphins. Unfortunately for Jackson, that momentum did not last.\n\nAfter returning from a hamstring injury, Jackson struggled to play anything like he did in 2024, throwing four touchdowns and five interceptions across seven starts following his return against the Dolphins.\n\nIn the meantime, Jackson battled various ailments that kept him out of practices. Jackson missed practice time with injuries to his ankle, toe and knee, also missing a practice due to illness. While those injuries never kept him out of a game, his performance appeared to be impacted by them.\n\nJackson exited a prime-time game against the New England Patriots with a back contusion and did not return. He was summarily ruled out of the Ravens’ Week 17 game against the Packers. While Jackson did not receive a formal diagnosis beyond a “deep tissue bruise,” the injury was painful enough that he could not return to a pivotal game against an AFC contender.\n\nMORE: Where does Lamar Jackson rank among the 13 greatest Ravens of all time?\n\nBefore his back contusion deep into the 2025 season, Jackson missed 17 games over eight NFL seasons, including the playoffs. Here is the complete breakdown:\n\nJackson's 17 missed games include two due to pre-playoffs rest and two due to illness. His longest injury-related absence spanned six games, as Jackson missed the Ravens' final five regular season games and a playoff game with a sprained PCL in his knee in 2022.",

Well, the Texans took care of business today and defeated the Chargers, which has clinched the AFC West for the Denver Broncos.\n\nAFC WEST CHAMPS.\n\nGoal No. 1 ✅\n\nAnd we’re still climbing. pic.twitter.com/yHbSmyw8Ww\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) December 28, 2025\n\nThis is the Broncos’ 16th AFC West Championship, their first since 2015, and the first for Head Coach Sean Payton and quarterback Bo Nix.\n\nThe Broncos have been on a magical run this season, and after starting the season 1-2, they ripped off 11 straight wins and are now AFC West champions and the favorites for the number one seed in the AFC. They have been led by their elite defense and second-year quarterback Bo Nix, who has improved as the season went on and has led multiple 4th quarter comebacks and game-winning drives.\n\nWith a postseason berth and now the AFC West locked up, the Broncos will set their sights on the number one seed in the AFC. They can clinch the one seed as early as tomorrow, but they will need a lot of help for that to happen. They will need the Patriots to lose to the Jets, the Bills to lose to the Eagles, and the Jaguars to lose to Grandpa Phillip Rivers and the Colts. All three of those scenarios playing out tomorrow are highly unlikely, so the Broncos will likely need to win next weekend, at Mile High, vs. the Chargers.\n\nThe Broncos are back where they belong. Three years ago, the team fired Nathaniel Hackett the day after Christmas and just signed quarterback Russell Wilson to a contract that would age poorly. Now, three years later. Sean Payton has led the Broncos back to being Super Bowl contenders, and Bo Nix is your franchise quarterback.\n\nTIME TO CELEBRATE BRONCOS COUNTRY, THE DENVER BRONCOS ARE YOUR 2025 AFC WEST CHAMPIONS!",

The Houston Texans beat the Los Angeles Chargers on Saturday, which precludes Jacksonville from clinching the division title on Sunday if they beat the Colts. However, a win over Indianapolis would leave Jacksonville in first place holding a one game lead over Houston heading into Week 18.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars clinched a playoff berth this past week, but can clinch something more important in Week 17. They are in control of their fate in the AFC South and clinch the division title as soon as this week. They need a win and some help from their Houston division-mates.\n\nThe Jaguars face the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday and are 5.5-point favorites. Jacksonville will be without right guard Patrick Mekari due to a back injury, while center Robert Hainsey is questionable with a groin injury. The Colts will be without center Tanor Bortolini (concussion) and defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (back). Their list of questionable players includes cornerback Sauce Gardner (calf) and right guard Dalton Tucker (shoulder).\n\nIf the Jaguars clinch the AFC South, it would be their first playoff appearance and division title since 2022. That year, they beat the Chargers in the Wild Card round and then lost to the Chiefs in the Divisional Round. They have won their division four times prior to this sesason.\n\nThe Jaguars can clinch the AFC South with a win and a Texans loss or tie against the Chargers on Saturday. Houston is traveling to LA for the game and is a 1.5-point underdog.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: 11-4 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nDenver Broncos: 13-3 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nNew England Patriots: 12-3 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: 11-4 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nLos Angeles Chargers: 11-4 (clinched playoff berth)\n\nBuffalo Bills: 11-4 (clinched playoff berth)",

They could clinch the top seed with some more help on Sunday, but for now they’re guaranteed a top three seed in the 2026 NFL Playoffs.\n\nUpdate (Christmas night): Denver’s win over the Chiefs on Christmas night keeps both of their scenarios alive for Week 17. The Broncos will clinch the AFC West with a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans on Saturday night. Denver can also clinch the No. 1 seed in the conference with a Patriots loss to the Jets, a Chargers loss or tie to the Texans, a Jaguars loss or tie against the Colts, and a Bills loss or tie against the Eagles.\n\nThe Denver Broncos travel to GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas night to take on the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAnd the Broncos can make it a wonderful Christmas for themselves and their fans with a win over their division rivals, and a little bit of help from around the rest of the league. Denver can clinch both the AFC West, and the No. 1 seed in the AFC, here in Week 17.\n\nThe Denver Broncos last won the AFC West back in 2015.\n\nPeyton Manning — yes, the guy from the commercials — was their starting quarterback.\n\nBut Denver can clinch the AFC West title this week, officially bringing to an end the Kansas City Chiefs’ reign atop the division. With a win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, and a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie against the Houston Texans on Saturday, the Broncos are AFC West champions.\n\nDenver can also clinch the AFC West with a tie against the Chiefs, provided the Chargers lose to the Texans.\n\nNot only can Denver clinch the AFC West this weekend, but the Broncos also have a narrow path to clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC, something that again the team has not accomplished since that 2015 season.\n\nHowever, Denver would need a lot of help to wrap that up this weekend.\n\nFirst, the Broncos would need to win against the Chiefs on Thursday night. Then, the Broncos would need the New England Patriots to lose to the New York Jets, the Chargers to lose or tie against the Texans, the Jacksonville Jaguars to lose or tie against the Indianapolis Colts, and the Buffalo Bills to lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nSo you’re saying there’s a chance …\n\nHere are the full AFC standings heading into Week 17:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nAFC West standings entering Week 17\n\nHere are the full AFC West standings with two weeks left in the season:\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x",

    "description": "Coach JJ Redick said he calmly delivered a message to his players that it was time for \"reconnection\" with the team's second-leading scorer sideline at least a month.",
    "fullText": "After the Lakers’ third straight loss Thursday, JJ Redick promised things would get “uncomfortable.” The second-year coach, frustrated after the team delivered a lump of coal in a Christmas Day blowout by the Houston Rockets, said he couldn’t stand to rewatch the same tired story. Leaning his elbow on the table at his postgame news conference, Redick called out players who don’t give enough effort on defense or play hard.\n\nTwo days later he stood in front of reporters with a different tone.\n\n“Recalibration,” Redick said calmly of the message he delivered during Saturday’s team meeting. “Reconnection.”\n\nRedick has cooled, but the Lakers still are under fire. Not only are they trying to snap a season-high three-game losing streak at home Sunday against the Sacramento Kings (6:30 p.m.), but also the Lakers (19-10) still are looking for their first home win in December and must navigate this defining moment without guard Austin Reaves.\n\nReaves was diagnosed with a grade 2 strain in his left calf Friday and will be reevaluated in four weeks. The latest setback comes less than two weeks after he was sidelined because of a “mild” strain in the same calf that kept him out for three games.\n\nReaves is averaging career highs in points (26.6), assists (6.3) and rebounds (5.2) and his ascent from undrafted rookie to potential first-time All-Star was one of the team’s feel-good stories of the season. Reaves scored a career-high 51 points against Sacramento in October, rescuing the Lakers in a game without LeBron James or Luka Doncic and showing Reaves’ potential in a starring role.\n\nNow without their second-leading scorer, the Lakers are looking for their supporting cast to step up.\n\n“We just need our guys to be stars in their roles,” Redick said. “Certainly from a top-end talent standpoint, it diminishes that. But it doesn't change the non-negotiables or how we're trying to play.”\n\nAfter losing the last three games by an average of 20.7 points per game, the Lakers needed to get reacquainted with their non-negotiables during Saturday’s meeting. The session was uncomfortable in the way confronting truth can be uncomfortable, Redick said. It wasn’t just coaches lecturing, but also players speaking up.\n\nThe top priority was creating more clarity, Redick said. The team needed to get back to building its defensive fundamentals after so many lineup changes because of injuries. The Lakers have used 16 different starting lineups in 29 games and have to readjust their rotation again in Reaves’ absence.\n\n“Togetherness is going to have to be emphasized to where it looks like an exaggeration,” center Deandre Ayton said, “where it becomes a habit. And that's what winners do. And it's pretty easy for this team. It's just that there's always a different group out there and we're going to get it for sure.”\n\nForward Rui Hachimura said coaches reminded players of the team’s three pillars that again were displayed on a screen in the practice gym Saturday — championship habits, championship communication, championship shape.\n\n“We just talk about everybody, players, coaches, we just gotta kind of tighten up,” Hachimura said. “We had a good stretch in the beginning and now we kind of, I don't know, we relaxed or we kind of got tired of winning, you know, but we just stopped doing what we're supposed to do.”\n\nThe Lakers are 29th in the NBA in defensive rating in the last 15 games, giving up 122.2 points per 100 possessions. It’s a significant drop from their rating of 113.7 in the first 14 games in which they went 10-4.\n\nSince James returned from, the Lakers’ preferred starting lineup — Doncic, Reaves, James, Ayton and Hachimura — has a net rating of minus-19.9 in seven games.\n\nOffensively the Lakers have lacked organization since James came back, Redick acknowledged. James declined to speak to reporters after practice.\n\n“Too many random possessions,” Redick said. “That's on me.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Sorry, NBC. For your late-season game streamed exclusively* on Peacock, you were expecting Jordan Love vs. Lamar Jackson with playoff implications. Instead, you’re getting Malik Willis vs. Tyler Huntley instead.\n\n*Except in the Green Bay, Milwaukee, and Baltimore markets, which will get the game on local NBC stations.\n\nTo be sure, Willis vs. Huntley is pretty darn good as backup quarterback matchups go. Willis has been excellent for the Packers in the last two years when called upon to fill in for Love, while Huntley has been much the same as Jackson’s backup for five of the last six seasons. In fact, Huntley somehow even made a Pro Bowl in 2022, albeit as the sixth quarterback option for the AFC.\n\nIn any case, the game still has significant potential postseason implications for both of these teams. The losing team in this game will be eliminated from division contention with a loss, with Baltimore being eliminated from the playoffs outright if the Packers win. Green Bay is in the postseason already, but a loss locks them into the #7 seed instead.\n\nBoth teams still need considerable help to win their divisions, however, and even with a win could be knocked out with a single result going awry for them on Sunday.\n\nJoin us here at Acme Packing Company to discuss everything happening in and around tonight’s game!\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!",

As a South Georgia kid, you grow up wanting to be a Florida State Seminole. I remember going to Doak Campbell Stadium with my dad and how electrifying that experience was. My dad raised me that either you’re a liability or you’re an asset, and all I want to do is be an asset for Florida State. I get to come home and do what I love to do.

    "fullText": "Who is Malik Willis? Meet the failed Titans draft pick who has become impressive Packers backup originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers will square off against the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday in Week 17, and Matt LaFleur's squad will be without starting quarterback Jordan Love.\n\nLove left the Packers' Week 16 defeat to the Chicago Bears early due to a concussion and was ruled out for Saturday's contest versus the Ravens. That means Malik Willis will take over as the starter for Green Bay.\n\nWillis has made a few appearances for the Packers over the last two years, but let's get to know Green Bay's reliable backup quarterback.\n\nWills began his college career at Auburn, but transferred after just two seasons with the Tigers due to a lack of playing time. The dynamic signal-caller committed to Liberty, where he tossed 47 touchdowns and 18 interceptions with 27 scores on the ground as well.\n\nAfter the 2021 season, Willis entered the 2022 NFL Draft and was selected in the third round by the Tennessee Titans.\n\nEntering the league, Willis had a ton of hype around him, but his tenure with the Titans was short-lived and underwhelming. He spent just two years in Tennessee, making three starts and never throwing a touchdown pass.\n\nAfter the 2024 preseason, where he showed improvement and promise, Willis was traded to the Packers to be Love's backup.\n\nThough he wasn't expected to play a pivotal role, Willis was thrown into the fire during Weeks 2 and 3 of the 2024 season after Love went down with an injury. In those two starts, Willis dazzled, winning both games against the Indianapolis Colts and his former team, the Titans.\n\nWillis finished the 2024 campaign with three touchdown passes, no interceptions, and a 74.1% completion rate. He also added a rushing touchdown.\n\nSo far in 2025, Willis hasn't made a start, but he's still played well when tasked to fill in for Love. The 26-year-old is now set for his first start of the season against the Ravens in a game Green Bay must win to stay alive in the NFC North division race.\n\nLions rumor opens door for Detroit to hire new OC from rival\n\nFred Warner injury update is exciting news for 49ers\n\nJoe Burrow expected to be subject of offseason trade calls\n\nSteelers injury updates offer good and bad news for Week 17\n\nMax Brosmer made NFL history that will make Lions fans sick",

    "fullText": "The NFL has fined Chicago Bears defensive end Austin Booker for a couple of illegal hits on Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love in last Saturday night's game, according to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\n\nBooker was fined $11,636 total for his two hits on Love, including one that knocked Love out of the game with a concussion. It was the more controversial call of the two considering Love lowered his helmet to initiate helmet-to-helmet contact. But Booker was flagged, and now penalized, regardless.\n\nWhen Love exited the game, the Bears defense struggled against backup quarterback Malik Willis, whose mobility proved to be an issue. But Chicago's bend-don't-break defense, coupled with quarterback Caleb Williams' fourth-quarter heroics, was able to pull off an improbable 22-16 overtime win.\n\nMeanwhile, the NFL did not fine Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon for his late hit on wide receiver DJ Moore early in the first quarter. But Moore got the last laugh as he scored the game-winning touchdown in overtime with Nixon draped over him in the end zone.\n\nFollow Bears Wire on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears DE Austin Booker fined for two hits on Packers QB Jordan Love",

    "fullText": "Chargers playoff picture: How loss to Texans impacts AFC wild-card race, LA's postseason chances originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers have emerged as a contender in a crowded AFC, but after a loss to the Houston Texans on Saturday, they can start packing their bags for their first playoff game.\n\nLos Angeles dropped its Week 17 matchup against Houston, falling to 11-5 on the season and ceding the AFC West crown to the Denver Broncos, who had already clinched the division earlier in the week. The Chargers have secured a playoff spot for the second straight season, but will now do so as a wild-card team.\n\nThe loss to the Texans, who were fighting for their own playoff lives, locks the Chargers into a road game in the wild-card round, likely as the fifth or sixth seed in the AFC bracket. While Jim Harbaugh’s team entered Week 17 with a slim but viable chance to claim the coveted AFC West title and host a home game, the defeat eliminates that possibility and shifts the focus entirely to the final regular-season matchup.\n\nHere’s where the Chargers stand in the AFC playoff picture.\n\nNFL Week 17 picks against the spread\n\nThe Chargers have officially cemented their place in the postseason, but after the tough Week 17 loss to the Texans, the AFC West title is officially out of reach. That loss, which dropped the Chargers to second place in the division, means the Denver Broncos (13-3) have officially clinched the AFC West crown for the first time since 2015.\n\nJim Harbaugh's team will now shift its focus to securing the best possible Wild Card seed as they prepare for a road trip in the opening round of the playoffs. The Chargers now hold the tiebreaker for the top Wild Card spot over the 11-4 Buffalo Bills due to a better conference record, but Buffalo can take sole possession of that spot with a win over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.\n\nWhile winning the AFC West is no longer an option, the Chargers' Week 18 matchup against the division-champion Broncos remains critical. The outcome of that game will determine whether the Chargers can maintain their hold on the No. 5 seed or drop to the No. 6 seed, which would dictate their Wild Card opponent and likely a tougher travel schedule.\n\nAfter securing their playoff ticket, the Chargers now focus on building momentum for the postseason, where they will try to make a run at the AFC Championship and the Super Bowl from the Wild Card position.\n\nCurrently, the Chargers sit at the No. 6 seed in the AFC.\n\nWith a win in Week 18, the Chargers would clinch at least the No. 6 seed. They need the Bills to lose to either the Eagles or the Jets to remain in the 5 seed.\n\nSix of the seven teams in the AFC playoffs have clinched, with the AFC North spot being the one up in the air. The Bills can still catch the Patriots for the AFC East and the Texans can catch the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nMORE: Meet Chargers QB Justin Herbert's family",

    "fullText": "The Texans' 20-16 win over the Chargers eliminated the Colts from playoff contention and made them the rare team to open a season 7-1 before failing to qualify for the postseason.\n\nOnly five other teams have suffered similar slides since the AFL-NFL merger and none of those teams have done it since the NFL moved to a 17-game season.\n\nThe Colts were able to get to 8-2, but they have lost their last five games heading into Sunday's game against the Jaguars. That collapse means they have now gone five straight seasons without a playoff berth.\n\nTheir last trip to the postseason came after the 2020 season. That was Philip Rivers' last full season in the NFL and the Colts coaxed the quarterback out of retirement a couple of weeks ago after Daniel Jones tore his Achilles. Rivers has played better than most people would have predicted, but the results haven't changed and the Colts will be left to ponder what might have been.\n\nThey'll also be left without their next two first-round picks to help shore up the roster. They sent both those selections to the Jets in a trade for cornerback Sauce Gardner and the first of those picks will be coming a lot earlier in the 2026 first round than originally anticipated as a result of the late season swoon in Indianapolis.",

    "fullText": "In banking, telecom, and payments, reliability is not a nice to have. It is table stakes. The most reliable systems I have worked on reduce entire classes of bugs before the code even runs. Functional programming and Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) let you push correctness into the type system, so illegal states cannot be constructed in the first place.\n\nMost production incidents are not due to complex algorithms. They are due to the code entering a state that should never have been possible. If you have been on call, you have seen variants of these:\n\nFunctional programming helps by modeling the domain with types that make invalid states unrepresentable. Pure functions and immutability keep behavior predictable and testable.\n\nProduct types combine fields, think \"and\". Sum types choose one of several cases, think \"or\". Together they model your domain rules.\n\nWith this shape, \"paypal\" cannot exist as a Payment. The compiler refuses the value.\n\nWhen you pattern match on a sum type, the compiler can force you to handle every variant. If you later add a new case, every non exhaustive match becomes a compilation error or warning. This is how refactors become safe by default.\n\nAdd a new Crypto method and both code bases will point out every place you must update.\n\nIncident story\n\nA payout worker retries on network timeouts and calls settle() twice. The table allows pending = false and settled = true twice with the same ledger id. Reconciliation finds duplicates and accounting needs a manual fix.\n\nWhy it happened\n\nState is spread across booleans and strings. The database does not express the lifecycle. The application code does, but only by convention and tests.\n\nTransitions become total functions. You can return a Result when a transition is not allowed.\n\nNow the illegal transitions are blocked by construction. Test coverage still matters, but the shape of the model prevents a class of bugs.\n\nRefactor safety\n\nWhen product adds Chargeback, the compiler highlights every match that ignores it. You cannot ship with a half handled lifecycle.\n\nEvery switch on TxnState now requires a chargeback branch. This is free guidance from the compiler.\n\nIncident story\n\nThe call detail record pipeline generates billing events whenever it sees a Connected event. Under jitter and retries, some sessions never receive Completed. The billing system charges based on the wrong boundary and customers complain.\n\nWhy it happened\n\nThe call lifecycle is implicit across many services. A connected session with no end was still billable because there was no type that separated non billable states from billable ones.\n\nNow a connected but never completed call cannot produce a billable duration. The shape forbids the bug.\n\nIncident story\n\nA cache TTL is stored in an environment variable. Someone sets CACHE_TTL_SECS=30s. In JavaScript, Number(\"30s\") yields NaN and your code treats it as zero, disabling caching in production.\n\nThe ambiguity disappears. The code must handle absence and parse errors explicitly.\n\nDo not use null to mean \"maybe\". Do not throw exceptions for expected errors.\n\nThese types make the happy path and the error path equally explicit.\n\nMutable shared state is a common source of heisenbugs under concurrency. Prefer immutable data and pure functions. When you need to update, create a new value.\n\nYour tests become simple. Given the same inputs, the function returns the same output.\n\nNumbers are not self describing. Create types that carry meaning.\n\nYou stop mixing milliseconds with seconds or dollars with cents by accident.\n\nKeep the domain logic pure and push IO to the edges. This makes unit tests cheap and fast.\n\nStart small and make continuous progress. Here is a practical order for a team new to these ideas.\n\nReplace pairs of booleans with a sum type\n\nReplace string enums with discriminated unions\n\nReplace nullable fields with Option\n\nReplace thrown control flow with Result\n\nIntroduce newtypes or branded types for units and ids\n\nPattern matching compiles to simple branches. Discriminated unions in TypeScript are just plain objects. The main cost you will feel is validation at the boundaries in smart constructors. This is a trade worth making. The compiler then protects the interior of the system.\n\nReliability is designed. With Algebraic Data Types, pattern matching, Option and Result, immutability, and smart constructors, you encode domain rules directly in your types. Illegal states cannot compile. This is why industries that cannot afford failure, such as banking and telecom, gravitate to functional ideas.\n\nIf you work on code that touches money, minutes, or public availability, adopt these patterns now.\n\nYour on call shifts will be quieter, and your users will notice the difference.",

    "fullText": "Lars,\nNiklas Hehenkamp and\nMarkus\n\nReports of GNSS interference in the Baltic Sea have become almost routine — airplanes losing GPS, ships drifting off course, and timing systems failing. But what happens when a group of engineers decides to build a navigation system that simply *doesn’t care* about the jammer?\n\nSince 2017, we’ve been developing **R-Mode**, a terrestrial navigation system that uses existing radio beacons and maritime infrastructure to provide independent positioning — no satellites needed. In this talk, we’ll share our journey from an obscure research project that “nobody needs” to a system now seen as crucial for resilience and sovereignty. Expect technical insights, field stories from ships in the Baltic, and reflections on what it means when a civilian backup system suddenly attracts military interest.\n\nSince 2017, our team at DLR and partners across Europe have been working on an alternative to satellite navigation: **R-Mode**, a backup system based on terrestrial transmitters. Our main testbed spans the Baltic Sea — a region now infamous for GNSS jamming and spoofing.\n\nWe’ll start by showing what GNSS interference actually means in practice: aircraft losing navigation data, ships switching to manual control, and entire regions facing timing outages — such as the recent disruption of telecommunications in Gdańsk during Easter 2025.\n\nThen we’ll take you behind the scenes of building R-Mode: designing signals that can coexist with legacy systems, installing transmitters along the coast, and testing shipborne receivers in rough conditions. We’ll share personal moments — like the first time we received a stable position fix in the middle of the Baltic.\n\nFinally, we’ll talk about perception and politics: how a “research curiosity” became a critical infrastructure project, why ESA now wants to build a *satellite* backup (with the same vulnerabilities), and how it feels when your civilian open-source navigation system suddenly becomes strategically relevant.\n\nLicensed to the public under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\n\nThis Talk was translated into multiple languages.

    "fullText": "United Rugby Championship, Dexcom Stadium\n\nTries: Treacy, Jansen, Devine Cons: Gilbert 3 Pens: Gilbert\n\nTries: Z Ward 2, Kok, Penalty try Cons: Murphy 2 Pens: Murphy\n\nUlster came from behind to claim a fifth bonus-point win of their United Rugby Championship campaign against Connacht in Galway.\n\nBoth sides came into the interprovincial derby at the Dexcom Stadium off the back of consecutive losses in all competitions but it was the northern province who got back to winning ways with a pair of tries in each half.\n\nIn a game when both sides were shown a pair of yellow cards, Zac Ward scored twice for Ulster with a Werner Kok effort and penalty try also contributing to the win.\n\nConnacht, who had led 10-0 in the first-half, scored late tries through Sean Jansen and Matthew Devine to cut the deficit to two late on, but Jack Murphy's late penalty made the game safe.\n\nUlster remain fifth in the URC and host Munster in Belfast next week, while Connacht go to Leinster now having lost five of their past six games.\n\nWhen it came to those vying for national coach Andy Farrell's attention, opposing flankers Nick Timoney and Cian Prendergast both made telling contributions in the early minutes with breakdown turnovers.\n\nThe latter should have provided the territory for Connacht's first score but Sam Gilbert missed a kickable penalty at the end of a forgettable opening quarter of an hour.\n\nThe westerners eventually took the lead in the 24th minute.\n\nWith Ulster's Jack Murphy in the sin bin for a deliberate knock-on, Connacht made the most of a kick out on the full with Sam Gilbert putting Finn Treacy over in the corner for the game's opening try.\n\nIt was only handling errors in promising positions that prevented Connacht from taking a more commanding early lead. Ulster, meanwhile, were undermined by ill-discipline with seven penalties conceded ensuring they had precious little territory to speak of across the first half hour.\n\nTwo of those transgressions came on their own feed at the scrum with the latter of those punished by a Gilbert penalty.\n\nIn what was their first attack of any note, Zac Ward reduced the arrears seven minutes before half-time after the ball was moved well through the hands of Kok and Jacob Stockdale, although Connacht were adamant that Juarno Augustus had knocked on at the prior ruck.\n\nIt was Connacht then falling foul of the referee's whistle and, after another penalty, Ward was in for his second with the last play of the half after more good work from the industrious Kok.\n\nUlster changed both props at half-time, bringing on Angus Bell and Tom O'Toole and, only two minutes into the half, Irish centres Bundee Aki and Stuart McCloskey were both shown a yellow card for a scuffle after the whistle.\n\nWith both sides down to 14, Ulster were in for their third with Kok this this time on the end of another slick interchange of passes.\n\nJust as Aki and McCloskey returned, Connacht were shown their second yellow card of the game with Joe Joyce sent to the sin bin and shipping a penalty try for illegally stopping an Ulster maul.\n\nThe discipline from both sides - there were 26 penalties in the first hour of the game alone - robbed the contest of any real rhythm and Connacht spurned a key opportunity to get back into the game with another ball lost in contact just prior to the conclusion of Joyce's yellow card.\n\nNumber eight Jansen did cut the deficit with Connacht's second with just under a quarter of an hour to play and, when scrum-half Devine scrambled over from close range 10 minutes later, a grandstand finish was in store.\n\nAfter an important aerial take from Jacob Stockdale, however, Ulster saw out the game with Murphy adding another penalty in the final minute.\n\nConnacht: Gilbert; Ryan, Forde, Aki, Treacy; Carty, B Murphy; Buckley, Heffernan, Bealham; Joyce, O'Connor; J Murphy, Prendergast, Jansen.\n\nReplacements: Tierney-Martin, Duggan, Barrett, Murray, O'Brien, Devine, Ioane, Gavin.\n\nUlster: Stockdale; Kok, Hume, McCloskey, Z Ward; Crean, Stewart, Wilson; Sheridan, Izuchukwu; McCann, Timoney, Augustus.\n\nReplacements: Andrew, Bell, O'Toole, Hopes, B Ward, Doak, Flannery, Postlethwaite.\n\nYellow cards: Murphy, McCloskey",

    "fullText": "As a football idealist, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has specific beliefs about how the game should be played - and the best way to win.\n\nBut his usual philosophy was not the one that brought the Christmas present of a 1-0 Premier League win over Newcastle.\n\nFor one thing, there was the formation switch.\n\nAmorim joked in September that not even the Pope could persuade him to change, but for the first time since he took charge 13 months ago, he fielded a back four.\n\nFor another, victory was achieved with 33.4% possession, their lowest in any game this season. It was United's lowest percentage of possession in a victory since the 29.4% they had when beating against Manchester City in January 2023.\n\nThey had nine shots at Old Trafford compared to Newcastle's 16. The visitors had 43 touches in their opponents' box. Amorim's men had 15.\n\nYet it was Manchester United who prevailed, thanks to a combination of Patrick Dorgu's first goal for the club - which was a sublime first-half volley from the edge of the area - and only a second clean sheet of the season.\n\nIt wasn't pretty. But even for Amorim, sometimes there are days when substance trumps style.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the unequivocal reply when asked if this was one of the 'most satisfying' wins of his, at times, tortuous 13 months in charge.\n\n\"The feeling is good. If you compared to other games, we suffered so much more today but in certain moments we put everything on the line.\n\n\"We are defending every cross. Especially if you see the second half, sometimes we managed to defend with a back six.\n\n\"We had so many games when we controlled the opponent so much better, but it is a good feeling to have a clean sheet. We suffered together. If we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games.\"",

    "description": "A deep dive into Claude Code 2.0 features, Opus 4.5 workflows, and context engineering. Learn sub-agents, MCP servers, hooks, skills, and practical tips to boost your AI-assisted coding productivity.",
    "fullText": "This post is a follow-up to my post from July'25 - My Experience With Claude Code After 2 Weeks of Adventures. If you are new to Claude Code or just want a quick refresh, I am once again asking you to go through it. It covers some lore, my workflow back then and then 80-90% of the Claude Code standard workflow. You may choose to skip the intro although I recommend you read it. Lore is important man.\n\nA short recap - we had covered CLAUDE.md, scratchpad, using task tool (now sub-agents), the general plan + execute workflow, tips for context window management, Sonnet 4 vs Opus 4 (not relevant now), using shortcuts like ! and using Shift + ? to show shortcuts, memory basics, /resume to restart conversation and short discussion on custom commands.\n\nI got a great response on my Opus 4.5 vibe-check tweets and still receieving good feedback on my July blog post (despite being somewhat poorly written). This shows there's clearly a demand for in-depth resources around Claude Code.\n\nI noticed that lots of people, both technical and many non-technical or less hands-on people i.e technically-lite people have started to try Claude Code (CC). CC is more of a general agent - you can use it for tasks other than coding as well - like making an excel invoice, data analysis, errands on your machine etc. And of course everything I talk about is by default meant for coding too.\n\nIf you can learn even 3-4 ideas that help you with using Claude Code (or other tools like Codex/Gemini CLI/OpenCode) or improve your understanding of LLMs, it would be a win for me.\n\nI don't want this post to be a prescription (map). My objective is to show you what is possible and the thought processes and simple things you can keep in mind to get the most out of these tools. I want to show you the map but also the territory.\n\nClaude Code dominated the CLI coding product experience this year and all the CLI products like Codex, OpenCode, Amp CLI, Vibe CLI and even Cursor have heavily taken inspiration from it. This means learning how things work in Claude Code directly transfers to other tools both in terms of personal usage and production grade engineering.\n\nKarpathy sensei posted this which caused the Twitter timeline. This led to a lot of discussion and there were some really good takes - some which I have written about too.\n\nIt's a reasonable crashout - the technology is evolving at a mindblowing pace and it's difficult to keep up for most of us and especially for senior folks and people with high quality standards. Nevertheless, I think if you are reading this post, it's scary but also exciting time to build stuff at speeds never possible before.\n\nInstead of thinking in terms of \"keeping up\", a better framing is how can I improve myself with help of these tools i.e augment.\n\nIn my opinion, there are 3 components to augment yourself:\n\nStay updated with tooling - What Karpathy sensei mentioned. Use these tools regularly and keep up with releases. I have been doing this regularly; it can be draining but I enjoy the process and I have the incentive that it helps me at my job. For the technically lite, even weekly/monthly updates would help.\n\nUpskill in your domain - It's a great time to spread both vertically (domain depth) and horizontally (adjacent areas). The more you know, the better you can prompt - converting unknown unknowns to known unknowns. Experience builds judgement and taste - that's what differentiates professional devs from vibe-coders. Since implementation is much faster now, you can spend more time on taste refinement.\n\nFor software engineering folks, this might mean getting better at good practices, system design, planning - where more thinking is involved. Ask more questions, run more experiments (since you can iterate fast), spend more time on understanding requirements. Using good software engineering practices to create better feedback loops for LLMs (good naming, refactoring, docs, tests, typed annotations, observability etc.). Review code. Please don't forget to come back to my post lol but I liked Addy Osmani's take on this.\n\nThe idea is to let the LLM perform things with input, get output and see errors.\n\nAs an aside, getting better at articulating thoughts via writing helps. One may also try touch typing/writing using speech-to-text tools to operate faster.\n\nThis post will act as a guide for things Karpathy said but you'll need to play around, build intuition and achieve outcomes with help of these tools yourself. The good news is it's fun.\n\nI am having a great time with Claude Code 2.0 since the launch of Opus 4.5 and it's been my daily driver since then. Before we go all lovey-dovey about Claude, I wanted to quickly go through the timeline and lore. I love yapping in my blog and I feel it's important to set the context here.\n\n2025 saw release of many frontier models by OpenAI and Anthropic. Also, it's super under-talked but OpenAI actually caught up to Anthropic in code-generation capability - intelligence wise, context window effectiveness, instruction following and intent detection.\n\nIt's been a wild year and honestly speaking I got tired of trying out new releases by OpenAI every 2 weeks.\n\n>no swe-bench-verified comparison\n>no comparison against opus 4.5\n>\"we are topping in cybersecurity\"\n>mfw i realise i am the fucking eval https://t.co/4oDG3yj6CP pic.twitter.com/aUfJfwROCf\n\nThere have been several Open Source competitors like GLM-4.7, Kimi-K2, Minimax-2.1. The space is very competitive and there is definitely an audience that uses the cheaper priced but high performant Chinese models for low-medium difficulty tasks.\n\nThat said, I still think Anthropic/OpenAI lead over Chinese Frontier models. The latter have contributed \n\n(Note: I am talking with respect to personal coding usage, not production API usage for applications).\n\nI was using Claude Code as my main driver from late June to early September. I cancelled my Claude Max (100 USD/month) sub in early September and switched to using OpenAI Codex as my main driver. Switch was driven by two factors -\n\nclaude code is more enjoyable as a product and has more features. i have always felt to try out more things related to automation in cc as compared to codex. once they drop a new iteration i would consider getting a max sub again if its better than gpt-5-codex\n\nAnthropic also had tonne of API outages and at one point of time they had degradation due to inference bugs. This also was a major driver for several people to move to the next best alternative i.e Codex or GPT-5.1 on Cursor.\n\nI was using Codex (main driver) and Cursor (never cancelled) until late October. Claude Sonnet 4.5 had released on 29th September along with Claude Code 2.0.. and I did take a 20 USD sub from another email account of mine to try it out (I had lots of prompting work and Claude models are my preferred choice) but GPT-5/GPT-5-codex were overall better despite being slow.\n\nSonnet 4.5's problem was fast and good but it would make many haphazard changes which would lead to bugs for me. In other words, I felt it to be producing a lot of slop in comparison to GPT-5.1/GPT-5.1-codex later.\n\nAround October 30, Anthropic sent an email saying we are offering the 200 USD max plan to users who cancelled the subscription and obviously I took it.\n\nchat please remind me to cancel after 28 days😂 pic.twitter.com/TSGidVJ2xo\n\nMy Claude Code usage was still minimal but on 24th November, they launched Opus 4.5 and I had 5 days to try out Opus 4.5. I used the hell out of it for my work and also wrote this highly technical blog with the help of it discovering several of its capabilities.\n\nI had done a similar tweet when I had switched to GPT-5.1 which had gotten half the response of this one. This indicated to me that more people resonated with Opus 4.5 (at least on Twitter) back then. Also, many people were just not able to realise GPT-5.1's capabilities tbh.\n\nOther than the above State of the Art at the coding benchmarks like SWE-bench-verified (code-generation), Tau Bench (agentic stuff), Opus 4.5 was faster, at-par in coding, super collaborative and good at communication. These factors led to my conversion. It had good vibes. More comparison points later in the post.\n\nAs I described in the screenshot, Opus 4.5 was roughly at same code-gen capability with GPT-5.1-Codex-Max.\n\nToday, in my experience I think GPT-5.2-Codex exceeds Opus 4.5 in raw capability by a small margin. Still, Opus 4.5 has been my main driver since release.\n\nI think first reason is it's faster and can do similar difficulty tasks in much lesser time than Codex. Also, it's overall\na much better communicator and pair-programmer than Codex which can even ignore your instructions at times (and go and make changes). Opus has better intent-detection as well.\n\nOne nice-use case shown here by Thariq on creating a background async agent to explain changes to a non-technical person leveraging Claude's explanation abilities.\n\nTo further demonstrate the difference, here's a CC vs Codex comparison\n\nFor the same prompt, see the outputs. Codex tends towards super concise while Claude matches my expectation.\nYou can modify the verbosity in Claude's case but Codex won't budge. Another thing I want to highlight is\nthe UI itself - Claude has more saturated white color on black whereas Codex's text is thinner/less readable\nand the thinking traces are shown in even lighter shade which I don't like.\n\nBecause of being faster not only in terms of lesser thinking to perform task but throughput wise also, it unlocks\nmuch faster feedback loops for your tasks. This makes progress feel more visceral even though capability wise, GPT-5.1/Codex were at par even in November.\nThe only downside with faster loop is if you are cautious, you end up micro-managing for long hours.\n\nOpus 4.5 is a great writer and comes closest to humans so I have always preferred Claude models for customizing prompts.\n\nBesides the model, obviously the Claude Code Product goes a long way to make things magical.\n\nAs a product it's a mile ahead of Codex in QoL features. The harness, prompts and the model make for a magical experience. The model is amazing but there is a massive amount of tasteful engineering that has gone into UX/UI and just the code/prompts to let Claude feel comfortable in the harness and make function calling accurate. We will explore this \n\nBefore we move ahead - my previous post somehow reached Hackernews #5 and I was facing allegations that my post was sponsored by Anthropic. I was like bro are you serious? Anthropic doesn't sponsor random users like me. Anthropic doesn't even think about me (meme.jpeg) besides from a user point of view.\n\nBesides praise, I have been snarky, made fun of outages, made a lot of fun of Sonnet 4.5 slop. I have expressed what I have felt over time and it's led to good discourse on the timeline as well.\n\nAll this said, Claude Code has been one of the most enjoyable product experiences I have ever had. I am grateful and highly respect the engineering and research team behind it.\n\nThat's enough yapping. In the next few sections, I will talk about useful features that I didn't talk about in my previous blog and notable features introduced in the iterations from Claude 2.0 - 2.074.\n\ncurrently using Claude Code for the first time, I can officially put \"Technical-lite\" on my resume now\n\nI am assuming several technical-lite people are gonna read this. Few concepts to help comprehension later in the blog -\n\nMore specifically, context is the input tokens. The context window refers to the maximum amount of tokens that an LLM can see and process at once during a conversation. It's like the model's working memory. Opus 4.5 has a 200K context window which is approximately 150,000 words.\n\nTool calling - Learn about tool calling. Here's a good resource. You know that LLMs can generate text but what if you want the LLM to perform an action - say draft an email or lookup the weather on the internet or just do google search. That's where tools come in. Tools are functions (in code or skills) defined by the engineer that do these exact things. We define tools and we let the LLM know about it in the system prompt and it can decide which tool to call when you are chatting with it! Once the tool call i.e the action is performed, the results are relayed back to the LLM.\n\nAgent - The simplest definition is an LLM that can pro-actively run tools to achieve a goal. For a more sophisticated definition, I like the one by Anthropic\n\n\"Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.\" from Building Effective Agents.\n\n\"Agentic\" - refers to the tool calling capabilities of the model - how pro-active, how accurate the tool calling is (detecting user's intent to perform the action, choosing the correct tool, knowing when to stop)\n\nHarness/scaffolding - Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5 are the models. They need to be provided with lots of \"scaffolding\" / layers of code, prompts, tool calls and software packaging/environment to make them work in a semi-autonomous fashion. Note that Claude Code is not a harness, it's a product (think the TUI, integrations etc.). Claude Code has a harness.\n\nClaude Code has had lots of AI features and quality of life improvements since July. Let's look at the ones that I found to be useful. You can see all changes in the Changelog.\n\nAsk mode options - Another thing I like is Option 3 when it asks questions in the syntax highlighting image above - \"Type here to tell Claude what to do differently\". Fun fact: All these are really prompts for the model whose output is parsed by another tool call and shown in this way.\n\nUltrathink - I like to spam ultrathink for hard tasks or when I want Opus 4.5 to be more rigorous e.g. explaining me something, self-reviewing its changes\n\nThinking toggle - Tab to toggle thinking on/off was a good feature. They changed it to Alt/Option + Tab recently but there's a bug and it does not work on Mac. Anyways CC defaults to thinking always true if you check in your settings.json\n\nPrompt history search - Search through prompts using Ctrl + R (similar to terminal backsearch). I have it in 2.0.74. It can search across project wide conversations. Repeatedly do Ctrl + R to cycle through results.\n\nCursor cycling - When you reach beginning/end of prompt, press down/up to cycle around\n\nMessage queue navigation - It's possible to navigate through queued messages and image attachments (2.0.73) now (idk if it's possible to display image attachment as well).\n\nFuzzy file search - File suggestion is 3x faster and supports fuzzy search (2.0.72)\n\nLSP support was added recently. Access via plugins.\n\nThere have been new integrations too like Slack Integration, Claude Web (beta), Claude Chrome extension. These are pretty obvious and I won't cover these. I think Claude Web would be interesting for many particularly (since you can launch tasks from iOS/Android too).\n\nNext few sub-sections are all about most used features.\n\nI didn't cover commands properly in my previous blog post. You can use / to access the built-in slash commands. These are pre-defined prompts that perform a specific task.\n\nIf these don't cover a specific task you want, then you can create a custom command. When you enter a command, that prompt gets appended to the current conversation/context and the main agent begins to perform the task.\n\nCommands can be made on a project level or global level. Project level resides at .claude/commands/ and global one at ~/.claude/commands.\n\nOften when the context window starts getting full or I feel the model is struggling with a complex task, I want to start a new conversation using /clear. Claude provides /compact which also runs faster in CC 2.0 but sometimes I prefer to make Claude write what happened in current session (with some specific stuff) before I kill it and start a new one. I made a /handoff command for this.\n\nIf you find yourself writing a prompt for something repetitively and instructions can be static/precise, it's a good idea to make a custom command. You can tell Claude to make custom commands. It knows how (or it will search the web and figure it out via claude-code-guide.md) and then it will make it for you.\n\nYou can find a bunch of commands, hooks, skills at awesome-claude-code though I recommend to build your own or search for one only when it's really required.\n\nI have a command called bootstrap-repo that searches the repo with 10 parallel sub-agents to create a comprehensive doc. I rarely use it these days and so many parallel sub-agents lead to the Claude Code flickering bug lol.\n\nAnyways, notice the \"Explore\" sub-agent and \"running in background\".\n\nSub-agents were introduced shortly after I published my last blogpost. Sub-agents are separate Claude instances that are spawned if the main agent wishes so or you explicitly tell it to do so. These powers are defined already in system prompt and sometimes you just have to remind... Understanding these features will help you micro-manage Claude haha.\n\nYou can also define your custom sub-agents. To create one:\n\nOr just use /agents to manage and create sub-agents automatically - recommended approach.\n\nThe \"Explore\" thing in above pic is a sub-agent. You can tell Claude \"Launch explore agent with Sonnet 4.5\" if you want it to use Sonnet instead of Haiku (I found this by just trying things out but we will see how this happens)\n\nThe Explore agent is a read-only file search specialist. It can use Glob, Grep, Read, and limited Bash commands to navigate codebases but is strictly prohibited from creating or modifying files.\n\nYou will notice how thorough the prompt is in terms of specifying when to use what tool call. Well, most people underestimate how hard it's to make tool calling work accurately.\n\nThis is the Explore agent prompt from 2.0.56 and it should be similar now too. Reference. These are captured by intercepting requests. Reference video.\n\nIn case of Explore sub-agent, it starts with a fresh slate which makes sense. It does not inherit any context from main agent. Many tasks involve searching through large amounts of digital media or code to filter for something relevant. Often the individual parts are independent of each other when you want to filter for something so launching parallel agents makes sense.\n\nIf I am trying to understand a feature or just looking up simple things in the codebase, I let Claude do the Explore agent searches. Explore agent passes a summary back to the main agent and then Opus 4.5 will publish the results or may choose to go through each file itself. If it does not, I explicitly tell it to.\n\nIt's important that the model goes through each of the relevant files itself so that all that ingested context can attend to each other. That's the high level idea of attention. Make context cross with previous context. This way model can extract more pair-wise relationships and therefore better reasoning and prediction. Explore agent returns summaries which can be lossy compression. When Opus 4.5 reads all relevant context itself, it knows what details are relevant to what context. This insight goes a long way even in production applications (but you only get it if someone tells you or you have read about self-attention mechanism).\n\nCodex does not have a concept of sub-agents and it's probably a conscious decision by the devs. GPT-5.2 has a 400K context window\nand according to benchmarks, it's long context retrieval capabilities are a massive improvement. Although people have tried\nmaking Codex use headless claude as sub-agents haha. You can just do things.\n\nThe general-purpose and plan sub-agent (separate from plan mode) inherit the context. With respect to user defined sub-agents, I am not sure but I think they start with clean slate.\n\nFrom the reverse engineered resources/leaked system prompt, it's possible to see that the sub-agents are spawned via the Task tool.\n\nTurns out you can ask Claude too. (I think the developers are allowing this now?). It's not a hallucination. The prompt pertaining to pre-defined tools are there in the system prompt and Claude code dynamically injects reminders/tools often to the ongoing context.\n\nTry these set of prompts with Opus 4.5\n\nYou will get the output something like below (click) but to summarise -\nIt defines 5 agent types: general-purpose (full tool access, inherits context), Explore (fast read-only codebase search), Plan (software architect for implementation planning), claude-code-guide (documentation lookup), and statusline-setup. Notice how each sub-agent is defined with its specific use case and available tools. Also notice the \"When NOT to use\" section - this kind of negative guidance helps the model avoid unnecessary sub-agent spawning for simple tasks.\n\nI want you to focus on the tool schema. The Task tool prompt above is detailed guidance on how to use the tool that resides in the system prompt. The tool schema defines the tool or the function.\n\nThe main agent calls the Task tool to spawn a sub-agent, using its reasoning to decide the parameters. Notice the model parameter - when I say \"Use Explore with Sonnet\", the model makes the tool call with model: \"sonnet\".\n\nTill August'25 or so, Claude Code used to show the Task tool performing actions in the TUI but now TUI shows the sub-agent name instead.\n\nNotice the run_in_background parameter. It decides whether to send a sub-agent to run in the background. I like the background process feature - it is super helpful for debugging or just monitoring log outputs from process. Sometimes you have a long running python script that you wanna monitor etc.\n\nModel usually automatically decides to put a process in background but you can explicitly tell it to do so. Note that \"Background Tasks\" is different. Using an & sends a task to Claude Web (should have named it Claude Cloud haha). I am yet to get this to work properly.\n\nI have a pretty simplish/task based workflow: CC as the main driver, Codex for review and difficult tasks, and Cursor for reading code and manual edits. I rarely use Plan Mode. Instead, once requirements are clear enough, I explore the codebase to find the relevant files myself.\n\nOpus 4.5 is amazing at explaining stuff and makes stellar ASCII diagrams. The 2025 Aug knowledge cutoff helps here too. So my exploration involves asking lots of questions—clarifying requirements, understanding where/how/why to make changes. It might be less efficient than Plan Mode, but I like this approach.\n\nOnce I have enough context, I spam /ultrathink and ask it what changes are required and then if things look ok, I start the execution closely monitoring the changes - basically micro-managing it. I sometimes ask Codex's second opinion here lol.\n\nFor difficult new features, I sometimes use a \"throw-away first draft\" approach. Once I understand what changes are needed, I create a new branch and let Claude write the feature end-to-end while I observe. I then compare its output against my mental model as to how close did it get to my requirements? Where did it diverge? This process reveals Claude's errors and the decisions/biases it made based on the context it had. With the benefit of this hindsight, I run another iteration, this time with sharper prompts informed by what I learned from the first pass. Kinda like Tenet.\n\nFor backend-heavy or just complex features specifically, I'll sometimes ask Codex xhigh to generate the plan instead.\n\nI maintain a few custom commands, use CLAUDE.md and scratchpad extensively. No custom sub-agents. I use MCP sometimes if need shall arise (e.g for docs. I have tried Playwright and Figma MCP so far) but in general not a fan. I have used hooks for simple stuff in the past and need-basis. skills/plugins are something that I am yet to use more regularly. I often use background agents for\nobservability (monitoring log / error) purposes. I rarely use git worktrees.\n\nIt's worth noting that the harness is so heavily engineered that Claude knows which sub-agent to spawn, what command/tool call/skill to run, what to run in async manner. It's able to heavy carry the agent loop that your task is mainly to use your judgement and prompt it in right direction. The next generation of models will get better and the relevant scaffolding will reduce for existing feature and increase for newer features. (Re: contrasting to Karpathy sensei's latest tweet shown at beginning)\n\nIt's not at all required to know the features in depth to be honest. However knowing how things work can make you a better micro-manager if the need arises like telling the Explore agent to use Sonnet.\n\ngetting claude opus 4.5 changes reviewed by gpt-5.1-codex-max high pic.twitter.com/A4tYN3W3Q6\n\nFor reviewing code and finding bugs, I find GPT-5.2-Codex is superior. Just use /review. Better than code review products too.\n\nIt's able to find bugs and mention severity like P1, P2. It's less likely to report false-positives and more trustable when it comes to confusing changes as compared to Claude. This Claude for execution and GPT/o-series model for review/bugs dynamic has been pretty constant for me for probably a year.\n\nNow is a good time to take a breath and refresh your context window. Before we get to the next set of features, it's worth\ngoing through context management fundamentals. Things might get a bit difficult for the technically-lite folks.\nDon't give up. Read through the post. Even ask Claude to explain stuff you don't understand.\n\nAn agent in a harness can pro-actively do a lot of tool calls to read your codebase and other inputs, edit stuff, make writes etc. In this process, they can produce a lot of data which gets added to the running conversation i.e the context window. Anthropic refers to this art and science of curating what will go into the limited context window from this information as context engineering.\n\nYou may ask how are tool calls adding tokens to the context window? The flow works like this:\n\nThe key thing to note here is that both the tool call and the tool call outputs are added to the context so that the LLM can know the results. This is because LLMs are stateless. They don't have memory outside the context window. Let's say you have n messages in a conversation. When you send the next message, the request will again process n + 1 messages in the LLM ~ single context window.\n\nIf you don't add information about the chosen tool call was, LLM won't know and if you don't plug the output, then it won't know\nthe outcome. The tool call results can quickly fill your context and this is why agents can get super expensive too.\n\nI quote directly from effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents\n\nContext refers to the set of tokens included when sampling from a large-language model (LLM). The engineering problem at hand is optimizing the utility of those tokens against the inherent constraints of LLMs in order to consistently achieve a desired outcome. Effectively wrangling LLMs often requires thinking in context — in other words: considering the holistic state available to the LLM at any given time and what potential behaviors that state might yield.\n\nContext engineering is about answering \"what configuration of context is most likely to generate our model's desired behavior?\"\n\nEverything we have discussed so far comes under context engineering. Sub-agents, using a scratch, compaction are obvious examples\nof context management methods used in Claude Code. Some notes around why context engineering is needed -\n\nLimited context window - The context retrieval performance of LLMs degrades as every new token is introduced. To paraphrase the above blog - think of context as a limited \"attention budget\". This is a consequence of the attention mechanism itself as it gets harder to model the pairwise relationships - think of it like getting harder to focus on things far apart.\n\nGPT-5.2 has a context window of 400K input tokens. Opus 4.5 has 200K. Gemini 3 Pro has a 1M context window length. Now the effectiveness of these context windows can vary too, just the length doesn't matter. That said if you want to ask something\nfrom a 900K long input, you would be able to most reliably do that only with Gemini 3 Pro.\n\nContext rot article goes deep into some experiments which showed performance\ndrops with length and not task difficulty.\n\nA rough corollary one can draw is effective context windows are probably 50-60% or even lesser.\nDon't start a complicated task when you are half-way in the conversation. Do compaction or start a new one.\n\nEverything being done in prompts and code we have seen so far has been to -\n\nThe next few sections showcase features and implementation that are designed for\nbetter context management and agentic performance.\n\nI am personally not a fan of MCP servers but we gotta cover it. MCP servers are servers that can be hosted on your machine or remotely on the internet. These may expose filesystem, tools and integrations like CRM, Google Drive etc. They are essentially a way for models to connect to external tools and services.\n\nIn order to connect to MCP server, you need a host (Claude) which can house the MCP client. The MCP client\ncan invoke the protocol to connect. Once connected, the MCP client exposes tools, resources, prompts provided by server.\n\nThe tool definitions are loaded upfront into the context window of host bloating the context window.\n\nI like the idea of Code Execution with MCP even though it's propanda for more token consumption.\n\nQuoting Code execution with MCP:\n\nAs MCP usage scales, there are two common patterns that can increase agent cost and latency:\n\nMCP usage scale implies more MCP clients ~ more tool call definitions in context window.\n\nMCP Code exec suggests instead of direct tool calls, expose code APIs rather than tool call definitions and give Claude\na sandbox execution environment with a filesystem. Then let it write code to make the tool calls.\nIt is an elegant idea and is pretty similar to skills in the sense it's \"prompt on demand\"\n\nQuoting from Manus's Context Engineering Lesson blog:\n\nManipulate Attention Through Recitation\n\nIf you've worked with Manus, you've probably noticed something curious: when handling complex tasks, it tends to create a todo.md file—and update it step-by-step as the task progresses, checking off completed items.\n\nThat's not just cute behavior—it's a deliberate mechanism to manipulate attention.\n\nA typical task in Manus requires around 50 tool calls on average. That's a long loop—and since Manus relies on LLMs for decision-making, it's vulnerable to drifting off-topic or forgetting earlier goals, especially in long contexts or complicated tasks.\n\nClaude Code has todo lists but they don't show them now. Now you know part of the logic for it.\n\nClaude Code also tries something similar via plugging reminder tags into user messages and tool results. Some of them are mentioned in tool descriptions, other reminders are added at runtime via code.\n\nI asked Claude about what system reminders are present in the system prompt.\n\nFor reference, an older version of CC 2.0.56 used to have this detailed reminder system-reminder-plan-mode-is-active.\n\nI think Armin talks about this in his post What Actually Is Claude Code’s Plan Mode? when he refers to recurring prompts to remind the agent.\n\nIf you look at the leaked prompts, you will notice there are like 2-3 prompts for plan mode and 2-3 tool schemas like ENTRY_PLAN_MODE_TOOL, EXIT_PLAN_MODE_TOOL. The latter would write down the output into a markdown file\nwhich you can access via /plan. Everything is a markdown.\n\nAnthropic introduced Agent Skills recently and these got recently adopted by Codex too. A skill\nis a folder containing a SKILL.md file, other referenceable files and code scripts that do some user-defined task.\n\nThe SKILL.md contains some meta-data via which LLM can know what skills are available (meta-data is added to system prompt)\nIf Claude feels the skill is relevant, it will perform a tool call to read the contents of skill and download the\ndomain expertise just like Neo in Matrix 1999. The code scripts may contain tools that Claude can use.\n\nNormally, to teach domain expertise, you would need to write all that info in system prompt and probably\neven tool call definitions. With skills, you don't have to do that as the model loads it on-demand.\nThis is especially useful when you are not sure if you require those instructions always.\n\nThe popular frontend-design plugin is actually a skill. You can check here\n\nHooks are available in Claude Code and Cursor. They allow you to observe when a certain stage in the agent loop\nlifecycle starts or ends and let you run bash scripts before or after to make changes to the agent loop.\n\nThere are hooks like Stop, UserPromptSubmit etc. For instance Stop hook runs after Claude finishes responding and the UserPromptSubmit hook runs when user submits a prompt before Claude processes it.\n\nThe first hook I created was to play an anime notification sound when Claude stopped responding. I was obviously inspired\n\nOne funny use case to run Claude for hours might be running a \"Do more\" prompt when Claude finishes current task\nvia the Stop hook.\n\nI came across this post during my research for this blog post. This person beautifully combined the concepts and features we discussed so far. They combine hooks to act as reminders for skills. If the utility/requirement arises, there's a lot of space for customization. You might not need such heavy customization but can at least take inspiration. (Speaking for myself lol)\n\nAnthropic recommends to keep skill.md under 500 lines so they divided it into separate files and combined with hooks and\nreduced the size of their CLAUDE.md.\n\nHopefully you learnt a bunch of things from this super long post and will apply the learnings not only in CC\nbut other tools as well. I feel a bit weird writing this but we are going through some transformative times.\nThere are already moments when I almost feel like a background agent and then other times when I feel smart when the models couldn't solve a particular bug.\n\nclaude and codex to me when i realise i am the background agent pic.twitter.com/wkihYFQmQM\n\nI no longer look forward to new releases because they just keep happening anyways (shoutout to OpenAI). Deepseek and Kimi K3 are in the queue.\n\nI am expecting improvements in RL training, long context effectiveness via maybe new attention architectures, higher throughput models, lesser hallucination models.\nThere might be a o1/o3 level reasoning breakthrough or maybe something in continual learning in 2026. I look forward to these but at the same time\nI find it scary because more significant capability unlock will make the world unpredictable haha.\n\nIf you found this useful, try one new feature from this post today. Happy building!\n\nThanks for reading. Please like/share/RT the post if you liked it.",

We made changes in the group and we weren't really getting front-foot ball, they slowed our ball up but a lot of quality came through at the end.\n\n\"It's good to get the five points and most importantly with the six-day turnaround to Sale [on 2 January] we've freshened up a few of the boys that didn't play today.\n\n\"It was one of those games where again we would score then we'd let them in, we knew they scored most of their tries if they get in there so we talked about nothing for free. Some of the penalties that we were getting pinged for which put them in there at the beginning were certainly questionable but we've got to look at ourselves.\n\n\"What was frustrating us was a lot of our line breaks they were allowed to come clearly offside in stopping some of those plays but I loved the way the boys stayed in and managed the last 10 minutes, and with 13, 14 men got the five points.\"\n\nNewcastle Red Bulls head coach Alan Dickens told BBC Radio Newcastle:\n\n\"Something we talked a lot about coming into this game was momentum.\n\n\"Against Bath we had the momentum in the first half and then we lost it, so that was something we talked about - if we do lose it, how do we get it back?\n\n\"Certainly after we scored the fourth try in the second half, Bristol had a purple patch, but we did wrestle back the momentum towards the back end of that second half.\n\n\"Granted it was a little bit of ill discipline from them that resulted in a 20-minute red card which gave us possession and then territory and we were able to pressure Bristol, but not score again to make it a tighter finish.\n\n\"When the facets of our game do come together for 60 to 80 minutes we're going to put in a good performance. Gloucester next week is another opportunity to put our best version on the pitch and that's what we want to do.\"\n\nBristol: Rees-Zammit; Heward, Moroni, Williams, Ravouvou; Jordan, Randall; Lahiff, Thacker, Chawatama; Taylor, Batley, Owen, Harding (c), Mata.\n\nReplacements: Oghre, Genge, Halliwell, Rubiolo, Ivanishvili, Wolstenholme, Worsley, Lane.\n\nSin bin: Kalaveti Ravouvou (77)\n\nNewcastle: Grayson; Spencer, Hearle, Arnold, Obatoyinbo; Connon, Benitez Cruz; Brocklebank, McGuigan (c), McCallum; Usher, De Chaves, Gordon, Christie, Leatherbarrow.\n\nReplacements: Fletcher, Hancock, Palframan, Baker, Mafi, Elliott, Hutchison, Chamberlain.",

A team like Northampton put you under massive pressure and they were very good in that second half.\n\n\"At half-time [it was] a pretty even game, we went ahead and then they applied pressure on us in that last 30.\"\n\nNorthampton Saints head coach Sam Vesty told BBC Radio Northampton:\n\n\"The mindset for 80 minutes was to just keep attacking and to just go at it, which was excellent. It didn't all go our way, but we never wavered from that attacking mindset and it brought the best out of us.\n\n\"We haven't won here since 2022 so it's a good place to come and do it. I'm just so proud of the boys to back themselves and have the confidence and mindset to go at it. I loved it.\n\n\"It's [the result] got to be up there because it's a tough place to come and win and for the boys to get over the line and to do it in such style as well.\n\n\"There's a few disallowed tries there as well so the scoreline could have been even more.\"\n\nBath: De Glanville; Cokanasiga, Lawrence, Ojomoh, Arundell; Russell, Spencer (c); Obano, Dunn, du Toit; Roux, Molony, Bayliss, Underhill, Reid.\n\nReplacements: Frost, Van Wyk, Griffin, Hill, Pepper, Carr-Smith, Carreras, Harris.\n\nNorthampton: Hendy; Todaro, Freeman, Hutchinson, Ramm; Belleau, McParland; Iyogun, Smith, Davison; Prowse, Munga, Chick (c), Graham, Pollock.\n\nReplacements: Walker, Scola, Millar Mills, Benson, Brown, James, Lumley, Sleightholme.",

    "description": "Mayer launched Dazzle after shuttering her photo and contact management startup Sunshine. Green’s investment suggests Dazzle is poised for the coming wave of new AI-infused consumer businesses.",
    "fullText": "The former Yahoo CEO, Marissa Mayer, refuses to sit on the sidelines of the generative AI revolution.\n\nAfter spending the last six years running Sunshine, a photo-sharing and contact-management startup with little success, the storied tech leader has shuttered the company to launch Dazzle, a new startup focused on building the next generation of AI personal assistants.\n\nWhile Mayer is not yet sharing specifics about Dazzle’s functionality, she has revealed that the new company has raised an $8 million seed round at a $35 million valuation. The round was led by Forerunner’s Kirsten Green, with participation from Kleiner Perkins, Greycroft, Offline Ventures, Slow Ventures, and Bling Capital. Although Mayer has admitted to investing her own capital in the startup, she emphasized that the round was led by Green, a venture capitalist with a storied record of identifying iconic consumer brands such as Warby Parker, Chime, and Dollar Shave Club.\n\nGreen’s investment suggests Dazzle is poised for the coming wave of new AI-infused consumer businesses. The founder of Forerunner Ventures previously told TechCrunch that while enterprise AI took the early lead in this tech cycle, consumer-facing AI is a “late bloomer” that’s finally ready for its breakout.\n\nEven for a founder of Mayer’s fame, landing Green as a lead investor is a significant stamp of credibility for Dazzle, especially after Sunshine was widely considered to be a flop. “I think she really has a great sense for where people and platforms are going,” Mayer said.\n\nMayer told TechCrunch that the Sunshine team began prototyping Dazzle last summer, a project that quickly eclipsed their previous work in ambition and opportunity. “We realized that this was something that we were much more excited about,” she said, noting that Dazzle has potential for “a much bigger impact” than what Sunshine was building.\n\nOriginally founded as Lumi Labs in 2018, Sunshine first launched with a subscription app for contact management dubbed “Sunshine Contacts.” Despite its founder’s high profile, the product struggled to gain traction. Privacy advocates raised alarms over the app’s practice of pulling home addresses from public databases to enrich contact lists, and the company never recovered from the initial skepticism. By 2024, the company broadened its offering by adding event management and “Shine,” an AI-powered photo-sharing tool. The new offering was widely criticized for its outdated design and similarly failed to attract widespread usage.\n\nSunshine raised a total of $20 million from investors, including Felicis, Norwest Venture Partners, and Unusual Ventures. When the company was dissolved, investors received 10% of Dazzle’s equity, Mayer said.\n\nReflecting on Sunshine’s struggle, Mayer was candid about its limitations, admitting the problems the company was tackling were too “mundane” and not large enough. “I don’t think we got it to the state of overall polish and accessibility that I really wanted it to be,” she added.\n\nMayer is now betting that the lessons from Sunshine will help her build a much more resilient and impactful business with Dazzle.\n\nBefore her tenure as Yahoo CEO, Mayer was employee number 20 at Google, where she helped design Google search ‘look and feel’, and oversaw the development of Google Maps and AdWords.\n\n“I have had the rare privilege of being at two companies that really changed how people do things,” Mayer told TechCrunch. “Yahoo, for many, defined the internet. Google, in terms of Search and Maps, changed everything. I really aspire to build a product that has that kind of impact again.”\n\nDazzle is expected to come out of stealth mode early next year.",

    "fullText": "Just 89 seconds separated Liverpool's two goals in their win over Wolves - but the difference in noise inside the stadium after each was clear.\n\nJust moments after Ryan Gravenberch's opener, Florian Wirtz slotted past Jose Sa to put the Reds 2-0 up.\n\nAs the Germany midfielder wheeled away to celebrate his first Liverpool goal, Anfield did not just celebrate - it roared.\n\nFinally, Wirtz had broken his duck.\n\nIt is 190 days since he joined Liverpool in a deal worth £116m, but this felt a real moment of arrival. The roar was one of both relief and joy for a player who is finally settling into life on Merseyside.\n\nHis assist for Alexander Isak at Tottenham last week did wonders for his confidence and, at Anfield on Saturday, his goal came towards the end of a half where Wirtz was a class above the rest. The creativity on display was clear.\n\n\"The best player [Wirtz] on the pitch by a country mile - the most inventive and the one who is willing to take risks,\" said ex-Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock on Final Score.\n\nFormer England forward Ellen White added: \"There's no doubting the quality that Florian Wirtz has. The centre of gravity, the way he can assist, he can use both feet.\n\n\"He just needed a bit more time.\"",

Unai Emery will never say if he believes it.\n\nOne thing, however, can no longer be denied - Aston Villa must now be taken seriously as Premier League title contenders.\n\nEmery met the inevitable question about whether Villa can mount a challenge with the straightest of bats: \"Not really. We are competing very well. We are third in the league behind Arsenal and Manchester City. Wow.\"\n\nEmery demonstrated he is not only the master of strategy, but also expectation management.\n\nIt took until Villa were in sight of a dramatic victory at Chelsea, where they came from behind to win 2-1 through substitute Ollie Watkins' header six minutes from time, until the deafening songs of belief rang around Stamford Bridge.\n\nBut the evidence is compelling:\n\nVilla's victory was their 11th in succession, equalling a club record set in September 1897 and March 1914. They have now won eight consecutive top-flight games for the first time since a run of nine between October and December 1910.\n\nAt the end of matchday five this season, Villa sat 18th and were without a Premier League victory. From matchday six onwards, they have won more games and more points than any other side.\n\nVilla have never had more points after 18 games of a Premier League season than their current tally of 39.\n\nThe statistics state an eloquent case.",

As soon as they got their goal Arsenal were suddenly under pressure from nowhere.\"",

It spreads from an infected animal to people through the saliva, most commonly through a bite of an infected animal. Rabies can also spread when a rabid animal’s saliva enters an open wound or the eyes, nose or mouth. For example, an infected dog licking your face or an open wound could potentially spread rabies. Rabies does not spread through contaminated materials such as clothing or bedding or by simply petting a dog.

    "fullText": "The China National Nuclear Corporation developed a first-of-its-kind power generator that uses carbon dioxide rather than steam.\n\nIt's the first commercial power source of this type and a significant step toward cleaner global energy.\n\nAs Newsweek reported, the China National Nuclear Corp.'s generator converts waste heat into useful electricity. This supercritical carbon dioxide power generator provides a clean energy solution and advances China's pollution-reduction efforts.\n\nThe company connected its generator to the grid at a steel plant in Guizhou province. There, it will capture waste heat from steel production and directly convert it into electricity.\n\nThe company expects the generator to be 50% more efficient than currently available technologies. Therefore, it also serves as a model for other power plants and industrial applications worldwide.\n\nThis energy development is encouraging because it contributes to the clean energy mix and is a substantial step forward for advanced nuclear technology. It offers high power in a small footprint, making it suitable for spacecrafts, ships, and other confined spaces.\n\n\"The Chinese are moving very, very fast. They are very keen to show the world that their program is unstoppable,\" Mark Hibbs, an expert on the nuclear sector, told The New York Times.\n\nNuclear energy is often misunderstood and controversial, yet it's an important part of the sustainable energy transition away from more polluting energy sources and toward cheaper, clear forms of energy, like wind and solar.\n\nNuclear plants are also known for radioactive leaks and producing hazardous waste. Safety and environmental concerns are valid. However, they still offer a promising shift away from pollution-heavy coal, oil, and gas.\n\nYet, recent developments from the CNNC and partner Jigang International Engineering and Technology Co. are paving the way for nuclear expansion in the country and beyond.\n\nChina is now seeking to scale up its new power-generation systems to deploy them in nuclear, steel, and solar plants.\n\nShould America invest \n\nOnly if it helps us compete with China\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Barefoot children played on chilly sand as Gaza ’s thousands of displaced people prepared threadbare tents on Saturday for another round of winter rain.\n\nSome families in the central town of Deir al-Balah said they had been living in tents for about two years, or for most of the war between Israel and Hamas that has devastated the territory.\n\nFathers braced fraying tents with old pieces of wood or inspected the ragged edges of holes torn in tarps. Inside the dim homes, daylight through tiny holes shone like stars.\n\nMothers battled the damp, slinging clothing over poles or cord to dry in the wind between the downpours that turn paths into puddles. One mother pulled a tiny child away from a mildewing patch of carpet.\n\n“We have been living in this tent for two years. Every time it rains and the tent collapses over our heads, we try to put up new pieces of wood,” said Shaima Wadi, a mother of four children who was displaced from Jabaliya in the north. “With how expensive everything has become, and without any income, we can barely afford clothes for our children or mattresses for them to sleep on.”\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, has said dozens of people, including a two-week-old infant, have died from hypothermia or after weather-related collapses of war-damaged homes. Aid organizations have called for more shelters and other humanitarian aid to be allowed into the territory.\n\nEmergency workers have warned people not to stay in damaged buildings. But with so much of the territory reduced to rubble, there are few places to escape the rain.\n\n“I collect nylon, cardboard and plastic from the streets to keep them warm,” said Ahmad Wadi, who burns the materials or uses them as a kind of blanket for loved ones. “They don’t have proper covers. It is freezing, the humidity is high, and water seeps in from everywhere. I don’t know what to do.”\n\nIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to visit Washington in the coming days as negotiators and others discuss the second stage of the ceasefire that took effect on Oct. 10.\n\nThough the agreement has mostly held, its progress has slowed. The remains of the final hostage taken during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war are still in Gaza. Challenges in the next phase of the ceasefire include the deployment of an international stabilization force, a technocratic governing body for Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and further Israeli troop withdrawals from the territory.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have accused each other of truce violations.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said that since the ceasefire went into effect, 414 Palestinians have been killed and 1,142 wounded. It said the bodies of 679 people were pulled from the rubble during the same period as the truce makes it safer to search for the remains of people killed earlier.\n\nThe ministry on Saturday said 29 bodies, including 25 that were recovered from under the rubble, had been brought to local hospitals over the past 48 hours.\n\nThe overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war has risen to at least 71,266, the ministry said, and another 171,219 have been wounded.\n\nThe ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count, is staffed by medical professionals and maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by the international community.\n\nIsrael's defense minister, Israel Katz, said in a statement Saturday that a military operation continued in a town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank a day after police said a Palestinian attacker rammed his car into a man and then stabbed a young woman in northern Israel on Friday afternoon, killing both.\n\nThe statement said the army had surrounded the town of Qabatiya, where Katz said the attacker was from, and was operating “forcefully” there. Authorities on Friday said the attacker was shot and injured in Afula. He was taken to a hospital.\n\nIt’s common practice for Israel to launch raids in the West Bank towns that attackers come from or demolish homes belonging to the assailants’ families. Israel says that it helps to locate militant infrastructure and prevents future attacks. Rights watchdogs describe such actions as collective punishment.\n\nAP video on Saturday showed Israeli bulldozers entering the town and soldiers patrolling.\n\n“They announced a strict curfew,” resident Bilal Hanash said, as he and others described main roads being closed with dirt barriers, a practice that has grown during the war in Gaza. “So basically, they’re punishing 30,000 people.”\n\nFind more of AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.",

Also read up on how North Korean hackers were responsible for over $2 billion in crypto losses in 2025.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\n\nThe FTC estimated that Americans lost 12.5 billion dollars to scams in 2024. That was a 25% increase from a year earlier. and in 2025 attacks are growing in scope and scale, even taking advantage of trusted sites like LinkedIn. One company trying to protect consumers is Push security. Mark Orlando, Push's chief technology officer joins me now. Mark, it is great to see you. So so maybe start here Mark, you know, as the year draws to a close, we're rolling into 2026, Mark. What what is the big\n\ncybersecurity themes, Mark, we should be aware of. What what are the big trends? Scale, for example, seems to be one you're highlighting.\n\nHi Josh, absolutely. Scale is uh really one of the biggest developments that we've seen not only this year but in the last few years, as the infrastructure behind these types of attacks gets easier and easier to stand up and operate. I think we can expect the scale of these attacks to continue growing exponentially. We've also seen the sophistication of these attacks uh really getting getting higher and higher. Uh you mentioned exploiting\n\nlegitimate sites and services like LinkedIn, um but we're seeing that across the board, whether it's social media networks or uh sponsored ads in Google results, attackers have come up with some very creative and sophisticated ways to deliver these scams and these attacks to unsuspecting users.\n\nIt sounds like, Mark, you're also highlighting how more attacks are are happening inside the browser. Why is that, Mark? I mean, just technically technically speaking, how does that how does that help the attacker?\n\nSure, well the browser has really evolved from a tool that we use to view web pages to, you know, essentially a platform that runs software on demand. I mean, this is where, you know, work really happens these days including, you know, where users are logging into all of the various accounts and services that we use on a daily basis. So, uh attackers realized this and they have kind of shifted away from uh different areas of the network like email uh or, you know, strictly web access that are fairly well defended into the browser, which is somewhat\n\nless well defended, certainly an area where most organizations don't have great visibility into what's going on and how users are interacting with websites. So, attackers have realized this, they've shifted focus to doing \n\nYou also highlight here, Mark, uh what sound like these LinkedIn-based fishing attacks. explain those, Mark, how do they work?\n\nSure. So, I think historically when you talk about fishing or email scams, I mean it is strictly that. It's something that's coming through email. and I think more or less that's what users have come to expect. if they're going to get scammed, it's going to be some, you know, poorly worded kind of suspicious email that comes in with an attachment or a link. And really that's uh increasingly no longer the case. So, uh you mentioned LinkedIn, we identified an attack campaign uh earlier this year where\n\nuh a an executive, a CEO in fact, uh of a company we work with was targeted through LinkedIn. He received a message from someone in his network, a first-level connection uh about something that was very relevant to that company and to his work. And so uh he clicked on the link, you know, along the lines of hey, check out this investment information, this opportunity, let me know what you think. Uh there was a lot of kind of sophisticated um\n\nkind of hoops he had to jump through to validate that it was in fact, uh him who was accessing the attacker website. and ultimately the goal was uh to gather his login information. So, in fact, it wasn't the trusted contact that had sent this message through LinkedIn, but rather someone else who had compromised his contact's uh account. So, this is a a situation where not only is the message very, very convincing, but it comes from a a trusted source, in this case, you know, a trusted known contact.\n\nSo, very, very difficult to pick out. and again, very difficult for an organization to see what's happening inside of those LinkedIn communications, much less do anything to stop it.",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen warned Saturday it would immediately respond to any military movements of separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates that undermine de-escalation efforts in the southern region of Yemen, as the United States urged diplomacy.\n\n“Any military movements that violate these efforts will be dealt with directly and immediately in order to protect civilian lives and ensure the success of restoring calm,\" said Brig. Gen. Turki al-Maliki, a coalition spokesman, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nAl-Maliki also accused the Southern Transitional Council, or STC, separatists of “serious and horrific human rights violations against civilians,” without providing evidence.\n\nThis came a day after separatists accused Saudi Arabia of targeting their forces with airstrikes, something not formally acknowledged by the kingdom, whose relations with the UAE have been strained because of STC actions.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Saturday that his country was “concerned by recent events in southeastern Yemen” and urged restraint and diplomacy to reach “a lasting solution.” He also expressed gratitude “for the diplomatic leadership of our partners, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.”\n\nYemen, engulfed in a civil war for more than a decade, has the Iran-aided Houthis controlling much of the northern regions, while a Saudi-UAE-backed coalition supports the internationally recognized government in the south. However, the UAE also helps the southern separatists who call for South Yemen to secede once again from Yemen.\n\nThe council moved earlier this month into Yemen’s governorates of Hadramout and Mahra and seized an oil-rich region. That had pushed out forces affiliated with the Saudi-supported National Shield Forces, another group aligned with the coalition in fighting the Houthis.\n\nThe coalition now demands the withdrawal of STC forces from the two governorates, with local authorities returning to oversee them, and the handover of their military camps.\n\nRashad al-Alimi, head of Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, the governing body of the internationally recognized government, said after an emergency meeting late Friday that STC movements posed “serious violations against civilians.”\n\nThe coalition said in its Saturday announcement came at al-Alimi's request to protect civilians in Hadramout.\n\nThe U.N. Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen said Saturday that it's closely following developments in Hadramout and Mahra, reiterating calls for restraint, de-escalation, dialogues and for all parties to avoid further escalation.",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Jeffrey R. Holland, a high-ranking official in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who was next in line to become the faith's president, has died. He was 85.\n\nHolland died early Saturday morning from complications associated with kidney disease, the church announced on its website.\n\nHolland, who died in Salt Lake City, led a governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which helps set church policy while overseeing the many business interests of what is known widely as the Mormon church.\n\nHe was the longest-tenured member of the Quorum of the Twelve after President Dallin H. Oaks, making him next in line to lead the church under a long-established succession plan. Oaks, 93, became president of the church and its more than 17 million-strong global membership in October.\n\nHenry B. Eyring, who is 92 and one of Oaks' two top counselors, is now next in line for the presidency.\n\nHolland had been hospitalized during the Christmas holiday for ongoing health complications, the church said. Experts on the faith pointed to his declining health in October when Oaks did not select Holland as a counselor.\n\nHis death leaves a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve that Oaks will fill in coming months, likely by calling a new apostle from a lower-tier leadership council. Apostles are all men in accordance with the church’s all-male priesthood.\n\nHolland grew up in St. George, Utah, and worked for many years in education administration before his call to join the ranks of church leadership. He served as the ninth president of Brigham Young University, the Utah-based faith's flagship school, from 1980 to 1989 and was a commissioner of the church’s global education system.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Provo university worked to improve interfaith relations and established a satellite campus in Jerusalem. The Anti-Defamation League later honored Holland with its “Torch of Liberty” award for helping foster greater understanding between Christian and Jewish communities.\n\nOaks, also a former BYU president, reflected Saturday on his more than 50 years of friendship and service with Holland, calling their relationship “long and loving.”\n\n“Over the last three decades as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, he lifted the weary, encouraged the faithful and bore a powerful witness of the Savior — even through seasons of significant personal trials,” Oaks said.\n\nHolland was known as a dynamic orator whose sermons combined scholarship with tenderness. In 2013 he spoke to church members about supporting loved ones with depression and other mental illnesses, sharing openly about times when he felt “like a broken vessel.”\n\nHolland is widely remembered for a 2021 speech in which he called on church members to take up metaphorical muskets in defense of the faith's teachings against same-sex marriage. The talk, known colloquially as “the musket fire speech,” became required reading for BYU freshmen in 2024, raising concern among LGBTQ+ students and advocates.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Latter-day Saint, said no church leader has had a more profound impact on his faith than Holland.\n\n“His words had a way of penetrating my soul like no other,” Cox said. “In times of trial or darkness, I would return to them over and over again and feel the light and peace I needed.”\n\nHolland was preceded in death by his wife, Patricia Terry Holland. He is survived by their three children, 13 grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Holland was preceded in death by his wife.",

    "title": "Kelley Blue Book Says These 5 SUVs Are Some Of The Best Cars You Can Buy",
    "description": "SUVs remain popular, but with a multitude of models, it can be hard to choose the best one. These SUVs are some of the best, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
    "fullText": "Sport utility vehicles, or SUVs, are vehicles that have the tough frame of a truck but provide enough interior room for multiple passengers and cargo. And they aren't just popular among retirees with grandchildren or people fond of bulk shopping trips to stock up on items at Costco. There were $528 billion worth of SUV transactions in 2024 across the globe, a figure that is expected to swell to just over $876 billion by 2032, per Stellar Market Research. And SUVs and trucks were the best selling vehicles of the first three quarters of 2025 in the United States, according to Car and Driver.\n\nAs a byproduct of their popularity, SUVs come in so many forms and models of varying quality that it is enough to put a car shopper into a fetal position of indecision, especially if you don't want to end up with a popular yet unreliable SUV. Fortunately, there's Kelley Blue Book, which has been a valuable source for automobile buyers since 1926. In early 2025, Kelley Blue Book came out with its Best Buy awards, which included Hyundai Kona, Honda CR-V, Kia Telluride, Ford Expedition, and Kia EV9. To give you a complete picture, we've included analyses and reviews from other online car sources in the roundup below.\n\nRated as the best subcompact SUV, the Hyundai Kona is described by Kelley Blue Book as a roomy, comfortable, fuel-efficient vehicle that can get about 31 miles for the gallon. With a starting price of about $25,900, Hyundai Kona can seat five people with just over 38 inches of leg room and can carry 25.5 cubic feet of cargo, or a maximum of 63.7 cubic feet when the second-row seats are folded down. The vehicle comes equipped with a 12.3-inch infotainment display and an optional all-wheel drive. Plus, the 2025 Kona is equipped with standard safety features such as collision warning with automatic emergency braking and blind-spot monitoring.\n\nYet according to Edmunds, the 2025 Hyundai Kona's acceleration abilities are \"underwhelming,\" while its suspension is not all that great, making it a less-than-ideal vehicle for off-roading (the model still got a 7.8 out of 10 rating). Consumer Reports, though, rated the 2025 Hyundai Kona overall reliability at 41 out of 100, about average for that model year.\n\nIn terms of costs to fix and maintain, CarEdge estimated that a Hyundai Kona will cost $8,463 over its first ten years, which is $297 more than non-luxury SUVs. As for how quickly this car can depreciate, CarEdge says it will lose 42% of its value after five years. That's better than the 53% depreciation of a Wagoneer, a popular Jeep with terrible resale value.\n\nKelley Blue Book compared the 2025 Honda CR-V — the winner of the best compact SUV category — to the brightest start in the sky for its quality, tech features, and the 76.5 cubic feet of cargo space it can provide once you fold down the rear seats. Though compact, the CR-V provides 41 inches of legroom for its rear seats along with reclining backs. And its hybrid versions can give up to 40 miles per gallon.\n\nBut where the CR-V truly excels is in its resale value, which Kelley Blue Book reports can fetch thousands of dollars more than its competitors due to the Honda brand's reputation for reliability. CarEdge agreed, putting its depreciation at just 29% over its first five years.\n\nWith a starting price of $31,495, the Honda CR-V costs $7,696 to fix and maintain in its first ten years of service, which is $530 less than the average for other popular SUV models. Also: Car and Driver called the 2025 model year a solid vehicle that's high in demand, and Edmunds gave it a 7.1 out of 10. However, this model was part of a recall ordered on Honda vehicles by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for potential fuel leaks and possibly incorrectly manufactured bad steering gearboxes.\n\nThe winner of the best midsize SUV for the sixth year in a row, the 2025 Kia Telluride has a three-row configuration that can seat eight, a Mercedez-Benz-quality dual-display infotainment touchscreen, 21 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row, and a total of 87 cubic feet with the two rear rows folded down, according to Kelley Blue Book. The model, which starts at about $37,800, also comes with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, and a host of other safety features.\n\nIn terms of reliability, Consumer Reports gives it an average with a score of 60 out of 100, although the vehicle also scored 72 out of 100 for owner satisfaction. Edmunds gives it a 7.1 out of 10 rating, while Car and Driver stated that Kia Telluride's standard features approach luxury standards. As for its resale value, the Kia Telluride will depreciate 51% in its first five years, according to CarEdge, and will cost $8,730 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $564 more than typical SUVs.\n\nThe '25 Ford Expedition took Kelley Blue Book's best full-size SUV award for its three-row spacious interior with plentiful cupholders and USB-C ports, ability to tow trailers up to 9,600 pounds, and a variety of trims, like the Expedition Tremor, that are great for transverse unpaved trails. With a starting price of $64,515, it has a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot that allows people to stream music and audiobooks as well as videos when parked. There is even a Bluetooth controller for people to play online games. The second row has tablet holders on the back of the front seat headrests, and there is a 13.2-inch infotainment touchscreen for navigation and climate control. The vehicle also comes with a safety package that includes a 360-degree camera, emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot and lane-keeping assist functions.\n\nOn the downside, according to Consumer Reports, the 2025 Ford Expedition is less reliable than the average car, with a reliability rating of 30 out of 100. It also costs $10,226 to maintain a Ford Expedition model in its first ten years of ownership, which is $2,060 more than other popular SUV models, per CarEdge. Ford Expeditions also depreciate 59% in five years, with a ranking of 164 out of 185 models analyzed by CarEdge for resale value.\n\nLarge enough to seat seven people, the Kia EV9 won Kelley Blue Book's Best Buy spot for 3-row EVs. An electric midsized SUV with prices that start at $56,395, the Kia EV9 can seat seven people comfortably, has a maximum range of 304 miles, and can get 150 miles worth of range after charging for only 15 minutes.\n\nEdmunds gave the model 8.2 out of 10, but Consumer Reports deemed the 2025 Kia EV9 less reliable than other cars of the same model year. There were also three recalls ordered by NHTSA because of a badly welded gear shift that causes the vehicle to lose power (342 vehicles for year 2025); possible missing bolts in the second and third row seats (22,883 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025); and a failing instrument panel screen for speed and other info (14,163 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025).\n\nBut if those issues are addressed by dealerships free of charge, as expected, the Kia EV9 is projected to cost $5,237 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $2,929 better than the average SUV, per CarEdge. However, in five years it will lose 52% of its value.\n\nUnlock your financial potential. Add Money Digest to your preferred sources for smart money insights!",

    "fullText": "Some metal detectorists dream of making the find that changes history and 90-year-old Dave Derby has done just that – twice.\n\nHis first major discovery was of a grand Roman villa estate near Northampton, and that was followed by an Anglo-Saxon cemetery.\n\nArchaeologist Stephen Young says Mr Derby \"embodies the best of what it means to be a metal detectorist and an archaeological enthusiast\".\n\nYet, for Mr Derby, from Kislingbury, near Northamptonshire, the greatest joy is finding ancient artefacts.\n\n\"You pick it up and think, 'What was the person like who owned it?'\" he says.\n\nHis interest in metal detecting goes back to 1964, when he was helping his father in his garden.\n\n\"All of a sudden he bent down and picked something up - and it was a coin,\" recalls Mr Derby.\n\nExperts from Northampton Museum explained it dated to the reign of George III (1760 to 1820).\n\n\"And I was hooked on what they were showing me, so I decided I was going to get a metal detector.\"\n\nOver the decades, he made many finds, but the one that first attracted international attention was the 1996 discovery at Whitehall Farm of a Roman villa estate.\n\nThe extensive complex, dating to the early 3rd to late 4th Centuries, included two bath-houses, complete with tessellated mosaic floors, and two 2nd-Century round houses.\n\n\"I was detecting in a particular field and looking around, there was pottery lying around - then I started to find Roman coins,\" says Mr Derby.\n\n\"And the farmer had come along to see how I was doing and I said, 'You have a Roman site here.'\"\n\nThey turned for advice to Mr Young, who had worked with Mr Derby since the mid-1980s.\n\n\"The site is a rare example of a late villa occupation remaining in use until the mid-5th Century, 50 years after the accepted termination of imperial Roman Britain,\" explains the former University of Northampton lecturer.\n\nThe discovery at Nether Heyford, near Northampton, developed into Clasp, a community archaeology project, which lasted until 2012, attracting students, volunteers and archaeologists from around the world.\n\nMr Derby's next massive discovery came when the same landowner offered him another field to survey.\n\n\"I went to this nice flat field and about 10 yards (9m) away from the hedge at the top, I got this fantastic signal,\" he says.\n\n\"And out came a lady's Saxon brooch, so I kept scratching around and I found a piece of metal which I thought could be part of a sword.\n\n\"I rang my son and said, 'You need to come – I've found a sword and there's a hand on the end of it!'\"\n\nThe discovery in 2003 became known as the Anglo-Saxon warrior.\n\nFurther excavations in the area unearthed five more graves and then few years later, about 23 sets of remains were discovered.\n\nAmong them were the remains of what appear to be \"feoderati\", soldiers of continental origin invited to Britain by the Romans under treaty to provide military support, says Mr Young.\n\nThe burials revealed family groupings, with some of women's remains found to be of local origin.\n\nAnalysis suggested some possibly dated back to as far as 430AD - about the time the Roman empire was collapsing.\n\nThis made it \"a seminal site of national importance for the post-Roman and early migration period of the 5th Century AD\", says Mr Young.\n\nOther finds included an early 6th-Century Mercian warrior burials and a 7th-Century mound burial of a man with a sword, whose rediscovery \"was down to Dave Derby\", he adds.\n\n\"I'm lucky to have worked with him and been able to integrate his talent and undoubted skills in enhancing our ability to understand the archaeological narrative,\" says Mr Young.\n\nMr Derby continues to love metal detecting, now accompanied by Peter, who says: \"I feel like we're modern time travellers; we dig holes in the ground and uncover something that's not seen the light, sometimes for thousands of years.\"\n\nAll the gold and silver finds more than 300 years oldare reported to Northamptonshire's finds liaison officer, in line with the law.\n\nOne of Mr Derby's favourites is a 7th-Century gold and gemstone pendant, which was returned to the landowner and is now worn by his wife.\n\n\"I'd rather find artefacts - they belong to somebody and you think 'What were they doing there?'\" he says.\n\n\"It's one of the most fantastic hobbies I've ever had.\"\n\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.\n\n'Saddest story' for owner who lost ring in 1600s\n\nAncient god, barbarian and frog come back home\n\nUnique medieval cross reveals its garnet centre",

    "description": "Here are a dozen strange and interesting tales from the medical literature.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nEach week, Live Science highlights an intriguing case report from the medical literature, where we explore unusual symptoms, rarely seen diagnoses and out-of-the-box treatments. Through this \"Diagnostic Dilemma\" series, we describe how doctors work to ultimately discover the cause of a patient's ailment. In complex cases, this diagnostic process can be quite arduous. That's part of why doctors share case reports: to help other medical professionals who might be facing the same puzzle.\n\nHere are 12 of our most intriguing Diagnostic Dilemmas from the past year. (If descriptions of medical symptoms and procedures make you squeamish, proceed with caution.)\n\nA Dutch teenager got knee surgery to treat a soccer injury, and upon waking up from anesthesia, he spoke only English — a language he'd previously spoken only in language classes at school. He kept insisting he was in the U.S., did not recognize his parents, and could not speak or understand spoken Dutch, his native language. Exams turned up no neurological abnormalities, and the doctors didn't initiate any specific treatment to address the language issue. Within 18 hours of surgery, the boy could understand some Dutch but not speak it without struggling. But then suddenly, he could both understand and speak it as normal. The doctors described the event as a strange case of \"foreign language syndrome.\"\n\nA teenager reported to a hospital with abdominal pain, and examinations soon revealed that she was nine months pregnant and that she was having contractions. When doctors examined the patient's reproductive tract, they found that she lacked a vaginal opening — a rare condition called distal vaginal atresia. Because of this, the medical team had to deliver the baby — a healthy, 6.2-pound (2.8 kilograms) boy — via cesarean section. The teenager had been seen at the same hospital about nine months prior, when an ex stabbed her after finding her fellating a new boyfriend. The wounds she incurred during the stabbing likely allowed sperm to escape her digestive tract and make their way to her reproductive tract, resulting in an unlikely pregnancy, her doctors theorized.\n\nA man was brought to a hospital by boat and helicopter after incurring an injury while fishing. He'd caught a white marlin (Kajikia albida) — a large fish with a long, pointy \"bill\" — and when he leaned over the edge of his boat to release his hook from the fish, it jumped up and struck him. At the hospital, doctors found a fragment of the fish's bill lodged in the man's throat, spinal canal and base of his skull. With an emergency surgery and antibiotics to prevent infections, the man survived the encounter without any long-term symptoms.\n\nA woman with osteoarthritis of the knee began getting acupuncture regularly when her pain medications started causing bad stomach issues. But her knees then became very sore, and she went to a hospital to be examined. X-rays revealed areas of her joints and shinbones where the bone tissue had thickened and spurs had formed. Additionally, hundreds of tiny flecks could be seen around both knee joints. It turned out that the woman's acupuncturists had left golden threads inside her knees on purpose as part of her treatment. In other cases, these threads have caused cysts and tissue damage, which can happen when they migrate through the body.\n\nA man in Michigan went to an ER with swollen eyelids and an itchy rash, and he noted that he'd also been experiencing cramps, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting over the preceding days. When doctors examined the patient, they uncovered signs of anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, and his condition quickly progressed to shock. The medical team successfully stabilized the patient, but a few days later, his condition worsened again. At that point, the doctors spotted a pattern: The symptoms arose when the man ate red meat. An allergy to meat, a condition called alpha-gal syndrome, can be triggered by the bite of certain tick species. It turned out that the man was an avid deer hunter who likely encountered an adult tick or tick larvae while hunting, his doctors concluded.\n\nA woman had her chromosomes checked following a pregnancy loss to see if there might have been an underlying genetic reason for the miscarriage. The test revealed that, at least in the woman's blood, her chromosomal profile (or karyotype) was 46,XY — the typical karyotype among males. Further tests revealed that across the rest of her tissues, her karyotype was 46,XX, the typical chromosomal profile of a female. The woman had a fraternal twin, so in this case of \"chimerism,\" the doctors concluded that the XY chromosomes likely came from her brother in the womb but somehow assimilated them only into her blood cells. The doctors suspected the \"veins and arteries of the two children became intertwined in the umbilical cord\" at some point. The woman had no overt symptoms tied to carrying these chromosomes in her blood and later went on to carry a pregnancy that resulted in the birth of a baby boy.\n\nA woman visited an emergency room with a headache, severe cramps and muscle pain, as well as an elevated pulse, breathing rate and blood pressure. She told doctors she'd attempted to get high by injecting a ground-up black widow spider (Latrodectus) into her veins in a suspension of distilled water. The doctors suspected the injected dose of black-widow venom was likely much higher than one would get from a bite, and its effects may have been exacerbated by the patient's allergic reaction to proteins in the venom. After the patient had been treated for several days in an intensive care unit, her symptoms resolved and she was discharged.\n\nA woman developed hives, swelling under her skin and trouble breathing after having sex with her partner. While receiving treatment at a hospital, she reported having a known allergy to Brazil nuts. She said that her partner ate them a few hours prior to sex but that he'd taken a bath and washed his hands thoroughly before intercourse. When the doctors conducted a skin-prick allergy test, using samples of the partner's semen, before and after he ate Brazil nuts, they found that the allergy triggers could indeed pass through the semen and set off the woman's allergy.\n\nFollowing a cancer treatment, a man developed a red rash that started out near the anus and then spread rapidly to the trunk and limbs. The rash, which looked like wavy lines all over the patient's body, appeared to migrate, with the lines starting out in one spot and later moving across the skin. A stool test revealed Strongyloides stercoralis, a parasite that can cause an infection called strongyloidiasis in humans. These worms were migrating under the man's skin, and the infection likely arose because the patient's immune system was stunted by glucocorticoids used in his cancer treatment.\n\nA rare autoimmune disorder injured a man's corneas and extensively impeded his sight. To restore vision in one eye, doctors attempted an osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis, or \"tooth-in-eye surgery.\" The procedure involves removing one of the patient's teeth and implanting it in their eye socket, where it serves as a platform for a transparent, plastic lens. The lens stands in for the injured cornea and enables light to enter the eye. The man's successful procedure was the first of its kind in Canada.\n\nA man went to a hospital because he was experiencing weakness and vomiting. There, tests revealed that his kidneys were failing and the calcium in his blood was too high. Physical exams and scans revealed abnormalities in his upper-arm and chest muscles — namely, areas of superdense calcification. It turned out that the man had previously gotten injections of silicone-like, oil-based substances to \"plump\" up the look of his muscles. In this case, the injections triggered a persistent foreign-body reaction, resulting in extensive scarring and calcification of the muscle that leached calcium into the bloodstream.\n\n—A woman kept tasting bleach — and doctors found a hidden cause in her blood\n\n—Botched penile tattoo left man with permanent semi-erection\n\n—Speed eating a 7-pound burger sent a man to ER unable to pass gas\n\nA lab worker came down with an infection that, despite medical treatment, ended up being fatal. His doctors were informed that the patient had worked with a weakened strain of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes the plague. This weakened form of the germ was thought to be noninfectious, but nonetheless, the man contracted it. Further tests revealed that the man had unusually high levels of iron in his blood. One way the plague bacteria had been weakened was that its key gene for absorbing iron had been removed — but the man's blood, which was chock-full of iron, may have enabled the germ to overcome this weakness and establish a deadly infection.\n\nFor more intriguing medical cases, check out our Diagnostic Dilemma archives.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.",

    "fullText": "Ripple Labs is doubling down on its presence in Japan, drawing on longstanding relationships with the country’s traditional financial institutions. The strategy is aimed at increasing adoption and interest in the XRP Ledger (XRPL).\n\nThis week, Asia Web3 Alliance Japan and Web3 Salon launched the Japan Financial Infrastructure Innovation Program. The initiative is designed to support Japanese startups developing next-generation, compliant digital financial solutions on the XRP Ledger.\n\nThe program opened applications on December 19 and is offering a $10,000 grant per startup. It is narrowly focused on three high-value verticals, including stablecoins, real-world asset tokenization, and credit infrastructure.\n\n\"Japan offers an overwhelming opportunity for blockchain innovation, supported by a forward-thinking regulatory framework and deep talent pool. This program represents Ripple's commitment to fostering a vibrant ecosystem where startups can leverage the speed, low cost, and reliability of the XRP Ledger to create real-world benefits and transform financial infrastructure,\" Christina Chan, Senior Director of Developer Growth at RippleX, said.\n\nAnalysts view it as a low-cost funnel for identifying candidates for Ripple’s significantly larger capital pool, including the 1 billion XRP fund dedicated to developers in Japan and Korea.\n\nThe program has secured backing from a formidable roster of establishment players, including Mizuho Bank, SMBC Nikko Securities, and Securitize Japan.\n\nDespite the initiative's high-profile corporate backing, it comes at a precarious moment for the network. While Ripple touts institutional adoption, the underlying usage of the XRPL tells a conflicting story of contraction.",

    "description": "\"We have objections but we won't appeal further.\"",
    "fullText": "Officials with the United Kingdom's Royal Navy are in hot water for pressuring a government agency to conceal information about radioactive pollution.\n\nInvestigative news outlet The Ferret obtained emails in which naval officials urged the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to keep details of the pollution secret. The Ferret made Freedom of Information Act requests in 2019, 2023, and 2024 for files regarding radioactive problems at two naval bases in Scotland. SEPA kept most of the files secret after consulting the Ministry of Defence, which cited national security concerns.\n\nThe decision was reconsidered when The Ferret took the matter to the Scottish Information Commissioner. In June, SEPA was ordered to release the files by July 28. In response, naval and MOD officials engaged in correspondence with SEPA and the commissioner, sending around 130 emails over nine days in an attempt to reverse the decision.\n\nThe Ferret made further FOIA requests to obtain the emails. They showed that naval officials went as far as to threaten legal action against SEPA if the files were released, though what kind is unclear. The MOD was flagged for the matter and called it \"deeply uncomfortable\" but added, \"We have objections but we won't appeal further.\"\n\nThe cover-up was an effort to conceal information about radioactive pollution in Loch Long on the River Clyde in Scotland. When SEPA finally released the files in August, they revealed that the Royal Navy had failed to properly maintain a network of pipes at the Royal Naval Armaments Depot at Coulport, resulting in \"unnecessary radioactive waste.\"\n\nKeeping such information from the public is dangerous, especially when it comes to health. Loch Long is a popular site for water sports, but tourists might think twice about going for a swim if they knew what lurked beneath the surface.\n\nInformation on radioactive waste in Scotland's Loch Long is now available thanks to The Ferret's investigative journalists. News outlets must continue to push for answers, even when public officials try to conceal the truth.

    "fullText": "With Donald Trump expanding the travel ban inspired by his first term in the White House to 20 more countries, as well as the Palestinian Authority, on Dec. 16, a total of 39 countries from different corners of the world now face either a total ban or restrictions on entering the United States.\n\nMali, South Sudan, Niger, Burkina Faso, Syria, and the Palestinian Authority have been added to the list of nations whose citizens cannot enter the U.S. at all, first introduced in June.\n\nAngola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Ivory Coast, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia, and Zimbabwe were meanwhile added to a list of countries facing a block on student and business visas; the list that Trump put in place in June 2025 previously included Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.\n\nImmediately after their nations were added to the ban, multiple diplomats and heads of state responded with condemnation. Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne issued a statement saying that the Caribbean country's government was \"deeply disappointed\" given that the justification accusing it of loose rules for granting citizenship by investment \"does not reflect the present reality of our laws.\"\n\nTwo weeks after the expansion of the ban, the West African nation of Niger has taken the most drastic step of permanently banning any granting of new visas to U.S. visas in a reciprocal measure until the situation changes.\n\n\"Niger is completely and permanently prohibiting the issuance of visas to all U.S. citizens and indefinitely banning entry to its territory for nationals of the United States,\" a governmental representative said to the Associated Press.\n\nA landlocked country bordered by Algeria, Libya, Chad, Nigeria, Benin, Mali and Burkina Faso, Niger is a Muslim-majority nation with a population of just over 25 million people. In the document announcing the travel ban, the White House said the country has a visa overstay rate of 13.41% for business visas and 16.46% for student ones as well as \"terrorists and their supporters [that] are active in planning kidnappings.\"\n\nWhile a history of war and political instability and coups d'états means that travel into Niger from Western countries remains very low (the State Department has kept it at the \"do not travel\" advisory level for years), the latest move from its government is a major escalation in relations.",

    "fullText": "TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Saturday his country is in a full-scale war with the U.S., Israel and Europe ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s meeting Monday with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nPezeshkian said in an interview published on the website of the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday that the war is worse than Iran's deadly war with Iraq in the 1980s.\n\n“We are in a full-scale war with the U.S., Israel and Europe; they don’t want our country to remain stable,” he said.\n\nPezeshkian said the West's war against Iran is “more complicated and more difficult” compared to the 1980-1988 war with Iraq that left more than 1 million casualties on both sides.\n\nThe remarks came two days before a planned meeting between Trump and Netanyahu during Netanyahu's visit to the U.S. Iran is expected to be a key topic in the talks.\n\nIsraeli and U.S. strikes on Iran that came during a 12-day air war in June killed nearly 1,100 Iranians including senior military commanders and nuclear scientists. Retaliatory missile barrages by Iran killed 28 in Israel.",
