    "fullText": "The legendary QB could finally get his due respect.\n\nBill Belichick shockingly didn’t make the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.\n\nAnd now Robert Kraft, the owner of those New England Patriots teams that Belichick coached, has reportedly been left out as well, according to Adam Schefter.\n\nBoth events work in favor of Ken Anderson, the former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback who has been on the cusp of entering the Hall for decades.\n\nRemember, the Hall of Fame voters can elect up to three people from the senior nominees, which include Anderson, Kraft, Belichick, former San Francisco 49ers running back Roger Craig, and former Pittsburgh Steelers defensive end L.C. Greenwood.\n\nThere is now a very real chance that Anderson will be part of the Class of 2026.\n\nIf so, there will be a big sigh of relief not just in Cincinnati, but also across the NFL landscape.\n\nAnderson, of course, won the MVP award in 1981 and led the Bengals to a Super Bowl. Most notably, he was well ahead of his time in terms of efficiency and accuracy.\n\nHere is a quick rundown of some of the lesser-known things that make Anderson a worthy member of the HOF:\n\nWe were fortunate enough to have Anderson on our show right before the Bengals drafted Joe Burrow. Watch the clip below:\n\nAnd the legendary QB was kind enough to tweet about the experience afterwards:\n\nThe Class of 2026 will be revealed on Thursday. Let’s hope Anderson finally gets in.",

    "description": "ESPN MLB reporter Buster Olney predicts that Detroit Tigers top prospect Kevin McGonigle will make an \"immediate impact\" in 2026.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Tigers have a couple top prospects who could see big league action very soon, with one in particular getting MLB experts excited.\n\nESPN's MLB analysts provided predictions for various top prospects in an article published on Tuesday, Feb. 3, and Buster Olney kicked it off with Tigers infielder Kevin McGonigle, currently ranked as the No. 2 prospect in baseball by ESPN.\n\n\"No matter where he plays, McGonigle will be a fixture in the Tigers' every-day lineup by midseason and make an immediate impact,\" he wrote.\n\nThe \"immediate impact\" part of his analysis may not surprise Tigers fans, or at least those who read prospect lists. McGonigle is the top prospect in the Tigers' system and a near-consensus top-2 prospect in baseball, with MLB Pipeline and Baseball America (like ESPN) ranking him No. 2 overall below Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop Konnor Griffin.\n\nMcGonigle also slashed .254/.369/.550 in 206 plate appearances across 46 games at Double-A Erie in 2025, showing off professional-level hitting skills that could fit in immediately with the Tigers lineup. And with some exposure at third base in the 2025 Arizona Fall League season (where he continued to hit exceptionally well), he could also bring some defensive versatility to the Tigers.\n\nHOW TO WATCH: Detroit Tigers leaving FanDuel Sports Network for MLB Media: Report\n\nWhat Tigers fans might be more interested in, however, is Olney predicting McGonigle will be in the Tigers lineup by midseason.\n\nIf the Tigers were to wait until around mid-May to call up McGonigle, they would retain an extra year of service time for their top prospect, meaning McGonigle would be in line to become a free agent in 2032 instead of 2031. That extra year for a prospect as highly praised as McGonigle could be incredibly valuable for the Tigers, meaning he might start the season in the minors instead of in Detroit.\n\nHowever, there are also strong arguments for calling up McGonigle to start the season. The Tigers have not signed a dedicated third baseman to their roster for 2026, right now projecting to use Colt Keith and Zach McKinstry at the position. McGonigle could potentially fill that role (while also able to play second base and shortstop) and bring a spark to the lineup.\n\nThe Tigers could also benefit from MLB's Prospect Promotion Incentive if they call up McGonigle within the first two weeks of the season, potentially earning an extra draft pick should McGonigle finish in the top-3 in the American League Rookie of the Year vote in 2026.\n\nTigers president of baseball operations Scott Harris addressed the team's plans for McGonigle at his end-of-season press conference in October (without naming McGonigle specifically), saying: \"I expect the players that posted dominant years in Double-A to factor into our big-league team next year ... I expect them to be in Detroit at some point next year.\"\n\nThe move that might make the most sense for the Tigers is to call up McGonigle in the middle of the season to take advantage of his production while retaining an extra year of his eligibility. If the Tigers were to call up McGonigle in late May or early June, for example, they could get McGonigle in the lineup for a huge chunk of their season without starting his service clock –⁠ though they wouldn't be eligible for a PPI pick.\n\nBut either way, it shouldn't surprise Tigers fans if McGonigle is up at some point in the 2026 season.\n\nNeed to catch up on the news during your lunch break? \n\nYou can reach Christian at cromo@freepress.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Detroit Free Press: Kevin McGonigle to make 'immediate impact' for Tigers per Buster Olney",

    "title": "Adrian Newey's First Aston Martin F1 Car Was Late. Rivals Should Be Worried",
    "description": "The Aston Martin AMR26 Formula 1 race car took to the track later than rivals, but don’t see that as a negative.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nA delayed start for the Aston Martin AMR26 was one of the big stories of last week’s Formula 1 Barcelona shakedown test, not least because the F1 world was so keen to see what Adrian Newey had conjured up for 2026's new rule set.\n\nThere was no shortage of social media pundits ready to suggest the team’s tardy arrival was, somehow, a reflection of failure or incompetence. The team would rather have been running a day or two earlier, and thus had more opportunity to gather data. However, there's a much bigger picture at play here in terms of where Newey is trying to take the team—not just over the course of this season, but also on into the future. That was evidenced when the AMR26 first turned a wheel last Thursday; the car left rivals stunned by the aero and mechanical details, especially around the suspension. The overall verdict was, Newey had indeed pushed the boat out.\n\nSo why was the car late? A perfect storm of circumstance. This is the first car from “Team Silverstone” since the 2009 Force India that does not feature a Mercedes engine; the team thus had to adapt to new partners at Honda, and all the associated systems changes. Having previously used customer gearboxes, it also had to design and build its own bespoke unit for the first time in two decades. Consider, too, that Newey was not allowed to start work at Aston until March 1st, 2025, under the terms of his Red Bull gardening leave. On arrival, he was quick to stamp his authority on the 2026 project and set a new direction. That, after all, is what team owner Lawrence Stroll was paying him to do.\n\nNot surprisingly, he already had plenty of ideas about how to push the limits in every direction in his search for the perfect solution to the new rules—and not just aerodynamics, but all areas of the mechanical package. Suspension components have a huge impact on airflow, and Newey has always ensured they are tailored to suit his overall targets. He also told the gearbox guys to start fresh, as he wanted something more compact and better packaged on which to build the rear suspension on.\n\nHe did not get a model of the AMR26 into Aston’s new on-site wind tunnel until April, when the FIA rules had allowed a January 2 start for all teams. But the wait was worth it, because it is now the best tunnel in the F1 business—a luxury for Newey, who was used to working with Red Bull’s relatively ancient facility that is literally a relic of the Cold War.\n\nNewey has not spoken to the media since he first signed for Aston, but on Tuesday he gave us a fascinating insight into how he tackled the challenge via a Q&A on the team’s website. \"We took a really close look at the regulations and what we believe we want to achieve from a flow field perspective to suit them,” he explained. “And from there started to evolve a geometry that attempts to create the flow fields that we want. It's very much a holistic approach.”\n\nHe admits that he doesn’t know if he got it right: “We certainly aren't sure what the best interpretation of the regulations is and therefore the best philosophy to follow. Because of our compressed timescale, we decided on a particular direction and that’s the one we've pursued. Whether that proves to be the right one or not, only time will tell. But you have to choose your path and get on with it...”\n\nHaving started late, he wanted to take as much time as he could before signing off on key areas, pushing all the deadlines in order to have the best possible all-round solution—and one with plenty of room for development. “The car is tightly packaged,” says Newey. “Much more tightly packaged than I believe has been attempted at Aston Martin Aramco before. This has required a very close working relationship with the mechanical designers to achieve the aerodynamic shapes we wanted. But I have to say that all the mechanical designers here have really embraced that philosophy. It hasn't made their life easy, quite the opposite, but they've really risen to the challenge.”\n\nPerhaps not everyone was a fit for this new philosophy, and as willing to join the journey. In the F1 design world an aggressive, risk-taking approach doesn’t always sit well with engineers, and it perhaps no coincidence that several key players departed in late 2025, some of whom had been hired by Stroll amid great fanfare just a couple of years earlier. It may also help to explain why Newey himself was made team principal, and thus the ultimate decision maker on key areas such as design and production deadlines.\n\nAn extra challenge this year was that all teams faced more stringent crash and load tests, which have to be passed before a car can run. Of course designers push to the limit—you don’t add extra material and thus weight if you don’t have to—and it’s not unusual to fail a test and lose a few days while beefing something up before trying again. However, we rarely hear about such issues, unless they contribute to a team obviously running late... at which point gossip starts to spread.\n\nGiven all of this, the fact that in the end the car ran only a couple of days behind the schedule Newey targeted when he arrived 11 months ago should be seen as a positive. It’s not the first time that a car he’s overseen hit the ground later than others, but often enough, Newey’s designs have quickly been proven to be winners, although on some occasions even he has got in wrong—most infamously in the case of the 2003 McLaren MP4-18, which was so fraught with issues it never actually raced.\n\nWas the stress around the late rollout a small step backwards that leads to giant steps forward in terms of competitiveness? That’s what we will have to wait and see over the early races of the season.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "fullText": "As if it wasn’t already clear, after firing general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah last week, it became obvious that the Minnesota Vikings aren’t happy with their recent performance. Considering they spent well over $100 million in free agency last season and somehow fell from 14-3 in 2024 to 9-7 in 2025, it’s no surprise that the Vikings weren’t pleased with the results.\n\nIn some cities, that effort would lead to a head coaching change, but the Vikings love what they have in Kevin O’Connell, who’s led the team to a 43-25 record across four seasons. While they didn’t feel coaching was the issue, clearly there’s a problem with the roster, and in Minnesota, the conversation centers around the quarterback.\n\nThe Vikings may be willing to be patient with J.J. McCarthy, the 10th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. Yet, after seeing him be limited to just 10 out of a possible 34 games since being drafted, the Vikings may be prepared to make other plans at QB. Especially if that QB is a proven franchise solution.\n\nAccording to The Athletic‘s Alec Lewis, the Vikings are prepared to take a swing for the fences if a superstar like Joe Burrow unexpectedly becomes available on the trade block.\n\n“If a player like Joe Burrow is available via trade, I expect the Vikings to do everything they possibly can to make that happen. It’s more a question of what is available, and how far from a cost perspective is it gonna take.”\n\nObviously, if Burrow hit the trade block, it likely means McCarthy’s days as a Viking are done. While he did have a rough debut season in Minnesota, the 23-year-old QB would still hold some trade value around the league. Yet, the Vikings would surely still have to fork over at least two first-round picks plus \n\nThough, if it means landing a QB who’s already made two conference championship appearances, then the Vikings are apparently prepared to pay the proper price.",

    "fullText": "Sam Bennett may have been the most notable snub from Team Canada's Olympic hockey roster.\n\nTurns out, the Florida Panthers star will be playing in the Olympics anyway.\n\nBennett was added to the roster as an injury replacement on Tuesday. The Lightning's Anthony Cirelli was hurt in the Stadium Series game on Sunday and will have to miss the tournament.\n\nBennett was just injured, too, but TSN's Darren Dreger says it was \"nothing serious.\" The news of Bennett as a replacement for Cirelli, and no announcement about the Panthers' injured Brad Marchand, may be a good sign for Marchand's chances of also suiting up at the Olympics.\n\nMORE: How Connor McDavid is to the Oilers what Josh Allen is to the Bills\n\nCirelli, as a faceoff guy and penalty-killing type, had a very specific role for the Canadian team. Bennett fits that pretty well, and he does bring a type of grit that Cirelli also has.\n\nBennett is a winner. He has been a part of back-to-back Stanley Cup championships with the Panthers. He was also on Canada's victorious 4 Nations Faceoff team.\n\nAt 29 years old, this may have been Bennett's best chance of making an Olympic team.\n\nThis season in 55 games with the Panthers, Bennett has 19 goals, 23 assists and 101 blocks shots.\n\nMORE: How Olympic roster freeze may create a second NHL trade deadline\n\nTeam Canada squeezed Bennett off the initial roster because it decided to keep both Bo Horvat and Nick Suzuki on the initial roster.\n\nHopefully, Bennett didn't make any plans for the Olympic break. Because after it was in doubt, he has some hockey to be played and a gold medal to chase.\n\nBilly Heyen is a freelance writer with The Sporting News.

    "fullText": "Earlier today, FC Barcelona officially announced that they were entering the bidding process to host the 2029 UEFA Champions League final at the renovated Spotify Camp Nou.\n\nSoon after, reports emerged claiming that the Blaugrana were also working behind the scenes to secure the hosting rights for the 2030 FIFA World Cup final at their stadium.\n\nHowever, Real Madrid are also in the race as they push to have the grand finale of the tournament played at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nNow, according to SPORT, Barcelona might have an edge over Real Madrid in their bid to host the 2030 World Cup final at the Spotify Camp Nou.\n\nThe 2030 World Cup will be jointly hosted by Portugal, Spain and Morocco. FIFA is currently assessing three main options for the final: Santiago Bernabeu, Spotify Camp Nou, and Hassan II Stadium in Casablanca, and will ultimately select one of these stadiums.\n\nIn this context, the Mayor of Barcelona, Jaume Collboni, reaffirmed the Catalan capital’s determination to compete to host the decisive match of the 2030 World Cup.\n\nBarcelona offers many attractions for FIFA and, although the Bernabeu appears to be the favourite, the city believes it has strong arguments to remain in contention.\n\nOne of the main elements boosting Barcelona’s chances is economic. Once the renovation is completed, the Spotify Camp Nou will have a capacity of 105,000 spectators, compared to the 84,000 seats at the Bernabeu, home of Real Madrid.\n\nThis represents a significant difference of 21,000 additional spectators. Ticket prices for major events have risen sharply in recent years. In the United States, for example, prices for the final at the MetLife Stadium on 19 July later this year have exceeded €3,000 per ticket.\n\nBased on average projections, FIFA believes it could generate more than €20 million in additional revenue if the final were held at Barcelona’s stadium rather than in Madrid. This is a substantial difference and one that could prove decisive in tipping the balance.\n\nCasablanca, for its part, is seen as less well-positioned due to the lack of the historical footballing weight associated with venues such as the Camp Nou or the Bernabeu.\n\nBarcelona and Madrid also enjoy advantages over Casablanca in terms of infrastructure and the location of their stadiums within the urban environment. The Hassan II Stadium is expected to be spectacular, but it will be located far from the city centre.\n\nHowever, Spanish cities are well established in hosting major international events, offering simpler and more reliable logistics.\n\nAdded to this is a strong footballing tradition, which FIFA is keen to highlight after recent World Cups awarded to emerging football nations such as Qatar and the United States.\n\nThe final decision will still take time, but Barcelona’s bid remains firm, as made clear by its mayor. The Catalan capital is not giving up, even if the spotlight currently appears to be focused on the Bernabeu.",

    "description": "Fantasy basketball analyst Dan Titus breaks down his latest risers and fallers as we move through Week 16 of the season.",
    "fullText": "The High Score 100 — the top 100 players in Yahoo's newest fantasy basketball format — is a running reflection of year-to-date performance and trending production. Each weekly update captures who's actually delivering value and who's fading.\n\n[High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. It's not too late to create or join a league]\n\nHere's a breakdown of the biggest risers and fallers through the 15th week of fantasy basketball — with the complete High Score 100 at the bottom of the article. I'll be updating my rankings every Tuesday throughout the fantasy basketball season.\n\nNembhard enters February playing his best ball of the season. He averaged 18.5 points, 4.2 rebounds and 9.2 assists per game while shooting 49% from the field. He's been a top-60 player in High Score all year. Lately though, he's been even better, ranking 30th over the past month, posting 43 fantasy points per game. The Pacers could be sellers at the deadline, but Nembhard has established himself as a key part of Indy's future.\n\nI have some concerns about him being load-managed as the season progresses, but it's probably more likely to occur with 31-year-old Pascal Siakam. Still, Nembhard has been a reliable and consistent point guard all season and fantasy managers can expect him to be a steady top-50, top-60ish player across formats.\n\nI was hard on Bam a few weeks ago. He landed on my fallers list in Weeks 12 and 13, but he's finally turning things around. Adebayo is riding a streak of eight straight games with 20+ points, recording a double-double in five of those games. He's been a top-25 asset in High Score over the past two weeks, averaging 45 fantasy points per game.\n\nWith Miami dealing with so many backcourt injuries, Bam has been more aggressive offensively. He's scoring more because he's putting up at least four more shots per game in his last 10 outings, while also racking up more steals and assists than in previous months.\n\nI expect Bam to continue powering the Heat, but who knows what could happen if Miami becomes a serious contender in the Giannis sweepstakes.\n\nFeels like no one is appreciating what Banchero has been doing lately. It’s probably because the Magic are underachieving, but fantasy-wise, Banchero's been in beast mode. In his past six contests, Banchero's averaging 26 points, 9 boards and 4 dimes, totaling 47 fantasy points per game.\n\nHe's been very efficient by his standards, shooting 51% from the field, 50% from 3 and 77% from the line. That efficiency helped him climb to 21st in High Score over that span. He's been getting to the line at will, getting up at least 10 free throw attempts in five straight games. A top-30 finish is well within reach if the Magic stay quiet at the deadline.\n\nPG's off the board entirely. The NBA handed him a 25-game suspension on Jan. 31 for violating the anti-drug policy, and he won't be eligible to return until late March — when Philly has just 10 games left in the regular season.\n\nNo production, no ranking. Simple as that. Even when George comes back, there's not enough runway to crack back into the High Score 100. Fantasy managers who were holding should cut bait and stream that roster spot. The season's essentially over for him.\n\nI like Norm, but he's been struggling. He hasn't had a 40-fantasy point game since Jan. 17 and in his last six games, he's averaging less than 30 fantasy points per game. That ranks 118th over the past 14 days.\n\nHe's been on the injury report with a back injury more than we'd like to see recently, so he's a player who will likely benefit from some time off around the All-Star break.\n\nZubac does two things really well: rebound and score around the rim. The problem is that's basically all he does, and recently, even those numbers have dipped. He averaged 12.3 points and 10.2 rebounds in 28 minutes per game in January.\n\nIn High Score, you need more than just points and boards to separate yourself, especially at the center position. Zubac isn't giving you many assists or stocks and when his scoring and rebounding drop even slightly, there's nothing else propping up his fantasy value.\n\nHe's been averaging just 28.7 fantasy points over the past two weeks and his performance has dropped him to 91st overall on the season. Let's hope James Harden doesn't get traded from the Clippers, because their two-man game has been pretty symbiotic.\n\nThe High Score 100 is a running reflection of year-to-date performance and trending production.",

    "fullText": "Max Holloway says he is in the best shape of his 14-year career ahead of his BMF title fight.\n\nUFC 326’s main event will be a fight between Holloway and Charles Oliveira.\n\nThe two men first faced off in 2015, with ‘Blessed’ winning that fight, though it ended under somewhat strange circumstances and led to some fans questioning Oliveira’s resolve.\n\nEven though the BMF belt has sparked plenty of debate among fans, it is hard to argue against these two stepping into the cage for it.\n\nBoth Holloway and Oliveira have been in the UFC for well over a decade, but neither look like they are slowing down anytime soon. They are both still fighting at a high level, even after all these years.\n\nThe 34-year-old American, who has already accomplished just about everything there is in MMA, says he has never felt better heading into his March 7 title defence.\n\n“I feel great, man. There’s so much science, I have Transparent Labs now, they keep my body in top shape, taking the right supplements, sleeping well, I do a bunch of other recovery stuff, this is the best I’ve ever felt.\n\n“When I was younger, I felt like this but no recovery. So a little bit older now, you’ve got to be smart. Take care of your body a bit more and just take the right steps to make it to the Octagon,” he said on his YouTube channel.\n\nJoining the UFC at the young age of 20, ‘Blessed’ had significant room for growth and did not approach his career with the necessary seriousness.\n\n“I learned a lot about my body over the years. When I was younger I could recover and take nothing, I had no sleep coming to workout, now I’ve got to get sleep, sleep is very important, supplements, vitamins all that is very important.\n\n“And just eating well. Young Max, brother, I would eat McDonald’s, I’d eat whatever I wanted to eat, Taco Bell, now I eat those kinds of foods and I’m stuck in the bathroom for a while, I learned a lot.”\n\nThe lightweight scene is in a bit of flux right now, especially with Ilia Topuria repeatedly hinting at a move to another division.\n\nBut before any talk of moving up can happen, he will have to face Justin Gaethje, who recently captured the interim title.\n\nIf ‘El Matador’ decides to make the jump, it would open up another vacancy at lightweight – something that could play right into Holloway’s plans.\n\nMichael Morales explains why he won’t respect Islam Makhachev\n\nKhabib Nurmagomedov shares blueprint to turn PFL champion Usman into the future GOAT",

    "fullText": "Francesco Bagnaia posted the eighth-quickest lap as MotoGP’s pre-season testing kicked off on Tuesday, finishing seven-tenths shy of Ducati teammate Marc Marquez’s best effort.\n\nAt first glance, it’s an underwhelming result that echoes his 2025 struggles. However, the final day’s time attacks will provide a clearer assessment of where everyone stands.\n\nBagnaia also sounded upbeat when speaking to Sky Italia after the session. He said he had carried forward some positive signs from last November’s post-season test in Valencia.\n\nThe 2022 and 2023 world champion is coming off a season where nothing seemed to click. His ongoing discomfort with the GP25 left him far from his best for much of the year.\n\nMarc Marquez suggested that Bagnaia would benefit from some time away, and on Tuesday, the 29-year-old sounded far more upbeat than he had been at the end of last year.\n\nLast season, Bagnaia tried a series of radical experiments to regain his corner entry feeling. But with the early version of the GP26, it came back to him naturally.\n\nThe Italian did start on pole position for last year’s Malaysian GP and finished just seven-thousandths off the fastest time on day three of the 2025 Sepang test. As a result, he’s approaching his initial findings with caution.\n\n“Starting again is fantastic, what MotoGP gives you is incredible,” he said. “I really enjoyed it today.”\n\n“We had the chance to do several laps, both this morning on the medium and this afternoon on the soft. We worked really well, I must say; everything we tried gave clear feedback.”\n\n“Fortunately my feeling is very positive,” he said, “especially in terms of braking and corner entry. It’s what we were looking for last year.”\n\nHe added: “Then we focused on new parts like the fairing: it has pros and cons, but I did exactly the same time with both old and new so for a start and few kilometres it’s positive.”\n\nBagnaia’s start to the season came against a backdrop of speculation about his future with Ducati, as reports have suggested his seat for 2027 has already been decided. Like many on the grid, he’s also in a contract year.\n\nReports indicate that Pedro Acosta has already agreed terms with Ducati. Luigi Dall’Igna appears unwilling to give Bagnaia time early in the season to turn things around.\n\nIf Bagnaia gets off to a strong start and consistently finishes on the podium, Ducati may end up questioning whether they acted too quickly in making their decision.\n\nWhile Acosta’s potential is clear, it’s still an open question whether he’s currently better than Bagnaia. There hasn’t been enough shown yet to make that case definitively.\n\nDucati could have waited to see more before making such a big call, especially since plenty of riders would put their plans on pause for a chance at one of those seats.\n\nMarc Marquez’s message to Ducati about his injury recovery ahead of Sepang test\n\nMaverick Vinales open to one rider replacing Brad Binder at KTM in 2027\n\nDucati’s Luigi Dall’Igna criticised for comments about Francesco Bagnaia’s future",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Olympic officials from Africa took their concerns about a visa program for entering the United States to leaders of the 2028 Los Angeles Games on Tuesday.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee members from Ethiopia and Djibouti quizzed the LA organizing team about how fans and visitors would get “equal access” to the U.S. in 2 ½ years’ time.\n\nLos Angeles was first on the IOC conference stage among six future Olympic hosts updating on their plans, though the one whose home country is currently seeing the most domestic turmoil.\n\n“It's a great worry. For everybody,\" a third African IOC member, Lydia Nsekera of Burundi — one of dozens of countries whose residents face restrictions entering the U.S. — later told The Associated Press of the visa uncertainty, \"even the (team) officials.”\n\nThe name of U.S. President Donald Trump was not said at the Olympic meeting, nor was reference made to his administration three days before Vice President JD Vance is due in Milan to attend the Winter Games opening ceremony.\n\nOne reference, however, seemed clear as L.A. sought to project an air of calm reassurance.\n\n“The world is complicated and unpredictable,” L.A. 2028 chairman Casey Wasserman said in a scripted speech. “Conflicts within and among nations ignite and are resolved. We are not naïve to this reality. We take it seriously and we will face it head on.”\n\nWhen more than 100 IOC members were invited to ask questions, Dagmawit Girmay Berhane of Ethiopia noted people from 175 countries have registered interest to buy tickets for the 2028 Summer Games.\n\nThe Trump administration has imposed a travel ban or limits on entry to people from dozens of countries including Zimbabwe, the home of IOC President Kirsty Coventry.\n\nWhile the U.S. government has promised exemptions for athletes and other participants of major sports events, fans and visitors face their visa applications being scrutinized.\n\n“How will you make sure there is equal opportunity for all who purchase or who register for the tickets have equal access to the visa services?” asked Berhane, a 13-year member of the IOC.\n\nFellow IOC member Gene Sykes, the president of the U.S. national Olympic body, said a State Department office in Washington D.C. is dedicated to smoothing visa issues for the Summer Games.\n\nSykes noted the World Cup in men’s soccer, which the U.S. co-hosts with Canada and Mexico this year, will test visa processing systems.\n\n“This entire process of welcoming visitors from other countries to the United States for sporting events is getting something of a trial run on a smaller basis,” he said. “It gives us the opportunity to see how do we optimize this.”\n\nFrom Djibouti, Aïcha Garad Ali asked if L.A. could appoint a similar “ambassador for visas” that worked for the 2024 Olympics: “\n\nSykes promised: “It’s certainly something we can give consideration to.”\n\nThe Olympic Games was “the singular unifying force for the world,” Wasserman said, urging his audience not to focus on “what is frightening.”\n\n“The world does not need another reason to fight with each other. It needs a reason to come together. Los Angeles is one of the most globally diverse cities on earth.\n\n“It is not just a mirror of America, it is a mirror of the world itself.”\n\nWasserman was introduced on stage with polite applause by IOC members in his first meeting with them since the release at the weekend of more government files relating to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe trove of documents included flirtatious emails from 2003 between Wasserman and Epstein’s one-time girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nIn a statement released Saturday, Wasserman expressed deep regret for the correspondence.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "The former UVA star picked up right where he left off last season.\n\nAfter missing the first 46 games of the season due to a lingering calf strain, former Virginia Cavaliers star Ty Jerome is finally back in action and already winning over a new fanbase.\n\nIt was a disappointing start to the season for Jerome, who broke out last year with the Cleveland Cavaliers to the tune of 19.9 points and 7.0 assists per game, leading to a third-place finish in the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year Voting.\n\nJerome’s impressive campaign earned him a three-year, $27 million deal with the Memphis Grizzlies in July, but his Grind City debut was pushed back until the final day of January for the first of a pair of home games against the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThe 2019 National Champion has quickly made up for lost time, scoring a team-high 20 points in Saturday’s 131-114 loss before following it up with a 19-point, 8-assist, 6-rebound performance on Monday night in a 137-128 rematch win over the T-Wolves.\n\nDespite playing just 20 minutes in each of his first two appearances for Memphis due to a minutes restriction, Jerome is already bringing stability to a Grizzlies backcourt that has dealt with injuries and inconsistency throughout the season. Jerome is shooting 54.5% from the field while showing off his trademark deliberate pace and elite decision-making as Memphis’s floor general.\n\n“[Jerome] doesn’t look like the most explosive guy, but he gets to his spots on the floor because he reads so well the body language of not only his own defender but also the helping defenders,” said Grizzlies head coach Tuomas Iisalo to the media after Monday night’s win. “He’s actually so good that he can manipulate [defenders] to get out of the space that he wants to create or get into the space that he wants to create for someone else.”\n\nWith Jerome sidelined and several other key players (including 2x All-Star Ja Morant, who has missed 28 games this season) in and out of the lineup, the Grizzlies went just 18-28 in their first 46 games, leaving them currently three games out of the play-in equation in the Western Conference.\n\nIn other pro ’Hoos news, De’Andre Hunter made headlines over the weekend as he was dealt from the Cavaliers to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Dennis Schroder and Keon Ellis ahead of February 5th’s NBA trade deadline.\n\nIt hasn’t been the season that many envisioned for Hunter, who averaged 14.0 points in 43 games this season with Cleveland on 42.3% shooting from the floor and a career-low 30.8% from beyond the arc. But a new home might be exactly what is needed for the 2019 fourth-overall pick. The Kings, which have a league-worst 12 wins this season, are in full-on tank mode, meaning we won’t be seeing Hunter back in the postseason this spring. However, Sacramento could be a perfect spot for the former ’Hoo to become an offensive focal point and once again show the league what he’s capable of in the right environment.",

    "fullText": "Yankees get lackluster offseason grade amid shaky reliance on five players originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees didn't have the most prolific offseason. They didn't land multiple All-Stars like the New York Mets or the Los Angeles Dodgers, and didn't swing big deals and trades like the Toronto Blue Jays, Baltimore Orioles, or Boston Red Sox.\n\nBut the Yankees did bring back Trent Grisham and Cody Bellinger, along with trading for Ryan Weathers to go with the plethora of depth additions Brian Cashman made.\n\nWhile the 94-68 Yankees are running it back, Jim Bowden of The Athletic gave the Yankees a \"C\" grade for their offseason. He highlighted five players the Yankees are relying on, and expressed concern about whether they should rely on those players or not.\n\n\"The Yankees will be counting on Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodon, and Anthony Volpe to successfully return from their injuries after starting the season on the IL,\" Bowden writes. \"They are hopeful Volpe, Austin Wells, and Ben Rice will have breakout seasons.\"\n\nThanks to very few changes being made to the roster for the 2026 season, the Yankees will need to get a lot of development and progress from these five players.\n\nBowden singled out Cole and Rodon as two of the Yankees' biggest question marks for the 2026 season: \"Can Cole and Rodon bounce back from their injuries to give the Yankees one of the best starting rotations in baseball?\"\n\nWhile seeing Cole and Rodon bounce back in a major way is within the realm of possibility, there's no guarantee when they'll be back, and even when they do return, they might not be nearly as good as they once were.\n\nMore: Yankees reveal plans for power prospect Spencer Jones\n\nRelying on Rodon and Cole for a positive outlook in 2026 is risky for the Yankees, and that's not the only risk at play.\n\nWhen Volpe returns from injury is also uncertain, and as Bowden notes, the Yankees will not just need him back; they will be hoping for a breakout year from the young shortstop.\n\nRelying on Volpe to such a degree is a lot on his plate, and even though Aaron Judge, Bellinger, and others will help alleviate the need for Volpe to breakout to win, to get over the hump and back into the World Series, he likely does need to breakout.\n\nAdd on that the Yankees are relying on Wells and Rice to both break out, and this upcoming season is a very risky one for the Yankees.\n\nRelying on multiple, if not all of these players, to breakout in 2026 is a very shaky path for the Yankees. It's possible, but not the most likely outcome. If it doesn't happen, 2026 could be a disappointing season.\n\nPirates' stance on trading Paul Skenes called into question by The Athletic\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nRed Sox busy offseason now includes a whopping 9 trades\n\nMets face 2 key questions after offseason of change\n\nReds reunite with 49-homer slugger at major discount with $15 million free agent news\n\nRed Sox make big $15 million mistake with Eugenio Suarez Reds news\n\nOrioles trade for 23-year old third baseman from AL foe",

The proof's in the pudding, and knowing that the shortcuts that people take and try to take is not worth it.

    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- One could have figured that Monday was going to be a special night for Philadelphia 76ers forward Dominick Barlow when he came out with a ton of energy to start against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nBarlow scored 11 points with seven rebounds, a steal, and a block in the opening quarter as the Sixers jumped out to a 19-point lead. That lead then swelled to as many as 23 as Philadelphia cruised to a 128-113 win over the Clippers behind a career-high 26 points and 16 rebounds--10 on the offensive glass--from Barlow.\n\n\"First quarter,\" Barlow said after the win. \"It was kind of in the flow of the game. It was running and finding easy baskets in different places. So, I kinda knew in the first quarter, I was like 'OK, if things keep going like this, it's gonna be a good night.'\"\n\nWith that being said, with his career-high in hand, Barlow wasn't hyped or excited for his own individual performance. He sat calmly at his locker as he knew he was approaching a big night for himself, but he also was just happy the Sixers won the game which is the most important thing.\n\n\"I knew, but it don’t really matter that much,\" he said calmly. \"As long as we win, play the right way. I kept saying, like, don’t force it, don’t try to—if it happens, it happens. If it don’t?\"\n\n#Sixers big man Dominick Barlow on if he knew he was approaching his career high last night: pic.twitter.com/iePkBDnHhz\n\n— Ky Carlin (@Ky_Carlin) February 3, 2026\n\nWhen sitting back and looking at Barlow's night, though, it can't be understated. He is the first Sixer with 25+ points and 10+ offensive rebounds since the great Charles Barkley in 1990. It's a pretty great accomplishment when considering Barlow signed in Philadelphia on a two-way deal, but he is thinking about taking on the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday to continue the trip.\n\n\"I’m kinda thinking about we gotta play tomorrow (Tuesday) against Golden State, and then come back to LA so I'm thinking about our schedule. Who made our schedule?\" Barlow wondered aloud. \"But yeah. Like, it's a good feeling. Obviously, kind of the situation I came in starting the year. So, like now, I think it's growth for myself, but also for our team, too. Obviously, we're in a situation. We're handling it the right way, and we're just playing basketball.\"\n\nAs Barlow mentioned, the Sixers will take on the Warriors on Tuesday before returning to Los Angeles to take on the Lakers on Thursday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Dominick Barlow downplays career night after Sixers beat Clippers",

First, where do you think Purdue will finish once Big Ten season comes to an end after these 9 games? Will they win the whole thing? Will they finish in the top 4? Below the top 4?\n\nThen, I want you to predict where Purdue will finish in their final 9 games. How many wins will come out of these last 9 games?

    "description": "Yes, we are going to have some fantasy content for you going forward and it starts with a dynasty angle on rookie quarterbacks.",
    "fullText": "The world of football covers more than just what we see on the field, as the game of fantasy football has shown us. What started as a general game with what was dubbed standard scoring has evolved into something with variables such as daily sports, Guillotine leagues, and survivor pools.\n\nHowever, today, we will be discussing one of the most popular angles: Dynasty. Specifically, we will be looking at dynasty rookies as that type of league allows for players to act like the general managers, their critique so often by making their own roster decisions 365 days a year.\n\nIn this piece, we will be kicking off a series in which we look at the dynasty rookies and where they are ranked coming out of the All-Star circuit in recent weeks. The first position group we will be looking at is the quarterbacks, and spoiler, this class is not very deep. As a result, we will be mentioning the top five quarterbacks as it relates to their dynasty potential right now, as we get closer to the scouting combine.\n\nCade Klubnik has shown at times that he can be a mobile quarterback and pick up yards when defenses give them to him. He entered the year as a potential top ten pick, but then Clemson saw their entire season go down like the Titanic, and he played his own role in that. However, I still believe he could be worth a stash for both a team in the NFL and for fantasy players. The main reason I think he has a chance to prove himself once he is in a camp is his dual-threat ability. He doesn't need to be Jalen Hurts or Lamar Jackson, but could he be a Trevor Lawrence-type? I wouldn't shut the door on it if he is given a chance.\n\nGarrett Nussmeier is another player who saw their stock fall in 2025, but he has done an okay job in recovering some of what he lost. He did it with a decent week in Mobile at the Senior Bowl, where he looked like the best quarterback some days. Was the talent that deep there? No, but I would rather him look like the best in a shallow pool than not in a deeper one at the moment. It is all about putting good days together, and he can do that with his decision-making. He doesn't take crazy chances, for better or worse, and he protects the ball, which will be something that gets him a chance potentially with an NFL team come April and beyond.\n\nTy Simpson could have returned to school and been projected to be a top ten pick in next year's NFL Draft. However, he declares early and now has a chance to compete for the top spot behind Fernando Mendoza. What is going to work against him is his lack of playing time, but it will also help him. He is going to be drafted and should not start for a year or two, and if in the right spot, he has a chance to develop further just as he would had he stayed in Alabama.\n\nOle Miss making the run they did in the college football playoffs was because of the play of Trinidad Chambliss. The quarterback arrived from D-2 Ferris State after winning a national title, and he wasn't named the starter, but he eventually was due to injury and rose to the occasion. It is the perfect example of being a playmaker in the college game. Do they always translate to the NFL level? Of course not, but Chambliss has been bought in, and I would rather bet with him than against him at this point.\n\nThe Heisman Trophy winner led the Indiana Hoosiers to the National Championship, and as a result, he finds himself cemented atop the dynasty rookie quarterback rankings. He will be the first overall pick in April's NFL Draft when the Las Vegas Raiders are on the clock. He will have some concerns with the offensive line, but being surrounded by the likes of Brock Bowers and Ashton Jeanty will give him some juice out of the gates. What he brings to the trio, though, is leadership, which the team had in Geno Smith, but with a new dynamic. Anytime you see Mendoza, he has no issue taking over games, the same way Smith used to. In 2026, the Heisman Trophy winner has a chance to use that leadership to be the tide that raises all ships on a dysfunctional Raiders offense that has some promise.",

    "description": "When the SEC’s membership voted to add a ninth conference game, you must wonder whether they thought a 16-team playoff would be in place in 2026.",
    "fullText": "When the SEC’s membership voted to add a ninth conference game, you must wonder whether they thought a 16-team playoff would be in place by the time the expanded conference schedule went into effect.\n\nYou also must wonder whether those SEC members still would’ve voted to expand the conference schedule, if they’d known the 12-team playoff would endure for the 2026 season.\n\nOn this edition of “SEC Football Unfiltered,” a podcast from the USA TODAY Network, hosts Blake Toppmeyer and John Adams unpack the SEC’s inability to strike a compromise with the Big Ten to reach on playoff expansion — and why the nine-game conference schedule might work to the SEC’s detriment in 2026.\n\nThey also debate whether the SEC should have gotten on board with the Big Ten’s plan for a 24-team playoff.\n\nAdams: I’ve long advocated for the SEC expanding its conference schedule to create a better product. However, I’m skeptical that the extra conference game will help the SEC’s playoff pursuits in 2026. You must ask: How much will the selection committee reward strength of schedule? Answer: Probably not as much as the SEC desires.\n\nA nine-game SEC schedule would have paired neatly with a 16-team playoff. SEC teams that finished 9-3 would’ve been prime candidates for at-large selection, in a 16-team field.\n\nThe selection committee still places a lot of value win-loss record, and an extra conference game will make it more difficult for SEC teams to reach 10-2.\n\nToppmeyer: The SEC needed a 16-team bracket for its nine-game conference schedule to pay off. The playoff committee has never selected a 9-3 team for a spot in the 12-team playoff, consistently rejecting SEC teams that pair nine wins with a lofty strength of schedule. Will the committee suddenly start admitting 9-3 SEC teams just because the conference added another league game? I’m skeptical of that.\n\nKudos to the Big Ten’s maneuvering. It argued for the SEC to add a ninth conference game, then threw up a roadblock toward expanding to a 5+11 playoff bracket that the SEC, Big 12 and ACC favored.\n\nWithout Big Ten support, the 5+11 playoff idea could not get approved. So, the SEC strengthened its schedule without successfully creating any more playoff bids. A 12-team playoff that’s worked well for the Big Ten persists.\n\nUnlike the SEC, the Big Ten does not require its members to play either a Power Four opponent or Notre Dame in the non-conference schedule, although many do.\n\nOverall, the Big Ten played the SEC like a fiddle.\n\nAdams: No. This combination of a nine-game SEC schedule with a 12-team playoff might not work to the SEC’s benefit, but that’s not enough reason to get lured into a 24-team playoff. A playoff of such size would turn the sport on its head and devalue the regular season.\n\nWhen we’re talking about almost the entire US LBM Coaches Poll Top 25 making the playoff, it's gotten too big.\n\nToppmeyer: No. If the SEC wants 16, then continue negotiating to try to bring that into effect in subsequent years.\n\nCommitting to 24, when three of the four power conferences want 16, just wouldn’t make sense. College football’s regular season is its greatest attribute. I’m skeptical of any playoff format that would dilute the regular season. The Big Team’s 24-team proposal would do that.\n\nBlake Toppmeyer is the USA TODAY Network's national college football columnist. John Adams is the senior sports columnist for the Knoxville News Sentinel. \n\nIf you purchase through our links, the USA Today Network may earn a commission.

The California native’s contract runs through 2028.\n\n“Aaliyah has a unique defensive prowess, strong aerial ability and the versatility to contribute in multiple defensive roles, which we’re excited to add to our group,” said Chicago Stars FC general manager Richard Feuz. “Her promising career is just getting started. We look forward to having Chicago be part of it.”\n\nFarmer’s first professional contract was signed with the most important club in Mexico in January 2025 and one month later, she received her first call-up to the Mexican national team. Despite 2025 being her rookie year, she has become a regular for the national team, playing eight games with “El Tri Femenil” since her debut on May 30.\n\nHis career took off not only with the national team but also with his former club, Tigres. Since signing with the club, he played nine regular-season games and two playoff games in the Clausura 2025. The following season, he started in 14 of the 15 regular-season games and helped Tigres win another championship, becoming a key figure for the team. It’s also important to highlight her participation in the Concacaf W Champions Cup with Tigres, where she scored her first professional goal against the Portland Thorns.\n\n“I’m incredibly excited to join the Chicago Stars,” said Farmer. “It’s an honor to be part of such a strong club that’s building something special, and I’m excited for what’s ahead. I’m grateful for the opportunity to compete, grow and play with some incredibly talented players. I’m excited to give everything I have for this team and can’t wait to get started.”",

    "fullText": "Yankees reportedly pursuing $12M former MVP, 4-time Gold Glover, 7-time All-Star veteran originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees spent the entire offseason focused on signing one major free agent: Cody Bellinger, who is arguably the most versatile defender in the league. After months of negotiations, the Yankees finally reached an agreement to bring him back to the Bronx.\n\n“The New York Yankees and outfielder Cody Bellinger are in agreement on a five-year, $162.5 million contract, sources told ESPN's Jeff Passan on Wednesday, ending a standoff between two sides that preferred to reunite all winter long. The deal includes opt-outs after the second and third seasons, a $20 million signing bonus and a full no-trade clause, sources said,” ESPN’s Jorge Castillo wrote.\n\nWith Bellinger signed, it seemed the Yankees’ offseason was largely complete—until recently. The team is now seeking a right-handed bat still available on the market. One name they are pursuing is Paul Goldschmidt.\n\n“According to MLB insider Jon Heyman at the New York Post, the Yankees remain interested in retaining Goldschmidt on a new contract. Goldschmidt, 38, played 146 games for the Yanks in the 2025 season and posted a .731 OPS, which was actually an improvement over his .716 mark in 2024. The veteran first baseman smacked 10 home runs and drove in 45 runs, while continuing to play his typically reliable defense,” Fox Sports New Jersey’s Matt Dolloff wrote.\n\nGoldschmidt would serve strictly as a DH or a bench option. New York had decided to let him walk so Ben Rice could take over as the team’s first baseman.\n\n“Goldschmidt will not be re-signed, as Ben Rice is the club’s first baseman of the future,” The Athletic’s Chris Kirschner and Brendan Kuty wrote.\n\nGoldschmidt brings tremendous veteran leadership and a strong clubhouse presence. His playoff experience would be invaluable if the deal comes to fruition.\n\nThe Yankees are undoubtedly confident in their current roster, but there is always room for improvement. Adding Goldschmidt would bring back yet another familiar face to the Bronx.",

    "description": "A unanimous decision from the OWGR means players on the LIV will earn ranking points for the first time",
    "fullText": "Competitiors on the LIV Golf Tour will be able to win world ranking points from the 2026 after a decision from the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) governing board ruled in favour of the tour’s application.\n\nLIV Golf began in 2022 as a breakaway tour to the established professinal PGA Tour and DP World Tours having been founded by Saudia Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.\n\nEach tournament lasted 54 holes instead of the usual four-round 72 holes played on the American and European tours and LIV was created with unique rules and teams to try and capture a similar vibe to that of the Ryder Cup. LIV has switched to 72 holes for the 2026 season, though that wasn't a big obstacle in getting world ranking points because other smaller tours around the world also have 54 hole events.\n\nIt drew big name players such as Phil Mickelson, Ian Poulter and Dustin Johnson whilst creating a rift with the PGA Tour in particular from which the players had to resign their memberships. Earlier this year Brooks Koepka and Patrick Reed announced their intentions to leave LIV and seek reintegration into the PGA Tour.\n\nAlso in 2022, LIV applied to the OWGR with a submission for the tour to be awarded world rankings points for its players but was unsuccessful. The OWGR rejected the first application in October 2023 when former chairman Peter Dawson said the board could not fairly measure LIV against the other tours. A year later, the then CEO Greg Norman advised that LIV would no longer be seeking OWGR approval for ranking points.\n\nHowever, LIV received a boost on the eve of its fifth season when the OWGR approved that the league will receive ranking points for the very first time in 2026.\n\nA statement from OWGR reads: “The Governing Board of the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) today announced its decision on the application from LIV Golf.\n\n“After conducting an exhaustive and collaborative process, and in an effort to reflect the changing landscape of the men’s professional game, the OWGR Board has made the decision to award world ranking points to LIV Golf events for the 2026 season.\n\n“Ranking points will be allocated to the top-10 finishers (and ties) in LIV Golf’s individual stroke play events, which recognises there are a number of areas where LIV Golf does not meet the eligibility standards set out by OWGR.”\n\nThe decision was unanimous but the OWGR board but comes with conditions. Only the top 10 players in each event will receive points.\n\nTyrrell Hatton at No. 22 and Bryson DeChambeau at No. 33 are the only LIV players in the current top 50 of the world rankings.",

    "description": "Florida football defensive tackle Caleb Banks lands with the Chargers in ESPN's latest NFL mock draft after a strong Senior Bowl showing.",
    "fullText": "Former Florida football defensive tackle Caleb Banks is projected to be selected by the Los Angeles Chargers with the No. 22 pick, according to ESPN's latest 2026 NFL mock draft.\n\nAccording to analyst Matt Miller, his reasoning is pretty straightforward: the Chargers need more of a true anchor on the defensive line, and Banks fits the mold as a nose tackle who can hold ground against the run while still bringing some juice as a power rusher.\n\nBanks is listed at 6-feet-6-inches and 339 pounds, and Miller describes him as an \"aggressive bull rusher\" with rare first-step quickness for a guy built like that.\n\nBanks' most recent season with the Gators didn't look normal on paper because he was limited to two games due to a foot injury. That's the type of thing that can quietly stall a prospect's momentum, especially when draft cycles move as fast as they do. But that's also where the Senior Bowl comes in.\n\nHis week in Mobile, Alabama, was well-received by scouts, and it sounds like the practices helped reintroduce him as a disruptor instead of \"the injured guy who missed time.\"\n\nBanks still has plenty of runway left in the pre-draft process, and his medicals and testing will matter a ton. But getting slotted in the first round, even in a mock, is the kind of headline that sticks. It puts Banks firmly in the \"name to know\" tier as draft talk heats up.\n\n\"The run on edge rushers before this pick leaves the Chargers with some interesting decisions. Do they add to an offensive line that was marred by injury in 2025 or try to fix a D-line that still needs a true anchor to help defend the run?\n\n\"With the talent that's left on the board, Banks would be very enticing as the nose tackle Los Angeles is missing. The 6-foot-6, 339-pounder is an aggressive bull rusher with rare first-step quickness for his size. Think Vita Vea, but with better length. Banks missed all but two games last season due to a foot injury, but his Senior Bowl performance was well-received by scouts, who saw the explosive play in the trenches that excited them entering the 2025 season.\"\n\nFollow us@GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well asBluesky, and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nIf you purchase through our links, the USA Today Network may earn a commission.

    "fullText": "Stefon Diggs was asked about the Cardi B halftime rumors with Bad Bunny at 2026 Super Bowl Opening Night on Monday, Feb. 3\n\nThe New England Patriots star played coy with his response when asked in front of a swarm of media who circled his podium at the event\n\nCardi features Bad Bunny on her 2018 hit, \"I Like It,\" along with J Balvin\n\nDoes Stefon Diggs know something that we don't know?\n\nThe New England Patriots star, 32, was put on the spot by a reporter at Super Bowl LX Opening Night when he was asked about the rumor that his girlfriend, Cardi B, will make a surprise cameo with Bad Bunny during halftime on Sunday, Feb. 8.\n\nThe topic arose when Diggs was asked by a different reporter his thoughts on the Puerto Rican Grammy winner, to which the wide receiver answered by pulling up one of his favorite songs, \"NUEVAYoL\" off his acclaimed 2025 album, DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, on his phone.\n\n\"Yeah, there's one song I really like,\" replied a stumped Diggs, who couldn't recall the song title on the spot so whipped out his device for an impromptu jam sesh on the mic in front of media, including PEOPLE, who circled his podium at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center on Feb. 2.\n\nWhile the music was playing, another reporter asked the NFL star about the rumors his rapper girlfriend, 33, will make a surprise appearance with Bad Bunny during his halftime show set, given their 2018 hit together, \"I Like It,\" which also features J Balvin.\n\n\"I don't know, we can call and ask her,\" quipped Diggs, playing coy with his response before quickly reverting back to singing, \"NUEVAYoL,\" saying, \"...but I think this is my favorite part!\"\n\nElsewhere during Opening Night, the NFL star weighed in on whether he'll be proposing to Cardi soon after being asked about his relationship with the “Up” rapper.\n\nThe reporter asked if Diggs wins the Super Bowl and gets a championship ring, whether the \"Up\" rapper would be “getting her ring” afterward. In response, the New England Patriots wide receiver responded, “It’s on the agenda, maybe, right? Right?”\n\nHe jokingly added, “I gotta get mine first.\"\n\nHe and the musician have been dating for several months and share a son — whose name has not yet been released, and who was born in November — together. The \"Am I the Drama?\" rapper announced the baby news in September.\n\nThe two first sparked romance rumors after they were spotted together in New York City and Miami in February 2025, per TMZ. They took their relationship public in May 2025 with an appearance together at a New York Knicks playoff game.\n\nThe next month, Cardi confirmed her relationship with Diggs on Instagram. Though the musician appeared to hint at a breakup a month later when she removed every photo with the wide receiver from her feed, the couple is still going strong.\n\nCardi has supported Diggs at a number of his games over the course of the season. In January, she celebrated the Patriots' AFC Championship 10-7 win over the Denver Broncos, sealing their spot in the 2026 Super Bowl.",

    "fullText": "Ademola Lookman was the most expensive Serie A sale of the 2026 January transfer window, but Napoli could match the same fee if Lorenzo Lucca’s loan move to Nottingham Forest is made permanent. Here is a reminder of the most expensive departures of the winter transfer window.\n\nThe Serie A transfer window came to a close at 19.00 GMT on Monday, February 2. Lookman was the second most expensive deadline day transfer in the world with his €35m switch from Atalanta to Atletico Madrid (not including bonuses).\n\nLazio were among the most active Serie A sides during the January transfer window, and raised just shy of €60m through their sales of Taty Castellanos to West Ham and Matteo Guendouzi to Fenerbahce.\n\nOfficial: West Ham United announce the signing of Taty Castellanos on a permanent deal from Lazio (picture via www.whufc.com)\n\nLorenzo Lucca is an interesting case, as he was technically bought outright by Napoli from Udinese, and then sent out on loan to Nottingham Forest with an option to buy. His two moves this month could turn out to be worth in excess of €60m.\n\nHere are the most expensive permanent sales of the January transfer window, and a list of the most significant loans with option to buy.\n\nAtletico Madrid confirm Ademola Lookman’s signing from Serie A side Atalanta.\n\nOfficial: Lorenzo Lucca joins Nottingham Forest on loan with an option to buy from Napoli (picture: www.nottinghamforest.co.uk)",

    "fullText": "The Browns held a press conference to introduce Todd Monken as their new head coach on Tuesday and team owner Jimmy Haslam spent some time discussing the process that led to Monken landing the job.\n\nSeveral candidates reportedly pulled their name out of consideration for the post prior to Monken landing the job last month, but Haslam said that those decisions didn’t change the way that the franchise viewed Monken.\n\n“You go through a search process — I think we started out with 20, 25 candidates,” Haslam said. “I think we interviewed nine, I might be off by one there. A search is a little bit of a roller coaster. Somebody drops out, somebody comes in. You get better references or better test results on someone. Or worse. I would say Todd was on the top of the list the entire time. I think our search lasted 20 days and I’d say he was leading the pack or in the front pack the entire time.”\n\nIt would be a surprise to hear any team owner say that their first choice for a head coach was anyone other than the person who wound up being hired, so we’re unlikely to know if the Browns had initially honed in on someone who ultimately chose a different path. It also won’t be something mentioned much if Monken can move the Browns in the right direction in 2026 and beyond, but more of the same in Cleveland won’t do much to make the job a more attractive one the next time the Browns need to make a change.",

    "description": "With Hiromu Takahashi's time with NJPW drawing to a close, Dave Meltzer has discussed where the \"Time Bomb\" could land next.",
    "fullText": "After nearly 16 years as part of New Japan Pro Wrestling, Hiromu Takahashi is leaving the company. It was announced on February 3 that the record four-time winner of the Best of the Super Juniors tournament would be finishing up with NJPW on February 11 following The New Beginning In Osaka event, causing many people to speculate where he might end up next. On the latest edition of \"Wrestling Observer Radio,\" Dave Meltzer commented on where Takahashi will go next, and in his mind, there are three possible options.\n\n\"Hiromu, we don't know where he's going. I've heard the Hiromu leaving stuff for I feel like two months at least, maybe longer,\" Meltzer said. \"The rumor was always NOAH. I've people talk about maybe WWE, I mean I could see him in AEW if he was available to AEW. I could see him going to WWE because there's the money, but as far as WWE's track record with Japanese junior heavyweights, I mean I know everybody thinks they're going to be different because they're really good, and he's obviously really good.\" Takahashi did tell Tokyo Sports after the announcement was made that he does have one major goal he wants to achieve, but didn't specify where he would need to go in order to achieve that goal.\n\nTakahashi already has a history with AEW thanks to the company's working relationship with NJPW, appearing on three Forbidden Door pay-per-views between 2023 and 2025, including challenging Kyle Fletcher for the AEW TNT Championship at the 2025 event. Later on in 2025, Takahashi won the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship in Pro Wrestling NOAH, a title he would end up dropping to AMAKUSA at the company's New Year event on January 1, but considering his former Los Ingobrenables de Japon stablemates Tetsuya Naito and BUSHI have also made their way to NOAH, that could be his next landing place. As for WWE, Takahashi has no history with the company, but he could follow in the footsteps of another former LIJ member EVIL, who is slated to be joining the company in the coming weeks.\n\nPlease credit \"Wrestling Observer Radio\" when using quotes from this article, and give a H/T to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.",

    "description": "The Longhorns hope to take advantage of three of the next four games at home against weaker conference opponents.",
    "fullText": "The Longhorns hope to take advantage of three of the next four games at home against weaker conference opponents.\n\nAt the midway point of SEC play, the Texas Longhorns are firmly on the NCAA Tournament bubble as the last team in the field of Joe Lunardi’s Bracketology after opening a winnable stretch of games with Saturday’s 10-point victory over the Oklahoma Sooners in Norman prior to hosting the South Carolina Gamecocks at the Moody Center on Tuesday.\n\nNext Saturday, disgraced former head coach Chris Beard brings his scuffling Ole Miss team to the Forty Acres, followed by a road game against Missouri and a home matchup against LSU. A win probability of 50 percent for the game in Columbia the lowest of that stretch for the Longhorns, creating an imperative for first-year head coach Sean Miller’s team to at least protect home court at the Moody Center.\n\nEven a win on Tuesday would represent just the second time in conference play that Texas has won back-to-back games and the only winning streak longer than that came early in the season when the Longhorns notched four straight games against some of the worst teams in the country.\n\nBut since the 14-point loss to Tennessee in Knoxville in which Texas struggled to compete, Miller’s team has had chances to win every other game, including in hostile environments like Rupp Arena in Lexington and Neville Arena in Auburn.\n\nAfter taking an eight-point lead into halftime against the Tigers, however, the game got away from the Longhorns in the second half because Texas committed 18 fouls that led to 28 free-throw attempts for Auburn.\n\n“Not a lot else changed, but what really changed is their free-throw attempts,” Miller said in an appearance on On Texas Football. “It’s not eight fouls that we’re trying to get rid of, it’s the two, three, or four undisciplined fouls that we can correct, that we are working hard to correct.”\n\nThose several undisciplined fouls add up quickly in close games — in the four SEC loses outside of the poor effort against the Volunteers, the Longhorns have lost by an average of 4.5 points.\n\n“That’s four free-throw attempts. They didn’t get into bonus as early. There’s a huge swing when you can foul less in college basketball, and I think that’s plagued our defense, and we could be a better overall defensive team. I’ve told our guys on a daily basis, if the number goes in the right direction defensively for us, a lot of the things that we’re hunting and going after will come true, but we’re only going to go as far on this path as our defensive improvement allows us,” Miller said.\n\nTexas currently ranks 297th in opposing free-throw rate.\n\nThe single player Miller needs to make strides in fouling less over the final nine SEC games is sophomore center Matas Vokietaitis, who is averaging 5.2 fouls per 40 minutes.\n\n“He gets fouled as much as any player that plays college basketball, so the spotlight is always on him — that means you have to be even more disciplined and smarter when it’s your turn to defend. There are times to be physical and there’s times to let it go, and there’s times that you have to show your hands and go vertical, and there’s times when you have to do a lot of work with your legs and your chest, your torso, and not your hands. We’ve had a hard time, truth be told, with Matas in that area, but he’s better than he was, for example, when we played in the Maui Invitational,” Miller said.\n\nVokietaitis is also better than he was last year as a freshman at Florida Atlantic in his first season playing basketball in the United States, cutting his fouling by almost a full foul per 40 minutes.\n\nFor the Texas team, however, a worse forced turnover rate than opposing free-throw rate is a bad duo.\n\n“We don’t force turnovers and we foul — that’s a wicked combination. Teams that don’t force turnovers can win big, but you cannot foul,” Miller said on Monday.\n\nThe other area defensively that the Longhorns need to improve in is three-point defense. Texas is limiting opponents to a three-point rate of 35.6 percent, 60th nationally, but allowing opponents to make 35.4 percent of those attempts 258th nationally.\n\nBecause the Horns have a low three-point rate and an even lower assist rate, the degree of difficulty for those three-point attempts is heightened because they often come off the dribble, and the combination of allowing that level of efficiency from opponents and not making up for it in volume can create large margins like the Hoos notching a 24-point edge in points off threes in their 19-point win in December.\n\nBut despite those weaknesses offensively, Miller and his staff have managed to create the most efficient offense at Texas since DJ Augustin and Damion James led the Longhorns to the Elite Eight in 2007-08, an attack built primarily on getting to the free-throw line and scoring in the paint.\n\nAnd it’s not just Vokietaitis buoying those areas of success — junior wing Dailyn Swain has also attempted more than 100 free throws so far this season and taken even more shots around the rim than the big Lithuanian.\n\nOver the last four games, Swain has been sensational, averaging 25.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 2.5 steals while shooting 64.9 percent from the floor, 44.4 percent from three, and 87.5 percent from the free-throw line.\n\nAlready one of the most dangerous players in the country off the bounce, Swain’s ability to shoot threes effectively is a force multiplier for his game, especially in bailing Texas out of poor possessions in late-clock situations.\n\nThe shooting improvement has taken a lot of hard work behind the scenes from Swain, whose high-major interest out of high school in Columbus was limited by his lack of shooting range.\n\n“It wasn’t that he couldn’t shoot or you didn’t like the way his shot looked like, he basically ignored that part of the game. He did it really almost through his entire time in high school,” Miller said.\n\nAfter signing with Xavier, Swain was 4-of-26 shooting from three as a freshman (15.4 percent) before showing some signs of improvement in making seven of his 28 attempts last season (25 percent). In practice, Miller and his staff spent a year and a half forcing the talented wing to shoot open threes, leading to enough improvement that he gained the confidence to take and make them in games — he’s now a 31.7-percent shooter this season and at 35.5 percent in SEC play.\n\nAs an almost 80 percent career shooter from the free-throw line, Swain’s ability to convert those opportunities gave Miller hope that he could eventually add a three-point shot to his game. Now he has, and it’s made him one of the most efficient scorers in the nation’s best basketball conference.\n\nSouth Carolina arrives in Austin with just two SEC wins, coming against LSU on the road and Oklahoma at home, leaving the Gamecocks at 15th in the conference in adjusted efficiency. But as the overtime loss to Mississippi State in the conference opener revealed a month ago, Texas can play poorly enough to lose to anyone, especially if the team is giving up a lot of three-pointers to opposing guards or debilitated by its fouling virus.\n\nSo Miller is emphasizing what the Longhorns need to do to win rather than focusing on the opponent specifically.\n\n“We just have to be at our best. Period. I think it’s like a nameless, faceless league. On your end, your preparation, your readiness, how you attack the game, how you play, you’ve got to be at your best, and the more you can be at your best, the better opportunity you have for success. So the only thing that’s different about this week is we have back-to-back home games. Other than that, I think we have to look at this — this is an SEC team and we all know what that is,” Miller said.\n\nTip is at 6 p.m. Central on SEC Network with Texas boasting an 85-percent win probability, according to Bart Torvik.",

That breaks down to:\n\nWhat marked Sarr’s signing at Bayern Munich was not his lack of production or even his lack of minutes, it is that he was just content to hang out, do some training, work out, and watch the games. It is an awesome gig if you can get it, but rather than aiming to get on the pitch elsewhere, Sarr embraced his role as passenger at Bayern Munich.\n\nAnyway, Sarr has re-emerged with FC Metz in a string of X posts:\n\n“I can’t wait to reconnect with the supporters at Saint-Symphorien”\n\nSarr came on to the professional scene with FC Metz in the 2014/15 season and will get a chance to relive his glory days in France.

    "description": "The Buccaneers address EDGE, linebacker depth and running back uncertainty in a full 7-round mock draft using PFF’s simulator.",
    "fullText": "Using the Pro Football Focus simulator, I ran a full seven-round PFF Mock Draft to see how the board might fall for Tampa Bay in the 2026 NFL Draft. With multiple defensive linemen coming off early i the first round, landing T.J. Parker (Clemson) at No. 15 felt like both value and need meeting at the right time. EDGE remains one of Tampa Bay’s most important roster priorities, and adding a young pass rusher helps reinforce the front seven with long-term upside and rotational juice.\n\nThis class intentionally focused on the Buccaneers’ biggest roster questions: EDGE, linebacker depth, interior offensive line depth, running back insurance, and tight end (which ultimately went unaddressed here, but let's assume the Bucs resigned Otton and add a name or two via UDFA to compete for TE1/utility/Special teams next season).\n\nChris Johnson (CB, San Diego State) adds depth and competition to the secondary, while Chase Bisontis (G, Texas A&M) strengthens the interior offensive line, a necessary investment for long-term stability. Bisontis has experience as both a guard and a tackle throughout his collegiate career and would fit immediately as a developmental depth piece for Tampa Bay's line, which struggled at times in 2025 due to injuries and limited depth. Aiden Fisher, a national championship linebacker from Indiana, provides the linebacking room with developmental depth behind the starters and a rush of youth at defensive signal caller in case Lavonte David hangs up his cleats this offseason.\n\nLate-round selections leaned into projection. Drew Allar (QB, Penn State) offers developmental upside, as Teddy Bridgewater showed last year, and the Buccaneers need a better option at QB2. Chip Trayanum (RB, Toledo) makes sense given the uncertainty surrounding Rachaad White’s future beyond 2025. Tight end remains a clear need that would still have to be addressed elsewhere, possibly in free agency or in a haul of UDFA, while resigning Bucs 2025 starting tight end Cade Otton, who didn't have a receiving touchdown until the final game in the opening drive against the Carolina Panthers in week 18.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bucs Wire: Bucs 7-Round PFF Mock Draft: Edge, Depth, and Development",

    "fullText": "Florida football finds itself right in the middle of the SEC pack in CBS Sports' power rankings for the 2026 season, a reflection of both uncertainty and quiet optimism surrounding the program entering Jon Sumrall's first year with the Orange and Blue.\n\nCBS Sports' Brandon Marcello slotted the Gators 10th in the SEC, placing Florida firmly in the conference's crowded middle tier following a chaotic transfer portal cycle and a full coaching reset.\n\nSumrall inherited a group that needed significant turnover, and that context matters. Florida lost key contributors to the portal, rebuilt large portions of its depth chart and is still sorting out several position battles heading into spring practice.\n\nCBS Sports pointed specifically to quarterback uncertainty, noting the compeition between Georgia Tech transfer Aaron Philo and Tramell Jones Jr. as a storyline that could ultimately swing Florida's ceiling one way or another.\n\nIt's simply too early to make definitive judgements. Spring practices, sumeer development and continued roster movement will reshape the conference landscape before fall arrives. For Florida, that means the current ranking by CBS Sports should be viewed more as a snapshot than a verdict.\n\nFor now, the Gators are positioned as a team with something to prove.\n\nHere is everything Marcello wrote about Florida and why he ranked them at No. 10 in the SEC power rankings.\n\n\"Jon Sumrall arrives with a major rebuild on his hands in Gainesville. The former Tulane and Troy coach has never won less than 10 games in a single season, but make sure to temper your expectations for Year 1 in the SEC. He had to overhaul a roster depleted by transfers, and we don't quite know what to expect with Georgia Tech transfer Aaron Philo battling Tramell Jones Jr. at quarterback.\n\n\"Still, Sumrall has the magic touch and knows how to build rosters. He also hired a top-tier staff. The Gators could be in the top half of the SEC this season, but we need to see more this spring and summer to better gauge the Gators.\"\n\nFollow us@GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well asBluesky, and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.",

    "fullText": "Thomas Brown could be another branch on the McVay tree\n\nSean McVay’s coaching tree with the Rams has a wide reach, but one name that never comes up in those conversations is Thomas Brown. Although Brown actually has head coaching experience already (he was Bears interim head coach in 2024), his rise through the ranks since being an offensive assistant for McVay from 2020-2022 has slipped through the cracks.\n\nBut Brown’s secret could be out of the bag if he’s instrumental in helping the Patriots beat the Seahawks in the Super Bowl on Sunday.\n\nBrown is the Patriots pass game coordinator.\n\nOnce a running back for the Falcons and Browns, Brown started as a strength and conditioning coach at the University of Georgia in 2011. By 2020, Brown was hired by McVay as a running backs coach on the Rams and was added the title of assistant head coach in 2021. He was moved to tight ends coach in 2022.\n\nFinally, Brown moved on and took a job with the Carolina Panthers on Frank Reich’s staff as offensive coordinator in 2023 after he was passed over for the same job in L.A., as McVay opted to go outside the organization to hire Mike LaFleur to replace Kevin O’Connell instead. LaFleur is leaving this week to become the head coach of the Cardinals, leaving an opening for Rams OC.\n\nProbably not. It is widely expected that McVay will try to retain Nate Scheelhaase as offensive coordinator. But Brown’s name is back on the market as one that many teams would like to have. He also interviewed for the same Cardinals head coaching position that went to LaFleur. As passing game coordinator in the Super Bowl, Brown could be in line for a full-time OC position somewhere rather than working under Josh McDaniels again.\n\nBrown’s short tenure with the Panthers went as poorly as Reich’s. He was let go with the rest of the staff after one season. He was then hired by the Bears as pass game coordinator in 2024, then promoted to OC when Shane Waldron was fired, then promoted to interim head coach when Matt Eberflus was fired.\n\nHe is now pass game coordinator for MVP candidate Drake Maye and he continues to work with tight ends.\n\nBrown won a Super Bowl with the Rams in 2021. After so much turmoil in 2023 and 2024, he could win his second this weekend and do so against the Seahawks.",

But led by Monken, all three noted that Schwartz's status is a subject for another day.\n\nMonken noted that he had talked with Schwartz, but didn't divulge anything further about their discussion.\n\n\"First of all, I think Jim is an outstanding defensive coordinator — I think we all would agree with that,\" Monken said. \"But I think it’s a little inappropriate for me to comment about that at this time.\"\n\nIrrespective of Schwartz's status, Monken noted that he does not plan on changing Cleveland's defensive scheme.\n\n\"It’s been a bitch — I apologize — to go against this defense six times over the last three years. Schematically, and more importantly, the players, because ultimately it’s a players’ game,\" Monken said.\n\n\"My anticipation is we’re not going to change the system,\" Monken later added. \"[It’s] very difficult to go against. I’m not planning on changing the system. We’re built for the system that they’re in currently. I’m not going to get into staffing, because that’s not at this time to get into that. But they can rest assured that we’re going to keep the same system. We’re still going to let them attack. We’re still going to let them play free. I can’t see any other way. They’re a big reason why I took this job — the defensive players.\"\n\nAs Monken made clear, it's the players who are his focus, not the defensive coordinator.\n\n\"I didn’t take this job because of Jim Schwartz,\" Monken said. \"I have a lot of respect for Jim Schwartz, as I would hope he has for me. But I took it because of the players that are here, the ownership, Andrew Berry, and the ability to build this roster from the ground up on the offensive side.\n\n\"So, and I said this to the other guys, I didn’t think I’d say it, but I’m gonna say it — when I was preparing for the Cleveland Browns, I wasn’t trying to chip Jim Schwartz, I was chipping Myles Garrett. And when I was sliding a protection to the outside backers or Grant Delpit, they were blitzing off the edge, I was sliding the protection to the players. And when I was worried about throwing to the right against Denzel Ward or Tyson Campbell to the left, that’s who I was worried about throwing at.\"",

    "fullText": "FORT LAUDERDALE — Panthers star forward Sam Bennett suffered an upper-body injury during Florida’s loss to Buffalo on Monday night. It’s the latest in a series of injuries that have decimated the reigning Stanley Cup champions, who have lost four straight games.\n\n“It seems like somebody’s getting injured every night,” Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk said.\n\nPanthers coach Paul Maurice said Bennett — who was reportedly picked to replace Tampa Bay’s Anthony Cirelli for the Canadian Olympic team on Tuesday — and fellow forwards Anton Lundell and Brad Marchand may be able to play Wednesday against Boston, but the team has not made that determination yet.\n\n“There’s a chance they could all play tomorrow,” Maurice said. “There’s a chance not to play tomorrow, but we won’t know till after the morning skate.”\n\nBennett’s injury meant all four of the Panthers’ centers from last year’s Stanley Cup team — captain Aleksander Barkov, Lundell, Bennett and Tomas Nosek — are hurt. Florida needed winger Eetu Luostarinen to move to center, a position he previously played, to fill the void on Monday.\n\n“He was good; five on two on the draws,” Maurice said Monday. “I like him better on the wing because of what Lundell does, what the two of them can do, but everybody needed to play all over.”\n\nThe growing list of injuries that have plagued Florida all season have not gone unnoticed.\n\n“When you get started blowing up barbecues, you start to think,” Maurice said, referring to Luostarinen suffering an injury while grilling earlier this season. “… But I would say that in everything that’s happened here over the last four years, there’s something to be gleaned out of your adversity.”\n\nMaurice said the team needs to stick to its foundation and stay confident so they avoid pressing. He said the Panthers did that in their loss to Buffalo.\n\n“I think sometimes you’ll sit so defensively because of the urgency and it’s also the foundation of your game,” Maurice said. “But we put up (42 shots) last night and felt we had opportunities to score. So there has to be a certain amount of freedom and ease in your game for the confidence to stay and to make plays because you can’t just (keep) kicking it out into the neutral zone all night. I thought we were good with that last game. Most important thing is you have a foundation. That has to be there first. You can’t lose that ease in your game where you’re too tight to create.”\n\nTkachuk said right now the Panthers just have to grind out close victories.\n\n“We cannot try to outskill teams — and that’s not what we were trying to do — but at some points in the game, we are doing that. We’re just playing into their hands,” Tkachuk said. “… We’ve just got to try to get back to the basics. We’ve got to try to win a 1-0, 2-1 game here and just try to go from there. We’re in one right now, and if we don’t simplify it, this year’s going to get away from us.”\n\nThe Panthers are feeling the urgency of the moment. Florida plays Boston on Wednesday and Tampa Bay on Thursday before the team gets a three-week break for the Olympics. But Tkachuk said the Panthers, who are currently nine points out of a playoff spot, need to turn things around before the break; they cannot wait any longer.\n\n“This could get away from us if we don’t figure it out,” Tkachuk said. “It has to start next game. We’ve got two games left, and Boston’s another team we’re chasing that’s a wild card team, so we’ve got to get it.”",

    "fullText": "Super Bowl LX week is officially under way. Monday evening saw the opening night ceremonies, which included media access to both teams, coaches and players alike. Naturally, Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald was one of the most sought-after interviews given his lofty status However, it seems Macdonald is getting tired of answering one incredibly specific question.\n\nYou might be able to guess what it is, seeing as though this is a Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots. A question regarding a certain infamous play call, one that has haunted the Pacific Northwest for over a decade now. During opening night, Macdonald was asked four separate times about what kind of play he would call in a similar scenario. At first, he appeared to find it amusing, but his good humor about it ran out.\n\nThis Super Bowl rematch is rather unique, as no player or coach (aside from Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels) that was involved with Super Bowl XLIX is with the teams playing in Super Bowl LX. The only thing that's remained the same are the logos on the helmets. Yet that moment where Malcolm Butler intercepted Russell Wilson at the goal line will live on, and still casts a shadow to this day.\n\nThe only way the Seahawks are going to be able to find a way to move past it, and for Mike Macdonald to stop answering questions about it, will be to defeat the Patriots on Sunday.",

    "description": "As podcast bros debate falling birth rates, one writer has a radical new suggestion.",
    "fullText": "The world wants women to have more kids. Apparently, it’s our fault that birth rates are dropping and we’re in danger of letting men die without passing on their DNA – shock, horror, what will we do about this injustice?\n\nOn a recent episode of Diary of a CEO, host Stephen Bartlett and Love Islander-turned lifestyle guru Chris Williamson – both childless, mind you – pondered this injustice. “Should society intervene to course-correct that?” mused Bartlett. “Should we put systems in place to make sure that those men meet partners?”\n\nI have a better idea; We have to kick out patriarchy and welcome in matriarchy.\n\nHold on, I hear you say, wouldn’t it be just as bad exchanging one gender-based societal system for another? Well, no. It wouldn’t. I’ll explain. But first, we need to understand why more women are choosing to say no to child-rearing.\n\nBirth rates in the UK hit a record low of 1.41 in England and Wales in 2025, marking the third year of decline. Deaths are expected to consistently outnumber births by the year 2030. The primary driver of hesitancy is economic pressure. It now costs a couple £260,000 to raise a child to age 18 and £290,000 for a lone parent — the median income in the UK is around £39,000. Many parents must also support their child well beyond their passage into adulthood, thanks to a struggling economy.\n\nHigh childcare costs, sexist attitudes, and a lack of flexible working options are forcing mothers out of the workplace.\n\nA 2025 Ipsos survey of 18- to 50-year-olds found that 44% planned to delay having children or not have them at all. The main reason cited? The astronomical cost. Even as the government expands free nursery hours, it’s not enough to make having a child financially viable for many people. The fantasy of the one-working-parent household is no longer the norm, and parents are being destroyed by exorbitant childcare fees. Naturally, in response, people are increasingly saying no or “maybe later” to parenthood.\n\nPelvic floor muscles are no joke.\n\nBut money isn’t the only reason women are turning their backs on parenthood. The opportunity to prioritise a job over family is still relatively new for women, so many of us are choosing to grow our careers rather than grow a baby. We’re also seeing fewer grandparents able to take on childcare responsibilities, which often leaves prospective parents choosing between financial stability and childcare.\n\nThen there’s the state of the world. Climate change is looming over us. War is breaking out across the globe. Political instability has never felt more visceral than it does in an age where we see people murdered by state officials on our news feeds. It’s no wonder people are electing to delay or avoid having children to protect potential offspring from growing up in a broken world.",

    "fullText": "Last summer, Bryan Vance found himself in an argument with a stranger on Reddit. Vance, a Portland-based journalist who runs Stumptown Savings, a newsletter covering local grocery deals, had been accused of using ChatGPT to write his content. The evidence? His use of em dashes.\n\n“A Reddit user accused me of using AI, pointing to my use of, quote, extra long M dashes that are not possible to replicate on a normal keyboard,” Vance recalls. The accusation stung, particularly because Vance spends 40 hours a week personally visiting grocery stores and crafting his newsletter by hand. “I’m a human, I can confirm I’m human,” he says.\n\nThis plucky bit of punctuation has had a very, very long literary history way beyond today’s tussles with technology. It’s been on a hero’s journey, playing the lead in an adventure story that has spanned both centuries and the pages of our most beloved plays, novels and poems. So who invented it—and why?\n\nThe em dash gets its name from its width, roughly equivalent to a capital M. Its origins trace back to 11th century Italy and a scholar named Boncompagno da Signa, who practiced the formal art of composing letters and documents. Frustrated with the inconsistent punctuation rules of his time, he created his own system, including a horizontal dash called Virgula Plana that looked exactly like a modern em dash.\n\nWhile his dash-as-period never caught on, the mark’s grammatical flexibility allowed it to evolve. According to Keith Houston, author of Shady Characters: The Secret Life Of Punctation, Symbols And Other Typographical Marks the dash slid into the printing era without a fixed purpose, which may have made it remarkably adaptable.\n\nThe dash became essential for capturing a theatrical technique called aposiopesis, speech deliberately broken off mid-sentence. In King Lear, characters trail off with dashes as they lose their train of thought or shift direction, bringing psychological realism to the stage.\n\nWhen the novel emerged as a literary form in the 18th century, writers adopted the dash to capture authentic human thought and speech. Lawrence Sterne’s 1759 satirical novel “Tristram Shandy” deployed dashes with wild abandon, creating a stream-of-consciousness narrative that felt revolutionary. One short excerpt contains seven dashes used in every conceivable way. “It must have been like a bolt from the blue,” Houston says. “It must have been so incredible for people at the time to read this.”\n\nNovelists also used dashes for censorship, redacting names and locations to create an air of authenticity. Jane Austen employed this technique in her work, including in Pride and Prejudice using dashes to obscure military regiment names as if protecting real people’s reputations. The device added both realism and intrigue, helping sell these new works of fiction.\n\nNo writer became more associated with the em dash than Emily Dickinson. She composed nearly 1,800 poems in Amherst, Massachusetts, many during the Civil War, accompanied by thousands of dashes. Her dashes didn’t just indicate pauses; they captured the speed and ambiguity of human thought itself.\n\nDr. Fiona Green, who has studied Dickinson for decades, notes that the poet’s dashes create suspended moments of meaning. “She exploited unfinishedness,” Green explains. “The poems are always in the process, always undecided.” When Dickinson died in 1886, her editors stripped away most of her dashes before publication. Out of 1,151 dashes in her first collection, only 52 remained. Yet the poems became a sensation, never going out of print.\n\nThe em dash has always had critics. Jonathan Swift mocked excessive dashes in the 18th century. A reviewer complained about Lord Byron’s dashes appearing “sometimes twice or thrice in one line.” Modern style guides like The Chicago Manual of Style warn: “If in doubt, edit them out.” Even dash enthusiasts acknowledge the temptation to overuse it. “It’s easy to overuse the dash,” Houston admits. “I have to self edit to stop myself using it all the time.”\n\nWhich brings us back to Bryan Vance and his Reddit troubles. Around 2024, people noticed that ChatGPT and other large language models had developed an em dash habit. The punctuation appeared so frequently in AI-generated text that younger internet users began calling it the “ChatGPT hyphen.”",

    "fullText": "Five former Dell employees are suing the tech giant, alleging it mismanaged its 401(k) retirement plan and cost workers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe complaint, filed on January 28 in a federal court in Texas, alleges that Dell and its retirement plan managers held employees' money for several years in underperforming investment funds, even as better alternatives became available.\n\nThey argue that the plan's fiduciaries failed to properly monitor and replace several in-house investment options, including Dell Pre-Mixed Portfolio Target Date Series and Dell Core Funds, that consistently underperformed comparable funds in the market.\n\nThe plaintiffs say those decisions violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and led to \"massive underperformance\" that \"resulted in the loss of over $318 million of assets for the Plan and its participants.\"\n\n\"The participants in the Plan suffered financial harm as a result of the Plan's imprudent investment options and the process Defendants used to monitor and retain the Subject Funds,\" the complaint states.\n\nThe \"breadth and depth\" of the fund's \"underperformance raises a plausible inference that Dell's selection and monitoring process was tainted by a lack of competency and/or complete failure of effort,\" the plaintiffs allege.\n\nDell declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDell's 401(k) plan provides retirement savings for roughly 63,000 current and former employees and their beneficiaries, according to the court filings. In 2024, the plan held about $14.6 billion in assets, the documents state.\n\nThe lawsuit is led by five former employees — Allison Lowbruck, Adam Moss, Eric Rodgers, Michael Schwartz, and John Vedamanikam — who are seeking to recover alleged losses for plan participants and reclaim any fees they say were earned through self-dealing.\n\nThey are also calling for changes to how Dell's retirement plan is run going forward and for the removal of those who \"have breached their fiduciary duties.\"\n\nLawsuits alleging 401(k) mismanagement are not unheard of.\n\nSome similar suits brought by plan participants against large companies in the past have resulted in settlements rather than being decided at trial.\n\nIn 2015, UnitedHealth agreed to a $69 million settlement over alleged mismanagement of its 401(k) plan. Boeing also settled a long-running 401(k) lawsuit that year, agreeing to pay $57 million after nearly nine years of litigation.\n\nAre you a Dell employee?

On Wednesdays, users get a text about a potential match. After each date, Ditto follows up for feedback and uses that information as additional data for future matches.\n\n\"People are tired of being trapped behind the apps,\" Wang said.\n\nDitto will announce on Tuesday that it has raised $9.2 million in seed funding, led by venture capital firm Peak XV, with participation from firms like Alumni Ventures, Gradient, and Scribble Ventures.\n\nThe seed funding will primarily be spent on hiring talent across AI and growth, Wang said, as well as toward Ditto's marketing. The company has 10 staffers and has raised a total of $9.5 million to date. Ditto launched its product in early 2025.\n\nDitto isn't the only AI dating app gaining momentum right now.\n\nOther startups like Sitch, Known, and Amata have raised millions for similar products that pitch AI-powered matchmaking as the new alternative to swiping through profiles. Dating app mainstays like Tinder and Bumble, meanwhile, are also testing the AI waters to reignite user interest.\n\nDitto's AI tries to determine whether two people would be a good match by using profile details, such as users' hobbies or interests, to simulate a date, Wang said.\n\n\"Would you guys have a good conversation? Do you guys have matched humor level? Do you guys have similar vibes and values?\" Wang said.\n\nThe dating startup world has a history of targeting college students as early users. For instance, Tinder's early success came in part from its marketing on college campuses.\n\n\"College kids are very adaptive to new technology,\" Wang said.\n\nThe app now has about 42,000 people signed up across several college campuses in California. With its recent funding, Ditto plans to expand to more college campuses.\n\nOne tactic that helps get college-aged users on board: parties.\n\nDitto plans to host several yacht parties across the US, beginning with a Valentine's Day party in Los Angeles (it hosted its first yacht party this summer).

    "description": "Disney announced it will appoint experiences chairman Josh D'Amaro as its next CEO, succeeding Bob Iger, who has already come out of retirement once.",
    "fullText": "Disney has selected its parks head as the successor to CEO Bob Iger. Now, the Mouse House has to hope that history doesn't repeat itself.\n\nJosh D'Amaro, a 28-year Disney veteran who's run the company's experiences division since 2020, will take over for Iger, who's retiring for the second time, on March 18.\n\nDisney announced the CEO succession plan on Tuesday, the day after posting first-quarter results for its 2026 financial year. Iger will remain on Disney's board as a senior advisor, the company said in its filing.\n\nD'Amaro was named CEO after a unanimous vote by Disney's board on Monday, Disney said in a statement.\n\nDisney's board chairman, James Gorman, said in a memo to employees that D'Amaro \"demonstrated a strong vision for the company's future and a deep understanding of what makes Disney unique in an ever-changing marketplace.\"\n\nAnother factor in D'Amaro's favor is that Disney's parks have become crucial to the company's success, as his Experiences division accounted for more than 70% of Disney's operating income last quarter. Under his watch, the division has grown to record profits and rebounded from the pandemic.\n\nD'Amaro beat out Dana Walden, who oversees Disney's entertainment and TV portfolio, for the top job. The two were largely seen in the industry as the frontrunners in the months leading up to the announcement. Walden will become Disney's president and chief creative officer on March 18, the same day D'Amaro takes over as CEO.\n\nOutgoing CEO Iger called D'Amaro an \"exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO\" in a statement.\n\nIt may be tempting to draw parallels between D'Amaro and Iger's first successor: Bob Chapek, who'd also run Disney's experiences business before becoming CEO in early 2020. Iger appeared to regret his choice of Chapek and seemingly undermined the man he called \"Little Bob,\" CNBC reported. Chapek's brief stint as Disney CEO was widely viewed as a bumpy, tumultuous tenure.\n\nDisney's CEO succession process was much more thorough this time. It was led by Gorman, a former Morgan Stanley CEO, who had successfully navigated his own leadership transition.\n\nUnder D'Amaro's leadership, Disney's experiences business has started to carry the company financially. The growth in experiences has been driven by nearly annual price hikes at Disney's parks, which have helped generate more revenue per guest.\n\nDespite those price increases, D'Amaro — a charming 54-year-old — has remained well-liked among Disney fans, some of whom have even argued that higher prices could reduce crowds, thereby improving their experience.\n\nHowever, some Disney superfans said they were skeptical that D'Amaro was a better choice than Walden, who has run the company's crucial streaming business and has strong relationships in Hollywood.\n\n\"You can only extract so much out of the parks,\" said Lucas Lozano, a Disney fan based in Texas.\n\nDisney superfan Shae Noble, who just renewed her annual pass to Disney World, said she's \"losing faith\" in Disney leadership as park prices rise and said she's \"nervous about leadership changes after what happened before,\" referring to Chapek.\n\nLozano expressed a similar concern: \"Let's not forget: Bob Chapek once was in D'Amaro's position before he was named CEO, and look what happened.\"\n\nD'Amaro will also have to win over Wall Street, which has been lukewarm on the Mouse House for the last few years. Disney's stock is down 1% over the past year and has lost a third of its value since its peak five years ago.\n\nD'Amaro's own fiefdom, Disney's experiences business, appears to be firing on all cylinders, though there are questions about how much more it can push up prices.\n\nDisney's direct-to-consumer business is a mixed bag. Streaming has become profitable and steadily added subscribers. However, Disney+ and Hulu's share of US TV viewing has barely budged for years, according to Nielsen data.\n\nDisney has a few ideas for jumpstarting engagement, including adding AI and short-form video to Disney+ after a deal with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. It's also working to transition ESPN into the streaming future.\n\nD'Amaro will need to look well beyond parks to set Disney up for success in the post-Iger era.",

    "description": "I feel lucky we got such a low, historically good mortgage rate on our home in 2020. We're already outgrowing it and want to move, but we feel stuck.",
    "fullText": "My husband and I bought what we thought was our dream home in 2020. It had everything we wanted as twentysomethings in the city — convenience, charm, great views.\n\nOver time, however, our needs have changed, and it's no longer the right fit for us. The only problem? We bought it shortly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when rates had plummeted to historic lows.\n\nIn fact, we locked in a 2.75% mortgage rate — so now we feel trapped in a house that no longer checks all our boxes.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love our house.\n\nIt has a beautiful view of downtown Cincinnati; it's within walking distance of a wide range of restaurants, bars, sports stadiums, and theaters; and it's an old, historic home with lots of charm.\n\nWe love the hardwood floors, the historic brick, the old (nonfunctional) fireplaces, the pocket doors, and the large roof deck overlooking the Cincinnati skyline.\n\nWe spend mornings out there sipping coffee and reading, and nights having beers and entertaining friends while enjoying the view.\n\nWe can even see fireworks downtown — from our bed! But all these perks came at a cost.\n\nYou've got to work hard to get those incredible views of the city.\n\nFrom street level, where we and our guests have to park, you've got to climb up 34 concrete steps to get to our porch. From there, you've got about 10 more steps to get to the front door.\n\nOnce you're inside, the house is split into three levels (plus a basement with laundry). That's a lot of stairs.\n\nAlthough our knees can take the strain for now, we're worried about how we'd come and go regularly when we're in our 50s and 60s. Some of our older family members are already unable to visit our home because it's simply inaccessible given their health.\n\nTaking out the trash is an annoying chore, and we struggle to carry groceries up to our kitchen. I'll never forget the time I dropped a 12-pack of Diet Coke and the cans went cascading down the steps like exploding slinkies.\n\nWe've also had issues with having new appliances and furniture delivered (and getting the old ones removed).\n\nWhen our old Great Dane had a surgery that kept him from walking, we had to have a friend help us carry all 220 pounds of him up those steps when we brought him home.\n\nThe steps are a big pain in the neck, especially when it snows, but there are other reasons we regret buying the house now, too.\n\nWithout a driveway or private spot, we must rely on street parking. Sometimes, the only open space is a quarter of a mile away. We feel even worse when our guests have to park that far from our home.\n\nWe've got a large front and side yard, which is a blessing in the city that we don't take lightly. However, we also have to mow that yard, part of which is a steep hill that ends at a retaining wall with a sudden drop to the sidewalk below.\n\nI've almost fallen multiple times — and I'd likely have gotten severely injured if I had.\n\nWe eventually paid a landscaping company $11,000 to plant easy-to-maintain groundcover that helps us avoid risking our lives just to cut the grass.\n\nAs we've gotten older, we've started to want different things: a quieter home outside the city with a little more land and a lot fewer steps.\n\nBut that 2.75% interest rate is really hard to let go of, especially with mortgage rates as high as they are. Last I've seen, they're hovering around 6%.\n\nAs a Certified Financial Education Instructor and personal-finance writer, I know just how much of a difference that makes long-term.\n\nFor instance, when I last checked, the median sale price for a home in the US was about $411,000. Assuming you put no money down on such a house, you'd pay roughly $193,000 in interest over a 30-year fixed loan with a 2.75% rate.\n\nAnd if that rate jumps to 6%? Total interest costs amount to more than $476,000 — that's more than the cost of the home itself!\n\nWhen I look at those numbers, I have a hard time agreeing to sell our home and buy another at a much higher interest rate.\n\nUltimately, my husband and I know we still need to move. All it takes is one broken ankle, and our house suddenly becomes an intimidating obstacle course.\n\nPlus, we want our older family members to be able to visit, and we'd like to enjoy the peace of a more remote location.\n\nTo move without a major financial impact, we're prioritizing purchasing a much cheaper home than our current house. By selling our house for a nice profit, and then buying something more affordable, we hope to counteract the higher interest rates.\n\nFinding a cheaper house that still checks all our boxes won't be easy, but we're in no major rush to move. When we bought this current house, we moved fast and impulsively.\n\nThis go around, we want to take our time and find a place that's perfect for us — perfect for us now and 20 years from now.",

    "description": "Disney parks veteran Josh D'Amaro will take the torch from CEO Bob Iger. Here's the memo Disney's board chairman sent employees on Tuesday morning.",
    "fullText": "Disney just made it official: Josh D'Amaro will be its next CEO.\n\nD'Amaro, the experiences chairman who's been at the Mouse House since 1998, will take over for longtime CEO Bob Iger on March 18, Disney announced on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Josh possesses that rare combination of inspiring leadership and innovation with a keen eye for strategic growth opportunities and a deep passion for the Disney brand and its people — all of which make him the right person to take the helm as Disney's next CEO,\" James Gorman, Disney's board chairman, wrote in a memo to employees, which was viewed by Business Insider.\n\nGorman added that D'Amaro \"demonstrated a strong vision for the company's future and a deep understanding of what makes Disney unique in an ever-changing marketplace.\"\n\nWhile D'Amaro's Disney's experience has thus far been limited to its Experiences division — which contains parks, cruises, and products — Gorman wrote that the incoming CEO \"has collaborated with some of the biggest names in entertainment\" while \"showcasing the power of combining Disney storytelling with cutting-edge technology.\"\n\nParks are a crucial pillar for Disney and generate the majority of its operating income. D'Amaro must manage the company's declining TV networks, which have been ravaged by cord-cutting, while continuing to grow streaming profits, which haven't yet made up the difference.\n\nDana Walden, the head of Disney Entertainment who was the other leading contender for the top job, is getting promoted to president and chief creative officer, Disney said.\n\n\"Dana is one of the most accomplished creative leaders in entertainment and has done an outstanding job,\" Gorman told employees.\n\nAfter two stints and nearly two decades as CEO, Iger will cede his role to D'Amaro next month and serve as a senior advisor until the end of the year. Iger's tenure will be remembered as a transformative era in which Disney bought Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel, and entered into the streaming and AI age.\n\nRead the full memo from Gorman below:\n\nDear Disney Employees and Cast Members,\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to announce that Josh D'Amaro, Chairman of Disney Experiences, will be the next Chief Executive Officer of The Walt Disney Company, effective at the Annual Meeting on March 18. Josh possesses that rare combination of inspiring leadership and innovation with a keen eye for strategic growth opportunities and a deep passion for the Disney brand and its people — all of which make him the right person to take the helm as Disney's next CEO.\n\nThis is wonderful news for all of us at Disney and I know you will join me in congratulating Josh on this well-deserved appointment.\n\nOver the past three years, the Disney Board has undertaken an exhaustive and disciplined process to identify and prepare the right leader for Disney's next chapter. Josh demonstrated a strong vision for the company's future and a deep understanding of what makes Disney unique in an ever-changing marketplace. He has collaborated with some of the biggest names in entertainment to bring their stories to life in our parks, showcasing the power of combining Disney storytelling with cutting-edge technology. The Board believes he is exceptionally well prepared to guide this global company forward.\n\nBob Iger, who has led Disney to unprecedented success during his nearly two decades as CEO, has provided extensive mentorship to Josh throughout the succession process, and will continue to serve as Senior Advisor until his retirement from the company at the end of the year. Bob returned from retirement in 2022 at the Board's request to stabilize the company and make it fit for purpose, and to prepare Disney for this moment with a strong leadership bench, including potential successors. He has achieved all of this and more, and the Board and I are deeply grateful to Bob for his longstanding dedication to Disney.\n\nWe also announced today that Dana Walden will assume the role of President and Chief Creative Officer of The Walt Disney Company, also effective at the Annual Meeting. Dana is one of the most accomplished creative leaders in entertainment and has done an outstanding job as Co-Chairman of Disney Entertainment since its formation in 2023. In this new role, she will report to Josh and work with him in ensuring that storytelling and creative expression across every audience touchpoint consistently reflect the brand, engage audiences at scale, and advance core business objectives — while driving enterprise-wide initiatives and translating vision into action.\n\nOver the past century since Walt and Roy founded this company, Disney has had a remarkable and storied history, built on creativity, imagination, and a unique ability to touch people's lives around the world. As we look to the future, we are lucky to have someone like Josh ready to guide this global company forward as CEO. We are also fortunate to have a deeply experienced management team in place, including Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman, ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, and the Disney executive officers. Their experience, judgment, and continuity will be an important asset to Josh as he begins this next chapter in Disney's history.\n\nAnd finally, after two years on the Disney Board, I can attest that this company's greatest strength is its people — the employees and Cast Members whose creativity, talent, and dedication bring the magic of Disney to life every day. On behalf of the Board and myself, I want to thank you for all you do as we prepare for this company's exciting next chapter. We are deeply honored to serve as your Directors.",

    "title": "10 easy Super Bowl appetizers you can make in an air fryer",
    "description": "With Super Bowl Sunday around the corner, it's time to build a roster of easy air-fryer recipes to help feed your guests in time for kickoff.",
    "fullText": "For any Super Bowl party, the air fryer is the real MVP.\n\nWith the Super Bowl just around the corner on February 8, it's time to build a roster of easy air-fryer recipes to feed your guests in time for kickoff.\n\nAir fryers have become a popular kitchen gadget, found in around two-thirds of US homes, according to market-research firm Circana.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to cookbook authors Todd Porter and Diane Cu-Porter, the writers behind Air Fryer World, about their go-to game-day appetizers for the air fryer, and also dug into popular recipes that can be made in the appliance.\n\nHere are 10 easy game-day foods you can make in an air fryer.\n\n\"You can definitely use the air fryer if you like crispy foods, appetizers, and chicken wings,\" said Todd Porter and Diane Cu-Porter, the bloggers behind Air Fryer World.\n\nOne suggestion they had for air-fried game-day foods is air-fried chicken wings.\n\n\"Wings are awesome in the air fryer! The hot circulating air makes them naturally crispy, but for extra crunch, use cornstarch for an awesome crust,\" they said.\n\nTo follow Air Fryer World's recipe for ultra-crispy wings, toss your slightly dried chicken wings with your desired spices and olive oil. Make sure your air fryer is pre-heated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit before adding them. When they're done, usually in under 10 minutes, toss your wings in your favorite sauce and put them on the table, ready to eat.\n\nAnother game-day appetizer is Air Fryer World's recipe for jalapeño poppers with bacon. To make them, start by stuffing hollowed-out jalapeño peppers with cream cheese and cheddar, wrap them in bacon, and cook for 10 to 12 minutes at 380 degrees Fahrenheit until the bacon is crispy.\n\nYou can also buy premade frozen poppers and use the air fryer to crisp them up, by following this recipe.\n\nTo make them, roll mini sausages or hot dogs in crescent dough and set your air fryer to 325 degrees Fahrenheit, according to this Pillsbury recipe. For an even cook, you want to ensure the pigs in a blanket aren't overcrowded, so you might want to make them in rounds if you're making a lot.\n\nHowever, they should only take a few minutes to get nice and crispy, so they'll still be on the table by kickoff.\n\nFrozen tater tots can easily be made in the air fryer by spraying an even layer with a little cooking spray and tossing them halfway through the cooking cycle.\n\nThen, get to work choosing your toppings. You can create a loaded tater-tot bar, with additions like sour cream, chopped green onions, shredded cheese, queso, store-bought salsa, or guacamole.\n\nIf you want to go the extra mile, sauté some bacon or chorizo in a saucepan and top your loaded tots to your heart's content.\n\nThese \"fries,\" which The Recipe Critic calls \"a low-carb, keto-friendly snack,\" pair well with multiple sauces, including ketchup, ranch, or even a spicy mayo. For a little added flavor, mix garlic powder or cayenne into your breading before tossing it with olive oil-topped zucchini slices.\n\nTo make, pre-cook your hollowed-out potato skins and place them inside the air fryer, skin-side down, according to one recipe by Air Fryer Eats.\n\nWhen they're almost crispy, fill them with your choice of cheese and stick them back in the air fryer for a few minutes. Then, top with bacon, green onion, or sour cream.\n\nWhether you choose to go classic Italian with your flavors or dip your cooked meatballs in barbecue sauce, making meatballs in an air fryer is much faster than a typical oven and will be just as delicious.\n\nAir Fryer World recommends placing an even layer of meatballs into the air fryer and baking them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for between 7 and 12 minutes until they're golden brown.\n\nYou can either bread your own shrimp, like this recipe from All Recipes, or follow the instructions on the back of most frozen coconut-shrimp packages for cooking them in the air fryer.\n\nServe with a tartar sauce or spicy mayo.\n\nAir Fryer World says that for perfectly crispy dumplings, you'll want to spray them with a little cooking spray before frying them. To get both sides evenly cooked, flip them over at the eight-minute mark and continue cooking for a few more minutes until they're done.\n\nServe with a little soy sauce and green onion.\n\nYou can make your favorite stuffed mushroom recipe as usual before air-frying, or go with Air Fryer World's recipe for cheesy stuffed mushrooms. Either way, moisten your air fryer basket or foil with cooking spray or olive oil and arrange your stuffed mushrooms evenly in the air fryer.\n\nPork sausage also works well as a filling, but you can also use spinach and cream cheese for a vegetarian twist.\n\nCook them at 360 degrees Fahrenheit for 6 to 8 minutes, then add the cheese and cook for another 2 minutes.",

    "title": "I moved from New York City to Charlotte for a better quality of life. I didn't expect to feel so lonely.",
    "description": "I moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, for a slower pace of life and lower costs. Although I found both of those things, I feel lonely in my new city.",
    "fullText": "After two years of living in New York City, I realized that, although I loved life in the Big Apple, I wasn't fond of the exorbitant cost of living.\n\nMy days in the city were busy — think last-minute Broadway tickets, venturing out to Brooklyn for my photojournalism class, and bottomless brunches that turned into all-day affairs. Still, I found that leaving my apartment was costly, and I knew I needed a change.\n\nSo, moving to Charlotte, North Carolina, seemed like a practical decision. My dad was an hour and a half away, the culture felt less cutthroat, and the cost of rent didn't make me cringe.\n\nAt first, the change was refreshing. I traded crowded subway cars for tree-lined streets and pricey rooftop bars for local breweries.\n\nI even went from paying $4,600 a month for a studio apartment in NYC to $2,489 for an updated one-bedroom apartment with tons of amenities.\n\nHowever, as I began settling into life in Charlotte, the slower pace that I craved began to feel isolating.\n\nOn paper, my job sounds exciting — telling people I'm a travel writer is an instant conversation starter. But behind the trips, Instagram-worthy pictures, and articles, most of my work happens alone.\n\nWorking for a small media company means I don't have coworkers, either. Aside from one weekly meeting with my boss, my days are quiet until I leave for my next work trip.\n\nLuckily, when I'm traveling on assignment, I'm rarely alone. From striking up conversations with crew members to befriending fellow travelers, I'm constantly meeting new people from all walks of life.\n\nThose interactions are among the most rewarding parts of my job, but they only happen a few days each month.\n\nPlus, I often leave these trips feeling drained, which makes it hard to put myself out there and build new friendships when I'm home in Charlotte.\n\nBack in New York, I already had established relationships, which meant I didn't feel like I was \"starting over\" whenever I returned from a trip.\n\nAnd although I've tried finding a community in Charlotte through networking events, friend-of-a-friend invitations, and coffee meet-ups, I realized that building genuine connections postgrad is a slow and painful process — especially when you don't have any built-in social circles from work.\n\nAlthough there's plenty to do in Charlotte, many of the events have started to feel familiar and repetitive, rather than exciting and new — especially after living in the city for over three years.\n\nAt times, I appreciate the quieter lifestyle. However, after a while, the coffee shops, breweries, and parks all seem to blur together.\n\nAlthough I was usually sitting at the same few bars in New York, I never knew what characters would stroll by outside, or what subway performers I'd see in transit.\n\nIn Charlotte, though, even small errands and walks with my dog feel mundane. The predictability of walking the same streets, seeing the same faces, and sitting in the same traffic on I-77 makes Charlotte feel a lot smaller than it is — and, at times, isolating.\n\nBuilding a life in North Carolina has taken longer than expected, and some days, the seemingly endless tapping of my lone keyboard amid the hum of my air purifier is deafening.\n\nHowever, I don't regret my decision to move here.\n\nMy partner and I can now afford a lifestyle that seemed out of reach in New York. We have space to entertain, and the lower cost of living means we can splurge on our hobbies, including our ever-growing Lego collection, traveling, or concert tickets.\n\nAnd although I haven't quite solved the loneliness part just yet, I'm trying to show up",

    "description": "Bad Bunny opened Gekko, a Japanese steakhouse in Miami, in 2022. Ahead of his Super Bowl appearance, I wanted to see if it was worth the hype.",
    "fullText": "I was surprised by the restaurant's location, which is far from the exclusive, low-profile celebrity enclave I'd expected.\n\nInstead, it's located across from Brickell City Centre, a buzzy, crowded mall with a wide range of retailers, from mass consumer brands like Bath & Body Works, H&M, and Apple to more high-end retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue, Richard Mille, and Porsche Design.\n\nIt is also next to a gas station, and traffic makes the intersection loud and chaotic.\n\nMaking the reservation online was easier than I expected, especially for a Friday night during Miami's peak tourist season.\n\nWhen I booked it — only a couple of days before I went — nearly all dining times were available for inside, outside, and bar seating, suggesting that either the restaurant wasn't a highly popular choice or that reservations weren't always needed.\n\nWhen booking my reservation online, I had to agree to a dress code that forbade athletic wear, shorts, tank tops, cutoff sleeves, and flip flops, as well as \"athletic- or beverage-branded baseball hats.\"\n\nI didn't find the dress code restrictive at all; I saw it as the restaurant's effort to keep out overly casual patrons and to make dining there feel like an event.\n\nSitting inside the restaurant, I could see how high-profile guests might feel at home in its intimate space.\n\nThe tables set around the perimeter of the restaurant were dimly lit. Booths in the back and private dining areas indicated that the place was designed with privacy in mind.\n\nAfro-house and reggaeton music played throughout the restaurant — it was loud enough to conceal nearby conversations but not so loud that we needed to shout.\n\nA three-sided chef's counter at the center of the dining space felt like a stage for them and their work.\n\nHowever, the sushi chefs weren't eccentric performers. Instead, it felt like watching masters of their craft artfully handle their exclusive ingredients.\n\nThe menu, which has five steak offerings, also includes a section devoted to five different wagyu options, ranging from the $120 4-ounce A5 Hot Stone entrée to the $598 4-ounce olive-fed \"Wagyu Experience.\"\n\nAside from the steaks on the menu, wagyu is also featured in other dishes, from appetizers like wagyu crispy rice, dumplings, and steak tacos, to surf-and-turf nigiri with lobster.\n\nI got the wagyu crispy rice, one of the restaurant's most popular appetizers. At $34, it's also one of the most affordable wagyu items on the menu, and it's meant to be shared.\n\nThe dish came with four pieces of fried rice squares topped with raw wagyu tartare and crispy capers.\n\nThe raw meat was the star of the show, with each rice square featuring a generous portion of the tartare. It had a strong, spicy, slightly acidic flavor that complemented the velvety, rich beef. The crispy capers were the cherry on top, and I found myself craving those more than the wagyu itself.\n\nFrom looking at Gekko's menu, you know what kind of crowd would most usually dine here, and what their tax brackets might be.\n\nItems on the menu feature ingredients like caviar and lobster, and don't shy away from using 24-karat gold leaf. I tried to pick as many of the glitzier dishes as I could while staying within a reasonable budget.\n\nFor my main bites — all two of them — I got the gold-topped otoro nigiri, which was $19 a piece, and the surf-and-turf nigiri, which featured torched wagyu and lobster, and cost $17 for one piece.\n\nWhile other nigiri pieces were half the price for a comparable portion, I went into the meal hoping to test whether the upcharge and hype were worth it.\n\nThe gold-topped otoro nigiri was silky and melted in my mouth. Even as someone who isn't the most well-versed in the difference between cuts of tuna, I could tell that the quality of the fish was unlike any I had tried at more affordable price points.\n\nI felt similarly about the surf-and-turf nigiri bite. The thin-sliced torched wagyu had a delicious smoky flavor, and the bite was velvety, with the wagyu's marbling making for a really pleasant texture.\n\nIf each bite wasn't the price of a full budget meal, I could've devoured a few more.\n\nIn trying out some of the most expensive items, I found that some high-end elements, like the gold leaf or the lobster, didn't play as much of a role as I expected for the price point, and that I would've enjoyed the dishes just as much without them.\n\nFor a total of $164 after tax and tip, I only got six bites of food: four in the crispy rice appetizer, which was labeled as an item to share, and one bite in each of the nigiri.\n\nThe total also included two drinks and dessert.\n\nWhile the bites were excellent and well-balanced, I felt some components of the dishes were just fancy for the sake of looking expensive and didn't add much to the dish for me, like the 24-karat gold leaf on the tuna nigiri.\n\nAt \"only\" $24, which felt reserved compared to some of the other menu items, the miso dulcey lava cake was the most worth-it item from my visit, and I wouldn't hesitate to come back just for it.\n\nThe decadent, made-on-demand dessert, which came with a 15-minute wait as staff prepared it, featured silky vanilla ice cream, shortbread crumbles, and icing printed with the restaurant's logo.\n\nThe cake itself had a crispy, toasted exterior and a rich, miso-and-dulce-de-leche filling that spilled out. Paired with the ice cream and crumbs, this dessert was the standout for me.",

    "title": "My husband and I got sick of boring nights of dinner and a movie. We got our spark back with monthly 'adrenaline dates.'",
    "description": "We needed a change in our marriage beyond boring dinner and movie dates. So, I created \"adrenaline dates\" and found ideas that helped bring us closer.",
    "fullText": "After five years of marriage, my husband and I were in danger of calcifying into the \"dining dead\" — couples who have nothing to say to each other over meals, dutifully chewing their food in dreary silence.\n\nLike many long-term couples, we'd gotten stuck in a cycle of boring dates: always a movie and dinner, where we'd talk about our kid or finances.\n\nWe adore each other, but at some point, it became easier to hit up the same theater and local diner or taco truck than to look for an exciting new spot or activity.\n\nBut familiar routines should be for the daily grind of work and parenting. For the one I vowed to spend my life with, I wanted more.\n\nDetermined to add more excitement to our date nights, I found myself reading up on adrenaline — and how high levels of it have been linked to increased attraction and arousal.\n\nIt seemed worth a shot to try to harness the rush and use it to feel closer and more attracted to one another. So, I started planning \"adrenaline dates\" that might do just that.\n\nTo start, we booked an escape room. Neither of us had ever done one, and my heart raced in fear of the unknown as we stepped into the dark, enclosed space.\n\nThough my brain knew we weren't actually trapped in a crisis situation, my body was rushing with adrenaline as we escaped from chains and deciphered clues as the clock counted down.\n\nFor our next dates, we raced around in laser tag, punched side-by-side in virtual-reality boxing, and hit the climbing gym to out-boulder one another.\n\nThe dates were fun and brought us closer, which only inspired us to push the envelope further. Later, we tried ax throwing and had a blast hurling the tools at a wood marker, splintering it as we went.\n\nWe visited a rage room, where we donned helmets and protective suits, grabbed baseball bats and crowbars, and started to shatter bottles and dismantle furniture.\n\nI was timid at first, hitting just one item at a time. By the end, I was smashing a dozen bottles to smithereens at once with the swoop of a baseball bat.\n\nAfter all the time we spend being careful, tiptoeing around coworkers, friends, neighbors, and parents, I love that we get to connect by feeling animalistic and reckless together.\n\nAs I flung heavy axes and smashed bottles, I could feel stress flowing out of my body and dissipating into the air. After these intense dates, I've never felt so relieved to fall into my partner's arms.\n\nThroughout these experiences, we felt joy and connection while creating special memories, which felt hard to do during basic dinner dates.\n\nPlus, \"adrenaline dates\" can range in activity level and cost, from playing suspenseful video games to riding rollercoasters.\n\nMany of our favorites have felt especially wild and destructive. Lately, we've been rock climbing challenging routes in Joshua Tree, bonding over the rush of fear and adrenaline while enjoying beautiful views.\n\nWe even try to schedule these dates every month on the full moon, so we can later kiss under the moonlight — it feels like magic and keeps us out even longer.\n\nThis story was originally published on January 5, 2025, and most recently updated on February 3, 2026.",

    "title": "Meet Disney's next CEO, Josh D'Amaro, who shares Bob Iger's birthday and fashion sense",
    "description": "Disney parks veteran Josh D'Amaro will soon take the torch from CEO Bob Iger. Get to know D'Amaro, who's been at Disney since 1998.",
    "fullText": "It's official: Josh D'Amaro is Disney's new top dog — or, in this case, mouse.\n\nD'Amaro, who oversees Disney's parks as its experiences chairman, was just chosen to succeed Bob Iger as CEO. Iger is set to step down on March 18, paving the way for D'Amaro to take over.\n\nD'Amaro is an \"exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO,\" Iger said in a statement. Disney's board voted unanimously for his promotion on Monday, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe incoming CEO has big shoes to fill, and much to learn about Disney's business beyond its parks, cruises, and products. D'Amaro will be tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.\n\nHere's what Disney fans, employees, and investors need to know about D'Amaro as he becomes CEO.\n\nD'Amaro, a Massachusetts native, shares a birthday with Iger, who is exactly 20 years older. He'll be 55 years old on February 10, as his eventual predecessor turns 75. The two also appear to have a similar fashion sense. Both D'Amaro and Iger regularly don sweaters over collared shirts, and have a penchant for jackets paired with white shirts.\n\nFrom childhood, D'Amaro was a Disney fan. He told the Orlando Business Journal in 2020 that his must-do Disney World ride is \"Peter Pan's Flight,\" which he said he and his siblings rode as kids — an experience he said he tries to recreate \"whenever I'm here.\"\n\nThe soon-to-be CEO studied business administration at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. He had transferred in from New York's Skidmore College, where he studied art and sculpting but had doubts about how he'd make a living, The New York Times reported.\n\nAfter graduating in 1993, D'Amaro worked at Boston-based Gillette for a few years.\n\nD'Amaro began his Disney journey in 1998, working at Disneyland as a business planner. Twenty years later, he became president of Disneyland, before moving from Anaheim to Orlando a year later to take the same position at Disney World.\n\nBefore that role, D'Amaro had worked on the park's business development, marketing strategy, and sales teams. D'Amaro also had roles at Disney World's Animal Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland — a valuable experience, given how crucial China is to Disney's business.\n\nOutside the parks, D'Amaro had also worked in Disney's consumer products businesses as a VP of global licensing.\n\nAfter more than two decades at Disney, D'Amaro was promoted to Disney Experiences chairman to oversee parks, cruises, and consumer products in early 2020 — at the most difficult time possible amid a pandemic.\n\nD'Amaro filled a role left by then-CEO Bob Chapek, who was eventually pushed out and replaced by Iger, who had retired.\n\nUnder his tenure, Disney has continued to expand its parks business, including announcing its plans to launch a seventh park, located in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\"For every one theme park visitor that we have in our existing experiences today, we believe there are 10 more out there that want to come and participate in the Disney experience,\" D'Amaro said in May at MoffettNathanson's media conference.\n\nUnder D'Amaro, an experiences business that slowed to a standstill during the pandemic roared back to life as Disney fans raced back to the parks after years of being cooped up at home.\n\nAs demand for Disney parks surged, so did prices. Park ticket costs have risen in each of the past four years, and profits, revenue, and visits have climbed as well.\n\nWhile Disney has received some criticism from fans for making its parks less affordable for middle-class families — with a slew of upcharges for fast-pass Lightning Lanes and costly food — those complaints don't appear to be hurting the company's bottom line.\n\nDisney's experiences segment just topped $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever, while its $3.3 billion in operating income made up more than 70% of the company's profit.\n\nAs CEO, D'Amaro must gain Wall Street's favor by pulling off similar feats in Disney's streaming, TV, and movie businesses. Disney's stock has fallen around 9% over the past year, and it's shed about 43% of its value from five years ago.\n\nAlthough another Iger unretirement and takeover is almost inconceivable, the longtime Disney leader has made clear that he's left the company on the right track, putting pressure on his successor.\n\nBoth the experiences and entertainment businesses \"have the ability to grow nicely into the future, given all the investments that we've made and the trajectory that we're on,\" Iger said on Disney's earnings call on Monday.\n\nIger also made it clear that his successor must be bold and make their own mark on Disney.\n\n\"When I came back three years ago, I had a tremendous amount that needed fixing,\" Iger said. \"But anyone who runs a company also knows that it can't just be about fixing. It has to be about preparing a company for its future and really putting in place, taking steps to create opportunities for growth.\"",

    "description": "As I've grown older, I've found myself living in progressively smaller cities. Each city, from Mexico City to Burlington, has been just what I needed.",
    "fullText": "I've spent my whole life exploring new places. Growing up, my family moved all over the US, from my birthplace of Cincinnati to Boston, Dallas, and various other cities.\n\nAs an adult, I've continued that trend, moving to progressively smaller cities over the years, before settling in my current home: a New Hampshire college town of under 7,000 people.\n\nI've never once moved because I disliked where I lived; in fact, each place was exactly what I wanted at that time in my life.\n\nOf course, there were logistical factors involved in my decisions, like jobs, relationships, and proximity to family. Like most people, though, my interests and priorities changed over the years.\n\nLooking for some adventure in my mid-20s, I moved to Mexico City, one of the largest metropolises in the world, with a population of millions.\n\nThere was always something new to experience, from restaurants to museums to day trips to spectacular ancient pyramids.\n\nAlong with all the adventures, however, came the chaotic quirks of big-city life. Traffic was often so horrendous that getting out of the city took some effort, and with that traffic came pollution — if the air quality was too poor, I had to limit my outdoor exercise.\n\nAlthough my time in Mexico City was exciting, after a few years, I was ready for something a little more laid-back.\n\nFrom Mexico, I moved to Washington, DC, a city with a population of around 700,000.\n\nI had good friends in the area, and it felt like a place with lots of job opportunities and tons of other young people starting their careers.\n\nI loved the endless choice of happy hours, fun outdoor events, and movies on the National Mall. Plus, it was great being able to leave my apartment and go for a run or a bike ride through Rock Creek Park, even spotting the occasional deer or fox.\n\nAfter six years, though, I began to tire of the buttoned-up happy-hour scene — and also the rush-hour traffic.\n\nI also wanted a home with a little more space, and given my income and the price of housing in the city, that would mean moving out to the suburbs, as many of my friends had done.\n\nThe thought of dealing with a daily commute into the city was enough to make me consider my options.\n\nBurlington seemed like a perfect fit: a lively midsize city with a population of around 45,000 and proximity to mountains, ski resorts, and lakes.\n\nUnlike in DC, I was able to get a place in town with a small yard, where I could plant a little garden and throw a ball for the dog I adopted shortly after moving.\n\nBurlington is a beautiful city with a large downtown pedestrian street lined with shops and restaurants. I loved spending a day hiking, cycling to the Burlington Bike Path, or simply relaxing on one of the town beaches.\n\nWhile there, I met my partner, and we frequently visited my family, who lived a few hours away in New Hampshire. After each visit, I found myself wishing I could stay a few more days.\n\nAfter six years in Burlington, we decided to move to Plymouth, New Hampshire, a college town of under 7,000 people. We've now been here for almost five years.\n\nThese days, I spend my free time playing with our young daughter, hiking with our dog, and enjoying any combination of biking, camping, paddling, skiing, fishing, and trail running — all just minutes from our house.\n\nWe were able to find a house with a spacious yard, where we now have a large garden, a chicken coop with three laying chickens, and plenty of room for our daughter and dog to run around.\n\nPlus, we can still easily walk to town to grab a meal, see a movie, or catch a concert with other families on the town green.\n\nMy late nights in Mexico City and happy hours in DC have been replaced with morning hikes, evening boat rides, and quiet dinners with friends and family in my small town.\n\nAlthough I never set out to live in a smaller community with each move, I've found that each environment has been perfect for my life stage.\n\nFor now, our current home is exactly where we want to be, but who knows what we'll need five or 10 years down the line? At this rate, maybe our next stop will be a cabin deep in the woods.",

    "fullText": "My mom died when I was young, so I grew up spending summers with her mom in South Dakota. I loved that time with her, but I often only saw her that one time of year. I lived back in Florida with my dad for the rest of the year.\n\nWhen my grandma was older, she embraced the snowbird lifestyle and spent half the year in Florida to escape the Midwest winters. I was already in my early 20s, but I was still grateful to finally live close to her, and I took full advantage of it.\n\nI joined her for church on Sundays, and we often went out to lunch. Even as a young adult, my idea of a good time was waking up early on a Saturday and going to yard sales with her to hunt deals together. I spent so much time with her that when she went back up north in the Spring, my entire social calendar would shift.\n\nShe always kept an eye on us, always snagging clothes on sale for my son, having us over for dinner often, and even helping me by watching my son when I needed to work or just get a haircut and couldn't find childcare. Looking back, she seemed like such a Wonder Woman to me that I didn't fully consider her age.\n\nIn her 70s, taking care of a toddler would have been a huge undertaking. But she always said yes when I needed help, and she really nurtured my son when he was with her. They went for nature walks together, drew pictures, and played games, which is what she did with me at his age, too.\n\nI can see more clearly now what a devotion of love that was, because I realize how tired she must have been after some of those visits. Even if my son was getting over a cold, and no one else wanted to watch him, she would. I think that was her way of rooting for me, because sometimes working and caring for a child alone felt impossible.\n\nHe was 8 years old when she died, so he was old enough to always remember her. I can tell by what he relays to me or what we remember together, like simply birdwatching with her binoculars on her ocean-facing patio, that the time he had with her left an impact.\n\nIf there's one thing I can see that my grandma passed on to me was how to spend quality time with those I love. That's because when I think of her now, that's all I can remember about her — all of the simple things she would do with my son or me that made us feel so special, loved, and seen.\n\nI'd like to think that, even though I grew up without my mom, I feel really lucky to have had her mom there for me as I navigated becoming a parent myself. In a way, my son experienced what it might have been like to have my mom as a grandma, and I got to have a part of my mom by my side, supporting me as a new parent.",

    "description": "The metals market is at a crossroads after a vicious sell-off in gold and silver.",
    "fullText": "It's easy to take a good thing for granted. Only once it's gone do you realize how special it was. Then you're faced with the indefinite uncertainty of whether you'll ever be able to get it back.\n\nNo, I'm not talking about being a modern-day Chicago Bulls fan after growing up during the Michael Jordan era, although I very well could be.\n\nI'm referring instead to the epic run-up in gold (+100%) and silver (+250%) that came to a screeching halt last week. It followed the \"don't know what you've got 'til it's gone\" playbook to a tee. Let's unpack the three phases:\n\nAlthough I wasn't invested in gold or silver during their parabolic ascents throughout 2025, I will cop to becoming numb to documenting their returns. The ease with which I settled into writing \"silver is up 250% over the last year\" without spitting out my coffee scares me.\n\nMy experience mirrors that of those who actually had money in the market. Complacency and euphoric sentiment are hallmarks of retail-investing behavior during unsustainable surges, and this episode was no different.\n\nDay traders, particularly those in China, rode the wave, and trend-following institutions followed. The use of options — which are popular with retail investors — created conditions that made the metals ripe for a squeeze.\n\nNo one was fooling themselves into thinking the assets were trading on pure fundamentals. But why would they get out when the gains were flowing so freely, even as overvaluation sirens sounded?\n\nThe more an asset goes up into overextended territory, the harder it falls. Silver's massive return gave way to a 36% drop last Friday, after President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as the new Fed chair triggered a sharp reversal of the so-called debasement trade.\n\nFor its part, gold dropped 11%. The commodities market was shaken to its core. It was the type of panic-driven incident where it feels like everyone's heading to the exits at once.\n\nWhen trading stopped for the weekend on Friday evening, investors were left alone with their thoughts for 48 hours, wondering how things could go once futures fired back up on Sunday.\n\nWelcome to phase three, where we currently reside. Trading on Monday was a mixed bag, before a recovery took hold on Tuesday.\n\nPeople are spooked and feeling uncertain, a sentiment that's being fueled by market pros urging people to not buy the dip, despite the knee-jerk gains.\n\nOne technical strategist says she sees eight or nine more weeks of corrective action in metals. Multiple investment chiefs told BI that it's an ill-advised time to buy back in, given the volatility.\n\nEveryone seems to agree that it's best to wait this one out on the sidelines. It'll probably be a while before we loop back around to phase one. But given the unpredictability of the market lately, I wouldn't count anything out.",

    "fullText": "It's been a rough few months for Palantir, but the AI software company looks like it's getting its groove back.\n\nExhibit A is the big stock surge Palantir saw on Tuesday, with shares popping as much as 12% as investors cheered its best quarter ever. Revenue came in at a record $1.4 billion, a 70% increase from the prior year. It also gave strong guidance for 2026, predicting $7.18 billion in revenue, ahead of expectations of $6.2 billion.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC on Monday, CEO Alex Karp said he believed the firm's financials marked \"the best results\" he was aware of in the tech sector over the last 10 years.\n\nIt's the kind of good news Palantir investors have been waiting for. The stock has been in the doldrums, sliding at the end of 2025 as the company attracted interest from short sellers and faced institutional selling pressure amid concerns about bloated tech valuations.\n\nWhile the stock is still up nearly 100% in the last year, shares were down 28% from their peak in early November through Monday, before the company reported earnings.\n\nAnd Wall Street has been floored by the latest results.\n\nPalantir's earnings mark the 10th straight quarter that revenue has accelerated, Morgan Stanley said on Tuesday. The bank lifted its revenue forecast for the stock for the next two years and reiterated its price target of $205, implying about 30% upside from the stock's current levels.\n\n\"PLTR is on course to reach $10B in revenue at the fastest growth rate and highest margins perhaps in sw history, underscoring its status as a clear AI winner,\" analysts wrote.\n\nBank of America concurred, reiterating its \"buy\" rating and $255 price target on the stock. Palantir's earnings could be a warning to other firms in the AI space that artificial intelligence endeavours need \"to come with real results,\" the analysts said.\n\n\"While the market's relationship with AI companies continues to be volatile, we see these results cementing PLTR's place as one which will survive and thrive in the chaos,\" BofA wrote.\n\nTruist called Palantir a \"Conclusive AI Pure-Play Victor\" in a note after the earnings.\n\n\"We view this momentum as further evidence PLTR is enabling AI adoption at scale for its customers, leading to discernible results,\" analysts wrote, adding that strong growth in Palantir's backlog gave them confidence about the firm's long-term trajectory.\n\nThe firm also reiterated its \"buy\" rating on Palantir and $223 price target, implying 39% upside from current levels.\n\nWedbush Securities' Dan Ives said Palantir's fourth-quarter results ended \"Another Robust Year from Messi of AI.\"\n\n\"Palantir is helping lead the AI Revolution into the use case phase as its AIP product moat is unmatched in our view,\" he said in a note. The firm called Palantir one of its top tech stocks to own in 2026 and reiterated its \"outperform\" rating and $230 price target, implying 44% upside.\n\nSome on Wall Street still see risks ahead for the AI darling, given Palantir's lofty valuation. Analysts at Jefferies said they saw potential downside given the stock's elevated forward earnings multiple.\n\n\"We view execution as strong, though at 39x CY27E rev, multiple downside outweighs fundamental upside, with more attractive stocks in our coverage,\" analysts wrote, reiterating their \"underperform rating\" and $70 price target, a drop of 56% from current levels.",

    "fullText": "As a longtime Costco employee, I always look forward to seeing the new items that come into the warehouse.\n\nFrom viral sneakers to delicious treats, here are seven of the best things I'm seeing on shelves this month.\n\nOne of the most unexpected — and talked about — items Costco recently released was the Kirkland Signature Nike SB Dunk Lows.\n\nThese sneakers, which are a collaboration between Costco and Nike, are only available at select warehouse locations and are pretty difficult to find.\n\nMy store didn't have any, so I drove 90 miles to a location in San Francisco. Although it's unclear if more will be released, I feel lucky to have snagged a pair.\n\nThis set of five Miu silicone freezer trays caught my eye as a way to make meal prep and portion control easy.\n\nThe trays, which come with lids for easy stacking, can be used to freeze soups, broths, smoothies, or even leftovers.\n\nThe RXBar strawberry peanut-butter bites —  made with real ingredients like peanut butter, egg whites, apples, strawberries, and dates — are a great on-the-go snack.\n\nEach serving is loaded with 8 grams of protein and 200 calories.\n\nThe Hefty 12-piece Shrink-pak bags are a great way to compactly store and organize bulky comforters, pillows, towels, or clothes.\n\nEach box includes 11 bags in various sizes and a hand pump to remove the air.\n\nIf you're looking for a unique way to express your love this Valentine's Day, Costco has you covered.\n\nThe macaron pops by Macarooz are beautifully decorated to look like roses and are made with real red-velvet versions of the classic treat.\n\nIt may be cold outside, but I'm already looking for ways to decorate for the change of season. Disney's delightful spring-themed train set caught my eye, and features classic characters like Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy, and Pluto.\n\nThe train has dainty lights that function on a timer, and even plays music.\n\nAmylu chicken-sausage breakfast bites are a great way to keep meals tasty and interesting. Each serving is packed with 14 grams of protein and 150 calories.\n\nThese can be found in Costco's freezer section.\n\nCostco was not involved in the sourcing or writing of this story.

We remain focused on serving our customers,\" founder Peter Rahal wrote on X.\n\nAttia was also named among 19 new CBS News contributors just days before the emails between him and Epstein were made public. CBS editor in chief Bari Weiss has since faced public calls to cut ties with him.\n\nCBS News and David Protein could not be reached for comment.\n\nIn emails from 2015 and 2016, included in the latest release, Attia used joking and familiar language with Epstein, including references to Epstein's \"outrageous\" lifestyle and a crude sexual joke.\n\nOn Monday, Attia issued a public apology, calling some of the emails \"embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible,\" and saying he was \"ashamed of myself for everything about this.\"\n\nAttia, 52, is a well-known antiaging and longevity expert with roughly 1.6 million Instagram followers.\n\n\"I am not asking anyone to ignore the emails or pretend they aren't ugly,\" he wrote on X. \"They simply are.\"\n\nHe said he was not involved in any criminal activity and said his interactions with Epstein had nothing to do with Epstein's sexual abuse or exploitation.\n\n\"The man I am today, roughly ten years later, would not write them and would not associate with Epstein at all,\" he said.",

    "description": "Longtime fund manager George Noble said the Fed under Kevin Warsh will keep fueling the forces that have boosted gold in the last year.",
    "fullText": "The metal market's tantrum in the aftermath of Donald Trump's nomination of a new Fed chief was wrongheaded, one longtime investor says.\n\nThat's because, according to veteran fund manager George Noble, Kevin Warsh is a dove who will keep adding fuel to the debasement trade, rather than the hawk markets have perceived him to be.\n\nNoble, the former director of the Fidelity Overseas Fund and founder of two hedge funds, said in a post on X that Warsh has expressed a desire to lower rates, continuing a trend that's boosted haven assets like gold and silver over the last year.\n\nGeopolitical uncertainty and waning investor confidence in risk assets spurred gold and silver to historic highs in 2025. Warsh's nomination spurred a reassessment of the debasement trade, but Noble doesn't see any reversal coming, pointing to a recent Fox News interview in which Warsh hinted at his dovish stance.\n\n\"The 'hawk' wants to slash rates by 200 basis points into a 'booming' economy,\" Noble wrote. \"That's not hawkish. That's pouring gasoline on a bonfire.\"\n\nIn Noble's view, the narrative that kicked off the precious metals plunge—that higher rates will boost the dollar and hurt the appeal of gold—collapses when you examine Warsh's history and statements from a macro perspective.\n\n\"The debasement trade isn't about who chairs the Fed, \"Noble said. \"It's about math. And if Warsh actually executes the plan he outlined on Fox News - slashing rates to 2% - gold at $4,500 is going to look like the bargain of the century.\"\n\nNoble doesn't think investors should rush to buy the dip in gold right now, given the extreme volatility. He speculated that gold and silver could still have further to fall and that investors should tread carefully.\n\n\"Let the market tell you where the bottom is. Then buy,\" he said.\n\"And when you do - favor the equities over the metals. The miners have lagged badly and offer better risk/reward from here.\"",

    "fullText": "A raft of online videos show parents serving up dinner without a single plate in sight, to the amazement of their families\n\nAppearance: Feeding time at the zoo, but for humans.\n\nI’ve just Googled this. Apparently a dump dinner is a make-ahead slow cooker recipe. Oh you poor sweet fool. Things have changed.\n\nPlease explain the new definition of dump dinners. I’d love to. For reference, please remind me how you prepare dinner for your family.\n\nWell, first I get some plates and cutlery, and I … No! Wrong!\n\nI don’t understand. Well, if you want to do a dump dinner properly, then the first thing you need to do is cover your entire dining table in tinfoil.\n\nI don’t like where this is going. And then you tip whatever you’ve been cooking all over it. No plates. No serving dishes. Just the fat wet slop of food on table.\n\nThis cannot possibly be a thing. And yet it is. TikTok is is now saturated with dump dinners, with parents posting videos of themselves hurling mountains of spaghetti and sauce straight on to their table so their kids can sort of dive into it with their hands.\n\nThis article includes content provided by TikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\n\nOh, so this is something that the kids have specifically requested? Nope. In almost all the videos, the children react with noticeable alarm, with some even screaming: “What the hell are you doing?”\n\nSo what the hell are they doing? Hard to say. One TikToker claims that their dump dinner is part of “Fun Fridays”, a tradition where they apparently do dumb stuff and post it on the internet for likes.\n\nIs it always kids? No. In one video a woman does it for her elderly mother, who yells: “What the fuck? Don’t you believe in bowls?… You’re a real lowlife.”\n\nThis article includes content provided by TikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\n\nDid this trend begin anywhere specifically? Older hands might look to traditions such as Maryland’s communal, eat-it-off-the-table crab boil – but at least those happen outdoors. Internet historians might also point you towards the “potato party” – a brief South Korean fad whereby groups of teenagers would pool their money, head to McDonald’s, order huge amounts of fries and then dump them all over their table.\n\nDo people do potato-based dump dinners as well? Apparently not. From all available footage, this seems like a strictly spaghetti-themed fad.\n\nSo it just appeared out of nowhere. It’s hard to say, but perhaps its inception comes even earlier, in fact. Don’t forget that, in the Magical Mystery Tour film, there’s a scene where John Lennon shovels spaghetti on to a woman’s table.\n\nThe Beatles: the first TikTok influencers. Yes, I’m sure that’s a reputation they would all be happy with.\n\nWhen will it all end? This is a TikTok fad, so expect it to die of natural causes in the next couple of weeks. The only thing that will hasten its demise is if some idiot attempts it with soup and ends up scalding their immediate family.\n\nDo say: “Dinner’s on the table.”\n\nDon’t say: “Don’t forget to like and subscribe.”",

    "description": "Nancy Guthrie, mother of beloved \"Today\" show host Savannah Guthrie, has been missing since February 1. Here's what we know about the case.",
    "fullText": "Nancy Guthrie, 84, the mother of beloved \"Today\" show host Savannah Guthrie, has been missing since Sunday, and authorities are investigating her disappearance as a crime.\n\nPima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said that based on the scene at her Tucson, Arizona, home, he believes this is a \"possible kidnapping or abduction\" case.\n\n\"Just call us. Let her go. Just call us. The family will tell you, there's no questions asked here,\" Nanos told NBC News.\n\nNancy Guthrie is the mother of \"Today\" show host Savannah Guthrie.\n\nShe has appeared on \"Today\" numerous times, including when Savannah called her on air in 2012 to wish her a happy 70th birthday. In 2022, for her 80th birthday, Savannah paid tribute to her mom on the show, calling her \"a truth teller, whether you really want to hear the truth or not. She's quick and she's smart, she's well-read, she's curious about everything.\"\n\nLast November, Nancy was featured in a segment where Savannah took a tour of her hometown of Tucson.\n\nNancy was last seen at her home outside of Tucson, Arizona, on the evening of January 31 after her family dropped her off there. She lives alone but has house staff.\n\nThe next day, Sunday, February 1, a friend called the family concerned when Nancy wasn't present for Sunday service at her church.\n\nAfter an hour of searching the home and property, the family called 911. Authorities say her cell phone and car were left behind. She has limited mobility and requires daily medication that can be fatal if not received within 24 hours.\n\nAuthorities said they don't know if Nancy Guthrie was targeted because of her famous daughter and are not aware of any threats to Savannah Guthrie.\n\nAlong with investigating tips, authorities have been searching for Nancy using drones, a helicopter, an airplane, search-and-rescue dogs, and volunteers. Nanos said on February 3 that possible DNA evidence had been found at the scene, though it could take several days to learn anything conclusive.\n\nABC News reported that investigators are focusing on Nancy's electronic devices to see if there is data that could point to an assailant or a specific time when the abduction occurred.\n\nSavannah Guthrie has been an anchor on NBC's morning show \"Today\" since 2012.\n\nBorn in Australia, she and her family moved to Tucson when she was young. She joined NBC in 2007, and in her time there before \"Today,\" she was a White House correspondent and anchored \"NBC Nightly News.\"\n\nSavannah has not appeared on \"Today\" since her mother's disappearance.\n\nOn Tuesday, she posted an image on her Instagram that read \"Please Pray\" with the following caption:\n\nwe believe in prayer. we believe in voices raised in unison, in love, in hope. we believe in goodness. we believe in humanity. above all, we believe in Him.\n\nthank you for lifting your prayers with ours for our beloved mom, our dearest Nancy, a woman of deep conviction, a good and faithful servant. raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in this very moment.\n\n\"He will keep in perfect peace those whose hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord.\" a verse of Isaiah for all time for all of us.\n\nA post shared by Savannah Guthrie (@savannahguthrie)\n\nGuthrie is part of NBC's lineup to cover the upcoming Winter Olympics in Italy; it's so far unclear if she will still attend.",

    "description": "As a med student at Stanford, I think about my mother, who knows very little English. I wonder how I could make patients like her more comfortable.",
    "fullText": "My patient set down his knitting sticks, leaned over, and said in Spanish: \"Wow. This went by fast.\"\n\nI thought he meant the movie we were watching. Ciro Guerra's \"El abrazo de la serpiente.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, answering in Spanish.\n\n\"La vida,\" he said. \"Pasó volando.\"\n\nHe was a patient I met as a volunteer back in college. Our conversations unfolded because I could meet him in his own language. Spanish turned a hospital bed into a place where he became more than a diagnosis. I heard about the life he shared with his late wife, learned of his children's hobbies, and, more than once, the story of how he finally won his mother-in-law's approval.\n\nThese early conversations led me to deepen my love of language as a medical student at Stanford.\n\nIn college, a medical Spanish course at Yale transformed how I understood patient care. We practiced explaining conditions and conducting clinical conversations entirely in Spanish. We studied health reporting from across Latin America and worked through practice cases involving linguistic barriers to care.\n\nThe class pushed my perspective beyond English and an America-centric system, giving me the foundation for global health work and health equity research that ultimately inspired my interest in medicine.\n\nNow, whenever I interact with a patient as a medical student, I picture my own immigrant mother, who speaks little English, in the exam chair. Would she feel safe? Would my words reassure her — or push her to nod along politely while hiding her confusion?\n\nTrust, I learned, is the real currency of medicine.\n\nOutside of my coursework as a medical student at Stanford, I serve at free clinics and vaccination drives, where many patients arrive alone, without caregivers who can translate. At vaccination sites, staff and professors call on me to step in as a translator.\n\nLast month, during a free clinic shift, I was able to speak my dialect, Fujianese, with a patient for the first time since coming to California. It was a humbling and emotional moment for both of us. I helped take her history and clarified the specific legal and insurance barriers she faced to the physicians. As she spoke through tears about her uncertainty and fears, I stayed with her while we connected her to community organizations working to secure alternative forms of health coverage for undocumented patients after her Medicaid coverage was dismantled.\n\nThe stakes are real. When language barriers stand between patients and clinicians, studies show more medical errors, delayed diagnoses, and lower use of preventive primary care.\n\nOn one of the evenings I spent with that patient at the hospital, who shared his life story with me, the overhead speakers crackled: \"The wards will be closed to visitors in 10 minutes.\"\n\nShortly afterward, one of the patient-care assistants opened his room door to check that we heard the announcement.\n\nI remember him saying, \"I think I'll be fine. My wife will be coming later.\" My patient then pointed at me. \"He can help me until she gets here.\"\n\nThe assistant's eyes met mine. \"That's wonderful,\" she said.",

    "description": "\"Poor Josh,\" said billionaire investor Nelson Peltz, about Disney's new CEO Josh D'Amaro.",
    "fullText": "Close to two years after losing a proxy fight to longtime Disney boss Bob Iger, billionaire investor Nelson Peltz is still a skeptic.\n\nActivist investor and Trian Partners founder Nelson Peltz said at a Florida event on Tuesday that Disney picked Josh D'Amaro as its new CEO because \"Iger needs a reason to stay on.\"\n\nPeltz said to expect an announcement from Iger saying, \"Josh doesn't know anything about the movie business, the entertainment business; therefore, I'm going to stay on and guide him.\"\n\n\"Poor Josh,\" Peltz said, with a laugh.\n\nD'Amaro's appointment as CEO was approved by Disney's board in a unanimous vote led by former Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, who managed his own succession at the bank.\n\nD'Amaro \"demonstrated a strong vision for the company's future and a deep understanding of what makes Disney unique in an ever-changing marketplace,\" Gorman said in a statement, and the division he leads was more than 70% of the company's operating income last quarter. Iger, meanwhile, called D'Amaro the \"right person to become our next CEO.\"\n\nIger will remain at the company in a senior advisor role until the end of the year. This is Iger's second retirement from Disney. He previously tapped Bob Chapek, who'd also run Disney's experiences business before becoming CEO in early 2020. Iger returned from retirement in 2022 after Chapek's bumpy, tumultuous tenure.\n\nPeltz waged a proxy battle with Disney to gain board seats in early 2024, while criticizing its streaming division's losses, unstable stock, and uncertain succession plans. He sold his Disney shares after shareholders voted to support Iger.\n\nPeltz said D'Amaro has his work cut out for him when he takes over on March 18.\n\n\"I hope he's given the opportunity to do it,\" Peltz said.",

    "fullText": "Prosecutors’ announcement comes amid a hardening of European attitudes to social media firms\n\nProsecutors have raided the French headquarters of Elon Musk’s social media platform X and summoned the tech billionaire and the company’s former chief executive for questioning as part of an investigation into alleged cybercrime.\n\n“A search is under way by the cybercrime unit of the Paris prosecutor’s office, the national police cyber unit and Europol,” the Paris prosecutors’ office said in a post on X on Tuesday, adding that it would no longer be publishing on the network.\n\nIt said in a statement that Musk and Linda Yaccarino had been summoned for “voluntary questioning” in April in their capacity as “de facto and de jure managers of the X platform at the time of the events”. Yaccarino resigned as chief executive of X in July last year.\n\nThe French prosecutors’ announcement comes amid a hardening of European attitudes to social media giants. A senior source in the Greek government told Reuters on Tuesday the country was “very close” to announcing a social media ban for children aged under 15.\n\nIn Spain, where the government is preparing a series of measures including a social media ban for under-16s, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, promised to protect children from the “digital wild west” and hold tech companies responsible for hateful and harmful content.\n\nSánchez said on Tuesday that urgent action was needed because social media was a “failed state where laws are ignored and crimes are tolerated”.\n\nThe Paris raid is part of an investigation launched in January last year into the suspected abuse of algorithms and fraudulent data extraction, which the prosecutor’s office said it had widened to cover complaints about X’s artificial intelligence tool, Grok.\n\nIt said the alleged offences it was investigating now included complicity in the possession and organised distribution of child abuse images, violation of image rights through sexualised deepfakes, and denial of crimes against humanity.\n\nOther possible charges included fraudulent data extraction from, and falsified operation of, an automated data processing system by an organised group, and operation of an illegal online platform by an organised group, the statement said.\n\nFrench authorities launched the investigation after the centre-right MP Éric Bothorel filed a complaint alleging that biased algorithms on the platform were likely to have distorted its data processing system and affected the kind of content it recommended.\n\nBothorel complained of a “reduced diversity of voices” and Musk’s “personal interventions” in X’s management since he bought it in 2022. Another complaint said the changes had led to a surge in “nauseating political content”.\n\nProsecutors said in November that they were expanding the investigation to include the behaviour of Grok, which allegedly engaged in Holocaust denial, advancing false claims commonly made by people who deny Nazi Germany murdered 6 million Jews.\n\nThe chatbot has since caused outrage by allowing users to “strip” clothed people, including children, in photos through AI image generation and editing. The EU has launched an investigation into its production and dissemination of sexualised deepfakes of women and minors.\n\nX has been approached for comment on Tuesday’s raid. The company said last summer it did not intend to comply with French prosecutors’ demands, which it described as “politically motivated”, and denied all allegations against it.\n\nX said it believed the investigation was “distorting French law to serve a political agenda, and ultimately restrict free speech”. It said it was committed to “defending its fundamental rights, protecting user data and resisting political censorship”.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday that the investigation was being conducted as “part of a constructive approach, with the aim of ultimately ensuring that the X platform complies with French laws, insofar as it operates on national territory”.\n\nDespite being described as voluntary, the summonses issued to Musk and Yaccarino are mandatory, but they are hard to enforce on people outside France. Afterwards, authorities can potentially place suspects in custody.\n\nEuropol said it supported the investigation through its European cybercrime centre and deployed a specialist to Paris for the raid. “The investigation concerns a range of suspected criminal offences linked to the functioning and use of the platform,” it said.\n\nThose included “the dissemination of illegal content and other forms of online criminal activity”, the pan-European policing organisation said, adding that it “stands ready to continue supporting the French authorities as the investigation progresses”.",

    "fullText": "New US-owned app struggled with a storm and was accused of blocking content critical of Trump – can it recover?\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m Blake Montgomery, writing to you from Doha, where I’m moderating panels about AI and investing as part of the Web Summit Qatar.\n\nI want to bring your attention to the impact of a Guardian story. In December, we published a story, “‘A black hole’: families and police say tech giants delay investigations in child abuse and drug cases”, about grieving families and law enforcement officers who say that Meta and Snapchat have slowed down criminal investigations. (The tech companies contend that they cooperate.) This month, Colorado lawmakers introduced a bill to compel social media platforms to respond to warrants in 72 hours.\n\nNearly two weeks ago, TikTok stepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life. It endured a major outage that stifled users’ ability to upload videos, which fueled a fierce user backlash over perceived censorship. Now it’s facing an ascendant competitor and an inquiry by the California governor.\n\nTikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The day after the deal closed, its new owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection.\n\nDuring the weekend that followed, the US weathered a fearsome winter storm and the killing of an American citizen by federal immigration agents. Both knocked TikTok off its feet.\n\nWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on. The app suffered severe outages as a result. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings. Many of those same users cried censorship as they tried to express their outrage over Alex Pretti’s death via TikTok and found they could not. Prominent personalities said they would leave the app.\n\nAfter days of outcry, TikTok issued a statement ascribing the problems to the snow, ice and cold. That did not stop California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, from announcing the next day that his office would investigate the app’s alleged suppression of content critical of Donald Trump.\n\nTikTok’s late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. Upscrolled’s founder said in a conversation at the Web Summit Qatar that the app now boasts more than 2.5 million users.\n\nWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well, though.\n\nElon Musk had more extensive ties to Epstein than previously known, emails show\n\nTesla discontinues Model X and S vehicles as Elon Musk pivots to robotics\n\nTwo dramas, both showing in New York, are highlighting how our collective anxieties about technology have shifted in the decade between their premieres.\n\nMarjorie Prime, now revived on Broadway but first staged in 2014, follows Tess (Cynthia Nixon), as she deals with the ageing, death and robotic recreation of her mother (June Squibb). The world of the play features “Primes”, android lookalikes of real people that attempt to emulate them for the comfort of those left behind, which Tess and her mother both engage with. Picture an Alexa, but it’s your dead husband, grandmother, etc. The play brings to mind the early worries about Siri, which debuted three years before the play. Since then, we’ve seen our own real-life versions of Primes: millions of people have digitally copied their deceased loved ones to varying degrees of uncanniness and success. Though its predictions are no longer far-fetched, the play remains moving. I found it touching.\n\nData, which premiered off Broadway last week, follows the talented young programmer Maneesh (Karan Brar) after he joins Athena Technologies, a clear analogue for the very real company Palantir. Maneesh is inducted into the company’s most elite team, data analytics, where he learns about clandestine work with the US government. He struggles with the ethics of the project. He wrestles with whether to expose it to the world in hopes of tanking it or keeping his head down. The play’s themes are quite familiar. They were playing out in headlines two days before I attended, and the Guardian has published stories about them.\n\nData is paced and plotted like a political thriller, more like House of Cards than Her. Seeing the two plays within a week of each other, I was struck by how much our concerns with tech have moved from the realm of science fiction into that of realism. Marjorie Prime is less literally concerned with tech, more with its emotional consequences. Data is about what it means to literally work as a software engineer. It seems unlikely to me that a play about the ethics of software in US bureaucracy could have sustained any tension in an era before this one.\n\nMarjorie Prime imagines a melancholy future; Data chronicles a version of the unpleasant present. The very real events of the previous year and Silicon Valley’s entanglement with the Trump administration loom over Data, for better and for worse. The play could not be more timely; it may feel dated by the end of year. Watching it felt like reading a yarn in the Wall Street Journal (or the Guardian, if I’m flattering myself).\n\nI am curious to observe which play ages better. Data serves as a real-time, red-hot record of our current moment, which may cool quickly. During the play, I was intrigued by some of its villains’ seemingly nefarious arguments in favor of the company’s work. What if the main character exposes the evil in the press and nothing happens, as his boss says? I have been part of multiple news cycles where that has been the case. What will plucky 22-year-old Maneesh do then? The question presents a more interesting, nuanced response to reality than Maneesh’s black-and-white, do-or-die plan to blow things up. By contrast, Marjorie Prime’s sentient artificial intelligence acts as a vehicle to discuss the age-old grief of a parent’s death and its aftermath.\n\nThe central question that both plays ask is not, in the end, one explicitly about technology, but about how to keep living beneath crushing weight. In Marjorie Prime, Tess struggles with the repetitiveness of her days and the robotic, constant reminder of her mother. She eventually succumbs to her despair, replaced by a robot herself, which torments her grieving husband with its pale simulation. In Data’s final, devastating scene, the secondary hero, Riley (Sophia Lillis, who gives the play’s best performance), asks how she can just go back to work, plagued as she is by moral concerns but trapped by monetary need, after failing to stop the company’s work. She trembles as her phone beeps, reminding her she’s late for her next meeting.\n\nWhat is Moltbook? The strange new social media site for AI bots\n\nThe slopaganda era: 10 AI images posted by the White House – and what they teach us\n\nApple reports record iPhone sales as new lineup reignites worldwide demand\n\nSouth Korea’s ‘world-first’ AI laws face pushback amid bid to become leading tech power\n\nCan you guess our screen time?

    "fullText": "Pearson, Experian and others fall sharply after startup unveils software to automate a range of professional services\n\nEuropean publishing and legal software companies have suffered sharp declines in their share prices after the US artificial intelligence firm Anthropic revealed a tool for use by companies’ legal departments.\n\nAnthropic, the company behind the chatbot Claude, said its tool could automate legal work such as contract reviewing, non-disclosure agreement triage, compliance workflows, legal briefings and templated responses.\n\nShares in the UK publishing group Pearson fell by 4% on the news, and shares in the information and analytics company Relx plunged 14%. The software company Sage lost 5.5% in London and the Dutch software company Wolters Kluwer lost 10.5% in Amsterdam.\n\nShares in the London Stock Exchange Group fell by 8.5%, its biggest drop in almost five years, and the credit reporting company Experian dropped by 8.9% in London, amid fears over the impact of AI on data companies.\n\nEurope’s media stocks index is set for the biggest daily fall since March 2020, down 5%. Nasdaq-listed Thomson Reuters’ shares plummeted 14.2%.\n\nThe FTSE 100 had hit a record high on Tuesday morning but the sell-off dragged the blue chip index into the red.\n\nAnthropic said the plugin did not provide legal advice. “AI-generated analysis should be reviewed by licensed attorneys before being relied upon for legal decisions,” the startup said.\n\nThe company also announced a number of other open-source tools to automate a range of professional activities, including sales and customer support.\n\nAnthropic was founded in 2021 by Dario Amodei, its chief executive, and other former staff members from OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT.\n\n“Anthropic launched new capabilities for its Cowork to the legal space, heightening competition within the space,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note on Thomson Reuters. “We view this as a sign of intensifying competition, and thus a potential negative.”\n\nThe share price declines deal another severe blow to Nick Train, one of the UK’s most high-profile fund managers, whose firm Lindsell Train has run Finsbury Growth & Income Trust since 2000. The trust’s four largest holdings are Sage, Experian, London Stock Exchange and Relx and its shares fell more than 5% on Tuesday.\n\nTrain apologised again for the “dire” performance of the investment trust at its annual meeting last month, after surviving a vote on its future. The FTSE 250-listed company is the worst-performing UK equity income trust over one year and five years.\n\nThe news will reignite fears of job losses caused by the AI boom. Clifford Chance, one of the largest international law firms, said in November it was reducing the number of business services staff at its London base by 10%, citing increased use of AI as a factor behind the decision.\n\nAlong with factory jobs that can be automated, office-based jobs are seen as vulnerable to advances in AI – computer systems that perform cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence.\n\nThe UK is losing more jobs than it is creating as companies adopt more AI tools, and is being hit harder than rival large economies, according to a study by Morgan Stanley.\n\nMore than a quarter (27%) of UK workers are worried their jobs could disappear in the next five years as a result of AI, a recent survey of thousands of employees showed. It found that British businesses reported an average 11.5% increase in productivity aided by AI. US businesses reported similar gains, but created more jobs than they cut.\n\nIn his annual Mansion House speech last month, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said AI could destroy swathes of jobs in the capital. He said London was “at the sharpest edge of change” because of its reliance on white-collar workers in the finance and creative industries, and professional services such as law, accounting, consulting and marketing.\n\nLiz Kendall, the technology secretary, has also warned that “some jobs will go”, as she announced plans to train up to 10 million British workers, including members of the cabinet, in basic AI skills by 2030.\n\nLindsell Train and Nick Train have been contacted for comment.",

    "fullText": "A recent update from Anthropic has sparked a rush for the exits in a corner of the tech sector.\n\nThe AI juggernaut recently rolled out a new plugin for its Claude Cowork AI agent that can perform several clerical tasks, including tracking compliance and reviewing legal documents.\n\nAs far as AI updates go, it didn't make much of a splash outside the legal space when it was rolled out last Friday. However, it has triggered a sell-off among software and publishing stocks with ties to the legal industry.\n\nHere were the big movers on Tuesday:\n\nThe threat of AI disruption was factored into many Wall Street outlooks heading into 2026, but the market's reaction to Anthropic's update makes it clear investors are highly skittish about disruption from AI agents.\n\nThe field is crowded, but Claude stands out as the choice of many industry professionals for legal and financial analysis. Famed short-seller Andrew Left told Business Insider last year that he has used it for research for his upcoming court case.\n\nOf the three software stocks, only LegalZoom operates exclusively in the legal industry, helping simplify tasks for customers through guides and access to independent attorneys. British IT conglomerate RELX owns the legal data and analytics platform LexisNexis, while Thomson Reuters's exposure is through its ownership of legal research platform Westlaw.\n\nThe stocks have struggled so far in 2026, with declines of at least 20% year-to-date. Each one began the year with a gradual decline that sharply accelerated following the release of Anthropic's legal plugins.\n\nInvestor confidence in the legal publishing industry may be further compromised as these advances continue. Many venture capital firms rushed to fund legal tech startups in 2025, making it clear that they believe in the power of these AI-forward companies to further disrupt the industry.",

    "description": "Moltbook and OpenClaw are generating lots of buzz right now — but cybersecurity researchers have some concerns.",
    "fullText": "OpenClaw and Moltbot are the talk of the tech town right now, but cybersecurity researchers have flagged some concerns that you might want to think about.\n\nOpenClaw — first known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot, all in the same week — has got the tech world buzzing thanks to its abilities to autonomously perform tasks like managing a user's schedule.\n\nMeanwhile, Moltbook has gone viral for its Reddit-style social network, where AI agents post and interact with one another. No humans allowed — apart from observing.\n\nBut as the tech world memed about the two latest AI talking points and Elon Musk pondered aloud if Moltbook heralded the \"very early stages of the singularity,\" multiple security researchers have been ringing the alarm bells about more immediate risks.\n\nOpenClaw runs locally on a user's computer and operates as a digital assistant that plugs into apps like Telegram and WhatsApp.\n\nTo do so, it requires access to users' files, credentials, passwords, browser history, and more.\n\nThat could be particularly risky for so-called \"prompt injections,\" a type of attack in which an AI encounters hidden instructions on web pages, which could trick it into doing things like sharing private information or publishing on social media.\n\n\"Due to the level of access required, the data could contain very sensitive information, which amplifies the risk,\" Jake Moore, global cybersecurity specialist at ESET, told Business Insider.\n\nTheoretically, any large language model is at risk of prompt injections. However, OpenClaw's ability to \"remember\" interactions from weeks ago creates additional risk, the cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks said in a Friday blog post, because the AI assistant could ingest malicious instructions and execute them later.\n\nThe security risks aren't just hypothetical.\n\nJamieson O'Reilly, the founder of Dvuln, a company that finds cybersecurity weaknesses, likened a misconfiguration he discovered on OpenClaw to hiring a butler to manage your life — only to return home to find the front door wide open and \"your butler cheerfully serving tea to whoever wandered in off the street.\"\n\nGary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and longtime skeptic of AI hype, was more explicit about the security risks in his latest newsletter, published Sunday.\n\n\"OpenClaw is basically a weaponized aerosol, in prime position to fuck shit up, if left unfettered,\" he wrote.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw, said in a Monday X post that he had been working to make the service \"more secure.\" He did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nMoltbook's name is inspired by OpenClaw's first rebrand, and they both have lobster logos — but the two are not formally affiliated.\n\nThe site is, however, mostly populated by AI agents built on top of OpenClaw. And, like OpenClaw, researchers also say they have found security holes in Moltbook.\n\nO'Reilly, the Dvuln founder, said in a Saturday X post that Moltbook had been \"exposing their entire database with no protection,\" and that it would \"allow anyone to post on behalf of any agents.\"\n\nMatt Schlicht, the creator of Moltbook and CEO of the startup Octane AI, replied that he was looking into it, and O'Reilly later said the issue had been patched.\n\nHowever, on Monday, cybersecurity company Wiz said its researchers had hacked a \"misconfigured\" Moltbook database in under 3 minutes, exposing 35,000 email addresses and private messages between agents. The company added that it disclosed it to Moltbook, who secured the flaw \"within hours.\"\n\nSchlicht could not be reached for comment.\n\nAndrej Karpathy, an OpenAI cofounder who coined the term \"vibe coding,\" said in a Saturday X post that Moltbook was \"genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\"\n\nOn Saturday, he provided some caveats in a follow-up post. He appeared to describe the site as a \"dumpster fire\" and advised caution because \"it's way too much of a wild west and you are putting your computer and private data at a high risk.\"\n\nThe security issues reflect a long-running concern about apps built using vibe coding, with Schlicht writing last week that he \"didn't write one line of code\" for Moltbook and that \"AI made it a reality.\"\n\nAnd for OpenClaw, it's a reminder that there is often a privacy and security trade-off when an app gets access to sensitive information to deliver better service.\n\nO'Reilly, who says he is now helping OpenClaw identify security issues because he believes in its mission, told Business Insider that users could take technical steps to reduce the risk of using an agent that requires root-level access, such as running it on a separate machine and carefully monitoring it.\n\nHowever, for any such system, the \"risk will never be zero,\" he said. In his view, the biggest issue is that most people are used to downloading apps from Google or Apple's app stores, which are heavily vetted before being made available to consumers.\n\n\"They've downloaded hundreds of apps before, so why should this one be any different? That thinking is fundamentally flawed,\" he said.",

    "description": "An alleged scheme involving a man posing as an off-duty airline crew member has exposed serious flaws in airport security, aviation experts warn.",
    "fullText": "A Canadian man got hundreds of free flights on multiple US carriers by allegedly posing as an off-duty airline pilot or flight attendant.\n\nProsecutors say he never paid for the tickets, but experts warn the real concern isn't the free rides — it's the flawed security measures he exposed.\n\nA federal indictment in Hawaii says 33-year-old Dallas Pokornik was a flight attendant at a Toronto-based airline from 2017 to 2019. From 2020 to 2024, he allegedly used a fake identification badge based on his former company to secure free tickets on three US airlines headquartered in Honolulu, Chicago, and Fort Worth.\n\nMost airlines allow their crew and other staff to fly for free or at a highly discounted rate if a seat is available.\n\nCourt documents also state that Pokornik sometimes requested access to the cockpit jump seat — a spare seat in the cockpit reserved for industry professionals like regulators or off-duty pilots. They do not clarify whether Pokornik, who is not a pilot, ever gained access to a flight deck.\n\nPokornik's actions, as alleged by the Justice Department, suggest several guardrails — including airline ID verification, airport credential checks, and crew-only boarding procedures — may have been bypassed across multiple carriers.\n\n\"Everybody loves to hate the airlines, and it's fun to think they got ripped off,\" aviation analyst Henry Harteveldt told Business Insider. \"But the point is that this man's actions are extremely serious. A potential terrorist could see this and think, 'Look, there's a loophole.'\"\n\nThe case gained national attention after Pokornik's extradition from Panama in January. He is charged with two counts of wire fraud, to which he pleaded not guilty, and faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted.\n\nThe case has been described online as a real-life \"Catch Me If You Can,\" a 2002 movie where Leonardo DiCaprio plays a pilot impersonator cashing in fraudulent checks. That story was set in the 1960s, while Pokornik's alleged exploits occurred in a post-9/11 aviation environment with far more security.\n\nHarteveldt said this case points to weaknesses in airline verification systems that rely heavily on mutual trust between carriers to ensure that only active, vetted crew members are granted credentials.\n\nAirport personnel would have had to accept Pokornik's fake credentials multiple times without properly checking databases, Harteveldt added, and it remains unclear how he consistently obtained boarding documents to pass through security.\n\nRetired airline pilot Mark Stephens told Business Insider that the alleged request to sit in the jump seat is particularly concerning, given that the flight deck is one of the aviation industry's most tightly controlled spaces.\n\n\"If another airline's crewmember wanted to jump seat in my cockpit, they had to provide me their pilot's license, a company badge, and a valid medical,\" Stephens said. \"He would have had to come up with all of those; that's why this is so baffling to me.\"\n\nThe potential consequences of system slips were highlighted in October 2023, when an off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot in the cockpit jump seat of a Horizon Air flight attempted to shut down the engines mid-flight during a mental health crisis. The crew restrained him and landed safely.\n\nIt's unclear which airlines Pokornik allegedly defrauded, but the US cities named by prosecutors correspond to Hawaiian Airlines, United Airlines, and American Airlines. Porter Airlines is headquartered in Toronto.\n\nUnited declined to comment. The other airlines, as well as Pokornik's attorneys and the US Attorney's Office, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nStephens said it's difficult to determine how Pokornik got from the curb to the gate with just a fake airline badge since airline staff travel is a credentialed benefit that typically requires a verified employee profile, a valid employee number, and confirmation that the person is actively employed.\n\nAirports have a security screening line reserved for eligible pilots and flight attendants, called the Known Crew Member (KCM) lane. The process is generally more relaxed than for standard passenger screening because crew members should have already undergone extensive background checks, Harteveldt said.\n\nKCM is limited to enrolled US airlines and is not available to foreign carriers, and prosecutors say Pokornik was impersonating a crew member at a Canadian airline.\n\nTheoretically, he could have used fake credentials at the pre-security check-in counter to obtain legitimate boarding passes and clear the regular passenger checkpoint. Airline employees flying on standby often receive temporary documents that allow them to clear security before a seat is assigned.\n\nPossible explanations include a computer error, a stolen identity belonging to someone active at the airline, or help from someone on the inside.\n\nAt the gate, Stephens said, Pokornik would have needed an agent to verify his credentials before boarding if he wanted a jump seat. This usually involves the gate agent confirming eligibility in the airline's system.\n\nStephens added that it's possible the booking system didn't contain Pokornik's photo, since his badge was from a different airline: \"A universal positive ID system that matches the badge presented at the time of boarding to a verified employee profile would be one solution,\" he said.\n\nEven if Pokornik never made it into a cockpit, the scale of the incident is alarming, Harteveldt said.\n\nProsecutors say Pokornik took hundreds of flights across three airlines over several years — suggesting he wasn't exploiting a single weak system, but rather repeatedly navigating independent airline and airport security processes without being stopped.\n\n\"Airlines should be grateful that these weaknesses were exposed in a relatively benign manner, but should be alarmed that these weaknesses exist at all,\" Harteveldt said. \"Safety agencies should ask [Pokornik] how he did this; his experience could help prevent this type of breach from happening again.\"",

    "title": "The Nintendo Switch 2 Can Handle AAA Games Better Than People Think",
    "description": "Resident Evil still scared the crap out of me on the Switch 2.",
    "fullText": "When the Nintendo Switch 2 came out, I was a bit skeptical that such a thin and light device could handle AAA, blockbuster games. But when I actually got it in my hands and reviewed it, I was impressed to see that it was capable of running demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077 just as well as my Steam Deck could. Since then, it's continued to prove itself by capably running other beefy games like Star Wars Outlaws and, more recently, Final Fantasy VIII Remake. The catch? All these games were all a few years old, and with the exception of Star Wars Outlaws, they all had versions for last-generation systems.\n\nAs we started moving into 2026, I was still left wondering how well the Switch 2 will be able to keep up with brand new AAA titles as they come out. Based on some hands-on time I've had with two upcoming technical showpieces, the answer is \"very well.\"\n\nLast week, I attended a preview event hosted by Nintendo where I got to play the Switch 2 editions for Super Mario Bros. Wonder and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, as well as the brand new game, Mario Tennis Fever. All of these looked great, but they didn't really push any kind of graphical boundaries. My real interest was in the two third-party titles at the event, both of which were being shown off by Capcom.\n\nThe first was Pragmata, an upcoming sci-fi shooter that, most importantly for our purposes, uses the notoriously performance-hungry RE Engine. When it works, this engine is great for fidelity in particular lighting, but optimizing for the thing has been a nightmare on even powerful systems, as evidenced by frame rate-wrecking bugs continually popping up in games like Monster Hunter Wilds. While that's an open-world game, meaning it has to render a lot at once, Pragamata itself is no slouch, and I figured it would make a perfect test case for whether the Switch 2 can handle not just older AAA releases, but new ones, too.\n\nThe verdict? If you had told me this thing were running on a PS5, I'd believe you. I played the game in both handheld and docked mode, and on the TV, it was easy to forget everything but the gameplay and just sink right into the experience. Textures were smooth, the resolution seemed to be at least a solid 1080p, if not higher, and I would say the frame rate was actually above 30 fps. I don't have any specific numbers—I wasn't able to test these settings at the event, and Capcom couldn't tell me any details—but my thought is that even if the graphics had compromises to run on the Switch 2, they weren't noticeable and didn't hamper my experience. Hardware snobs who absolutely need a 4K resolution and at least 60 fps might want to stick to PC, but results like this aren't too far behind what the other home consoles can do with the newest games and are a noticeable improvement on how the original Switch handled AAA games.\n\nThere, blockbuster games were often either pixelated and slow, or ran on the cloud and required an internet connection. Compromises like these were understandable there, but it sometimes meant you were focusing so much on the game's technical issues that it was difficult to get immersed in the gameplay, assuming developers even bothered to port a game to Switch in the first place.\n\nNone of these were problems when I was playing Pragmata on the Nintendo Switch 2. Controls were snappy, environments were easy to parse, and most impressively, the hair was on point! OK, that might sound a bit odd, but hear me out: It's actually super impressive.\n\nNaturalistic long hair has been a nightmare for video games to render until very recently, which is why if you've ever played a video game with a customizable character, the hair options often cap out at medium length, or are very stylized. Pragmata, meanwhile, makes a point of having a companion character at your side at all times who has messy, frizzy, unkempt hair almost down to her waist. And each individual strand of that hair has physics on it, so it moves realistically rather than as one big blob.\n\nThat takes a lot of processing power to simulate, and is clearly meant to be a bit of a technical brag for Capcom. But while the devs' work optimizing the game to handle this hair is definitely to be commended, it's also reassuring that the Nintendo Switch 2 didn't buckle at all while doing this. In fact, it seemed like it still had horsepower to spare, based on how consistent the gameplay was. I encountered no frame rate dips, which was a lifesaver in pitched battles.\n\nThe only noticeable quality loss was when I played in handheld mode, which seemed to reduce the resolution to about 720p. Here, the game looked a bit pixelated, but given that the PS5 and Xbox don't even have an option to go portable, it's a compromise I'm willing to accept. In a fair, TV-to-TV comparison, I'm happy to report that Pragmata on the Switch 2 is a more than acceptable way to experience the game, even right down to that folicular fidelity.\n\nPragmata is a pretty game, no doubt, but the real technical showpiece at the preview event was Resident Evil Requiem. Also using the RE Engine, if Pragmata is a strong indicator for how the Switch 2 simulates physics, then Resident Evil does the same for lighting.\n\nAgain, performance is smooth, but I'd say the resolution here is more definitively closer to 1080p while the frame rate seems a little lower than Pragmata's. Still, character models are detailed, and animations play out without any weird jitters. Resident Evil has made a name for itself on both of these fronts with its recent titles, so it's great to see these qualities preserved.\n\nBased on my experience with Pragmata, though, I expected this. What I didn't expect was just how realistic the lighting would be. Like the hair in Pragmata, realistic lighting is a bit of a performance challenge for games, especially now that many games are using ray tracing for their lighting, which means that lighting is calculated in real time using realistic pathing for each ray of light, rather than being \"baked\" into scenes ahead of time. This makes it easier for lighting to change on the fly and fall where a player might naturally expect it to, something that's important for Resident Evil, since the title uses it for gameplay. But it also puts a lot of strain on the system.\n\nI was a bit worried going into this demo, because while I knew the Switch 2 was supposed to be able to handle ray tracing, I wasn't ready to believe it until I saw it, especially when it was being used for more than set dressing. In the demo I played, there's a monster that can't follow you into the light, and poor lighting might make it unclear where safe zones were. But like with Pragmata, my technical skepticism quickly drained away, and I instead just sat and quietly played, immersed in the game like I would be on any other console.\n\nHere's the biggest bit of technical praise I can offer the Switch 2: Even in just a half hour of playing, Resident Evil Requiem on the Switch 2 still managed to scare the crap out of me. I left the event unsure of walking out into the dark night outside. If that doesn't tell you how bought in I was in just playing the game, instead of nitpicking pixelated character models or a wonky frame rate, I don't know what will.\n\nI may not have been allowed to capture detailed performance data at this event, but I left pretty optimistic about the Switch 2's ability to handle AAA games. For years now, gamers have come to accept that multiplatform AAA titles will come out on Xbox and PlayStation, but will usually either skip Nintendo or come out for it years down the line. That's because the Wii was much less powerful than the Xbox 360 and PS3, the Wii U was less powerful than the Xbox One and PS4, and the Switch was less powerful than the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. After the GameCube, Nintendo has always been at least a generation behind when it comes to performance.\n\nNow, it can finally stand toe-to-toe with its competitors again, just like when you had Nintendo's purple lunchbox in your living room. It may not be at the zenith of performance, but it's more than acceptable. I don't know how long this status quo will last—the next console generation is rumored to be facing delays right now. But for now, Nintendo owners can finally play the newest blockbuster games day-and-date with their Sony and Microsoft-owning friends, without needing to own a second system. That's great for developers and gamers, and should put anyone who just dropped $450 on Nintendo's latest at ease. You can finally pay attention to new AAA games as they come out again, and plus, you still have that handheld mode party trick.",

    "title": "What People Are Getting Wrong This Week: Will the Midterm Elections Be Canceled?",
    "description": "Let's talk civics.",
    "fullText": "Trigger warning: I’m going to write about the upcoming midterm elections—but if it helps, I’m not going to be partisan about it. This should be a pretty straightforward topic, but lately social media has been rife with speculation that the upcoming midterm elections will somehow be canceled. And while election-related fear-mongering is hardly new, it’s usually a dull buzz. This year, whether you blame exponential cultural polarization, social media echo chambers, or the rain, election-cancelation fears have grown into an unmistakeable roar.\n\nIt's alarming to be sure. But are the people who are worried about this stuff wrong, or was 2024 actually the last \"free and fair\" American election? To get some answers, I talked to attorney Chad Peace, an expert in U.S. elections law and a legal advisor to the Independent Voter Project, a non-partisan non-profit organization devoted to encouraging voters to participate in the electoral process. I started by asking Peace point-blank how likely he thought the chances are of the midterms being outright canceled. “Pretty close to 0% would be my guess,” he says.\n\nThe unlikelihood of midterm election cancelations comes down to how they’re structured.  Under the U.S. Constitution, states run their own midterm elections and are required by law to hold them every two years. While the Constitution and federal laws provide a general framework for how the midterms should work, their actual administration is handled by state and local governments. It is a highly decentralized process, and that’s by design. “It's very clear in the Constitution that the states have the control over the time, place, and the manner of elections, and the reason it’s so clear is to prevent the very concerns that we're [seeing] right now,\" Peace says.\n\nChad and I discussed several hypothetical scenarios (if not outright conspiracy theories) about how the elections might be canceled. To make this part of our conversation more scannable, I’m going to present it in Q&A format, with my questions in bold and Chad's responses in regular text. Remember, these are just the facts.\n\nThere could be some executive authority to change [election] rules, but there’s not really any executive authority to cancel them.\n\nI'd be hard pressed to find an executive order that's gonna cancel elections or really be enforceable against the states. At the end of the day, the states have extraordinary authority to conduct elections.\n\nEven under martial law, the states are going to conduct elections. Will it be an interesting situation? Yes. I don’t think it’s going to come to that level, but even during the Civil War, we had elections.\n\nThere’s no way to cancel them. Congress can do a lot of stuff, but at the end of the day, it’s very clear in the Constitution—and there’s a reason it was so clear—that the states have control over the time, place, and the manner of elections.\n\nIt would [also] be pretty hard for a state to cancel [its own] midterm elections. Could they have emergency authority and say, \"we really need to postpone\"? Yes. [There'd be] a fight, but eventually you’re going to have to have elections. Historically and constitutionally and within the laws of most states, elections will go on. Whatever side you’re on politically, I’m pretty sure the American electorate isn’t ready for elections not to be held. That’s pretty fundamental across voter ideology.\n\nThe narrow question of whether midterm elections will be canceled in 2026 has an easy answer: no. But that doesn’t mean the 2026 election cycle will necessarily be “normal.” There’s no way to predict how midterm elections might be affected by various congressional, state, or federal actions, and this uncertainty is the real fuel for the cancelation rumors. \"The real concern is what level of legitimacy do our elections have?” Peace says. “I don't think we're at the point where we've lost all legitimacy, and people are saying ‘these people aren't really our leaders.’”\n\nNo matter where you are on the political spectrum, these are strange times. But they aren’t the first strange times the nation has ever experienced. “Every time has its uniqueness, but I don't think [our current political climate] is totally unprecedented,” Peace says. He points to the protests during the Vietnam War as another, fairly recent example of significant political shifts in the U.S. “It reoccurs all the time in our history. It happens when you see significant political shifts and realignment.”\n\nNo one knew how the Civil War or the great Depression would end while they were happening, but elections still occurred, and we’re still here. “America and our electorate have had an amazing way of coming back to a place where we make it [through]. We make it, and we move on,” Peace says.\n\nIf you’re freaking out about the legitimacy of our upcoming elections, doomscrolling social media probably won’t help, but volunteering might. “Get involved. Go to your local registrar and say, ‘I want to be an election observer,’” Peace says—particularly if you’re non-partisan. “A non-partisan, independent person who is involved and aware and observing the facts on the ground, I think, has an incredible effect on assuring the electorate that things are legitimate and fair.”\n\nAlong with having an epic name and being an expert in US election law, Chad Peace is the executive producer of upcoming film Attack of the Killer Tomatoes: Organic Intelligence. This gives him way more credibility in my eyes.",

    "title": "15 Shows Like 'The Night Manager' You Should Watch Next",
    "description": "Ten years between seasons means you have a lot of time for streaming.",
    "fullText": "For all the talk about Stranger Things taking nearly a decade to produce just five seasons of television, consider The Night Manager: It took this British spy thriller 10 years just to get to season two. Luckily, audiences seem to have been willing to wait, as they show performed decently in the streaming ratings when it dropped on Prime Video earlier this year.\n\nThere's a reason viewers were anxious for more, even after such a long wait: Based on a John le Carré novel and starring Tom Hiddleston as Jonathan Pine, the series finds the manager of a luxury Cairo hotel running afoul of an Egyptian crime boss with ties to Dickie Roper (Hugh Laurie), one of the world's wealthiest and best-connected businessmen. Roper is a wildly charismatic, entirely amoral arms dealer and Angela Burr (the flawless Olivia Colman) is a Foreign Office agent on a quixotic quest to bring him to justice. It's crackerjack stuff.\n\nWhile you're waiting for a rumored third season, which hopefully won't take a decade, here are 15 other spy thrillers to keep you occupied. Stream The Night Manager on Prime Video.\n\nLen Deighton occupies a similar place in the literary spy canon as John le Carré, and here Joe Cole (Peaky Blinders) is cast as Len Deighton's lead anti-hero, unnamed in the novels, but known as \"Harry Palmer\" in various adaptations going back to the 1960s. Set in 1963, this show sees Tom Hollander's Major Dalby offer scrappy crook Palmer a deal: If he agrees to work as an intelligence officer, he'll get a ticket out of military prison. Naturally, his first case, involving a missing nuclear scientist, expands into a globe-hopping espionage adventure with impeccable period vibes. Stream The Ipcress File on Prime Video.\n\nThe best spy dramas have a grounding in truth (or feel like they do), so it doesn't hurt that A Spy Among Friends is based almost entirely on fact In the early 1960s, high-ranking MI6 operative Kim Philby (Guy Pearce) is revealed to have been a double agent, and is doggedly pursued by his former colleague Nicholas Elliott (Damian Lewis). The miniseries is framed around a particularly tense encounter between the two men, just as Elliott has been tasked with uncovering the details of his friend's decades-long betrayal. Stream A Spy Among Friends on MGM+ and Britbox.\n\nThis genre-bender has been a bit of a hit for Netflix—enough to have earned a second-season renewal. Keira Knightly stars as Helen Webb, wife of the Secretary of State for Defence of the U.K., and a secret spy in the employ of the mercenary spy organization of the title. She learns from her handler (Sarah Lancashire) that her lover has been killed, thus potentially blowing her cover, but luckily she has a hitman bestie (Ben Whislaw) to help her out. It's all deliberately pulpy, with a tongue-in-cheek self-awareness that lightens the tone. Stream Black Doves on Netflix.\n\nCinematic in scope, this new adaptation of the Frederick Forsyth novel is buoyed by brilliant casting: Eddie Redmayne plays the Jackal, a steely international assassin pursued by MI6 operative Bianca Pullman, played by Lashana Lynch (putting her experience as the new 007 in No Time to Die to good use). I'm not sure there's anything here we haven't seen in countless other spy thrillers (including, of course, the 1973 and 1997 film adaptations), but the performances and production values are top-notch, with each episode playing out like a tense mini-movie. Stream The Day of the Jackal on Peacock.\n\nWith nods to the great spy dramas of John le Carré, Slow Horses updates the setting without losing the thrills or the style of a time-honored genre. The “Slow Horses” of the title is a group of has-been (and never-were) MI5 agents—they’ve all made messes of their jobs, but are still seen as having some use, if only in dull administrative tasks. Naturally, the group (lead by Gary Oldman's brilliantly crude, flatulent Jackson Lamb alongside foil and spymaster Diana Taverner, played by Kristin Scott Thomas) finds themselves in deeper waters than anyone had expected of them. An adaptation of Mick Harron's novel series, the show has a sly sense of humor, balancing a cynical tone with a conviction that redemption is possible, if not easy. Stream Slow Horses on Apple TV+\n\nSouth Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook (Decision to Leave, No Other Choice) directs this series, based, like Night Manager, on a John le Carré novel, bringing an undeniably sexy period style into the mix. Florence Pugh is Charlie, a young actress recruited by Mossad spymaster Martin Kurtz (Michael Shannon) to infiltrate a group of Palestinian terrorists, even as she's being manipulated by an Israeli intelligence officer (Alexander Skarsgård). Crucially, like the book, the show offers nuanced characters on multiple sides of the conflict, raising serious questions about who the real villains are. Stream The Little Drummer Girl on AMC+ or buy it from Prime Video.\n\nMichael Fassbender stars here as \"Martian,\" the codename for Brandon Colby, a former undercover CIA agent just returned to London after six years in Sudan. He's left behind a lover, Dr. Samia Zahir (Jodie Turner-Smith)—a relationship he wasn't terribly forthcoming about with his handlers. When Sami turns up in London as part of a diplomatic delegation, Martian is forced to choose between his job and his personal life, which becomes more complicated when it appears that she's involved in a broader scheme involving the Sudanese government, MI6, and an undercover agent in Belarus. It's all very twisty-turny in the best tradition of spy shows, with a great cast: Jeffrey Wright plays Martian's boss and mentor; Richard Gere, the CIA London Station Chief; and Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville, a shifty senior MI6 operative. Stream The Agency on Paramount+.\n\nIt's late 1987, and university students Yeong-ro (Jisoo) and Soo-ho (Jung Hae-in) meet-cute in a coffee shop. She's an English Lit student, and he's an Economics grad student—or so he says. The story starts to crumble when he shows up in Yeong-ro's dorm room covered in blood. She thinks he's a pro-democracy protester hiding from the police, but actually, he's a North Korean spy sent to bring a professor back with him. The show earned itself a fair bit of controversy for suggesting that the struggle which lead to South Korean democracy was infiltrated by spies, but history notwithstanding, it's an effectively heart-wrenching spy drama. Stream Snowdrop on Disney+.\n\nNabhaan Rizwan plays Raza Shar, a young British Pakistani Londoner with a shady past (and present) who's coerced by Paddy Considine's DS Gabe Waters into signing on to become a police informant, part of a large network employed by the show's imagined counter-terrorism organization. A known terrorist was killed just recently, but it soon becomes clear that he might have trained a number of other extremists before he died. It's a tense, fast-moving show that, like The Night Manager, places a reluctant spy in the foreground. Stream Informer on Prime Video and Britbox.\n\nThis one isn't a spy drama, and generally favors a lighter tone than The Night Manager, but the two shows share a key common thread: each is about a charismatic but otherwise awful rich guy, and a government agent who is determined to stop them. Paul Giamatti plays attorney Chuck Rhoades (based, a bit, on the real-life Preet Bharara), who is working to bring down shady hedge fund manager Bobby Axelrod (Damian Lewis). Even without actual espionage, the moves and countermoves make the whole thing feel like a similarly elaborate chess game. Stream Billions on Paramount+.\n\nIn addition to, or instead of, The Agency, try Le Bureau des Légends, the French original on which it's based (they're similarly addictive, though many will prefer the original on principle). Same general premise: Mathieu Kassovitz stars as Guillaume Debailly, a spy just recently returned from a six year undercover mission in Damascus. As he's trying to readjust to his old life, everything is thrown into turmoil when Nadia (Zineb Triki), the woman with whom he'd been in a relationship in Syria, turns up in Paris. Over the course of five seasons, the show excelled at dealing with day-to-day life for its intelligence workers. It's not all thrilling spy escapades, and that's very much an advantage. Stream The Bureau on Paramount+.\n\nThough the focus shifts a bit after the first few seasons, Homeland begins as a tense espionage thriller, as CIA case officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) begins to suspect that that decorated Marine Corps scout sniper Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), recently rescued from an al-Qaeda compound, has been turned by his captors and is planning a terrorist attack on the United States. Given she's been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, her superiors don't give Mathison's suspicions much credence, forcing her to go rouge in what turns into a cat-and-mouse/is-he-or-isn't he? game between the two. Both leads won Emmys for their performances, and the series took the Outstanding Drama prize in its first year. If it pulls a few too many punches at the tail end of the first season, it makes for a compelling watch. Stream Homeland on Hulu and Netflix.\n\nBlending spy and detective tropes (and based on a series of novels by Mick Herron, of Slow Horses fame), this one stars Emma Thompson as hard-living, hard-drinking private investigator Zoë Boehm. She's hired by Ruth Wilson's Sarah Trafford, a married art restorer who nobody takes very seriously (including her husband), even when she becomes invested in the fate of a young girl whose family is killed in an alleged gas explosion down the street. The girl, whose parents have died, disappears into the foster system, and no one really seems to care—until Sarah hires Zoë and her husband to look into it. Soon, both women are in way over their heads, as the missing girl points to a much broader government conspiracy. Stream Down Cemetery Road on Apple TV+.\n\nA bit lighter in tone than The Night Manager and shot through with a vein of black comedy that wouldn't feel out of place in a Coen brothers movie, Patriot is the story of a beleagured intelligence officer who just cannot catch a break. Michael Dorman is John Tavner, tasked with ensuring that the leading candidate for the presidency of Iran doesn't win. An elaborate plan to support a more moderate rival candidate sees him taking on a non-official cover identity and getting a job at a Milwaukee piping firm. After he blows the interview, he needs to eliminate his hapless competition for the job, then he needs to borrow urine for the drug test, which winds up exposing him to extortion, etc. etc. As the screwups began to stack one on top of the other, John's situation becomes ever more precarious (and darkly hilarious—his musical talent means that a lot of exposition comes in the form of extremely specific folk songs that he performs under yet another assumed name). Stream The Patriot on Prime Video.\n\nThe juicy imported political thriller stars Alec Secăreanu (God's Own Country) as Victor Godeanu, a Romanian ministry director and friend to dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu (the show takes place in 1978, and is based on a true story). Godeanu is also working for the Soviets and, with his cover about to be blown, decides to defect to the United States. When Ceaușescu sends agents to kill him, the intelligence agencies of five countries become tied up in the defection drama. Stream Spy/Master on HBO Max.",

    "title": "What Happened When a 'Ghost Student' Scammer Took Out Student Loans in My Name",
    "description": "Identity thieves are absconding with federal student aid.",
    "fullText": "Identity thieves are now using college enrollment to take out student loans in victims' names. This so-called \"ghost student\" scam capitalizes on limited verification for online class sign-ups and the federal aid application process to steal millions in funds while assigning the debt to unsuspecting targets.\n\nI personally have been a victim of this scam, which I discovered only after an outstanding student loan debt landed on my credit report in 2024. Here's how the scheme works.\n\nTo run this scam, fraudsters use stolen or fake identities to enroll \"ghost students\" in online classes while also applying for federal student aid, including Pell grants and loans. Of course, they never actually attend those classes, instead disappearing with the money and placing the resulting financial burden on the individuals and schools they've conned.\n\nIn my case, scammers had used just enough accurate personal information to \"enroll\" at a community college in southern California and take out a Pell grant in my name. However, because the enrollment was fraudulent, the grant was considered overpaid and sent to collections via the U.S. Department of Education—which is how it landed on my credit record.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Inspector General (OIG), this type of fraud blew up with the shift to online and remote learning, particularly at community colleges that offer open enrollment (and generally engage in limited verification of applicant information). Increasingly, AI tools also likely help scammers to expand their reach with enrollment and loan applications and get past identity verification checks.\n\nThe scheme has affected schools across the country. In California alone, nearly a third of all applicants to community colleges in 2024 were identified as fake. A handful of individuals have been sent to prison after stealing millions in \"ghost student\" financial aid, but the OIG still has 200 investigations open.\n\nFor individuals targeted by the ghost student scam, the consequences are essentially the fallout of identity theft, such as debt falsely assigned to you that negatively affects your credit or the inability to get legitimate student loans (or any other type of credit) when you actually need them.\n\nIt also forces you into a long and arduous process of disputing the fraud: I spent several months going back and forth between the Department of Education, the community college, the credit bureaus, and an attorney to track down the fraudulent applications, file identity theft reports, provide extensive documentation proving that I wasn't responsible for the debt, and get the information removed from my record.\n\nUnfortunately, the ghost student scam circumvents a standard anti-fraud safeguard because most federal student aid doesn't require a credit check. (My credit record had been frozen for years, and still was at the time that this fraud took place.) While you should absolutely freeze your credit and thaw it temporarily only when needed, this step may not prevent bad actors from using your information to apply for grants and loans.\n\nBecause this scam is a form of identity theft, you should take every precaution to safeguard your personal information. Given the ubiquity of data breaches and hacks, you can assume a lot of it is already out in the open, but that doesn't mean you can't lock accounts down and practice good digital hygiene. Credit fraud alerts and a regular review of your credit reports will help you catch any suspicious activity quickly.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk’s rocket company SpaceX has acquired xAI, the artificial intelligence firm founded by Musk three years ago, in a massive, and unconventional, deal that combines the two privately held firms into a company with an astounding $1.25 trillion reported valuation and plans for a historic IPO this year.\n\nHow does Musk justify the $1.25 trillion valuation?\n\nHow do Tesla's investments complicate this deal?\n\nWhat are the space-based data center plans?\n\nWhat companies are involved in this SpaceX-xAI merger?\n\nMusk, who is the CEO of both companies as well as publicly traded electric vehicle and robotics company Tesla, described the combination as one that will “form the most ambitious, vertically integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile-device communications, and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform,” he wrote in a blog post on SpaceX’s website.\n\nMusk cited the potential for space-based data centers, the energy-intensive computing facilities necessary to power AI services, as one of the most important benefits of the combination, even though the concept is still unproven and largely theoretical. “Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term,” Musk wrote in the blog post.\n\n“By directly harnessing near-constant solar power with little operating or maintenance costs, these satellites will transform our ability to scale compute,” Musk wrote.\n\nWhile reports of a potential deal emerged last week, the stratospheric value of the transaction and the swiftness with which it closed left many industry observers in awe, underscoring the massive expectations around AI as well as fears of an overheated market that could be due for a reckoning.\n\nAccording to reporting in Bloomberg, the deal between SpaceX and xAI will lead to a combined enterprise value of $1.25 trillion, with shares of xAI valued at $526.59 apiece. Musk has reportedly been hashing out the potential terms of a SpaceX IPO this year that would value the company at $800 billion, setting the stage for what could be the largest initial public offering of all time.\n\nRepresentatives from SpaceX and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMusk, the richest person in the world, has a documented history of mingling the financial interests of his businesses. In 2015, Tesla acquired Solar City, a solar energy company founded by Musk’s cousins and on whose board Musk served as chairman.\n\nAnd in March 2025, xAI acquired X, the Musk-owned social platform formerly known as Twitter, in a $33 billion, all-stock deal. “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk said at the time.\n\nMore recently, Tesla surprised shareholders just last month when it revealed that it had invested $2 billion in xAI in exchange for a batch of preferred stock as part of xAI’s $20 billion Series E funding round. That investment means Tesla shareholders now own preferred stock in a company that has become a subsidiary of SpaceX, which could raise questions from investors about Tesla’s role in funding xAI’s growth. In addition to the $2 billion investment, Tesla disclosed it sold $430 million of Megapack battery storage and systems to xAI in 2025, costing it $285 million, exhibiting the circular nature of Musk’s businesses.",

    "fullText": "Ireland captain Gaby Lewis says qualifying for the 2026 T20 World Cup means \"so much\" to the side after missing out on the tournament two years ago.\n\nLloyd Tennant's side booked their place at the global qualifiers in Nepal on Sunday thanks to their 62-run win over Thailand.\n\n\"We're all absolutely thrilled. Obviously there were some scars there from not qualifying for the last one,\" said Lewis\n\n\"That was tough for the girls, so there were a lot of nerves coming into the competition, but we felt really prepared. It obviously means so much.\"\n\nLewis was named batter of the tournament in Nepal after averaging 39 across Ireland's seven matches with her best knock 73 in a loss to Bangladesh.\n\nWhile much of Ireland's T20 successes in recent seasons have been anchored by the batting of the so-called 'Big Three' of Lewis, Orla Prendergast and Amy Hunter, World Cup qualification owed plenty to a bowling attack that limited the Netherlands and Thailand to 45 and 59 runs respectively in their Super Six wins.\n\n\"It was brilliant. You've got some great bowlers in our squad,\" added Lewis.\n\n\"It was brilliant to see different bowlers stand up in different games, it wasn't just the same bowler all through the tournament. It was a brilliant, all-round squad performance.\"",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at what next for Jean-Philippe Mateta after his dream move to AC Milan broke down over issues with his medical",
    "fullText": "Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta finds himself in a difficult position as he no doubt considers what's next after a dream move to AC Milan broke down over issues with his medical.\n\nPalace manager Oliver Glasner has spoken publicly about Mateta's issues with a knee injury in recent weeks.\n\nAnd that niggle may explain the striker's poor form; he has scored just once since the start of December.\n\nThe ailment, however, didn't prevent the player from trying to force a move away from Selhurst Park during the final days of the January transfer window.\n\nBut with Mateta now stuck at Palace after two rounds of medical tests spooked Milan officials enough to pull out of a deal worth £30m, his mind will turn to the immediate future.\n\nSources have indicated to BBC Sport that Palace were up front with Milan over Mateta's knee issues, sending the Italian club full medical reports towards the end of last week in preparation for a deal being concluded.\n\nBut, according to sources in Italy, Milan's reservations were over Mateta's right knee. The 28-year-old's meniscus had ruptured in 2019 when playing for Mainz and he underwent surgery that kept him out for around six months.\n\nIn their two examinations of Mateta, the Serie A club came to the conclusion that the striker would likely require an operation to cure the problem, described as an 'inflammation' of the knee.\n\nIt is Milan's view that the issue cannot resolved by therapy and load management.\n\nThe prospect of surgery does appear the common sense approach here.\n\nIt will allow the player to continue his career free of the pain he has struggled with in recent weeks. Likewise, it would help ease any concerns his future suitors may have over his fitness ahead of any move away from Selhurst Park.\n\nIt would also suit Palace to a point as it would likely eradicate the possibility of his current knee problems arising as an obstacle towards any future sale.\n\nMateta's current deal expires in 2027 when Palace would lose him for nothing, so the prospect of selling the player this summer will certainly be considered.\n\nBut with the chance of playing in his first World Cup looming large, any surgery for Mateta may have implications towards his selection for the tournament.\n\nDepending on the timescale of recovery and rehabilitation, an operation would eat into the time Mateta has to convince France manager Didier Deschamps that he is worthy of a place for Les Bleus this summer.\n\nThe club record signing of Jorgen Strand Larsen will also impact Mateta's first-team opportunities between now and the summer, too, given the £48m outlay.\n\nMateta has scored two goals in three matches for France since his debut last year. Fulfilling his World Cup ambition is within reach but he is facing having limited minutes on the pitch for the remainder of the season as he looks to reinforce his international case.\n\nAnd that's the quandary that faces Mateta as he contends with the aftermath of his failed move to the San Siro.",

After a break week, Borthwick's side then travel to Italy and then France.\n\n\"That's why this competition is so good, because you have five brutal games, five tough games, three back-to-back and three away games,\" hooker Jamie George, who leads the side against Wales, told Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"It's going to be really challenging but that is also exciting and hopefully can bring the best out of us.\"",

If you speak to him, he's delighted that he's simplified things and got back to what he's good at, which is beating people. We've seen that plenty this season.\"\n\nWith Stockdale selected on the left wing, Jamie Osborne gets the nod at full-back.\n\nUsual number 15 Hugo Keenan misses out with a broken thumb sustained in training last week, with Osborne coming in despite having played no rugby since Ireland's win over Japan in November because of a shoulder problem.\n\n\"Knowing his temperament and how diligent he is in his preparation - which is top drawer by the way - there's no better man,\" said Farrell of Osborne's readiness for a first game in three months.\n\n\"Jacob [Stockdale] is playing well, he deserves his chance on the left wing. Hugo has been unbelievably unlucky. He was looking sharp coming back in and I really feel for him to have the thumb injury.\n\n\"You look at the likes of Jimmy O'Brien or Mack Hansen or others [without Keenan] and Jamie is the one who is going to fill the spot for us. He's had a shoulder injury so he's fit, he's certainly showed that in the last week.\"",

I was nervous at the end but I backed the bowlers, that's what they train for - to nail those yorkers at the back end under pressure.\"\n\nEngland have won the U19 World Cup once - in 1998 - and were beaten finalists in 2022.

    "fullText": "Russia’s natural gas exports via the TurkStream pipeline to Europe jumped by 10.3% in January from a year earlier, Reuters calculations showed on Monday, as Gazprom boosted supply via the only gas route left from Russia to the EU.\n\nLast month, Russian gas supply via TurkStream totaled 1.73 billion cubic meters (bcm), up from 1.57 bcm in January 2025, according to the calculations made by Reuters.\n\nWhat happened to Ukraine's gas transit deal?\n\nWhich European countries still receive Russian gas supplies?\n\nWhy did Russian gas exports via TurkStream increase?\n\nHow will EU sanctions affect Russian gas imports?\n\nOn January 1, 2025, Russian pipeline gas supply to Europe crumbled again, after Ukraine refused to extend the pipeline transit deal with Russia.\n\nRussian gas supply via pipelines to Europe has slumped since 2022, after Russia cut off many EU customers from its gas deliveries, and Nord Stream stopped supplying gas to Germany, after Russia reduced flows and after a sabotage in September 2022.\n\nRussian pipeline gas supply via Ukraine stopped on January 1, 2025, after Ukraine refused to negotiate an extension to the transit deal.\n\nThat left only TurkStream as the conduit of Russian natural gas via pipeline to Europe.\n\nSome European countries, including Hungary and Slovakia, continue to receive Russian gas through the TurkStream pipeline via Turkey and the Balkans.\n\nSupplies via TurkStream have increased over the past year.\n\nDaily flows in January 2026 averaged 55.8 million cubic meters (mcm), up from 50.6 mcm in January 2025, per the Reuters calculations based on data from European gas transmission group Entsog. December 2025 flows averaged 56 mcm per day, so the past two months have seen consistent flows via TurkStream.\n\nDespite higher gas flows on TurkStream, Russia’s gas sales to Europe last year plunged to a 50-year low, after crashing by 44% from 2024 in the absence of transit via Ukraine.\n\nMoreover, the 27 EU member states last month formally adopted the regulation on phasing out Russian imports of both pipeline gas and LNG into the EU. A full ban will take effect for LNG imports from the beginning of 2027 and for pipeline gas imports from the autumn of 2027.\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n\nU.S. Considers Sanctions Relief to Revive Venezuela’s Oil Output\n\nCrude Rallies on Weather Disruptions and Fresh Geopolitical Nerves\n\nBrent Breaks $70 After Trump Threatens Iran With Military Force\n\nOilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.

    "description": "Indian stocks and the rupee are set for strong gains on Tuesday after a trade deal that slashes U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50% in exchange for India halting",
    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Indian stocks and the rupee are set for strong gains on Tuesday after a trade deal that slashes U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50% in exchange for India halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.\n\nHere are some comments from investors and analysts:\n\nRADHIKA RAO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DBS, ​SINGAPORE:\n\n\"This breakthrough is unmistakably positive for the real economy/exports, sentiment as well as financial markets, while further details are awaited. Textiles, gems & jewellery, engineering goods, leather and chemicals are ‌likely amongst the key gainers.\n\n\"An eventual unveiling of the bilateral trade agreement will provide more details on the beneficiary product lines and trade as well as investment commitments. Domestic markets are expected to witness a relief rally at open, after ‌high tariffs had been one of the key drags on sentiment in the past quarter.\"\n\nCHARU CHANANA, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SAXO, SINGAPORE:\n\n\"This is constructive for Indian equities because it reduces trade policy uncertainty and improves visibility for export-linked earnings - exactly the kind of catalyst that can restart the narrative when global investors have been cautious. But there's a lot we still don't know. If the oil bill rises meaningfully, that can reintroduce inflation and currency sensitivity.\n\n\"The structural story remains strong and the latest budget’s infrastructure and AI push keeps the ‘catch-up’ theme alive. For foreign investors though, the next hurdle is the Indian rupee, which means ⁠the market may look less like a one-way beta trade and ‌more like a dispersion market.\"\n\nMARC VELAN, HEAD OF INVESTMENTS, LUCERNE ASSET MANAGEMENT, SINGAPORE:\n\n\"The trade deal removes a chunk of policy and tariff uncertainty that had been weighing on Indian assets, opening the door for a near-term bounce in the rupee and equities via sentiment and foreign flows, though sustainability will depend ‍on how the deal is implemented rather than the headline itself.\"\n\nTRIDEEP BHATTACHARYA, PRESIDENT & CIO, EQUITIES, EDELWEISS ASSET MANAGEMENT, MUMBAI:\n\n\"The reduction in tariffs from around 50% to ~18% has come in materially better than consensus expectations. When combined with the recently concluded India–EU trade agreement, this potentially represents one of the strongest external growth stimuli for the Indian economy in 2026.\"\n\nLAKSHMAN VENKITARAMAN, ASSOCIATE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WASTACH GLOBAL, SALT LAKE CITY:\n\n\"We believe the trade deal improves ​investor sentiment toward India. While the U.S. is India’s largest trading partner, exports to the U.S. account for less than 5% of India’s GDP. Nonetheless, U.S.-India trade frictions have weighed on foreign ‌investor perception. This has been compounded by a global trade focused on AI, which has disproportionately benefited markets such as Taiwan and Korea.",

    "description": "A new study drawing from 47 million nights of sleep data has found that a simple sleep behavior rule can extend your life. Here's what it is and how you can do it.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nYou're probably already aware of the effects of not getting enough sleep. Not only can sleep deprivation lead to mental and physical health risks, studies have shown that it can shorten life expectancy. But what if there was a way you could do the opposite — hack your sleep to add years to your life?\n\nA huge new study by Vitality and The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) has found that following a simple sleep hygiene rule can potentially increase your life span by as much as four years.\n\nBelow, we explore the study's findings, what that rule is, and tips for how you can apply it to your own sleep, as well as speaking to Dr. Katie Tryon, Deputy CEO at Vitality. Read on for everything you need to know...\n\nThe new study says that practicing the following two key sleep hygiene habits can help you live up to 4 years longer\n\nThe '7:1' rule means getting regularly getting 7 hours of sleep within a 1-hour window\n\nSticking to a healthy sleep duration and regular sleep timing can improve your life expectancy by 24%\n\nMany of us aren't getting enough sleep, and it's potentially life changing. This new study points out that research shows 41% of people in both the UK and the US get less than seven hours sleep a night, and that regularly getting less than six hours sleep a night can lead to a 20% higher risk of early death.\n\nSo, this study used 47 million nights of sleep data (from wearable devices used by 105,000 individuals over a number of years) analyzed by researchers alongside health and wellness data, socio-economic data and insurance claims data.\n\nLooking into the data, they found that maintaining good sleep habits can have a huge impact on our length of life and health.\n\nAn average person who starts going to sleep at the same time each night and getting more than seven hours of sleep a night may see an estimated 24% lower mortality risk, the researchers said, compared to people who slept less than seven hours and didn't stick to a consistent bedtime.\n\nThis improvement, they explained, could translate to 2 to 4 more years of life, and better health with them (though they did note that this depends on factors including age and baseline life expectancy).\n\nFor context, going from a poor diet to an ideal one can add up to 4.5 years to life and from physically inactive to highly active can add up to 6 years to, the study noted.\n\nPeople have been so focused on getting seven, eight hours of sleep per night. But the study highlighted that sleep regularity and consistency is more important.\n\nDr. Katie Tryon, Deputy CEO at Vitality\n\nAnd, while the number of hours is important, Dr. Tryon highlights that the new research has shown that it's getting sleep consistently paired with the regularity of bedtime that's key.\n\n\"I feel like people are more tuned in to how much physical activity you need,\" says Dr. Tyron.\n\n\"I think it applies the same to bedtime in where people have been so focused on getting seven, eight hours of sleep per night. But the study highlighted that sleep regularity and consistency is more important.\"\n\nWhen just looking at the effect of sticking to that one-hour bedtime window, the study found it can reduce mortality risk by 31%.\n\nPlus, the new research revealed ways improving sleep can impact the healthcare system — sticking to the same seven hours rest and regular sleep time can lead to a reduction in hospital admissions by up to 7%.\n\nIf you want to give yourself a chance of adding up to four years onto your life, the researchers suggest the '7:1' sleep behavior rule.\n\nThat means getting at least seven hours of sleep and sticking to an hour window for going to sleep (for example, between 10pm-11pm), at least five nights a week.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers also found that only 10% of people actually follow the above, which they describe as \"optimal sleep patterns.\"\n\nThat means a huge 90% of people don't, and could potentially benefit from making these simple changes to their sleep habits.\n\nIn fact, the study estimated that if just 25% of people with poor sleep patterns adopted the '7:1' rule, it could lead to 39 million more years of added life in the UK and 191 million \n\n\"I think being able to being able to start treating sleep as a modifiable behaviour... could make a huge difference in how people think about it and how people manage it and really help people improve their health,\" Dr. Tryon says.\n\nOur sleep is controlled by our internal body clock, known as our circadian rhythm. Going to sleep at the same time each night helps to keeps it regulated — think of it as teaching your body to know when its time for sleep.\n\nThis regulation is important because your circadian rhythm is responsible for the timely release of hormones responsible for sleep (like melatonin) at night and cortisol (for energy) in the morning.\n\nHowever, as Dr. Tryon explains, that disrupting our circadian rhythm, for example, through shift work or moving through different time zones, (both of which can make it hard to go to bed at the same time each night), \"has a significant impact on regulation of hormones, on regulation of metabolism, on on various other bodily metrics.\"\n\nSigns of a dis-regulated circadian rhythm, as licensed clinical psychologist Dr. Leah Kaylor previously told us, can include trouble falling asleep, frequent nighttime awakenings, feeling tired in the morning despite a full night of sleep and experiencing fatigue during the day.\n\nIf you're reading this and worrying that your bedtime is all over the place, there are some simple steps you can take to get your bedtime schedule back on track.\n\nDr. Lindsay Browning, a chartered psychologist and neuroscientist, has previously explained to us that it can be helpful to work out how much sleep you generally require to feel refreshed (for some it may be only 7.5 hours, while others might need 8.5 for example). \n\nThen consider what time you need to wake up in the morning, and work backwards from there to make sure your bedtime allows you enough rest.\n\nBut if your current bedtime is much later, or a bit all over the place, Dr. Browning recommends moving towards your ideal sleep time in increments of 20 minutes each evening. So if you've been heading to bed at 12.30am, aim for 12.10am the first night, and 11.50pm the second, and so on.\n\nFor more, including how to factor in your chronotype, you can check out our guide on how to fix your sleep schedule.\n\n\"I think there is definitely still a huge benefit [if] you can't have a consistent sleep schedule in trying to at least get a consistent amount of sleep,\" Dr. Tryon says.\n\nSo, if you're struggling to maintain the same bedtime, perhaps due to work shifts or parenting responsibilities, these tips from Dr. Tryon should help improve the quality of the sleep you do get.\n\nDr. Tryon says that a key way to improve the quality of your sleep is \"thinking about what you're eating and drinking before you go to bed. Caffeine being an obvious one.\"\n\nYou may not know that caffeine has a half life of around 4-6 hours, which means it takes that long for your system to clear half of what you've consumed. Matt Gallant,kinesiologist and sleep supplement formulator, suggests stopping caffeine intake around 2pm.\n\nBut a simple way to help prevent caffeine impacting your sleep is to consider following the 10-3-2-1-0 rule, which includes stopping caffeine consumption 10 hours before your intended sleep time.\n\nAlcohol also impacts sleep quality (including disrupting REM sleep and often leading to more wake-ups during the night), while evening eating habits such as large, heavy meals late at night, sugary desserts after dinner and acidic spicy foods can also affect sleep, including delaying sleep onset and disrupting your rest.\n\n\"Obviously quality is dependent on consistent sleep time. But if you can't do that, think about, reducing your screen time before you go to bed,\" says Dr. Tryon.\n\nOne way screens can impact sleep is through the light they emit, since light, including blue light from screens, causes the suppression of melatonin (the hormone that helps us feel sleepy).\n\nWhile some recent research has indicated that blue light may have such a significant impact on sleep, (a study showed it only lengthened the amount of time it takes to fall asleep by an average of 2.7 minutes), scrolling your phone isn't just about how much light you're exposed to.\n\n“Phone use keeps the mind cognitively active as well. Whether you’re reading, reacting, or scrolling, your brain stays alert and engaged,” says GP and physician Dr. Ola Otulana.\n\n“This mental stimulation can delay the natural rise of melatonin and interrupt your body’s circadian rhythm and also increase the likelihood of restless sleep,\" he adds.\n\nA recent study found that every hour of screen time before bed increased the risk of insomnia by 59%, and that sleep duration is reduced by 24 minutes for each hour spent looking at a screen in bed.\n\nFor those who find it tricky to stick to a consistent sleep schedule, Dr. Tryon suggests it can still be helpful to have \"a calming bedtime routine, depending on the time that it takes.\"\n\nIf you haven't come across the idea of a bedtime, or nighttime routine, before you may think it sounds childish. But it's actually a simple way to train your body and mind to prepare for rest.\n\n“A bedtime routine really is about winding down,” Dr. Browning has explained. “It's about transitioning from the busy stress work of the day to sleep.\n\n\"And we can only sleep when we relax. When we’re anxious, we can’t sleep. So anything, literally anything, that you find relaxing is going to help you sleep.”\n\nWhile the focus should be on what you personally find calming, you might want to consider deep breathing techniques, listening to calming music, sleep mediation, a warm shower or bath, or even a short yoga routine.\n\nThanks to technological developments, the best sleep trackers, can monitor a whole host of metrics, from sleep latency, to time spent in each sleep stage, heart rate, time spent asleep, nighttime awakenings, to breathing pattens, snoring and more.\n\nAnd they come in the form of wearables like rings, armbands and watches, as well as under-mattress devices.\n\n\"I think it's so amazing that we've got these devices that you can actually look at, not just the length of your sleep, but actually the quality of the sleep,\" says Dr. Tryon.\n\n\"Now you can get that real time feedback that if you eat X, Y, Z, or you do X, Y and Z, that actually distinctly reduces the quality of your sleep.\" she says.\n\nHowever, Dr. Tryon explains that it's important not to feel stressed out if the numbers your sleep tracker is showing you aren't where you want them to be, and instead focusing on the idea that you can make changes to help the quality of your sleep.\n\n\"It's really thinking through, what can I change in order to change those numbers as opposed to intentionally trying to change those numbers. I can't say to myself, 'You need more REM sleep, have more REM sleep'\" she points out.\n\nInstead, she suggests \"changing your relationship with a tracker and thinking about...the modifiable stuff.... you're doing during the day in the run up to that moment.\"\n\nFollow Tom's Guide on Google News and add us as a preferred source to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.",

It is less a neat inquiry than a muffled cry inside each of us, rising over and over against days filled with repeated loss: Who are we?\n\nI refuse to accept that Gaza will come to be defined only by destruction and loss. This is a land shaped by long and layered human experiences across history. A natural byway between Africa and Asia, it has long been a meeting point for people, trade, and culture. Lineages of language and conversation, shared traditions and space, all came together to create from our long history a sense of “we”—a nomenclature for our collective identity.\n\nWhat I seek is a serious attempt to recall this “we” in the midst of a genocide that has never been just a material act of erasing bodies, but a systematic effort to target both spirit and memory. It has stripped places of their soul and their physical appearance, distorted the very image of belonging, and left us, individually and collectively, digging through the ruins of memory for some natural reflection of who we are.\n\nThis digging is arduous work, nails forever scraping against loss. Even so, we keep at it, building back schools, cultural centers, libraries in our minds, each one a witness, a keeper of knowledge. But how can we even attempt an answer when these places have been erased? When death arrives daily, stealing our loved ones, our people? How can we shape our identity amid this constant loss? I share some of them here to share a fragment of Gaza’s larger story, to connect past with present and reconstruct an image of who we were and who we remain.\n\nThe Islamic University, founded in 1978 as Gaza’s first secondary institution, was more than an academic site. Within its halls, generations of students nurtured curiosity, ambition, and resilience against a backdrop of siege. It was a sanctuary where ideas could thrive, debates could flourish, and a collective consciousness could grow despite the isolation imposed on the Strip. Students from diverse fields—science, media, literature, and religious studies—studied and worked here.\n\nThe university became a beacon of higher education in Gaza, ranking first locally and second nationally. Its programs extended beyond knowledge and towars practical empowerment, shaping graduates who could navigate challenges creatively and lead their communities.\n\nOn October 10, 2023, Israeli war planes bombed the university, partially destroying more than 500 classrooms in more than 20 buildings. The war that followed took with it many of the university’s professors and staff. Dr. Sufian Abdul Rahman Tayeh, the university president and a leading researcher in physics and applied mathematics, known for his work in optics and advanced materials, was killed with his family in December 2023. Dr. Khetam Al-Wasifi, a biophysics professor and author of more than 50 research papers in fields such as electromagnetic waves and simulation techniques, was killed with her husband in a similar attack. Their loss is tremendous, a ragged hole in Gaza’s intellectual fabric.\n\nAl-Azhar University represented a distinct and complementary academic option to the Islamic University, both in the nature of its programs and its role within Gaza’s educational landscape. It was often chosen for its wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs, including veterinary medicine, agriculture, humanities, law, media, and education. Where the Islamic University focused largely on pure sciences and theoretical research, Al-Azhar offered a more diverse professional and academic formation. Its classrooms and lecture halls were incubators of ideas that connected Gaza to broader Arab and international intellectual spheres; It was also a more open environment, one that encouraged students to engage with one another in intellectual and cultural debates.\n\nRecognized regionally as a top institution, Al-Azhar fostered a generation of students equipped to confront adversity with creativity and knowledge. Its partial destruction signifies a rupture in the continuity of our intellectual life, as the branch in Gaza City was partially destroyed on the same night the Islamic University was hit, and the second branch in the south of the Strip was completely demolished in November 2023.\n\nAl-Azhar had created an intellectual breach in Israel’s blockade, a way out of the suffocating grip of a siege that had lasted 16 years. With its destruction, a lifeline that connected Gaza to the Arab region and the wider world—through conferences, cultural activities, and shared knowledge—has been severed. Al-Azhar offered an intellectual fissure through the blockade, an essential breach whose closure has not yet been fully mended.\n\nRashad Al-Shawwa Cultural Center\n\nFounded in 1985 as Palestine’s first cultural center, the Rashad Al-Shawa Cultural Center was intended to break Gaza’s cultural isolation. It hosted exhibitions, performances, and educational programs, cultivating artistic expression among all sectors of the Strip. Palestinian and Arab artists performed on its stage, bringing plays, concerts, film screenings, and other events to the people of Gaza. Among its most prominent figures was Leila Shawa, who designed the stained-glass panels in the main hall. Local Gazan artists, such as Maisara Baroud and Raed Issa, were regular exhibitors, central to the site’s cultural blossoming. Even the building was a work of art; designed by architect Saad Mahfel, it was once shortlisted for the Aga Khan Award for Architecture for its integration of art and local identity. At its center was the Diana Tamari Sabagh Library, one of the largest halls in the Strip, where thousands of books cradled knowledge gathered across diverse fields.\n\nThe Rashad Al-Shawwa Cultural Center embodied the city’s spirit of creativity and resilience. Once a place of cultural refuge, the early weeks of the genocide forced it to become a human refuge one as well. Until its destruction in November 2023, it was used as a shelter for displaced people whose homes had been destroyed by the Israeli military.\n\nThe AL-Qattan Center once housed over 111,500 library books and included approximately 25,000 registered members. More than 45,000 children benefited annually from its workshops, while its focus on reading, arts, and writing meant that the center was a central educational and cultural hub, nurturing both children and teachers through a combination of library resources and educational programs. It served as a bridge between generations, instilling knowledge as a discipline and creativity as central to our cultural pride.\n\nDespite severe damage to its infrastructure, the center’s impact remains a testament to Gaza’s ongoing effort to cultivate artistic resilience and learning amid adversity. Its legacy persists through the educators, artists, and children who continue to carry out its mission.\n\nThe Omari Mosque Library was far more than a selection of books. At once a spiritual and intellectual refuge, it housed texts that were centuries old. Before the war, it held nearly 20,000 books and manuscripts, including rare texts dating back to the Mamluk and Ottoman periods, some over 700 years old, covering fields such as Islamic jurisprudence, philosophy, astronomy, medicine, and religious sciences. Among those was the Sharh al-Ghawamidh in the Science of Inheritance, by the scholar Badr al-Din al-Mardini, a seminal thesis on Islamic inheritance law estimated to be around 500 years old.\n\nMost of these manuscripts were unique to the library—no copies existed elsewhere. They were irreplaceable, an archival scaffolding for the city’s history. When Israel bombed the library—not just once but again and again—it obliterated not just a building but centuries of accumulated knowledge. Though a local team from the Department of Endowments and Antiquities has managed to rescue 123 of the 228 ancient manuscripts, heritage restoration officials in Gaza have said that much of the damage is irreparable.\n\nCentral Library at the Islamic University\n\nAs Gaza’s largest library, the Central Library was a cornerstone of intellectual life for students, researchers, and scholars. Its five floors held an expansive collection of academic resources dating back to 1970, along with countless reference works, student theses, and both Arabic and foreign-language books. When Israel bombed the university in October 2023, nearly 240,000 of the library’s books were burned. The university estimates that the continued bombardment destroyed a total of nearly 1 million books. Their destruction is, by that measure, the single greatest intellectual loss in Gaza’s long and turbulent history.\n\nAl-Daraj is the commercial and architectural center of the old city. The neighborhood is a stage, where the city proclaims itself, a place of commerce, movement, and markets, as well as major cultural and religious landmarks like the Al-Sayed Hashim Mosque, where the grandfather of the Prophet Muhammad is believed to be buried. The sanctity of the mosque—and the Old City by extension—is not something that has been imposed. It whispers through its stillness, in the way light bends as it creeps into the neighborhood.\n\nRayan El Amine, Jack Mirkinson, and Lizzy Ratner\n\nBooks & the Arts\n\n /\n\n Namwali Serpell\n\nThe heart of Al-Daraj also contains Qasr al-Basha, the Ottoman-era building later known as “Napoleon’s Castle.” Napoleon Bonaparte is said to have used it as his base during his campaign against the Palestinian city of Acre. Therein lies the story of Gaza itself. A city that has always existed on the world’s map, never a margin, never a quiet passageway.\n\nAl-Zaytoun is less a neighborhood than a trace of time. The neighborhood moves slowly, the weight of centuries visible in the way its residents saunter. Here, the call to prayer stands beside the sound of church bells. History is inextricable from daily life: The Wilaya Mosque, with its stone inscriptions dating back to the eighth century CE, bears witness not just to architecture but to the living continuity of a city so accustomed to threat. Nearby stands St. Porphyrius Church, a testament to Gaza’s often contested pluralism. It is a neighborhood of difference. A site where religious, social, and human memories sustain. In Al-Zaytoun, the stones are not asked about their faith; they are asked only to endure.\n\nIn the absence of all these places that once were, we hold on to their memory, rebuilding them brick by brick. Even so, we who remain also know that memory is not enough. Even now, Gaza continues to bleed. What this means is that the question is not merely, “How do we rebuild?” but “Will we be able to rebuild?” And “What will rebuilding even mean”?\n\nThe media sometimes portrays reconstruction or international aid as a remedy, but even if buildings are rebuilt, who will restore the heritage? Who will restore the archives? Who will restore the intellectual memory, cultivated over generations of professors, students, and scholars? Who will restore years of research, writing, study, and experimentation? Who will bring back the voices that will never be heard again? And who will bring back the dead?\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

Automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Toyota (TM) (the hybrid leader) are looking to offer more hybrid options in the future.\n\nHere are the top 10 new vehicles on Consumer Reports' 2026 list:\n\n(New addition to the list.) Consumer Reports said the Honda (HMC) Civic is an overall excellent sedan, but the hybrid is the best version. \"It possesses all the qualities Consumer Reports' automotive experts love about the gas-only sedan, including quick and responsive steering, a comfortable ride, and a spacious interior.\"\n\nConsumer Reports noted that the Toyota Camry is now sold exclusively as a hybrid, powered by a 2.5L four-cylinder engine that got 48 mpg overall in CR's testing. \"The latest iteration strikes a pleasing balance between ride comfort and capable handling, offers practical interior space, and features user-friendly controls that effectively utilize physical knobs and switches.\"\n\nConsumer Reports said the Subaru (FUJHY) Crosstrek returned to the list due to positive additions like the new, more powerful hybrid powertrain with an EPA-estimated 36 mpg combined. \"The Crosstrek handles well, with quick steering and minimal roll through turns, but it's the ride quality that's most noteworthy.\"\n\nAlso returning is the Forester, which Consumer Reports said benefits from a new fuel-efficient hybrid powertrain, a 2.5L four-cylinder engine boosted by hybrid tech sourced from partner Toyota — good for five more miles per gallon compared to the gas version. \"Unlike most other small hybrid SUVs, which only offer limited all-wheel drive, the Forester Hybrid has a mechanical, full-time AWD system.\"",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s approval rating polls released at the start of 2026 indicate a gradual decline in public support for the President. One year into his second term, the data suggest that voter confidence has softened, even as his presidency continues to provoke strong reactions on both ends of the political spectrum.\n\nThe polling data from early 2026 shows a decline in support for President Donald Trump as midterm elections near. Multiple surveys conducted in late January reveal a consistent trend: more Americans now disapprove of his job performance than approve.\n\nTrump’s approval rating is currently mired in the upper 30s to low 40s, while his disapproval consistently registers above 50%. This negative shift comes after a year of big policy moves and political upheaval. This includes a protracted government shutdown and aggressive federal budget cuts, as well as the controversial domestic deployment of U.S. troops (via Democrat & Chronicle).\n\nA New York Times survey puts his support at 41%, with 56% opposed. The Economist shows a similar 38% to 56% split. Meanwhile, pollsters like Rasmussen and Morning Consult show a slightly tighter race, with approvals at 46%. Others, like Pew Research Center and American Research Group, report a starker deficit, with unfavorable ratings reaching 61% and 63%, respectively. This broad spectrum of Donald Trump’s approval rating polls points to a challenging political environment for the White House.\n\nAnalysts suggest this dip is rooted in more than just policy disputes. A detailed Pew Research Center study from late January probed deeper into public trust, finding widespread skepticism. According to their report, “more Americans express little or no confidence in Trump than say they are extremely or very confident in him.” This deficit of confidence spans critical areas, including his leadership, mental fitness, selection of advisors, and commitment to democratic values and ethics.\n\nThe post Donald Trump’s New Approval Rating Polls Show Major Changes appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "Rewaa was killed by an Israeli bomb. Her absence has broken me in ways I still cannot describe.\n\nThis piece is part of A Day for Gaza, an initiative in which The Nation has turned over its website exclusively to voices from the Gaza Strip. You can find all of the work in the series here.\n\nIoften think of my sister Rewaa as the “bride of heaven.” She moved through our lives with a calm, light spirit—someone whose presence made everything around her feel warmer and brighter. I still remember her dimples, her soft smile, my Shelter of Arms, and her generous nature, always giving more than she had.\n\nMy longing for her stumbles at the shroud that veiled her face, and at the soil that hid her fragile body—the grave. That moment forms a permanent barrier in my life: the line between the years we lived together and everything after. She was not only a sister to me. She was my closest companion, the person who shared every stage of my life—from childhood laughter to adult burdens.\n\nShe disappeared from us on the night of July 25, 2025. At around 10:30 pm, I was sitting with my mother, eating grapes. Suddenly, my sisters Aya and Shaima burst in crying. They told us that a bombing had struck the building where Riwaa and her children were staying. My brothers rushed to Al Ahli Baptist Hospital, and we waited desperately for news. When we heard she was injured and unconscious but receiving blood units, we still clung to hope.\n\nMinutes later, everything shattered.\n\nThat sentence still echoes inside me. My mother collapsed in grief. My sisters screamed. Our house shook with pain.\n\nWe didn’t sleep that night. At dawn, we went to Al-Ahli Hospital. Behind a red curtain lay my sister’s body, wrapped in white. Next to her was Fadi, her youngest, his small body still and swollen. He had followed his mother even into death.\n\nI lifted the shroud from her face. She looked like she was sleeping. I called her by her nickname, “Awwa’,” again and again. She didn’t answer. Her hands stayed still. Her eyelids didn’t flutter. She didn’t ask me to go out with her, or suggest tea by the seaside, or talk about buying clothes for her daughter.\n\nMy sister—my heart, my companion, the tender, generous, quick-witted mother of three—was gone.\n\nRewaa and I shared everything. She filled my days with jokes, mischief, and endless laughter.\n\nI miss the ordinary moments: finding her in the kitchen preparing a surprise cake, rushing around the stove with enthusiasm, covering every pot in an attempt to hide the evidence of her “crime” to produce a simple sponge cake. I miss her making lentils—her unexpected comfort food during the war—despite the fact that she used to insist on eating only from Gaza’s best restaurants before. I even recorded her once as she cooked in the kitchen of our shelter in Deir Al Balah. In the video, she laughs at my teasing in the childish voice she adored.\n\nNow I watch that video constantly. I would give anything to taste one more spoonful of lentils made by her hands.\n\nI also miss how she used to burst into my room while I was studying dentistry. She always seemed determined to pull me out of my routine. “Come on,” she would say, “let’s get dressed, go for a walk, get ice cream, go to the seaside—anything.” I used to pretend to resist, but she never gave up. Eventually, I’d give in, and she would run off excitedly to get ready like a little girl aged 29; her happiness came from simple things: a walk, an ice-cream cone, the sea.\n\nDuring my five years of dental school, and even afterward, I ate more meals in her home than in my own. I would call her to ask what she had made, and she would always say the same thing: “Come over… even if I didn’t cook, I’ll make something for you, or we’ll cook together.” Her apartment was close, and I always hurried to her. We either cooked together or ordered food—usually after a long debate that ended with her favorite dishes: cordon bleu, grilled food, or meals from another restaurant nearby, where her children spent countless afternoons bouncing on the trampoline its owners had set out to entertain kids. That same restaurant still holds the echo of our laughter as we waited for the circular pager that shook violently when the food was ready.\n\nShe was also the one I called every time no one could decide on a lunch plan. She had tried every dish in every restaurant, driven by her simple love of life and new experiences.\n\nAfter eating, we often sat in front of the TV while her three children—Nada, Ezzedine, and Fadel—watched cartoons. I once photographed them asleep together on their small trampoline, lying side by side like identical copies. Rewaa stood next to me in that quiet moment and told me she was almost 30, admitting that the thought unsettled her. Then she laughed it off, saying she still looked younger than her age, because she has a tiny body.\n\nNone of us knew she would never reach her 30s. She will remain forever young in my memory.\n\nRewaa and I shared so many moments that now feel like scenes from another life. Once, during a family outing to the sea, we slipped away from the adults and ran toward the giant swinging ship ride, like two little girls living inside adult bodies. We chose the last row and spent the whole time screaming, laughing, and asking the operator to make it go faster. We flew into the sky like two birds, smiling wing to wing. We were always meant to fly together. Why did you, Rewaa, fly alone this time?\n\nAnother time, at a kids’ playground, we tried the “bees” ride with the children. My seat didn’t move, and the operator blamed it on “extra weight.” Rewaa and our sister Amal laughed so hard they could barely breathe. I laughed too, despite myself, because she looked so full of life—radiant and happy.\n\nShe was endlessly generous. Her heart overflowed. She cared about every detail in our lives. After I graduated from dental school, she surprised me with a huge pink cake and arrived singing, with her children carrying little cupcakes decorated with graduation caps. I jumped off the couch, hugged her too tightly, and almost made her drop the cake. We laughed, sang, and celebrated that day with a joy that now feels suspended in time.\n\nNow, when I replay that memory, I ask myself why I didn’t hold onto her longer—why I ever let her go.\n\nOn every Mother’s Day, she used to send extravagant gifts to our mother—flowers, fruit baskets, chocolates, even kitchenware. We always knew they were from her, even without a card. She visited our grandmother with milk, yogurt, and biscuits. She showered everyone with love, care, and attention. She gave each family member their own nickname, even our youngest brother Hamza, whom she called “Hameez.”\n\nShe was present in everything, leaving traces of herself everywhere.\n\nA week before her death, she dubbed herself “the auntie of the baby” in reference to the child our sister Amal was expecting. Amal gave birth to her son, Moein, on August 19. I called and messaged Rewaa repeatedly that day, instinctively wanting to share the news with her.\n\nMoein was born 25 days after she died. He entered this world missing the aunt who would have adored him.\n\nRewaa died just weeks before the ceasefire arrived, slowing the killing but failing to end it. Survival had been within reach, almost … hers.\n\nEvery day, every hour, I miss her soft voice—the way she replaced emphatic Arabic letters with lighter ones, turning them into something playful and feminine. Even her teasing carried warmth.\n\nShe was the vibrant presence in every room, the one who gave until nothing was left, the laughter that carried us through the hardest times. She brought color wherever she went. Her absence has broken me in ways I still cannot describe.\n\nI picture her now as a bride in white, resting in a place where no shell can reach her, no stray bullet, no random death. A place where everything is eternal.\n\nA place where someday, I hope, I will meet her again.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "Frozen weapons are among the many challenges NATO soldiers would face in an Arctic conflict.\n\nSoldiers have to be careful not to let the harsh elements cause their guns to malfunction.\n\nBut they also can't let the guns get too warm, as that creates new problems.\n\nSODANKYLÄ, Finland — Among the many challenges NATO soldiers face in the harsh Arctic environment, the possibility of frozen weapons is one that risks leaving them most vulnerable.\n\nIt's anything but easy to keep guns, drones, and other equipment in the right conditions far above the Arctic Circle, where temperatures routinely drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and the heavy snow brings unwanted moisture that can cause jamming and other problems.\n\nNATO military personnel training in northern Finland told Business Insider during a visit to the region in late January that they can't afford to let their guns get too warm if they want them to work in this climate.\n\nThe biggest problem with weapons in these conditions is temperature variation, said Maj. Mikael Aikio, the Arctic section leader of the Finnish Army's Jaeger Brigade, which is leading a winter warfare training and cold-weather survival course for roughly 20 NATO soldiers.\n\nThe monthlong course, hosted in Finland's northern Lapland region, teaches NATO soldiers how to live, move, and fight in the harsh Arctic environment.\n\nThis type of training has become a growing priority for NATO as officials call for greater Arctic defense amid increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the High North. Western forces could find themselves fighting on frozen battlefields as the alliance and its adversaries compete for influence in this strategic region.\n\nLapland, like other northern regions in NATO's seven Arctic states, is a tough place to operate in winter. The biting cold, limited sunlight, and deep snowfall force troops to move slowly and with caution. And limited support infrastructure makes sustainment even more difficult up north.\n\nIn the Arctic, survival is only the first challenge. Troops must also keep their weapons functioning; even minor equipment failures can hand the enemy an edge.\n\nCanadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, one of the participants in the Arctic warfare training course, said all technology struggles in this part of the world, especially anything that requires charging, such as drones.\n\nAnything that gets covered in snow eventually becomes damp or wet, Lemelin said, so soldiers try to keep their guns cold at all times to avoid having ice or snow melt and introduce any moisture that might freeze and prevent it from working properly.\n\nFinnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, another course participant, said she carries a brush with her at all times to clear snow from her gun, especially from sensitive areas like the optics, which are more vulnerable to buildup. Soldiers are trained to ensure their weapons are dry to prevent anything from freezing up.\n\nLähdekorpi said firing a cold gun is a challenge. Her outer gloves are too bulky, so she strips them off and uses a thin liner to pull the trigger, but that leaves her hands exposed to the weapon's metal frame, which holds the cold.\n\n\"I think my hands are the worst enemy for me,\" she said. \"I have to keep them warm.\"\n\nProper weapon care doesn't end when training stops. Soldiers are taught to keep their guns at a steady ambient temperature. Bringing them into a warm tent, for instance, can cause condensation that later refreezes.\n\nSoldiers can't leave the guns outside their tents, as they might be stolen in real-world conditions. Instead, they bring them inside but place the weapons on the ground or in a space that is almost as cold as it is outside.\n\nProper firearm temperature management is not the only equipment struggle in the harsh Arctic. Drones are also relatively limited in their capabilities, especially in extreme cold, when temperatures drop below -14 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nDuring a combat exercise in the middle of the Arctic warfare course, soldiers practiced using drones to collect targeting data and call in artillery strikes against a simulated enemy force made up of Finnish conscripts.\n\nUsing small drones for reconnaissance, targeting, and fire support missions is standard practice in the Russian war against Ukraine, and they are expected to continue to be a key part of the kill chain in future conflicts, despite their limitations.\n\nAikio, a Jaeger Brigade major, said drones need special handling in Arctic conditions. Leaving them exposed on snowmobiles before launch risks damage from the elements, and once airborne, icing on small propellers and limited visibility can quickly degrade performance.\n\nLearning to keep weapons and other gear operational in this environment is one of many skills NATO soldiers are being taught to master in Finland, roughly a third of which lies above the Arctic Circle. The country also knows cold-weather combat, making it well-suited to teach the rest of the alliance winter warfare.\n\nLemelin, the Canadian captain, described the course as a \"humbling experience;\" it's critical exposure for the NATO alliance as Western militaries grapple with a rapidly changing Arctic environment and an expanding adversarial footprint.",

    "fullText": "After their home was obliterated, Rasha Abou Jalal and her family remain determined to build a new one, even if it must be built out of nothing.\n\nThis piece is part of A Day for Gaza, an initiative in which The Nation has turned over its website exclusively to voices from the Gaza Strip. You can find all of the work in the series here.\n\nWe—my husband and our five children—did not return home this past October, after a ceasefire paused the bloody Israeli war that stretched for two years. There was, to be more precise, no home to return to; it was obliterated in the first weeks of the war. No traces remain. We have only the memories now.\n\nAs of this writing, we have settled in a rented house in the south of Gaza City—though “house” is a generous description. It is the remnants of a home. There are no walls here; it is a shelter that itself seems ambivalent toward our habitation. Our children run wild through a living room that opens directly onto rubble, so the threat of their falling through the ruins is always imminent.\n\nI still remember my husband’s gaze as we prepared to move into the house. Looking around, he said, “We can’t possibly live here, but we’ll build a home, even if it must be built out of nothing.”\n\nHe began gathering old scraps of wood and nylon. Enlisting the help of a few friends who were craftsmen, he fastened wooden planks to the wall and stretched nylon over the hollow gaps, creating a makeshift cover to protect our children.\n\nThe walls are flimsy, trembling violently in the breeze. But this is all we have. Despite the ceasefire, Israel has prohibited building materials from entering the Strip. There is no cement, no steel, no real tools to build with.\n\nStill, my husband didn’t wait. He kneaded red clay with water and, with the help of those same friends, pasted the mixture over the holes that had formed in the corners of our home.\n\nI watched him carefully smooth the cement, patchworking gravel in the little crevices. “Will it hold?” I asked.\n\nWithout looking up, he replied, “What’s important is not whether this will hold, but whether we will.”\n\nEvery detail of this home is imprinted with memories of displacement. The nylon that drapes the walls recalls tent shelters, the wooden planks the long nights out in the cold, and the red clay the ground where we pitched the tents that flooded with every rainfall. Twelve times we were forced to move, each time fleeing toward the same, singular mirage: safety. We have spent so long living among stopgaps, it has become difficult to imagine our lives as anything more than provisional.\n\nBecause of the Israeli blockade, we are left to rebuild our lives with the crudest of devices, as though what follows a genocidal attack on our land is a test. To survive now, we must prove that we are deserving of life at its most primitive. With every repair, it is as if we are asking permission for a permanence that may one day allow us to build a home that preserves our dignity.\n\nIn late December, heavy rain fell across Gaza City. As we watched the sky from our home, a tentative knock came at the door. My brother-in-law and his family stood there, soaked and weary, holding in their arms their children and the few clothes they owned.\n\nTheir tent, at a shelter site west of Gaza City, had been swept away by the rain. The dirt beneath it had sunk amid the downpour, and the nylon could not hold against the wind. Our home, already too small to hold the seven of us, had suddenly turned into a refuge.\n\nMy sister-in-law, sitting on the ground, pressed one of her children against her chest, trying desperately to warm them. Her body trembled. I asked her, calmly, “What happened, exactly?” She sighed. “The rain came all at once; water seeped in from underneath the tent. We tried to lift the covers, to pull the ropes tight, but the ground had already turned to mud.”\n\nShe fell silent for a second, then whispered, “When the tent collapsed, I didn’t have a thought—I grabbed the children and ran.” I asked her if she had saved anything. “No, the blankets were flooded, the mattresses were soaked, even the food spoiled.”\n\nIn this home, there is no space to spare, no real rooms, and the cold seeps in through every crevice. Despite that, we spread out across the ground together and shared what little we had of blankets, bread, and warmth.\n\nMy sister-in-law looked around and said, “Your home is small, but it saved us.”\n\nI didn’t know what to say. The house we live in is falling apart, a shelter that requires daily repair. But in Gaza, we have stopped asking whether one has enough. The question now is only whether you can share what little you have.\n\nWe didn’t sleep well that night. The children were restless, and the sound of rainfall lasted until morning. Lying there, I thought of the thousands of families who had no door to knock on.\n\nThe tent, a temporary refuge, had become a threat. It took only rain to lay bare how fragile all of this was. Aid remains insufficient; our shelters are unsafe. We live a life deferred. Rain was once a merciful thing. Now it exposes the extent of our deprivation.\n\nIn Gaza, we exist in an interim. The impermanence of our lives has forced us into a state of constant apprehension. Even food demands an intolerable patience. Cooking gas is not available in the Strip, so we’ve been forced to build a clay oven in the corner of our home. For hours, I stand by a fire, cooking whatever food has been made available to us. Over and over, I feed wood into the opening, stir the pot, watch clouds of smoke rise and disappear. Most residents depend on such a clay oven, and so the smell of burning wood has become ubiquitous.\n\nWhen the flames flare up, a thick smoke shrouds the room. This cloud must, of course, enter my lungs before it can exit through the window. Without fail, I choke, step back for a moment to catch my breath, and return again. Gasping for air, I wonder every time whether even food now demands a breath longer than I can manage.\n\nThis daily ritual is not a choice; it’s the direct consequence of a deliberate policy. Israel denies the entry of cooking gas so that our lives remain suspended over fire, wood, and smoke.\n\nThe small quantities allowed into the Strip force an untenable financial decision. Before the war, a kilo of cooking gas was 20 shekels; today it is more than 100. It’s a price most families in Gaza cannot afford, particularly after their savings were drained by the war—an economy of destitution that has made cooking itself a health hazard.\n\nNot that there is much food for us to cook. Despite the ceasefire, Israel continues to limit the entry of food aid and other basic necessities into Gaza. As a result, hunger has become more regular than bombardment. Harsher, perhaps, in its silence and its protraction.\n\nOver the months, the realities of this siege have crept across the Strip and into our home, even into my sister’s womb.\n\nIn the middle of December, my sister gave birth to a child a few days earlier than she was expecting. Immediately, his cry was not as it should have been; his screams did not fill the room the way a newborn’s usually do. They were debilitated and fitful, as if he were apologizing for entering a world that had nothing for him.\n\nThe room fell silent after the midwife placed him on the scale. His weight was far from healthy. Startlingly thin, he weighed just over three and a half pounds. It appeared as though his skin had been pulled tight over tiny, underdeveloped bones.\n\nThe doctor looked at my nephew, and then back at my sister’s washed-out face. “This child suffered from malnutrition inside the womb. His condition is fragile. Any simple infection could threaten his life.”\n\nMy sister looked at me with eyes drowned in fear. “I could feel he was exhausted inside me,” she said. “I couldn’t eat. We lived through months of harsh hunger. Weeks went by when I couldn’t get enough food.”\n\nHer pregnancy had coincided with the worst months of the famine, between March and October 2025. My sister lived on two inadequate meals a day: lentils, dry bread, sometimes only tea to quiet her hunger. Like any pregnant woman, she needed milk, vitamins, and prenatal supplements, all of which had vanished or were impossible to obtain. Even clean drinking water was not consistently available.\n\nAfter his birth, my nephew was placed in an incubator inside a crowded hospital ward. There were barely enough machines for the newborns, and electricity was sporadic. My sister reached into the incubator and placed her finger in her baby’s palm. He held on with such unexpected strength, as if stubbornly clinging to life.\n\nHis story is not an exception. In October alone, according to UNICEF, 9,300 children in Gaza were admitted for treatment for acute malnutrition. These numbers become faces in our homes: small bodies shivering in incubators, and mothers burdened with guilt because the siege has outpaced their ability to protect their children.\n\nToday, my sister’s baby sleeps wrapped in a piece of cloth much larger than his little frame. Winter is here and every breath is measured, every day another test of survival. We are not asking for a miracle. We ask only for enough food, for milk, for something besides hunger to greet our children in this wicked world.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "description": "With now just a month to go until Election Day, the Democratic primary for US Senate in Texas has become so fraught that a TikToker’s accusations have roiled the race and prompted a major endorsement in the backlash.",
    "fullText": "With now just a month to go until Election Day, the Democratic primary for US Senate in Texas has become so fraught that a TikToker’s accusations have roiled the race and prompted a major endorsement in the backlash.\n\nThe incident started Sunday night when Morgan Thompson posted a video recounting what she says was a comment Texas state Rep. James Talarico made to her in a private conversation in January: that he called his onetime opponent, former US Rep. Colin Allred, a “mediocre Black man.”\n\nTalarico’s campaign released a statement from the candidate on Monday calling Thompson’s claims “a mischaracterization of a private conversation,” going on to explain, “I described Congressman Allred’s method of campaigning as mediocre — but his life and service are not.” Thompson acknowledged that she didn’t have a recording and that they had previously agreed to treat their conversation as off the record.\n\nBut the accusation slammed Talarico’s campaign on Monday, sending aides into a flurry and prompting Allred — who dropped out of the Senate race when Rep. Jasmine Crockett decided to make a last-minute entry — to endorse her in the intense race, despite frustrations he had in December that she had chased him out of the race by getting in. It also renewed the questions about identity politics and electability that have riven the primary and the Democratic Party more broadly.\n\nThompson alleges that Talarico, who is White, said: “I signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman.”\n\nTalarico, in his statement denying the exact wording as Thompson relayed it, said, “I understand how my critique of the Congressman’s campaign could be interpreted given this country’s painful legacy of racism, and I care deeply about the impact my words have on others.”\n\nIn an interview on Monday evening, Allred told CNN he felt the campaign’s statement is “an admission that he said what he said,” and expressed surprise that he hadn’t heard from Talarico directly.\n\n“I responded not just on my behalf, but on behalf of Black candidates around the country that even if you run six points ahead of your presidential candidate, you’re still called ‘mediocre,’” Allred said, referring to his results in the 2024 Senate race as compared to Kamala Harris in the state. (Allred outperformed Harris by about five points.)\n\nThompson told CNN that she had been turned on to Talarico’s campaign by a friend last fall and preferred him over Allred. After attending an event of his in Dallas, she started using her social media following to boost him. Talarico’s staff reached out about her video from the rally, she said, and was soon feeding her information like fundraising numbers and clips from his “Jubilee” online debate to help.\n\n“It was like a symbiotic kind of thing. I wasn’t paid by the campaign at all,” Thompson said, though, “I was in constant communication with the campaign.”\n\nThompson said the relationship started to break down after she got a fundraising text for Talarico, signed by the Democratic strategist James Carville, who has been urging Democrats to start moving away from identity politics. Thompson said she saw that as an implicit critique of Black women, and that when she raised her frustrations with the campaign, an aide offered her to have a conversation with Talarico — either on camera for her to post, or “off the record,” as what was meant to be a private conversation.\n\nShe says she opted for the less formal conversation, without a recording. But she says she remembers the exchange, which took place backstage before a town hall in Plano on January 12, very well. Thompson said she raised concerns about the association with Carville and suggested that maybe he was chasing a big name, prompting Talarico to say, “So you’re concerned about me being a sell out?” She said she told him he was overlooking the racial dynamics he’d tipped into, prompting him to say, “I have blind spots.”\n\nCampaign spokesman JT Ennis confirmed the association with Thompson — “the Talarico campaign works with lots of creators in Texas to keep them updated on the campaign,” he said — and that they did speak before the Plano event. But Ennis told CNN Talarico does not recall making either of those statements, and that his version was backed up by an aide whom both said was in the room but was not made available for an interview.\n\nThe conversation turned, Thompson said, when she mentioned to Talarico online chatter she was seeing from people wishing he had run for governor instead — an option he had considered before launching the Senate run and was urged to reconsider when Crockett jumped into the race late.\n\n“That is when he said, ‘I signed up to run against a mediocre black man, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman,’” Thompson said, “That is a direct quote.”\n\nThompson also accused Talarico’s campaign of trying to silence her, claiming that her Instagram account had disappeared and her Threads account had been suspended within minutes of when she posted a video about her claims. Thompson does not know how this would have happened, she acknowledged, given that no one on the campaign has her password, but “It’s just too many factors in play. It’s just too many abnormalities. The timing of it was so fast.”\n\nAs for Thompson’s claims about the social media accounts being closed, Ennis said, “No. We do not have that kind of power, nor would we ever do that.”\n\nShortly after Thompson’s video went viral, Allred posted his own video ripping Talarico.\n\n“Let me just give you some free advice, James,” Allred said. “If you want to compliment Black women, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.”\n\nHe also suggested Talarico, a Presbyterian seminarian, was getting unfair attention for his discussion on the campaign trail of Christianity and how Democrats can make inroads with religious voters.\n\n“We don’t need you,” he said. “You’re not saying anything unique. You’re just saying it looking like you do.”\n\nThe Senate primary is March 3. Allred is also on the ballot that day, in a House primary against Rep. Julie Johnson that he entered after leaving the Senate race.",

    "fullText": "Today, The Nation is turning over its website exclusively to stories from Gaza and its people. This is why.\n\nGaza has been suspended in a bloody limbo for months. Despite the much-hyped ceasefire between Israel and Hamas—declared on October 10, 2025—peace has not arrived in the Gaza Strip. The bombings have continued, killing at least 509 people; hunger persists; aid trickles in rather than flows; and Israel remains in control of nearly 60 percent of the terrain. Hundreds of thousands of people continue to live in threadbare tents. Meanwhile, US promises of a “technocratic governance” mask a colonial project bestowed on a people with no say.\n\nThe ceasefire has bred apathy among us—and disinterest from a press that was already turning away. According to a recent study by the media watch group FAIR, US media coverage of Gaza has fallen to its lowest three-month average since the genocide began two-and-a-half years ago. The message is clear: There’s nothing to see here.\n\nThe Nation disagrees. We believe the story of Gaza remains as essential as it was on October 9, 2025, and that those who live in its ruins are the best ones to tell it. So today, February 3, we are turning our website over to Gaza and its people in an initiative we are calling “A Day for Gaza.” There will be no work shared that is not about Gaza, and no pieces published that are not written by people who are in or from Gaza.\n\nThe writers who have shared stories with us have done so in conditions that veer toward the impossible. They have written through hunger and grief, while huddling in makeshift shelters, and while listening to the thud of still-falling bombs—and they have done so, as Engy Abdelal writes, because they want “to tell the world that [they] have a future just as… [they] have had a past.” What they have created, in the process, is not only a record of Israel’s ongoing violence but also a testament to what Gaza was—and might yet be.\n\nNation contributing writer Mohammed R. Mhawish opens the series with a piece exposing the hollowness of the ceasefire, asking, “What do you call a ceasefire agreement under which people keep dying?” It’s a question that echoes across many of the articles, including Ali Skaik’s “The Street That Refuses to Die,” which transports readers to the Colorful Block, one of the author’s favorite places in Gaza. There, Skaik introduces us to family members, old acquaintances, and a 33-year-old street philosopher who observes, “The suffering got worse after the ceasefire. The war of rockets ended, and the cold war began.”\n\nDeema Hattab also ventures out in search of what is, and what was, in “A Catalog of Gaza’s Loss,” her loving reconstruction of some of the intellectual and cultural sites that have been destroyed. And in “How to Survive in a House Without Walls,” Rasha Abou Jalal, a PhD student and writer, explains what it’s like to try to rebuild a home out of rubble and determination. In “My Sister’s Death Still Echoes Inside Me,” Asmaa Dwaima grieves the unfathomable loss of her sister, who was “present in everything, leaving traces of herself everywhere.”\n\nThe rest of the pieces (you can find the full collection here) pick up these themes and expand on them. Written by professional journalists as well as academics, poets, parents, and even a dentist, they represent the breadth of literary and political life that has persisted despite the ongoing war in Gaza. They include literary criticism, dreams, and personal testimony.\n\nIn sharing “A Day for Gaza,” we hope to breach the silence that has descended around Gaza, and to do so by offering a microphone to some of the 2 million people whose stories demand to be told. We also want to extend an invitation—and a challenge—to our colleagues across the media industry to recommit to telling the story of Gaza. We owe its people—and the hundreds of our fellow journalists who have given their lives to bring us the truth from Gaza—nothing less.\n\nCollectively, the pieces from “A Day for Gaza” embody an enduring affirmation of Gaza’s refusal, in the face of the world’s neglect, to be erased. We are honored to turn The Nation over to these writers, photographers, and thinkers, to provide a place for them to tell their stories, and we urge other media outlets to do the same.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

You can find all of the work in the series here.\n\nI used to know this block, the Colorful Block, by the sound of life.\n\nChildren’s laughter spilled from every doorway; men argued playfully over the price of tomatoes; my uncle’s supermarket—bright and packed with goods of every kind—glowed late into the night. The refrigerator hummed, the bulbs buzzed, and the air smelled like oranges and detergent.\n\nThat was before everything went dark.\n\nWhen I came back after the ceasefire, I could barely recognize the street. The neighborhood, once painted in pinks, blues, and yellows to chase away the gloom of the blockade, had turned the color of dust. My uncle’s supermarket was only a blackened frame. Where the candy aisle once stood, a twisted shopping cart now lay half-buried in rubble.\n\nPeople say the war has ended. But walking here, amid roofless rooms and doorways that open onto the sky, you understand: The war has only changed shape. The bombs have mostly stopped falling, but the silence that’s followed is its own kind of violence.\n\nSo I decided to try to breach the quiet, to walk this block—house to house, neighbor to neighbor—and ask people how they are living, what they are rebuilding, and what they are still carrying from the genocide that tried to erase us.\n\nAt the corner, Abdel Rahman Jebril, 33, stood beside what used to be his home, leaning on a stick. His left hand was wrapped in cloth, the fingers stiff.\n\n“The suffering got worse after the ceasefire,” he said quietly. “The war of rockets ended, and the cold war began—a war that burns without weapons.”\n\nHis house was hit again and again until it collapsed completely, taking his dreams with it. Now he lives in a cycle of displacement—moving from one borrowed room to another—dragging his children and what little he could salvage.\n\nHe pointed to a small photograph, edges torn: his son Jude, 6, who wanted to become an engineer, and his daughter Lia, 4, who dreamed of being a doctor. “The genocide took our homes and the futures of our children,” he said.\n\nHe looked down at his injured hand. “Sometimes I dream that I wake up and it’s healed—that the house is still standing, that the children are back in school.” He smiled weakly. “But then I wake up for real.”\n\nA little way down the block, in a half-plastered room, sat Nour al-Huda al-Nabih, 33. Stacked neatly beside her was a pile of books, all for her PhD research.\n\nShe lives alone now with her husband, Arafat. They survived, but their children, Ahmad and Rasha, did not.\n\n“Rasha was 11,” she told me, her voice steady. “She was strong, always looking after her brother. In her little will, she wrote, ‘Please don’t yell at Ahmad.’”\n\nHer eyes softened. “Ahmad was so kind. He used to share his snacks with everyone.”\n\nAfter the ceasefire, the first thing she did was visit their graves. Then she returned to her doctoral studies, researching trauma in Gaza. “When I help children smile,” she said, “I feel my own children smiling somewhere, too.”\n\nShe still finds herself in the market, reaching for the same snacks Ahmad and Rasha used to love. “Sometimes I whisper, ‘If they were here, I’d buy this for them.’”\n\nShe gestured around her unfinished room. “I feel like a queen,” she said, “because I have walls. Many people don’t even have that.”\n\nThen she looked straight at me. “My message to the world: ‘Don’t let my children become numbers. Remember their names. Gaza has always stood for the world; now the world must stand for Gaza.’”\n\nOn the sidewalk sat Mohammad Mansour, 74, wrapped in a wool scarf despite the heat.\n\n“Since the Balfour Declaration in 1917,” he began, “we’ve been living this occupation. They want a land without people. This genocide is their way of finishing the project.”\n\nHe listed what was destroyed: homes, schools, mosques. “They even turned it into a war on faith,” he said.\n\nBefore the war, $30 could fill his pantry. During the genocide, one kilo of onions cost $100. “Now prices go up and down like bombs,” he said.\n\nHe spoke of two people he’ll never forget: young Aref Abu Laban, who was killed while helping his mother pick lemons, and his old friend Mohammad al-Saidi, who had dreamed up the Colorful Block project that once made these walls bright. “He believed color could defeat despair,” Mansour said. “Now the walls are gray again, but the dream is still alive in my heart.”\n\nI met Dunya Ashour, 19, when she was taking some photos of the destruction of the New Ajjami Mosque.\n\n“I don’t feel the ceasefire,” she told me. “At night I still wake up to explosions two kilometers away, in the yellow zones. I can smell the gunpowder in the air.”\n\nShe lost her favorite teacher, Arij al-Maydana, as well as her grandfather, Jameel. “I carry their loss every day,” she said, “but I tell myself they’re in a better place.”\n\nAgainst all odds, she finished her high school exams after two years of delay. “I studied under bombardment,” she said proudly. “I got 92.4 percent.”\n\nHer family is displaced; their house is gone. “We might leave Gaza if the Rafah border opens,” she said. “But I want to come back one day as Dr. Dunya.” She will return, she often says, as the dentist who rebuilt her own smile.\n\nShe looked around the ruins. “The genocide taught me not to grieve over small things,” she said. “Every morning I wake up alive is a victory.”\n\nI talked to Montaser Tarazi, 35, in the Latin monastery church located next to the Colorful Block. Tarazi is a Christian. “After the ceasefire, things became slightly less dangerous,” he said. “I can walk to the market again without fearing I’ll die halfway. But the loss… ” He paused. “The loss walks with us.”\n\nHis best friend, Dr. Suliman Tarazi, a dentist, was killed while taking shelter in the Orthodox Church. “That strike broke something in all of us,” he said. “If even the church can be bombed, nowhere is sacred.” Montaser’s house was destroyed. For three weeks, he and his family cleared rubble by hand. “We rebuild with our fingers,” he explained. But without equipment or cement, they gave up. It was like trying to plant a tree in ashes.\n\nYet he still believes in change. “If a unity government forms, if aid finally enters without limits, maybe Gaza can breathe again,” he said. “After more than 68,000 martyrs, something in us must change forever.”\n\nAt the entrance to the block stood my maternal uncle Hassan Skaik, 29, in front of what used to be his supermarket—the same one where I once worked. “I feel both good and bad,” he told me. “Good, because the blood stopped flowing. Bad, because everything else stopped too.”\n\nHis supermarket is destroyed: the refrigerators crushed, the shelves twisted. “Before, it was full of lights and laughter,” he said. “Now I only hear my own echo.”\n\nHe lost nine friends from the Al Saqqa family in one air strike. “It still feels unreal,” he said softly.\n\nAt night, he dreams of running from fire belts. “Every night,” he said, “the same nightmare.” But he’s learning to be grateful for survival. “We’ve started from zero before,” he said. “We’ll do it again…life, even like this, is a gift.”\n\nAt the far end of the street, Mahmoud Haddad, 38, stood by a cracked water tank, his shirt soaked from work.\n\n“The only thing that changed after the ceasefire,” he said, “is that the bombs are quieter.”\n\nHe and his neighbors cleared debris from a collapsed saltwater well, trying to make it usable again. “The municipality doesn’t work,” he said, “so we do it ourselves.”\n\nThey ration water by the liter. “Drinking water costs $2 for 20 liters, if you find it,” he said. “Sometimes we share one liter for two days.”\n\nHis friend and coworker Diya Hammam was killed in the war. “He made everyone laugh,” Haddad said. “Now the whole street is silent.”\n\nHe believes the only real solution begins with education. “If the schools reopen, Gaza will start breathing again,” he said. “Without education, we’re just surviving.”\n\nKhaled Al Saqqa, 28, is one of the few survivors of his family. His mother and seven siblings were killed.\n\n“I’m the dead one,” he said. “They’re the ones alive.”\n\nEvery morning he visits the rubble of his house. “I touch the walls,” he said. “I talk to them. I tell them I’m still here.”\n\nHe recently married. He is working on setting up a tent over the rubble of his home to live in with his wife, Dareen. “Rebuilding isn’t about cement,” he said. “It’s about learning to live again.”\n\nHe looked at me with tired eyes. “The crisis isn’t in the ruins,” he said. “It’s in my heart. But every breath I take here is for them.”\n\nBeside a torn canvas tent, I found Jamal al-Aklouk, 64, sitting on a plastic chair.\n\n“I retired three years ago,” he said. “Bought my dream home. Thought I’d die in peace there.” The home is gone now; he lives in this tent.\n\nThe destruction of Gaza’s mosques wounded him deeply. “I prayed near the rubble of the Great Omari Mosque,” he said. “Right then, I got a call—my grandson Ahmad was martyred. He was 7.”\n\nHe still carries the pain in his legs from running 17 hours from tanks. “I can’t sleep from the ache,” he said, “but I remind myself—if I can feel it, I’m still alive.”\n\nHe gazed at the sunset. “Everything passes,” he said. “Only faith remains.”\n\nAt the end of the lane stood Saeeh Al Haddad, hammering nails into a wooden frame. He was in Israeli prisons for 19 years and was released in the prisoner exchange deal in January 2025.\n\n“In prison, I lost my freedom,” he said. “But at least there, I was still alive. Out here, freedom feels like rubble.”\n\nHe refused to flee during the war. “When the genocide ended, a new battle began—the fight to adapt.” He lost his brother, Mohammed, his brother’s wife, and his sister’s family. “I carry them with me every day,” he said.\n\nNow he’s rebuilding what he can and planning his wedding. “One day,” he said, “Gaza will be rebuilt more beautifully than before. People will say, “Is this the same Gaza that was turned to dust?”\n\nHe smiled, eyes glistening. “The world needs Gaza,” he said, “to learn how people can build hope from nothing.”\n\nWhen night falls in the Zeitoun neighborhood, the street glows again—not with electricity but with firelight. Families cook lentils on makeshift stoves; children chase shadows with tin cans for toys. The scent of smoke mixes with sea air and memory.\n\nI stop at the ruins of the supermarket. The tiles are cracked, but if I close my eyes, I can still hear my uncle calling, “Cold slash! Come before it’s gone!”\n\nHe was right. Everything is gone.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, everyone is still here.\n\nEach neighbor carries a piece of Gaza’s story—a mosaic of grief, faith, and stubborn hope. They are rebuilding not just homes, but the meaning of life itself.\n\nIn this neighborhood, the war may have paused, but it has not ended. Still, the people refuse to disappear.\n\nBefore I leave, I see a boy running through the rubble, barefoot, laughing, a kite made from a plastic aid bag fluttering behind him. It catches the last light of the setting sun.\n\nFor a second, it feels like color has returned.\n\nThe street is broken, silent, waiting.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "These pictures are records of a genocidal war, but they are something more, too—they are fragments of Gaza itself\n\nThis piece is part of A Day for Gaza, an initiative in which The Nation has turned over its website exclusively to voices from the Gaza Strip. You can find all of the work in the series here.\n\nIn Gaza, the camera lens does not merely capture a scene. It documents the human spirit resisting death. And for Gaza’s photographers, every shutter click is an act of defiance. Each image carries risk, memory, and moral weight. They photograph through smoke and mourning, through hunger and destruction, and through the ache of watching the people they love become the subjects of their work.\n\nThroughout the Israeli genocide, Gaza’s photographers have become archivists of loss and of life. Their pictures are records of a genocidal war, but they are something more, too—they are fragments of Gaza itself, windows into our collective soul. Through their eyes, we see not only death and devastation, but dignity, defiance, and love that refuses to die.\n\nLate last year, The Nation asked eight photographers from Gaza to choose one picture from the recent past that carried particular significance for them, and to tell us why they’d picked it, when and where it was taken, and what story it tells. This is what they returned with.\n\nSamer Abo Samra, 27, is a freelance photographer. He took this photo on October 29, 2025, at 8:00 am outside the morgue at Gaza’s Al-Shifa Medical Complex following a “massacre that occurred during the Israeli occupation’s breach of the truce that killed about 100 civilians—mostly children and women.”\n\nIn the photo, a grieving father, Mahmoud Shakshak, bids farewell to his children—Sara and Fadi—who were just killed in an Israeli air strike. He was kissing Sara’s foot when Abo Samra took the picture.\n\n“The screams, the disbelief—it was unbearable,” Abo Samra told The Nation. “The father whispered: ‘Last night I bathed you, dressed you in new clothes… Fadi, you wore your Spider-Man shirt… you were so happy. You’ve gone now to a better world. I’ll never see you again.’”\n\n“That scene killed me,” Abo Samra said. “I felt like the camera was crying, and I felt helpless. I’ve captured many powerful images during the genocide—displacement, destruction—but this one broke me.”\n\nFor Abo Samra, the photo is a testament to the “betrayal of a ‘truce’ that was supposed to protect people,” but instead became a cover for a massacre. “It’s a cry from Gaza to the world,” he said. “These children weren’t numbers. They were joy, laughter, and love, stolen from their father’s hands.”\n\nAnas Fteiha, 31, is a photographer for Anadolu Agency. On March 19, 2025, he took this picture of Mohammad Hijazi, a 7-year-old from Jabalia who had fled south with his family during the genocide. While playing outside, Hijazi came across an unexploded remnant of war. It detonated. One of his eyes had to be removed; the other no longer sees.\n\n“When I took his picture, I realized—this child will never see his own reflection again,” Fteiha says. “It was the first time I photographed someone who had lost his sight completely.”\n\nHe remembers his trembling hands as he focused the camera. “He smiled at the sound of the shutter,” Fteiha recalls. “He thought I was taking his picture so he could ‘see it later.’ That broke me.”\n\n“We take sight for granted. For Mohammad, the world is now forever dark and colorless. But his courage is the brightest thing I’ve ever witnessed.”\n\nKhames Al-Refi, 23, is a freelance photographer for Anadolu Agency. On September 16, 2025, he followed Gaza’s civil defense crews to a collapsed house in the Al-Tuffah neighborhood in Gaza City. Beneath the rubble was 10-year-old Mayar Al-Wahidi.\n\nHer father had been killed a week earlier. Her mother had just been martyred in the strike that destroyed the house. But Mayar emerged covered in dust, silent, alive.\n\n“From 2 am until 8 am, they dug,” Al-Refi recalled to The Nation. “When they pulled Mayar out alive, her eyes looked like someone reborn.”\n\n“I’d never crawled under debris before,” Al-Refi said. “At that moment, I wasn’t a journalist—I was part of the rescue.” He stayed with Mayar in the hospital afterward, unable to detach emotionally. “She felt like family,” he said softly. “I still have her number.”\n\nMoatasem Abu Aser, 30, is a documentary filmmaker and photographer. “I chose this photo because behind it lies a vast story—about the violation of women’s rights in Gaza and the layered suffering they endure,” he said.\n\nHe met the woman in this photo by accident on September 11, 2025, near Al-Samer Junction in central Gaza. She had just given birth to twins while living with her mother-in-law and other children on a sidewalk, under a torn tarp, which was attacked by stray dogs at night.\n\n“She asked me to document her story,” Abu Aser told The Nation. “She hadn’t eaten or drunk in days when she was pregnant. One of her newborn twins died of starvation.”\n\nThe image shows her exhausted, eyes hollow, holding her surviving baby.\n\n“When I saw her, I felt powerless,” Abu Aser said. “I couldn’t offer food or shelter. I could only capture her truth. She is like our mothers, our sisters. Her suffering speaks for every woman who bears the cost of genocide and survival.”\n\nMohammed Al-Aswad, 28, is a freelance photographer. “I chose this image,” he said, “because it captures the essence of life clinging to existence amid devastation during the genocide.”\n\nThe photo was taken in November 2023 in the Beit Lahia area, moments after a heavy bombardment. It shows an ambulance racing toward Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Jabalia.\n\n“The air was thick with dust and fear,” Al-Aswad recalled. “The drones were still buzzing above, and the roads were choked with debris. Every step felt like a gamble with death—but I knew I had to capture that moment. It was the battle between annihilation and survival.”\n\nLooking through his lens, Al-Aswad saw more than chaos; he saw defiance. “The ambulance cutting through destruction—it was life fighting to exist,” he said. “That image is my reminder that even under the weight of genocide, humanity refuses to die.”\n\nSuhail Nassar, 30, took this picture, which he called “The Great Return to Gaza,” on January 27, 2025, days after the first extended ceasefire with Israel had been declared.\n\n“It wasn’t just a photograph,” he told The Nation. “It was a statement. A collective heartbeat returning home.”\n\nNassar had returned to his destroyed house in Gaza City with his brother. Around them, survivors embraced and cried amid shattered concrete and silent streets.\n\n“It was the strangest joy,” he said. “We weren’t afraid. We felt as if our souls had finally reunited with the land. Every breath was nostalgia—every ruin, a memory.”\n\nThough Nassar said returning to his home “was the best feeling of my life,” the day was still marked by sadness. “When I stood there, I could almost hear the voices of friends we’d lost. The happiness was pierced by their absence. The city was still wounded.”\n\nOmar El-Qattaa, 35, is a photographer for Agence France-Presse. He took this picture on April 23, 2024, in the Al-Mokhabarat Towers area in Northern Gaza, at the peak of the Israeli-induced famine. It captures a swarm of desperate civilians chasing food dropped from the sky.\n\n“It was a picture of humiliation,” El-Qattaa said. “People fighting over bags thrown from airplanes—like crumbs for birds…there was no aid, no food, nothing but air-drops. I watched people run, fall, hit each other—just to feed their children.”\n\nEl-Qattaa was not simply an uninterested observer. “I was starving too, unable to secure food for my children,” he recalled. “That day, someone shared biscuits with me for them.”\n\nOmar Ashtawy, 21, is a photographer for APAimages and a freelancer with Reuters, UPI, and the DPA Picture Alliance. He took this photo on May 14, 2025, in Jabalia. It shows a crowd with outstretched hands, metal bowls gleaming in the dust.\n\n“I chose this photo because it captures human pain in its rawest form,” he said. “It was not just people holding empty pots and hungry—it was about dignity.”\n\nDust filled the air; people ran with bowls, lids, or anything that could hold a portion of food. Ashtawy stood among them, the camera feeling unbearably heavy. “I was weak, dizzy from hunger like everyone else,” he said. “The cries of children echoed in my head. Each shot felt like betrayal—I was recording pain I shared.”\n\nAshtawy felt the weight of the camera as “a tool carrying a responsibility greater than my ability.”\n\n“I felt anger,” he said. “Anger at a world that lets people beg for life. But I also felt a duty to show the truth before it disappears.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "Faced with endlessly narrowing possibilities, I return to my diary in an attempt to dream, to imagine a future.\n\nThis piece is part of A Day for Gaza, an initiative in which The Nation has turned over its website exclusively to voices from the Gaza Strip. You can find all of the work in the series here.\n\nThis diary entry was written shortly after a ceasefire was declared. I wrote this between the sounds of bombardment and shellfire, but also between dreams of study and families reunited. This is not a story of individual survival, but an attempt to encapsulate a generation that has lived the war in all its horror and, at the same time, insists on dreaming:\n\nThe war began the week of my 26th birthday. There was a lightness on that day, something born from what remained of our childhood. Sparks like candy, crackling in our mouths: colorful letters; laughter leaking out through voice notes; hearts adorning our text chats; an abundance of cake. But the days that followed are laid out like burnt matchsticks; once the first one was lit, the flames consumed the rest. The war spared nothing on the calendar; I have had no other birthdays since.\n\nI am trying to put this all behind me. I am trying to extricate myself from those heavy details, to move forward. I want a future whose sky does not tend toward warplanes. I want a future severed from whatever “The Strip” has come to mean. A truthful and hopeful future where there is no Strip.\n\nThere is a dream I have held. A wave breaks on the shores of Accre before bending towards Jaffa, and I am suddenly on a small motorboat. We are chanting first, then laughing. Sweet sounds drown out the roar of the engine. My grandmother used to speak of this place—the Bride of the Sea—a wide, blue, expanse that did not always look out toward barbed enclosures.\n\nI want a future whose sky does not tend toward warplanes. I want a future severed from whatever “The Strip” has come to mean. A truthful and hopeful future where there is no Strip.\n\nWe step off at the harbor and walk toward those old houses whose balconies sway along the seashore. A familiar scent weeps: A vendor is selling Kaa’ak. He welcomes me in our Gazan dialect, his voice thick with familiar reassurance, and I run my fingers along the sesame seeds. “Mati’la’qish,” he says, don’t worry. This is a scene too familiar to be cliché. It is a fixture entrenched in our minds, an inheritance so ubiquitous that it could never be encountered for the first time.\n\nIn this dream, I’m home by nightfall. I’m incessantly chatty, desperate to announce a happiness to my mother that cannot contain itself. I doze off considering this miracle: to have reached those two cities not through a search engine or some anthropological study, but to have taken the short journey that began in a harbor and ended, again, with Gaza’s embrace. Two halves of the proverbial orange mended in the tenet of Return.\n\nNext, I gather my three sisters. Exile has scattered us across a distance far greater than what appears on a map. This reunion is endless, as if time itself is finally atoning for every dinner table that was not whole, every celebratory occasion that was incomplete, every moment we chased their garbled voices through an international call. We sit in a single house, their bodies squished onto a couch made only for two. I sit on the floor circling the children: Eileen, Ahmad, Tamim, Elias. We whisper the names of different fast foods we plan on ordering—careful so my mother doesn’t catch us. She who has always been careful to feed us only what is good for the body. I tell them stories of those nations that passed through us and those dreams that passed us by, an appraisal of the years that have somehow managed to continue without them. I steal a piece of chocolate from each of the children and slip it into my pocket. Small testimonies that a family, no matter how scattered, can gather again, can gather only in a city known by the stories we tell of it.\n\nI have come to the end of today’s lines. I have a sense that this is not so much a record of a dream deferred but a test of my imagination, a measure of my ability to envision a life despite all that has tried to uproot us.\n\nFrom my window I can see Gaza as it is now: weary, exhausted, bent in prayer and desperate for salvation. But there remains life; the capacity to dream, to hope, to resist. These diaries are not a comfort. They are an attempt to tell the world that I have a future just as you may understand that I have had a past. We come from a land that ought to be seen, not captured. A life that is deserving of more than rubble, while they take their warring turns on us.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

You can find all of the work in the series here\n\n“These certificates were supposed to open doors, not remind me of what I’ve lost,” says Hamada Abu Layla, 45, holding his three university degrees.\n\nIt is January, 2026, more than 90 days after the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and Abu Layla is standing amid piles of garbage bags in Al-Yarmuk, a dump in central Gaza City; it has been his family’s home for the past few months. Unable to return to Beit Lahia, where he once lived, he spent days searching Gaza City for vacant land to pitch his tent on. After finding none, he finally erected it inside Al-Yarmuk.\n\n“It’s very bad—a pure health hazard where all of Gaza’s waste gets dumped,” he says.\n\nAbu Layla lives in Al-Yarmuk with his wife and five children. They share the site with rodents, insects, snakes, and stray dogs that pound the fabric walls at night, terrifying the children and keeping them from sleeping. His children have developed skin rashes from insects.\n\nOnce, less than two-and-a-half years ago, Abu Layla had his own apartment—in a building where his parents and siblings also lived—and spent his days lecturing at Gaza’s Islamic Da’wa College. As a younger man, he graduated first in Palestine in Islamic Sharia from this university, and then went on to earn diplomas in information technology and mathematics.\n\nBut the war has taken all of this from him. The Israeli army bombed his Beit Lahia apartment building, killing both his parents and his siblings, and only Abu Layla, his immediate family, and one brother survived. They fled without burying the dead, who remained under rubble, and have not been able to return. Beit Lahia, which lies behind the “yellow line,” is now under Israeli military control.\n\nAlso lost to the rubble are Abu Layla’s professional dreams: the days he spent lecturing to students, passing down his knowledge to the next generations. His credentials, earned over 22 years, mock him from a trash heap.\n\nNow, instead of teaching students, Abu Layla’s work consists of survival: “I stand in water lines and charity kitchens for food. It’s mentally and physically exhausting, but I must do it to keep my children alive.” It’s the same routine that most Gazans are forced to perform.\n\n“I imagine I’m living inside a nightmare and can’t wake up,” he says. “Before the war I had a house, family, good social and economic situation. That’s the past now.”\n\nAbu Layla is among the survivors of Gaza’s devastated intellectual class. Before the war, Gaza was known as a famously education-focused society, with a literacy rate of nearly 97 percent and a storied intellectual tradition. Seventeen universities and colleges sprawled across the Strip, many with multiple campuses, educating the next generation of Palestinians. For these students, as well as for their teachers, college wasn’t just a way station on the way to a career but a commitment born out of the deep conviction that learning is a tool of resilience—a means to preserve national identity, a fundamental investment in human development, and a promise to the future despite poverty and blockade.\n\nBut the war destroyed much of that, silencing some of the brightest intellectual minds while knocking down the institutions that had once nurtured them. Of the 5,102 people who worked in higher education before the war, at least 1,112 (or 22 percent)—including 345 women—were killed, detained, or injured, according to a November 2025 UNESCO assessment. Israel’s bombs also obliterated 22 of Gaza’s 38 campuses, while damaging almost all of the remaining ones. The attacks on these institutions of higher education were so unrelenting—and appeared so targeted—that as early as April 2024, experts from the United Nations were warning that they might constitute scholasticide.\n\n“These attacks are not isolated incidents,” more than 20 UN experts said in a statement. “They present a systematic pattern of violence aimed at dismantling the very foundation of Palestinian society.”\n\nNow, amid the slightly lessened horror of the ceasefire, those educators who survived the worst of the war are tasked with figuring out how to rebuild that foundation. And they are tasked with doing so in a landscape in which survival itself remains a struggle.\n\nDeath is still a constant threat in Gaza—death from Israel’s bombs as well as from bitter weather, dangerous living conditions, and an enduring health crisis. And rebuilding remains stalled as Israel continues to control the borders into and out of Gaza, restricting the flow of aid and construction materials. Palestinian government statistics show Israel has permitted only 43 percent of the 60,000 aid trucks required to meet Gaza’s actual needs. With so few resources, subsistence, let alone building back Gaza’s treasured education system, is a challenge.\n\n“Higher education in Gaza today fights for survival, not development,” says Abdel Hamid Al-Yaqoubi, an official at Palestine’s Ministry of Higher Education.\n\nAmid so much privation and instability, Abu Layla’s situation is far from unusual; suffering extends across Gaza’s academic community.\n\nWhen the war escalated, most universities placed staff on unpaid leave, meaning that most received no salaries. With students unable to pay their tuition fees, the universities were unable to pay their faculties and administrators. And many still cannot.\n\nTawfig Abu Jarad, director of public relations at Gaza University, says he knows of professors who were forced to sell vegetables to provide for their families. “Imagine a university professor accustomed to standing in lecture halls before students, now standing behind a vegetable stand with one of his former students shopping in front of him.”\n\nAs the situation has stabilized slightly since the ceasefire, there have been modest attempts at returning to in-person and hybrid education at some institutions. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education has been working with international partners like UNESCO to reorganize education through digital systems like the Virtual Campus, and the ministry held meetings with Gaza university presidents to support education continuity and overcome challenges. UNESCO has also created Temporary Learning Spaces in Khan Younis and Deir Al Balah, where students can access digital resources—many lost their computers during the most extreme phases of the war, and Internet access remains spotty—as well as psychosocial support.\n\nThese are crucial efforts to get a generation of students back to college, back to graduate programs. But even amid this progress, the challenges remain overwhelming. “Online education doesn’t meet students’ aspirations, especially in engineering and medical specializations requiring laboratories and in-person instruction,” says Abu Jarad.\n\nMoreover, even these limited efforts reach only a fraction of Gaza’s 88,000 higher-education students—and put only a limited number of professors back to work.\n\nSo far, Abu Layla has not been one of them.\n\nAs he stands in Al-Yarmuk dump, looking at his certificates earned through two decades of study and effort, he feels a pummeling sense of loss. “I spent my money, sweat, and effort to reach a respectable position in society, not to live next to a trash heap,” he says.\n\nHe tries to retain hope, imagining a time when “the beautiful days will return, when I see myself in my rebuilt house, and my children going to their schools.” But he’s not naïve, and he knows that time is still a ways off. He understands the present,\n\n“As long as we live in tents, haven’t returned to our homes, our children’s schools are destroyed, we feel no security or stability, the army occupies Gaza areas, and crossings remain closed,” he says, “the war hasn’t ended.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "The language of ceasefire has been repurposed in Gaza: It no longer describes a pause in violence but rather a mechanism for managing it.\n\nThis piece is part of A Day for Gaza, an initiative in which The Nation has turned over its website exclusively to voices from the Gaza Strip. You can find all of the work in the series here.\n\nWhat do you call a ceasefire agreement under which people keep dying? That is the question the people of Gaza have been asking themselves for the past few months.\n\nIn October, Hamas and Israel signed a peace deal supposedly intended to stop two years of slaughter in Gaza. Since then, more than 420 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire—an average of about four people a day—in what international mediators continue to describe as a successful de-escalation. The distance between that official narrative and the facts on the ground reveals how the language of ceasefire has been repurposed: It no longer describes a pause in violence but rather a mechanism for managing it, sanitizing ongoing military force under the guise of restraint.\n\nThose killed—many of them women and children—have been routinely described as threats, trespassers, or collateral casualties of the enforcement of the ceasefire. This has included families attempting to return to their homes, only to find their neighborhoods designated as off-limits beyond an ever-shifting “yellow line” drawn by Israel. Palestinian health officials have documented more than a thousand Israeli violations since the ceasefire took effect, including air strikes, artillery fire, and fatal shootings. The ceasefire has thus functioned precisely as intended: a framework for killing and controlling Palestinians at a slower, more diplomatically acceptable pace.\n\nThe yellow line—which theoretically demarcates the boundaries of Israel’s physical occupation of Gaza—is perhaps the clearest symbol of this semantic ceasefire. It’s a border that exists on maps and in military briefings but means nothing to people trying to survive in what’s left of their homes. The line’s position keeps shifting, and neighborhoods that were supposed to be accessible are now military zones—including huge parts of eastern Gaza City, all under intensifying Israeli presence despite the supposed pullback. Israeli forces reserve the right to shoot anyone who crosses it. For Palestinians living on the wrong side, it marks an ever-shrinking corner of Gaza where Israeli control keeps expanding.\n\nIsrael now maintains a military presence in more than half of the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire was meant to include Israeli withdrawals and the return of displaced Palestinians to their neighborhoods. Instead, the Israeli army has been demolishing homes and infrastructure in northern Gaza, pushing the yellow line deeper into territory it’s supposed to have vacated.\n\nAll of this has occurred during the first phase of what was supposed to be a comprehensive peace plan. The phase included specific commitments: 600 aid trucks entering Gaza daily, the opening of the Rafah crossing, Israeli forces pulling back to predesignated positions, Israeli hostages released, and Palestinian prisoners exchanged. Some of that happened in the initial days—living hostages came home, and Palestinian prisoners were released. But within weeks, aid trucks were cut to numbers much below the amount needed, Rafah was closed again, and Israeli strikes ramped up. The gap between what was promised and what’s been delivered shows the fundamental disconnect between a ceasefire framework built on mutual concessions and a reality where one side retains total military control.\n\nThe second phase of the deal—the one that would involve Hamas disarming, further Israeli withdrawals, and the establishment of a “Board of Peace” to oversee Gaza’s reconstruction—has just been announced by President Trump. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, has been appointed to lead the day-to-day operations of the reconstruction. International figures have been assembled, with Palestinian technocrats chosen to lead a future interim administration. It all sounds very official and organized. But scratch the surface and the hollowness of these announcements becomes clear. Israel is still arguing about the terms of the second phase, while Palestinians keep dying in what’s technically peacetime. The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains catastrophic. Famine conditions had improved slightly after the ceasefire, but that could change in a heartbeat. The fragility of the deal is becoming more concrete, as Israel continues to ban more than 30 aid organizations from operating in Gaza, including Doctors Without Borders and Oxfam. Huge parts of the aid infrastructure are now gone. In other words, the conditions required for the second phase to begin are nowhere to be found.\n\nThis is what a ceasefire looks like when the international community settles for calling something peace because it’s technically less violent than what came before.\n\nFor Gaza’s people, nearly all displaced, living in damaged buildings or makeshift shelters, the distinction between war and ceasefire has become academic.\n\nThis may be the best arrangement Palestinians can expect under the current framework—a managed status quo that staggers on while satisfying no one. Displacement, insecurity, and death continue, just at a pace that doesn’t trigger international intervention. Israeli forces justify their lethality as a security response to Palestinian provocations. What matters is that this managed level of devastation is low enough to preserve the ceasefire’s diplomatic framework but high enough to maintain tactical pressure. Through it, Israel allows continued military presence without the political costs of full-scale war.\n\nWhat makes this arrangement so revealing is that it represents the international community’s definition of success. This is what ending the Gaza war looks like: reduced daily death tolls, intermittent aid delivery, partial hostage releases. The UN Security Council endorsed this framework, deployed monitors to oversee compliance, and granted it legal legitimacy. The gap between war and peace has narrowed to a question of pace rather than principle—the same military control and displacement, with the same structural killing machine, just calibrated to a level that allows diplomatic progress to be claimed. Gaza knows the distinction between phases matters less than the continuity of conditions. The framework succeeds because it renders suffering sustainable in a way that’s bad enough to continue but controlled enough to ignore.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "description": "The Patriots’ defensive coordinator made his first public appearance since his cancer diagnosis at Super Bowl Opening Night.",
    "fullText": "Drake Maye commanded the biggest crowd during the New England Patriots’ appearance at Super Bowl Opening Night on Monday. Mike Vrabel and Stefon Diggs also drew plenty of attention at their respective spots on the risers, as did other big-name players.\n\nTerrell Williams, meanwhile, was not as prominently featured. He did not have a riser, nor any fixed cameras watching his every action over the 60-minute period. And yet, interest in him was still substantial.\n\nFor good reason, too: the 51-year-old made his first public appearance since leaving the team with a cancer diagnosis in late September. Having recently been found cancer-free, he joined the Patriots on their trip to Super Bowl LX against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nWilliams will not resume his full duties as defensive coordinator yet. However, he will continue keeping a close eye on a unit that has delivered some uplifting moments for him amid personal challenge.\n\n“It’s been joyous for me just to watch them, and watch them develop and watch them buy into the message that [Mike Vrabel] is preaching,” Williams said. “Trust me, I’ve been in this game a long time and it’s not easy to get people these days to buy in. Vrabes has that unique ability to get them to do that. That’s the fun thing to watch. I know exactly what he’s telling them.”\n\nHead coach Mike Vrabel has been vital in guiding the Patriots in 2025, but assistant Zak Kuhr also filled a critical role with Williams sidelined. The inside linebackers coach took over as defensive play-caller and de facto coordinator.\n\nTheir ability to adapt on the fly has allowed the Patriots to not skip a beat defensively. For Williams, it all comes back to the staff chasing a common goal — and to Kuhr being up to the task as well.\n\n“We all believe in the same things. The message has been the same throughout, from the time we got there to the time we met today,” Williams said.\n\n“So, whether it’s Zak, or whether it’s Scott Booker, or whoever it is, we’re all preaching the same message. Sometimes, when you coach in this league, you’ve got coaches who are pulling in different directions. Everybody has a motive. The only motive for us was to improve. Not to win, but to improve. We figured that the improvement would come, but Zak has done an unbelievable job.”\n\nFor Kuhr, moving into an elevated role early in the regular season was not entirely unfamiliar. He had also filled in for Williams during the offseason, when the nominal DC spent three months away from the team due to an unrelated medical condition.\n\nNonetheless, the Patriots defense and its coaches kept chugging along. In the postseason, the group has played its best football to date.\n\nLeading the way is Zak Kuhr, and the Patriots offensive coordinator is happy to see it.\n\n“I’m proud of him,” said Williams. “I’m looking forward to him calling this game on Sunday.”",

    "description": "Four years ago, the \"Commanders\" were born. It's an anniversary that most Washington fans would like to forget.",
    "fullText": "\"We are the Commanders,\" announced former Redskins quarterback Doug Williams.\n\nThat was on February 2, 2022, on NBC's Today Show, with then-team president Jason Wright overseeing how the name would be announced. Wright was there along with Williams and defensive tackle Jonathan Allen. When it came time for the big unveiling, Wright boringly turned to Williams and said, \"Doug, what is it?\" Williams then spoke those unfortunate words, \"We are the Commanders.\"\n\nWright had been hired and was immediately trying to demonstrate a great vocabulary, assuring his listeners of his past success and business acumen. It was all presentation. \"Image is everything\" to the impressionable. Wright, who was in charge of the franchise's business side, then displayed, for three years, an abundance of oversight failures as one thing after another on the business side became increasingly disappointing.\n\nOwner Daniel Snyder and Wright originally came up with something really \"creative\" after dumping \"Redskins,\" which had been the team name since 1933. The two geniuses came up with the \"Washington Football Team.\"\n\nImagine that an NFL football team named itself the \"Football Team.\" Of course, it was mocked and ridiculed by many across the nation. The two guys who thought they were smarter than everyone else they employed had managed to make Washington the only NFL team without an official mascot. Think about it. Isn't it still hard to believe they never saw that as a major red flag?\n\n— Mauro Rmz (@ArconsaRmz) February 2, 2022\n\nHow did we get to \"Commanders\"? Early, Wright announced the team would never return to \"Redskins.\" Then he announced that \"Warriors\" would never be considered. This was ironic because \"Warriors\" was the first name that many in the fan base had expressed excitement about on social media. Then Wright said \"Wolves\" was also ruled out as was \"Redwolves\" though, that too had generated fan interest.\n\nWright had some hired hands (now gone) who somehow saw \"Commanders\" as the suitable replacement for \"Redskins.\" They, like Wright, showed little to no appreciation for the franchise's history. Wright got rid of the franchise's historic throwbacks and introduced alternate uniforms that had absolutely nothing to do with Redskins' history. It was all clearly intentional.\n\nBut then Wright even went a step further, when he claimed, \"Commanders was \"something that broadly resonated with our fans.\" He smoothly slipped that claim into his presentation. Did it? To this day, how many in the fan base have you met who suggested and supported \"Commanders\" before the announcement?\n\nAh yes, February 2, 2022 (2-2-22) four years ago Monday... is the name any better today?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Four years ago, new name was revealed",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants have suffered another setback in their search for an offensive coordinator, as Davis Webb has opted to remain with the Denver Broncos in a promotion rather than join the team in East Rutherford.\n\nWebb, a former Giants third-round draft pick in 2017 who started one game for Big Blue in the 2022 season finale, interviewed for the vacant OC position under new head coach John Harbaugh.\n\nThe Giants requested the interview in late January, viewing Webb's rising reputation -- bolstered by his work developing quarterbacks like Russell Wilson and Bo Nix in Denver -- as a strong fit for guiding young signal-caller Jaxson Dart.\n\nHowever, on Monday, the Broncos promoted Webb from passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach to offensive coordinator, filling the vacancy created by the recent firing of Joe Lombardi following Denver's deep playoff run.\n\nSources: Denver’s passing game coordinator Davis Webb has reached agreement to become the Broncos’ offensive coordinator. Webb interviewed for three head coaching jobs during this hiring cycle, had other offensive coordinator opportunities, but opted to remain with the Broncos. pic.twitter.com/pYVZTJPNWD\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) February 2, 2026\n\nThis decision allows Webb to stay under head coach Sean Payton, another ex-Giant, where he has thrived since joining the staff in 2023 after retiring from playing.\n\nThe Giants had hoped to pair Harbaugh with Todd Monken, his former OC in Baltimore, but Monken took the Cleveland Browns head coaching job. The team has conducted virtual interviews with other candidates, including Jim Bob Cooter, Kliff Kingsbury, Brian Callahan, and Alex Tanney, with in-person meetings expected soon for finalists.\n\nWhile Webb's familiarity with the organization and his offensive acumen made him an intriguing option, his choice to accept the Broncos' promotion leaves the Giants continuing their pursuit of a proven play-caller to elevate the offense.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Davis Webb won't become New York Giants' OC, opts to remain in Denver",

    "fullText": "New Roma signing Bryan Zaragoza says the opportunity to join the Giallorossi came ‘from one day to another’ and can’t wait to debut at the Stadio Olimpico: ‘Lazio games don’t even come close.’\n\nRoma signed Zaragoza from Bayern Munich on loan with an option to buy on deadline day.\n\nThe Spanish winger, 24, had spent the first part of the campaign on loan at Celta Vigo.\n\nBryan Zaragoza with Roma director Frederic Massara (asroma.com)\n\n“It happened from one day to another. I was told Roma was an option, and I never had any doubt and said I wanted to come,” the Spaniard said in his first interview with Roma.\n\n“I want to thank the club, the owners, and everyone for giving me this opportunity.\n\n“I have high expectations; I want to be important in this club and win titles. I hope we can return to the Champions League.”\n\nScorer of two goals in 26 appearances across all competitions in the first half of 2025-26, Zaragoza can’t wait to play under Gian Piero Gasperini.\n\n“I know Gasperini because I really liked how his team played last season. It seemed very attractive to me. They played the ball really well, and I can’t wait to start this journey and see what it can give me to learn with him,” he said.\n\n“I’ve always liked to dribble, like street football. It’s one of my qualities.\n\n“I don’t know much about Rome; I’ve never been there before, but people say great things about the city. I come with a great desire to know everything and stay a long time here.”\n\nZaragoza has already met Roma star Paulo Dybala at Trigoria.\n\n“I met him as soon as I arrived at the training centre and spoke to him. He’s a great player, and I like the idea of sharing the dressing room with him,” he said.\n\n“In Spain and Germany, I couldn’t pick numbers higher than 25,” he explained.\n\n“Here, I was attracted by the idea of getting a higher number. I liked the 97, and my family and I decided it was what we wanted to pick.\n\nVIGO, SPAIN – OCTOBER 23: Bryan Zaragoza of RC Celta de Vigo warms up prior to the UEFA Europa League 2025/26 League Phase MD3 match between Real Club Celta and OGC Nice at Estadio Abanca Balaidos on October 23, 2025 in Vigo, Spain. (Photo by Jose Manuel Alvarez Rey/Getty Images)\n\n“I’ve played in the Liga and Bundesliga. I had not thought about coming to Serie A; it happened suddenly. I can’t wait to start and learn this league with great players and clubs. It’s a difficult league, but I’ll try to be successful.”\n\nZaragoza made his senior Spain debut in 2023 and has one goal in three appearances under his belt. Naturally, he hopes that his time in Roma will help him get a spot in the squad for the 2026 World Cup.\n\n“Yes, last season I was quite involved, regardless of my injury,” he said.\n\n“This season it hasn’t happened yet, but I hope the chance will come soon. To be at the World Cup is one of my targets.”\n\nZaragoza has already seen the Olimpico when he was at Bayern Munich, as he was an unused substitute in a Champions League match in 2024.\n\n“It doesn’t even come close because that day I played against Lazio, but I think playing against Roma or Lazio doesn’t feel the same,” he admitted.\n\n“I want to see the Olimpico full of Roma fans and feel their passion. I can’t wait to make my debut in this stadium, and my biggest desire is to debut with a win. If I even score, I’d be perfect.”",

    "fullText": "Lazio were the biggest spenders in Serie A during the winter transfer window, while Juventus were the only club not to spend a penny as they secured Jeremie Boga and Emil Holm on free loan deals.\n\nThe winter transfer window for Serie A clubs ended on Monday, February 2, so it’s time to review the activity of every team in Italy’s top flight, including how much they spent over the last month.\n\nLECCE, ITALY – JANUARY 24: Kenneth Taylor of SS Lazio during the Serie A match between US Lecce and SS Lazio at Stadio Via del Mare on January 24, 2026 in Lecce, Italy.

    "fullText": "Laces came out roaring and ready to reassert sole (or Solemates’?) claim to first place in the Unrivaled standings on Monday night. Yet, their eventual 67-62 win over Mist would not be as easy as it might have looked early on.\n\nUp 15-8 after a defensively-tilted first quarter, Laces maintained a comfortable margin as the offenses came alive in the second, up by nine points, 36-27, at the half. Alyssa Thomas already had tallied a double-double for the Solemates, with 10 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nwe got a BATTLE in on TNT rn 👀 pic.twitter.com/0fiFIXWj3l\n\n— Unrivaled Basketball (@Unrivaledwbb) February 3, 2026\n\nThe third quarter, however, belonged to Mist. And more specifically, it belonged to Arike Ogunbowale.\n\nOgunbowale ignited for one of her signature scoring eruptions, responsible for 12 of Mist’s 27 points in the period. Supported by a couple of 3s from Breanna Stewart and Veronica Burton, Mist was down by just a single point entering the fourth, 55-54. A late Thomas free throw gave Laces the lead after seven-straight points from Ogunbowale and Allisha Gray had pushed Mist ahead.\n\nWhen the fourth began, Laces would expand on that slight edge.\n\nNaz Hillmon, who had just three points through three quarters, scored the first six points for Laces, which were balanced by a single bucket from Mist. Naz’s efforts put Laces just five points away from the 66-point target score.\n\nA triple from Gray brought Mist within striking distance before two scores from Thomas set up Jackie Young to finish the job for Laces.\n\nAT earned Player of the Game honors, finishing with a season-high 20 points, 11 rebounds, four assists and three steals. It was an all-round, stat-stuffing effort exemplary of The Engine. Ogunbowale’s 17 points led Mist, with Stewart finishing with 16 points and nine boards.\n\nAt 7-2, Laces exit Week 4 atop the standings, with 6-3 Mist falling into third place, as Phantom, also at 6-3, has the head-to-head advantage over the Misties.\n\nIt’s been a rough Unrivaled rookie season for Sonia Citron.\n\nAfter her seemingly seamless transition to the WNBA, Citron’s 3-point stroke has been off in Unrivaled, with her shooting struggles exacerbating the overall challenges Hive has faced in their inaugural Unrivaled season.\n\nOn Monday night, Soni had her long-awaited Unrivaled breakout. She scored 32 points, going 12-for-18 from the field and 4-for-7 from 3. She also contributed five assists, two blocks and a steal.\n\nUnfortunately, Citron’s stellar night was not enough for Hive, as Vinyl prevailed 74-71 in the back-and-forth affair.\n\nThis one was tight from the jump, and would feature 11 lead changes and 13 ties. Vinyl’s balance, however, overcame not only Citron’s big game, but also a huge double-double from Monique Billings, who finished with 23 points and 15 rebounds for Hive.\n\nFive members of Vinyl scored in double figures, led by Rae Burrell’s 18 points. Burrell, who made two 3s and added three assists, three assists and a block, showed that her Saturday star turn was not an outlier, earning her second-straight Player of the Game honor. Dearica Hamby contributed 14 points and eight boards, while Rhyne Howard dished seven assists, her Unrivaled career-high, to go with her 10 points.\n\nVinyl entered the fourth up 63-59, as a Brittney Griner bucket as the third quarter expired seemed to set the club up to take control and cruise to the 74-point target score. Citron had other ideas, striving to singularly drag Hive to victory with 10 points in period, including a 3-pointer that pulled her club within one point of Hive, 72-71, and within three points of the target. With a stop, Hive would have the chance to steal the win.\n\nHoward turned on her aggression on Vinyl’s next possession, driving at Citron. Rhyne missed, but a somewhat questionable foul called on Citron sent Howard to the line. Rhyne sunk the free throw to secure the game for Vinyl, keeping the now 4-5 club in position for a playoff berth.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona are moving closer to securing one of the most promising midfielders in their youth system, with 16-year-old Hugo Garces on the verge of renewing his commitment to the club.\n\nAccording to SPORT, talks between both parties are progressing smoothly, and confidence is growing that an agreement will be finalised soon.\n\nGarces has been part of Barcelona’s academy setup since the summer of 2021, when he arrived from Zaragoza to join the Under-12s.\n\nSince then, his development has followed a steady upward curve, earning him recognition as one of the standout midfield profiles in La Masia.\n\nIn his early years at the club, Garces was often compared to Thiago Alcantara due to his technical quality, close control, and ability to dictate play in tight spaces.\n\nHowever, as his game has evolved, his style has taken on a more dynamic edge. Today, his profile is seen as closer to that of Gavi, particularly in terms of intensity, physical bravery, and his willingness to attack the box.\n\nRight-footed and similar in height to the Barcelona midfielder, Garces combines creativity with aggression.\n\nHugo Garces is close to signing a new contract with Barcelona. (Picture courtesy: Instagram/@h.garcees.10)\n\nAs of today, Barcelona are keen for Garces to sign his first professional contract as soon as possible.\n\nHaving turned 16 last month, he is now legally eligible to do so, and the club see this as a priority.\n\nInternally, there is full alignment between Barça and the player. Garces is said to be completely committed to the club, where he has grown both as a footballer and as a person.\n\nWhile the midfield pathway to the first team is highly competitive, those who follow his progress closely highlight one trait above all else: confidence.\n\nGarces plays with personality, belief, and a winning mindset, qualities that often separate good youth players from those capable of making the final step.\n\nNegotiations are not yet formally closed, but only minor details remain. If everything goes according to plan, Barcelona will soon have another key academy talent tied down as part of their long-term sporting vision.",

If ready and available, the expectation would be that he’d be in the lineup at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night too.\n\nBut the 18-year-old missed Chelsea’s match against West Ham United on Saturday due to a personal matter, and Liam Rosenior admitted on Monday that he doesn’t know whether the player will be back for Arsenal.\n\n“I don’t know yet,” Rosenior confirmed. “He is a young kid who has come and been magnificent.

    "fullText": "Real Madrid could head into their upcoming league trip to Valencia with a significantly reinforced squad, as several key defenders edge closer to a return.\n\nAccording to a positive update from MARCA, the likes of Antonio Rudiger, Trent Alexander-Arnold, and Ferland Mendy are all expected to be available if everything progresses as planned.\n\nThe timing could hardly be better for Alvaro Arbeloa, who has been dealing with defensive instability in recent weeks.\n\nReal Madrid will travel to Mestalla knowing that solidity at the back will be crucial against a Valencia side that traditionally raises its level at home.\n\nAmong the potential returnees, Rudiger’s comeback stands out as particularly important.\n\nThis is because with Eder Militao ruled out until at least March, the German international is viewed as the most reliable option to anchor the defence.\n\nBeyond his physical presence, Rudiger offers leadership and authority, qualities Arbeloa values highly both on the pitch and in the dressing room.\n\nMendy is likely to return this weekend. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nMendy’s possible return also provides a welcome balance.\n\nWhile the Frenchman is not known for his attacking output, his defensive discipline has long been one of his strongest attributes.\n\nIn matches where control and positional awareness are vital, Mendy’s presence gives Real Madrid a level of security that few alternatives can match.\n\nThe situation surrounding Alexander-Arnold, who has returned to training for a while now, is slightly more complex.\n\nThe England international’s start to life in Madrid was promising, with regular appearances early in the campaign, but injuries soon disrupted his rhythm.\n\nAs the season progressed, those physical setbacks prevented Alexander-Arnold from fully establishing himself. Now, his return comes with added pressure.\n\nHe is eager to accumulate minutes, aware that his place in Real Madrid’s plans, as well as in the England squad for the World Cup, depends heavily on staying fit and contributing consistently.\n\nIf all three players are included in the squad against Valencia, Arbeloa will finally have more experienced options at his disposal.",

    "description": "The Trojan women's guards played well once again and got two wins, while Ezra Ausar dominated the paint against Rutgers and helped the men win",
    "fullText": "Women's basketball took care of business at USC. The Women of Troy secured two wins due to great guard play. For the men, transfer guard Kam Woods had an elite performance get spoiled, but Ezra Ausar led the Trojans to a victory to bounce back from a devastating loss to Iowa. In the NBA, two Trojans shined and represented USC to the best of their abilities.\n\nHere are my top performers across hoops this past week for USC, both in college and the NBA:\n\nJazzy Davidson was her usual elite self, as she posted 21 points, 8 assists, and 2 steals in the victory over Iowa earlier in the week. Versus Rutgers in the blowout win yesterday, Davidson stuffed the stat sheet, leading the Trojans with 16 points, 9 rebounds, 5 assists, and 3 steals. Davidson has been a model of consistency, and this week the wins followed her stellar performances.\n\nKara Dunn had yet another impressive week. Dunn vs the Hawkeyes on Thursday had a team-leading 25 points, 12 rebounds, and 5 assists. Against Rutgers in the win Sunday night, Dunn led the team once again with 18 points and 6 rebounds. She continues to be the star of this season alongside Jazzy Davidson.\n\nOn Wednesday, transfer Kam Woods tried to take matters into his own hands vs Iowa. Woods put up 33 points, 4 steals, and only missed 5 of his 17 shots. It was a great showing for Woods, who made the most of his opportunity that night. He single-handedly beat the Trojans in a tight distance and gave USC a chance to pull off another big upset in conference. Unfortunately, Woods' stellar night was outshone by a devastating loss.\n\nEzra Ausar had himself a modest performance on Wednesday in a loss to Iowa. In the Trojans game following their loss, Ausar showed up big time. Ausar led the Trojans to victory with 21 points, 7 rebounds, and 1 steal. He was the consistent star the Trojans needed, and he dominated the paint all night long. When he is effective, and he is having a confident night, the Trojans, like on Saturday, come out on top.\n\nNo Keyonte George, no problem. In his first start of the season, Collier stepped up big with 19 points, 7 assists, and 2 steals. Collier was consistent in scoring this past week, reaching double figures each game. It was not just his scoring either, he was an elite facilitator posting at least 6 assists in each of the 4 games this past week. He had success defensively, having a 4-steal game on Wednesday. The Jazz should have the utmost confidence in Isaiah Collier as he continues to make an impact on both ends of the court.\n\nDeMar DeRozan turned back the clock this past week. Derozan had two 30-point games this past week, one of which came yesterday as he dropped 32 on 10-16 shooting. He also had a 25-point performance with 8 assists in the battle vs the 76ers that resulted in a game-winning basket by Tyrese Maxey. Any good performance Derozan has does not correlate to his team winning games, it just correlates to his trade value growing. With a week like this past week, DeRozan can be on his way to playing for a contending team.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Top USC basketball performers in college hoops and NBA, February 3",

    "fullText": "Benjamin Sesko came up with the biggest goal of his Manchester United career so far in the 3-2 win against Fulham.\n\nThe Slovenian forward joined United in August, having made no secret of his desire to one day play for the club. He was thrilled to make it happen.\n\nThe six-year interest the Red Devils showed in Sesko appears to be yielding positive results, demonstrating the commitment of both the club and the player.\n\nThe 22-year-old has already scored six goals for the club, with four coming in 2026 alone. Despite not yet starting a game under Michael Carrick, he has managed to find form and consistency.\n\nAnd his powerful finish against Fulham not only gave United a lead but also brought out a huge reaction from the crowd and his teammates.\n\nSesko’s goal kept Manchester United’s run going under Carrick and underlined the kind of presence he can have in front of goal.\n\nThe Slovenian striker looks to be playing with more belief lately, and any early concerns from fans seem to have faded away.\n\nFormer United defender Rio Ferdinand expressed his delight for Sesko on his YouTube channel, noting that he had received encouraging updates from Carrington about the No. 30.\n\nThe former centre-back said: “What I would say about him from people on the training ground is his attitude is first class.\n\n“He’s in every day, early, ready to prepare for training, ready to do the extras before training, getting his body right, to make sure that he’s ready to go out there and give his best every day in training, no stone is left unturned.\n\n“And they say especially for a young kid, his mindset and his attitude has been first class.”\n\nThe celebrations following Sesko’s stoppage time winner were no surprise according to Ferdinand. The squad was clearly happy for him.\n\n“That’s why you see the guys in the changing room raring about on the pitch reacting to his goal in the way that they were all so happy for him.\n\n“You only get that type of reaction when they go, ‘you know what? He’s likable, and you must be a good kid, and you must show traits of someone who works really hard’.\n\n“So good luck to him, man. I want him to do well.”\n\nSesko is pushing for more minutes at Manchester United but faces a tough challenge in Bryan Mbeumo, who has been in good form.\n\nWith limited opportunities, he has had to be patient and make the most of his chances. His last two goals have both come off the bench.\n\nFerdinand truly believes Sesko can be the long-term answer for Man United’s striker position, as he said: “He’s got all the attributes you’d want in your number nine, by the way, modern day player.\n\n“He’s big, he’s strong, he’s athletic, he’s agile, he’s got a clean strike.”",

    "description": "Caleb Williams' top offensive lineman, Joe Thuney, is a finalist for protector of the year. Thuney helped Caleb and Ben Johnson revive the Bears",
    "fullText": "Caleb Williams was sacked 68 times last season, the highest in the NFL. Caleb Williams was unable to show what he showed this season due to coaching and the offensive line being downright atrocious. Ryan Poles ensured to fix both last offseason.\n\nThat, in fact, he did complete both. The Bears' offensive line gained 4 new starters, and the Bears hired the most sought-after coach in the coaching cycle. Ben Johnson and Caleb Williams will get a lot of credit for turning this team into a winner early, but trading for Joe Thuney, a proven winner, made a huge impact as well. The rest of the league recognized that, as he was named a finalist for protector of the year.\n\nIn a recent Bears Wire article, Alyssa Barbieri breaks down the impact of Joe Thuney on the Bears this season and Caleb's initial reaction to his best offensive lineman getting recognized:\n\n\"Thuney helped anchor one of the best offensive lines in the NFL and played a huge role in the Bears going 11-6, winning the NFC North and beating the Green Bay Packers in the wild-card playoffs. Thuney was named First-Team All-Pro and earned a Pro Bowl nod for his impressive outing in 2025. In 17 games, Thuney allowed zero sacks, one hit and 15 pressures and was only penalized twice. He played 1,149 offensive snaps, the second-most of any guard in the league, per Pro Football Focus.\"\n\n\"As a result, Thuney was nominated for the NFL's first ever Protector of the Year award, alongside Denver Broncos tackle Garrett Bolles and guard Quinn Meinerz, Miami Dolphins center Aaron Brewer, Kansas City Chiefs center Creed Humphrey, and Detroit Lions tackle Penei Sewell. Thuney's quarterback Caleb Williams took to Instagram to celebrate Thuney's nomination and gave him the ultimate praise.\n\n\"Best in the world!\" Williams wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"Williams was the main beneficiary of the overhaul of the offensive line with the additions of Thuney, Jonah Jackson, Drew Dalman and rookie Ozzy Trapilo. But Thuney continues to show, even after 10 years, that he's still one of the best in the game, and Williams will still have him blocking for him for the next few years.\"\n\nIn his rookie season, it was a season full of \"his o-line is not giving him any help\" and many other excuses as to why his play did not match the player many thought would be coming out of USC. This season, the Caleb Williams that lit it up at USC was seen a whole lot on the field, terrorizing defenses because of how good Joe Thuney and the rest of the offensive line were.\n\nCaleb avoided his fair share of sacks, but he was confident and able to be that superstar quarterback because he was confident in Joe Thuney and company. Other than drafting Caleb Williams, trading for Joe Thuney has to be the best move Ryan Poles has made in his tenure as Bears GM. Caleb Williams recognized Thuney's impact, as well as the rest of the NFL does too.\n\nJoe Thuney blocked for championship-winning quarterbacks and all-time greats Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes. Caleb Williams, if he keeps up with where he is headed, he can join that tier of guys and be the next winning quarterback Joe Thuney blocks for.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Caleb Williams, Bears took big step forward because of Joe Thuney",

    "description": "Former LSU cornerback Mansoor Delane is expected to be selected early in the 2026 NFL Draft. Here are three ideal fits for the former Tiger.",
    "fullText": "Former LSU football cornerback Mansoor Delane made his mark during his lone season at LSU, earning first-team All-American honors and finishing as a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, which is given to the nation’s top defensive back.\n\nHis impressive 2025 campaign has firmly put him in the conversation for an early first-round pick in the NFL Draft in April. Where he might come off the board is up for debate, with some mock drafts having him go in the early to mid-teens, while one recent mock draft had him taken in the top five.\n\nThe goal of this piece is to take a look at some teams that fit the former Tiger best, but his notoriety limits the options to some extent. It’s highly unlikely Delane makes it past the middle of the first round, so we’re going to limit the available options to teams who are projected to be within range to select him.\n\nThis isn’t only a great fit because Delane would be joining two former Tigers in Cincinnati, though that certainly heightens the intrigue for LSU fans. The Bengals had one of the NFL’s worst passing defenses in 2025, ranking in the bottom quartile of the league in passing EPA/Play, passing success rate allowed, and explosive pass percentage allowed, according to ESPN’s Sam Hoppen.\n\nGiving them a corner with Delane’s talent has proven to be a major factor in turning around defenses in the past, and there are few in the league who need that sort of talent injection more than Cincinnati.\n\nThe Rams were one of the NFL’s best teams this season, and a draft-day trade with the Falcons last offseason landed them what has become the 13th overall pick. Although their defense certainly wasn’t a terrible unit by league standards, their passing defense certainly wasn’t a strength, allowing 7.6 yards per pass attempt this season.\n\nMany mock drafts have the Rams selecting Tennessee cornerback Jermod McCoy over Delane, but Delane feels like the more likely — and smart — pick. This Rams team wants to maximize its Super Bowl window while Matthew Stafford is still playing, and McCoy didn’t play a snap in 2025 due to an injury during the 2024 college football playoff. Despite concerns about Delane’s size and athleticism, he offers the Rams elite coverage play that they don’t have to draft based on year-old tape.\n\nThe Jets are a distinctly different situation from the Rams. This isn’t a team trying to max out a Super Bowl window; it’s a team that’s trying to reload a defensive roster that’s devoid of talent. The draft strategy that works best for a team like this is taking the best player available, and if Delane is still on the board at 16, he certainly qualifies.\n\nAdditionally, Delane would be a great fit for Aaron Glenn’s man-coverage-heavy defense. According to Pro Football Focus, Delane posted the second-best man-coverage grade among Power Four cornerbacks in 2025, meshing perfectly with a Jets defense that ran man coverage fourth-most in the league this season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Three likely draft destinations for LSU football corner Mansoor Delane",

But I hope so.”\n\nThe UFC has been hyper-focused on excitement as a metric for earning title shots, and Murphy suggested it would be hard to earn an exciting win off an opponent like Movsar Evloev.\n\n“I believe the matchmakers know what kind of match this is,” he said. “I think it would be unfair to say you’ve got to go out there and get a crazy knockout to get a title shot. Everybody knows what kind of fight this is going to be and what type of fighter I’m fighting against. So I think the winner should be undeniably next in line for the title. Simple.”\n\nIf there’s one person out there banging the drum for Movsar or Lerone to get a shot, it’s Alexander Volkanovski himself. If excitement and popularity is the metric, then it would be easy for UFC to slot No. 6 ranked Jean Silva into a title fight. But “The Great” is clearly unenthused about that fight.\n\n“You’ve got Silva obviously probably trying to get his name out there,” Volkanovski said in a new interview. “Now he’s saying some stuff and thinking he really deserves next. If the UFC obviously were to push that for me, everyone knows me. I’ll fight anyone. But I don’t think that’s very likely to happen.”\n\n“I don’t think he’s in a position to fight for the title, especially when you’ve got Lerone Murphy and Movsar Evloev fighting very, very soon. I think that’s very clear.”\n\nOnly if you’re looking at things in terms of win streaks and rankings and not social media popularity and action. The winner of Murphy vs. Evloev may leave London with a ten fight win streak compared to Silva’s one. But Silva surfed on his opponent’s back at the end of his last fight, which we must admit was pretty cool.\n\nCool enough to earn a title shot? In today’s UFC, maybe.",

    "fullText": "Dana White’s latest venture into boxing might be about to shake up the sport in a big way, with reports suggesting Zuffa Boxing is closing in on a fight fans have wanted for years.\n\nSo far, Zuffa Boxing has only put on two shows. But given White’s long track record of promoting major events in combat sports, there’s already plenty of buzz around what he could bring to boxing. That reputation now faces a real test, as talks are swirling around what could be one of the sport’s most anticipated matchups.\n\nAccording to BoxingScene, the matchup between Nate Diaz and Paulie Malignaggi has been verbally agreed, marking one of the more unexpected turns this year. The two have a history going back several years over comments Malignaggi made about Nate and Nick Diaz.\n\nTyson Fury and Anthony Joshua have been linked to a fight for years without ever sharing the ring. The closest they came was an early sparring session during their youth, long before their professional careers took off. That may be about to change, though.\n\nIt is being reported by BoxingScene that Dana White is planning to stage the fight on Zuffa Boxing, with Netflix likely to broadcast it. Reports suggest that Netflix will also be involved in Fury’s upcoming April fight against Arslanbek Makhmudov, adding to their growing presence in live sports.\n\nA car accident last year left Joshua injured and cost him two close friends. However, he has since returned to training and recently released a video addressing the loss of his friends and his journey back.\n\nFury hasn’t fought since back-to-back defeats against Oleksandr Usyk in Saudi Arabia. Joshua’s last appearance was a knockout win over Jake Paul on another Netflix card just days before his accident.\n\nDana White didn’t hold back his excitement after Zuffa Boxing 2, hinting that the promotion is ready to make some noise in the industry. Speaking at the post-fight press conference, he suggested big news is on the way.\n\n“We have some pretty crazy announcements coming over the next few weeks,” he said, without naming any specific dates or fighters. “I’m way further in this thing than I anticipated being two shows in.”\n\nWhite added: “There’s a lot going on to rock the industry – new signings, more deals, new territories. I’m telling you guys by the end of 2026, it’s going to be impressive.”\n\nWhite has plenty of experience in boxing promotion already. He was involved with Tom Loeffler’s work for Callum Walsh, including a Dublin event in 2024 and also promoted last year’s Canelo Alvarez vs Terence Crawford bout.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are keeping close tabs on RB Leipzig teenager Yan Diomande, who is considered one of the best prospects in Europe at the moment.\n\nThe 19-year-old was born and raised in the Ivory Coast, but started his career in the United States at the academies of Yulee Hornets and DME. In January 2025, he entered the European scene through the gates of Leganes and swiftly managed to grab the limelight, especially following a particularly delightful performance against Real Madrid.\n\nLast summer, RB Leipzig splashed €20 million to secure his services after receiving the nod of approval from Jurgen Klopp.\n\nSince then, he has established himself as one of the most exciting players in the Bundesliga and has also been labelled as the best product for the Red Bull system since Man City striker Erling Haaland. This season, has contributed with eight goals and six assists in 21 appearances for the German club.\n\nAs reported earlier today, David Ornstein confirmed that Man Utd’s plans for next summer include signing a new left winger, especially after missing out on Antoine Semenyo last month.\n\nLast summer, United shelled out £62.5 million on Matheus Cunha, who has been justifying this figure with his impressive displays. Nonetheless, the club still needs an additional option down the left flank, having parted ways with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.\n\n(Photo by Maja Hitij/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Manchester World reporter Rich Fay, Diomande is an early favourite for this role.\n\nIt should also be noted that Fabrizio Romano had revealed that Man Utd and Tottenham are among several European clubs that scouted Diomande this season.\n\nWith his blistering pace and effortless ability to skip past his marker, the young Ivorian has been an absolute menace for opposition players.\n\nIn a past interview, Diomande revealed that, despite his academy training, he remains a street player at heart.\n\n“I played in the streets. I still play when I go home – sometimes with friends. I like to say: I left the streets, but the streets did not leave me. It is still part of me,” said the Abidjan native.\n\nMoreover, Diomande is a good friend of Amad Diallo, who would help him adjust to life at Carrington. The two wingers play on opposite flanks for the Ivorian national team, causing havoc for their opponents.\n\nWhile we can expect several twists and turns between now and the summer, the Leipzig wonderkid is certainly one to keep a close eye on in the coming months.",

    "fullText": "Ireland hooker Dan Sheehan says there is \"confidence\" in the players still available for Thursday's opening Six Nations match against France in Paris (20:10 GMT).\n\nHead coach Andy Farrell named his team for the game on Tuesday morning and is without several usual starters through injury.\n\nTadhg Furlong, Hugo Keenan, Ryan Baird and Mack Hansen are all out through injury, while Bundee Aki is suspended.\n\nPerhaps most problematic is the absence of not just usual loose-head Andrew Porter but also his two primary back-ups in Paddy McCarthy and Jack Boyle.\n\nIn their place, Jeremy Loughman will win a first cap since the 2024 Six Nations, with his Munster colleague Michael Milne providing cover from the bench.\n\n\"We have confidence in the people we have,\" said Sheehan.\n\n\"We have done a good job of building some good depth over the years and we have got some loose-heads that have caps.\n\n\"Some teams would struggle [with the injuries] but I think we have good depth and people to come in. I don't think much has changed and there has been no sense of panic.\"\n\nDespite concerns over front row depth with Ireland down their three first-choice loose-heads, and starting tight-head Tadhg Furlong missing at least the opener, Sheehan's own position of hooker is one where Farrell has an enviable set of options.\n\nSheehan will start ahead of his Leinster team-mate Ronan Kelleher in Paris with Ulster's Tom Stewart also having impressed for Ulster this year.\n\n\"We have some top-quality young hookers across the provinces now,\" Sheehan continued.\n\n\"If you look at a few years ago, maybe people said there was a shortage, but I think all the provinces are producing quality hookers and that drives everyone on.\"\n\nThe past four editions of the Six Nations have been won by either Ireland or Les Bleus. Farrell's side haven't won against Thursday's hosts at the Stade de France since 2018, although did beat Scotland and South Africa at the ground during the 2023 World Cup.\n\n\"When people ask \"where is your favourite away stadium?\", it is the Stade de France, it is a great atmosphere,\" Sheehan added.\n\n\"The Six Nations is always so special, it is always the best two months of the year.\n\n\"[The start of the year can be] some boring months, but it always gives people a lift and us a lift. Everyone is buzzing to get going now.\"",

    "fullText": "Growing discussion around Manchester City and life after Pep Guardiola has moved firmly into the open, with The Telegraph reporting that Xabi Alonso is expected to feature on a three man shortlist to succeed the Catalan. Despite public denials from City sources, there is an unmistakable sense across Premier League circles that contingency planning has begun.\n\nCity’s recent wobble has sharpened the focus. A damaging draw at Tottenham, having led by two goals, left them six points adrift of Arsenal and fuelled questions about whether Guardiola’s era is reaching its natural conclusion. Rivals sense vulnerability, while internally there is acknowledgement that even dynasties require succession.\n\nGuardiola’s position remains officially secure. City announced in November 2024 that he had signed a two year extension through to 2027, a statement designed to quell speculation. Yet football operates as much on mood as on paperwork. Guardiola’s absence from media duties following a return to Barcelona for a speech supporting Palestinian children added to the sense of distance during a pivotal week.\n\nCity have dismissed talk of his departure as “pure speculation”, but speculation has rarely travelled this far without oxygen. One source quoted by Telegraph Sport offered a telling observation: “Tottenham were there for the taking, but City weren’t ruthless. They let them off the hook. Some of the players look like they think Pep is leaving at the end of the season and, as a result, they are going through the motions.”\n\nAlonso, recently dismissed by Real Madrid, is viewed as a coach of stature and composure, capable of handling elite environments. His association with Liverpool adds edge to the narrative, particularly with Arne Slot under pressure to deliver Champions League qualification. City already moved ahead of Liverpool for Marc Guéhi and Antoine Semenyo, and repeating that trick for Alonso would sting.\n\nEnzo Maresca, once Guardiola’s assistant, is also expected to be considered. Recently dismissed by Chelsea, Maresca had informed Chelsea of talks with City and Juventus. His candidacy is complicated by timing and competition, but familiarity counts.\n\nAnother name gaining traction is Cesc Fabregas, admired for his work at Como, who sit sixth in Serie A. Fabregas is expected to leave only for an elite role, and City would qualify.\n\nFormer City captain Vincent Kompany is not expected to leave Bayern Munich, having extended his deal to 2029 and embedded himself in transfer planning. Roberto De Zerbi, previously admired, faces uncertainty at Marseille after Champions League disappointment.\n\nResponsibility for shaping the shortlist will fall to Hugo Viana, City’s director of football, whose relationship with super agent Jorge Mendes brings additional intrigue. Guardiola himself may yet be consulted, an echo of the club’s preference for continuity and control.\n\nFor now, nothing is decided. But elite clubs plan before they are forced to act. City are doing precisely that.\n\nThere is pride in what Guardiola has built and anxiety at the thought of losing the defining figure of the modern club. Six league titles, relentless standards and a global identity do not vanish cleanly.\n\nAt the same time, succession planning feels sensible rather than disloyal. Fans understand that even Guardiola will not stay forever, and the idea that City are calmly mapping the future is reassuring. Alonso appeals as a thinker and a leader, someone who respects structure and intelligence, values City supporters recognise. Maresca offers continuity, Fabregas imagination.\n\nWhat would concern fans more is drift. The quote about players “going through the motions” resonates because City have always thrived on intensity and clarity. If Guardiola is staying, supporters want renewed conviction. If he is going, then decisive planning matters.\n\nUltimately, City fans trust the hierarchy. The club has earned belief that transitions will be managed with foresight rather than panic, and that whoever follows Guardiola will inherit a platform built to keep winning.",

    "fullText": "To this point in the season, we haven’t had a ton of major upsets among the top teams in the country. In fact, the top 10 teams in the AP poll have a combined 16 losses, an average of 1.6 per team. That means one of two things – either the teams at the top of the sport have really separated themselves from the rest of the nation, or they’re due for some regression! Let’s see what happens over the next month and a half!\n\nThe Wolfpack have really hit their stride as of late, running their offense behind a pick-and-roll and pick-and-pop scheme with Quadir Copeland handling the ball, Derrion Williams setting the screen, and Paul McNeil and Tre Hollomon spacing the floor. It’s fun to watch, and I don’t think that SMU is going to have any answers for it, lacking the personnel to switch on the screen.\n\nMORE: ESPN, NFL finalize billion-dollar media deal after government approval\n\nThe year is 2026, and the Blue Demons finally have a home-court advantage. In Big East play, DePaul has only lost once at home, and it was to the top-of-the-conference UConn Huskies. CJ Gunn is the type of scorer who can catch fire and ignite an entire arena, and I think Tuesday is the night when DePaul is officially back on the map.\n\nCross-country road trips have meant doom in the Big Ten this season. Here we have Iowa traveling to the Pacific Northwest to take on a healthy and rejuvenated Washington team with Wesley Yates and Jacob Ognacevic back. Plus, the stylings of Ben McCollum generally lead to low-possession games where upsets are more likely.\n\nThe Redhawks are still unbeaten heading into February, but they are starting to show some cracks. On Saturday, they trailed Northern Illinois by double-digits before coming back to win. In the first meeting between these two teams, Miami needed overtime and then a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to come out victorious on their home floor. Now the game is in Buffalo, and the Bulls are hungry for revenge.\n\nWinning in the Fertitta Center is never easy, but if Johnny Dawkins’ squad is good enough to beat Texas Tech, they can take down Houston, too. Stylistically, I think this is a good matchup for UCF. Houston loves to blitz and trap ball screens, and UCF has smart ball-handlers who should be able to handle the pressure and make good decisions. I think it’s quite likely that UCF’s forwards can get Houston into foul trouble.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo’s mom hints at next NBA team\n\nMLB: Mets sign former Dodgers World Series champion\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: Mattress Mack reveals massive $2 million Super Bowl 60 wager\n\nENTERTAINMENT: WWE star calls Pat McAfee to reveal shocking 2026 Royal Rumble return\n\nVIRAL: Kendall Jenner halts interview for Tom Brady Super Bowl 60 prediction on FaceTime\n\nThe post Predicting upsets in College Basketball this week  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Pay up for the monsters who can penetrate up the middle and dominate against the run.\n\n\"You have to, to make sure that your line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball is big, tough, resilient and that there's depth,\" the Dolphins' GM Sullivan said, on the day he was introduced.\n\nIn their roster-building, the Seahawks and Patriots both leaned toward investments on defense.\n\nWhat if I told you Seattle was last in percentage of NFL cap devoted to offense in 2025?\n\nWhat if I told you New England was 24th in NFL cap spending on offense in 2025?\n\nThe pendulum is swinging in this league and it's swinging toward defense.\n\nThe Patriots are paying big bucks for interior linemen Milton Williams and Christian Barmore.\n\nThe Seahawks are paying big bucks for interior lineman Leonard Williams and used a recent first-rounder on Byron Murphy.\n\nThe Dolphins need to invest in big people, and especially big people on defense.\n\nSuper Bowl 60: 5 people with Miami connections to cheer for\n\nTop 5 positions: NFL draft, free agency needs for Miami Dolphins\n\nMiami Dolphins free agency: Top 5 players to prioritize; the salaries\n\nJoe Schad is a journalist covering the Miami Dolphins and the NFL at The Palm Beach Post.

    "fullText": "Former Milan and Juventus defender Mattia De Sciglio said he snubbed a move to Liverpool to move to Turin in 2017, but he felt ‘used’ by Vincenzo Montella at San Siro.\n\nFormer Italy international De Sciglio spoke about his career in an interview with Corriere della Sera.\n\nA product of the Milan academy, De Sciglio has also played for Juventus and Empoli in Serie A and Lyon in the French Ligue 1.\n\nThe 33-year-old has collected 208 appearances in Serie A and 28 in the Champions League.\n\n“I could have played for Inter as a kid,” De Sciglio said via Calciomercato.com.\n\n“They had called me for a trial, but I was dropped because I was too short. Milan arrived shortly afterwards, and I went through the youth sector until my Champions League debut at 18.”\n\nDe Sciglio was a Milan first-team player in one of the darkest moments in recent history, but feels the way he was treated at San Siro was unfair.\n\n“Some of the fans and the media identified me as the guilty one in that situation, and they were all waiting for a minimum error to criticise me,” he said.\n\n“My social media accounts were filled with insults and nasty comments, but I had always behaved well, so I didn’t understand.”\n\nDuring a Milan home game against Empoli in April 2017, he realised he had to leave the Rossoneri.\n\nDORTMUND, GERMANY – JUNE 18: Vincenzo Montella, Head Coach of Turkiye, gestures during the UEFA EURO 2024 group stage match between Turkiye and Georgia at Football Stadium Dortmund on June 18, 2024 in Dortmund, Germany.

It seemed just a way to use me to hide a difficult moment for the whole team,” De Sciglio said.\n\n“As I was leaving, a boos erupted all around me. That day, I realised I could no longer go on like that; my story with Milan was over.”\n\nTURIN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 02: Kenan Yildiz of Juventus battles for possession with Mattia De Sciglio of Empoli during the Serie A match between Juventus and Empoli at Allianz Stadium on February 02, 2025 in Turin, Italy.

    "description": "Murphy and Evloev will clash in the main event, but will the winner be next for featherweight king Alexander Volkanovski?",
    "fullText": "Lerone Murphy has admitted that his UFC London main event against Movsar Evloev may not be a No 1 contender’s fight, despite theories from many figures in MMA.\n\nOn 21 March, Manchester’s Murphy will face the Russian in a battle of unbeaten featherweights, with champion Alexander Volkanovski keen to face the winner.\n\nNaturally, then, many fans and pundits have been quick to dub the UFC London main event a No 1 contender’s bout, given Murphy and Evloev’s impressive records and Volkanovski’s desire to face either man.\n\nYet it isn’t always that simple in the UFC, as Murphy noted on Monday, shortly after his fight was announced. “Nothing’s concrete,” he said on The Ariel Helwani Show.\n\nStill, Murphy added: “But I hope so. The matchmakers know what type of match-up this is. Everyone knows what type of fight this is going to be, and what type of fighter I’m fighting against.\n\n“So, I think the winner should be undeniably next in line for the title. Simple.”\n\nMurphy, who will carry a 17-0-1 record into the O2 Arena, said of the 19-0 Evloev: “Movsar is elite. He’s a very good fighter, good everywhere, but I just believe I’m going to take him into deep waters.\n\n“It’s going to be defensive wrestling, an ambitious offence, and pressure him to make a mistake. I’ll be hunting for the knockout from bell to bell.”\n\nNews of the match-up came just two days after Volkanovski extended his second reign as featherweight champion with a win over Diego Lopes. Volkanovski outpointed Lopes to retain the title in the main event of UFC 325, nine months after beating the Brazilian in the same manner to win the vacant belt.\n\nAnd the Australian champion used his post-fight press conference to call for a fight with Murphy, 34, or Evloev, 31, next.\n\n“It hurt watching that fight, thinking I should have been there,” Murphy said. “It should have been me [...] I think if I was in there, I would have gotten the job done.\n\n“I see a lot of things in there that I would have been doing. I feel, right now, that I’m the best in the world at featherweight.\n\n“Volk is the guy I have the utmost respect for as a champion. If it were up to him, he would have fought me, and he’s going out there and fighting the next best. It’s how every champion should be. Hopefully I get the chance to share the Octagon with him.”\n\nMurphy last fought in August, taking on UFC debutant Aaron Pico. The Briton stopped the former Bellator star in stunning fashion, with a spinning back elbow, which led Volkanovski to call for a title defence against Murphy.\n\nMeanwhile, Evloev has not fought since December 2024, when he narrowly outpointed Aljamain Sterling, a former bantamweight champion in the UFC.",

    "title": "Iconic Ouninpohja stage dropped from 2026 WRC Rally Finland route",
    "description": "Rally Finland will offer WRC crews new challenges this year",
    "fullText": "The iconic Ouninpohja stage, regarded as one of most revered in the World Rally Championship, has been dropped from Rally Finland this year as part of an event itinerary revamp.\n\nThe 32.98km gravel rollercoaster, which has earned cult status over the years, made its return to Rally Finland in 2024 after a then-seven-year hiatus. Last year, the stage became the Super Sunday centrepiece as two runs through the test, in front of bumper crowds, provided the climax to the rally – which was won by Kalle Rovanpera.\n\nHowever, Rally Finland organisers have made significant changes to the route for this year’s event (30 July - 2 August), which will see Ouninpohja absent from the schedule. However, the the successful Super Sunday – one stage, two passes – concept that it started last year will remain in 2026.\n\nOuninpohja will be replaced by the 30km Himos-Jamsa stage, which will be run twice to conclude the rally. The stage opens on a fast Vaheri public road and transitions into narrower private roads in the middle section, and finishes spectacularly at the foot of the Himos ski slopes within a compact event village.\n\n“We have a strong ambition not to run the same route two years in a row. In 2026, 66% of the special stages are different compared to last year, and the rally must keep evolving to remain exciting for both drivers and spectators,” said Kai Tarkiainen, Rally Finland clerk of the course.\n\nAccording to the organisers “the 2026 route reflects both the 75-year history of Rally Finland and bold new openings. It features sections inspired by classic decades of the event, alongside roads that have never before been used in a FIA World Rally Championship event.”\n\nNew FIA regulations introduced for the current season require a more compact overall structure, with special stages now accounting for at least one quarter of the total itinerary. This has demanded significant structural solutions.\n\n“Stage lengths, liaison distances and geographical logic must all work together, but sporting quality is always the top priority,” said Kari Nuutinen, deputy clerk of the course responsible for the route.\n\n“We have now achieved a route that meets all requirements and remains extremely compact yet highly diverse.”\n\nThe most significant changes to the route take place on Friday, which features 127.94 competitive kilometres. Nearly half of the day’s roads have never been driven in the WRC era.\n\nFriday’s itinerary includes Laukaa run in a new direction, Saarikas, the all-new Sydanmaa special stage combining the former Sirkkamaki and Kalliokoski roads, the completely new Hoho stage, and the evening highlight, the Harju Super Special Stage in downtown Jyvaskyla.\n\nSaturday is built around a fast and rhythmical package, with liaison sections shortened to be more driver-friendly. The day starts near Jyvaskyla in Parkkola and continues through Paijala and Vastila before reaching Leustu in Korpilahti before Sunday’s climax.\n\nRally USA return edges closer for 2027 as WRC plans test\n\nMore than 10 tuners interested in joining WRC under 2027 rules\n\nHow Oliver Solberg picked up his “crazy dream” Monte Carlo win\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Seems like the Los Angeles Clippers could trade James Harden. Here are some potential landing spots before the NBA trade deadline.",
    "fullText": "James Harden has continued to be a huge help to the Los Angeles Clippers after the team's awful start, but he's sat out the past couple of games. Now? There's word via ESPN's Shams Charania that the Clips and Harden are \"working through whether the sides can find a deal by Thursday's trade deadline.\"\n\nEven at age 36, Harden is still averaging 25.4 ppg, 8.1 apg and 4.8 rpg. His contract situation? He's got a partially guaranteed contract this year and a player option for 2026-27. So that could be a factor for whomever acquires him.\n\nSo where could he go? Here's a list of some possible destinations as the 2026 NBA trade deadline approaches:\n\nThis is the team that's most linked to him, with Darius Garland heading to the Clippers. Why would the Cavs trade a much younger point guard? Well, maybe they think they have a shot at the Eastern Conference this season and perhaps they don't think Garland could be worth the money he could earn soon.\n\nThey need a point guard and someone to take some heat off Anthony Edwards. This is a move that would help a lot given their issues at point guard with an aging Mike Conley.\n\nThis feels like a darkhorse. The Raps have a lot of young talent, but what if they deal someone (RJ Barrett, perhaps?) for Harden and win a playoff series with him? I honestly don't know if the Raptors feel like they need to interrupt the growth they have as a young roster, but on paper, it might make sense.\n\nI saw the most tweets about this one. Harden gets back with Kevin Durant, returns to the team where he broke out as an MVP. Maybe he's happy being back in Houston? If the Rockets want to keep pace in the super-competitive West, this would be the move.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: James Harden landing spots with NBA trade rumors swirling",

    "fullText": "Following injuries to their first-choice centre-backs, Manchester City dipped into the transfer market to sign Marc Guehi in January. The defender has gone straight into the team in the Premier League, but he’s faced eligibility issues in the other competitions.\n\nIn the Champions League, Guehi couldn’t be added to City’s squad until after the League Phase, so he missed their final two games against Bodo/Glimt and Galatasaray. They’re now free to add him in for the knockout stages.\n\nBut before that, as City turn their attentions to the second leg of their League Cup semi-final, Guehi will be unavailable once again.\n\nManchester Evening News report that despite the cup-tied rules being changed this season, there’s a time restriction that means players could only become eligible for a new club before the first leg of the semi-final.\n\nAs Guehi only joined City afterwards, he’s ineligible for both Wednesday’s semi-final, and also for a potential final at Wembley.\n\nThe margins that Guehi has missed out by will be frustrating to the player and his new club. He joined City on January 19th, with City’s semi-final first leg against Newcastle United taking place on January 13th.\n\nIf he moved just one week earlier, Guehi would have been eligible for both Wednesday’s match and a potential final.\n\nOn the other hand, it does seem fair that Guehi misses out. The centre-back already had his chance in the League Cup, starting in wins over Millwall and Liverpool, before starting and scoring in Crystal Palace’s quarter-final defeat to Arsenal.\n\nIf Arsenal do make it to the final, it does seem odd that they might have had to eliminate Guehi for the second time in the same season.",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich’s young teenage talent Lennart Karl made it publicly clear that he dreams of playing for Real Madrid at some point in his career, and his decision to do so did not go down well.\n\nAfter his recent public admission, there were open calls for the Bavarians to exclude the player from their plans and push him to leave with many questioning his commitment to the club.\n\nFor Real Madrid, however, the development came as a welcome one as it can possibly aid them in any possible future signing.\n\nAs relayed by Defensa Central, Karl remains one of the top young profiles Real Madrid are monitoring ahead of the upcoming summer transfer window.\n\nAfter all, he is one of Europe’s finest talents in his position and is being scouted by several top clubs.\n\nLennart Karl is on Real Madrid’s radar. (Photo by Jasmin Walter/Getty Images)\n\nHe is seen as the next ‘Arjen Robben’, and his current valuation stands at close to €90 million. He is closely being watched by Real Madrid and the price tag is not completely out of reach, but there are other concerns that serve as hurdles to his immediate arrival.\n\nLos Blancos enter the summer with two clear priorities in mind – the central defence and the central midfield. While Karl is a midfielder by trade, he does not play in the same position that they are looking to strengthen.\n\nAn attacking midfielder by trade, the Bayern Munich star shares his profile with the likes of Jude Bellingham, Arda Guler and possibly even Brahim Diaz and Real Madrid do not see that department to be in an urgent need for reinforcement.\n\nThe 17-year-old’s current contract runs until 2028 and Bayern Munich will undoubtedly try and renew his deal amid interest from across Europe.\n\nIf Real Madrid decide to enter the race, they can sign him quite easily given the player’s desire. The question, however, is whether he fits into their financial and sporting plans.",

    "fullText": "Aerospace business and artificial intelligence firm to unite for IPO as world’s most valuable private company\n\nElon Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX has acquired his artificial intelligence business xAI, in a $1.25tn (£910bn) merger that consolidates part of Musk’s empire as SpaceX prepares to go public later this year.\n\nThe two companies announced the deal on Monday in a statement on SpaceX’s website, saying the merger would form “the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform”.\n\nSpaceX, one of the world’s most valuable private companies, will gain xAI properties such as its Grok chatbot and the social media platform X. The acquisition comes as Musk has pursued plans to put datacenters and solar-powered satellites in space as a means of powering artificial intelligence, an immense and exorbitantly expensive undertaking.\n\nThe deal reportedly valued SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, putting the combined business on course for a stock market float valuing it well in excess of $1tn. The float is expected to be timed for early summer to coincide with a planetary alignment and Musk’s birthday.\n\nMusk turns 55 on 28 June, around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other.\n\nThe announcement of the deal specifically cited Musk’s plans for space-based datacenters as a rationale for the deal.\n\n“Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial datacenters, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” the announcement said.\n\n“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale.”\n\nMusk has been increasingly intertwining parts of his businesses in recent months through deals and acquisitions. xAI acquired the platform X in an all-stock transaction in early 2025, and last month Tesla revealed that it planned to invest $2bn in xAI.\n\nBoth SpaceX and xAI have received staggering valuations in the past year. As SpaceX continues to dominate satellite launches and secure extensive contracts with the US federal government, it sent a letter to investors in December that revealed an expected value of $800bn for the company.\n\nDespite widespread backlash to xAI’s Grok AI tool over its promotion of racist ideology and spread of nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images of women and children, the artificial intelligence company has also grown its valuation amid the AI boom. It announced a $20bn Series E fundraise last month from major investors, which valued the company at $230bn.\n\nSpeculation and leaks about the deal, first reported by Reuters, have proliferated in recent days. Musk appeared to give vague confirmation of the acquisition earlier on Monday, writing simply “yes” in reply to a post on X that referenced reports of the merger.\n\nThe news is a positive diversion for Musk after Tesla released an earnings report last week that showed declining revenues and a struggling car business. A few days later, a Department of Justice release of 3m files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein showed Musk exchanging numerous friendly emails with the disgraced financier and making plans to visit his private island. Musk has not responded to Guardian inquiries about the latest Epstein emails.\n\nHe called the release of the emails a “distraction” on X and claimed that he was “well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name”.",

    "fullText": "CEO Alex Karp hails ‘iconic’ financial results despite criticism over contracts with ICE and homeland security\n\nPalantir celebrated its latest financial results on Monday, as the tech company blew past Wall Street expectations and continues to prop up the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants.\n\nPalantir has secured millions of dollars in federal contracts amid Trump’s crackdown on immigrants. The multibillion-dollar Denver-based firm creates tech focused on surveillance and analytics, to be used by the government agencies and private companies.\n\nPalantir’s biggest US customer is the Department of Defense; it also works with the Department of Homeland Security, and the majority of its revenue comes from deals with the federal government. Palantir reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m.\n\nPalantir has drawn further criticism over its role in the government’s immigration agenda, since federal immigration officers killed two protesters in Minneapolis last month.\n\nPalantir chief executive Alex Karp told CNBC in an interview Monday that Palantir helps protect sensitive data. “If you are critical of ICE, you should be out there protesting for more Palantir,” he said. “Our product, actually, in its core, requires people to conform with fourth amendment data protection.”\n\nThe company beat Wall Street expectations of $1.33bn with $1.41bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025. It reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.25 – which also surpassed Wall Street expectations of $0.23 in EPS. The company’s stocks jumped about 8% in after-hours trading after the release.\n\nKarp described the company’s growth on an earnings call as “one of the truly iconic performances in the history of corporate performance”. He wrote in a letter accompanying the earnings report that the $1.4bn in revenue generated in last year’s fourth quarter marks a new record – a 70% growth rate over the same period the year before.\n\n“We did this while supporting, in critical manner, some of the most interesting intricate, unusual, operations that the US government has been involved in – many of which we can’t comment on – but were the highlight of last year and highly motivating to all of us at Palantir,” Karp said.\n\nKarp doubled down on his data protection claim on the call, arguing that Palantir’s work with the US government, including intelligence agencies, aligns with the fourth amendment and makes sure “every institution that uses (Palantir’s) products is doing it within conformity of the law and ethics of America”.\n\nData privacy advocates are not convinced. “Palantir tools are ICE’s digital henchmen,” said Will Owen, communications director at the non-profit, Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, in a statement to the Guardian. “Their revenue may be up thanks to Trump, but no one is buying that they hold ICE accountable.”\n\nLast year, ICE awarded Palantir a nearly $30m contract to build ImmigrationOS, which makes it easier to pull information about immigrants from across government databases – regardless of the accuracy of those records. 404 Media recently reported on the existence of another tool created by Palantir for the federal government: Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (Elite).\n\nElite “populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a ‘confidence score’ on the person’s current address”, according to 404 Media. The program reportedly relies on address data from the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes Medicaid.\n\nWired reported last week that the federal government has been using Palantir’s AI tools to process immigration enforcement tips. Wired also reported that the health department has been using other Palantir AI tools to screen grants and job descriptions for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and “gender ideology”.\n\nPalantir has said there is no malicious intent in its work with the federal government.\n\n“To be absolutely clear, Palantir is not working on any master database project to unify databases across federal agencies,” read a company blogpost last week. “Palantir has not proposed the US government build a ‘master list’ for the surveillance of citizens, nor have we been asked to consider building such a system for any customer.”\n\nPalantir has described 404 Media’s claims about the Elite tool as misleading; the company says it is “used for prioritized enforcement to surface the likely addresses of specific individuals, such as those with final orders of removal or with high severity criminal charges”.\n\nTrump’s “big, beautiful bill” awarded DHS and ICE huge budgets to pursue the administration’s anti-immigrant policies, including $45bn for ICE to expand its detention capabilities.\n\nIn 2025, Palantir’s federal contracts almost doubled – and increased to more than $970m; this amount was distributed across the government, mostly to the defense department, but it also includes the DHS.",

    "fullText": "Minister announces Microsoft, Cisco and Adobe to help apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses\n\nIn 2002 Barnsley toyed with a redesign as a Tuscan hill village as it sought out a brighter post-industrial future. In 2021 it adopted the airily vague slogan “the place of possibilities”. Now it is trying a different image: Britain’s first “tech town”.\n\nThe technology secretary, Liz Kendall, has anointed the South Yorkshire community as a trailblazer for “how AI can improve everyday life” in the UK.\n\nIn the latest move in Labour’s drive to inject AI into Britain’s bloodstream, the government has announced four US tech companies – Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Adobe – have agreed to help as the council pushes to apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses in Barnsley, an area of South Yorkshire which has struggled with unemployment and deprivation since the coal pits closed.\n\nThe town and its 250,000 people have been chosen because they have already adopted AI faster than many places, said Sir Stephen Houghton, the Labour leader of Barnsley metropolitan borough council. His authority has been using AI assistants for the last couple of years in adult social care and children’s services, and its bin lorries have been enabled with tech to scan roads for potholes. The parcel company Evri, which has one of its largest distribution hubs in the town, has been trialling robot dogs for deliveries.\n\nBut local opposition leaders have warned rebranding Barnsley as a tech town “might seem a bit of a leap” and highlighted local anxiety about whether AI is a force for good.\n\nThe “tech town” status means residents will get free AI and digital training, businesses will be supported to adopt AI, the hospital will test AI tools for check-ins, triage and outpatient care and AI will be tested in schools and at Barnsley College, all in an effort to improve pupils’ results and teachers’ workloads.\n\n“The economic basis of Barnsley was destroyed 30 years ago,” Houghton said. “This is the biggest opportunity we have had since then. The future of the economy is going to be in technology and for Barnsley to be at the centre of that is an incredible opportunity.”\n\nBut one area of uncertainty is the role of the tech companies. Houghton said: “The council won’t be paying them. Whether the government is, we have to wait and see.”\n\nMicrosoft already has a relationship with Barnsley College and, along with Google and Cisco, is understood to be working on a pro bono basis.\n\n“If we are going to get AI to work for Britain, we need Britons and British public services that can work with AI,” Kendall said. “If we can show that AI helps young people learn, supports local businesses to be more productive, and improves public services, then we can show what’s possible for the whole country. What we learn here will shape how we roll out AI across the UK.”\n\nMinisters have faced criticism over their handling of big technology companies. Last week the government launched a national AI training programme to upskill 10 million citizens, but many of the online courses turned out to be bespoke training for customers of particular companies such as Google, others cost as much as £525 to complete and some simply promoted the merits of particular company’s approaches to AI such as one explaining Microsoft’s “responsible AI approach”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said hundreds of courses on the AI Skills Hub are free and where payment is required it is clearly advertised. “All courses are reviewed against a common set of criteria to ensure they are relevant, high quality, and delivered by eligible organisations,” they said.\n\nMinisters have also been challenged for holding meetings with tech bosses at the rate of more than once each working day. The government insists engagement is vital to create growth and transform services.\n\n“It’s not about giving tech companies access to data they shouldn’t be having,” Houghton said. “It’s a secure programme and we are not leaving ourselves open. But this stuff is not going away. We have to make sure we are smart enough to protect people while taking advantage of the positive stuff it brings.”\n\nHannah Kitching, the leader of the council’s Liberal Democrat opposition, said investment in the town was welcome but “there is a lot of anxiety among people about the use of AI and whether it is a force for good. We know it could be but there are darker sides as well.”\n\n“[Barnsley] is still really connected to its mining past,” she said. “Younger people see the jobs and opportunities around the tech town idea but older generations perhaps don’t. There is a job to be done to get people onboard.”\n\nResidents “want the council to get the basics right”, she said. Roads were “absolutely crumbling” and in bad weather bins did not get collected, she added.",

Through an all-in-one platform deeply embedded within the criminal justice system, we recruit, train, and place justice-impacted individuals into life-changing careers.\n\nOur vision is to become the country’s unified workforce development system, replacing disconnected brick-and-mortar job centers with one integrated, tech-powered solution that meets low-income individuals exactly where they are. Today, the federal government spends billions annually on education and training programs, yet only about 70% of participants graduate, just 38.6% secure training-related employment, and average first-year earnings hover around $34,708.\n\nBefore Emerge, our founders Zo and Gabe co-founded Ameelio, an award-winning tech nonprofit that is dismantling the prison communication duopoly. Backed by tech luminaries like Reid Hoffman, Vinod Khosla, and Jack Dorsey, and by major criminal-justice philanthropies such as Arnold Ventures and the Mellon Foundation, Ameelio became a recognized leader in the space. Because of this experience both Zo and Gabe understood what it took to create change from within the system. After serving over 1M people impacted by incarceration, they witnessed firsthand the gap in second-chance opportunities and the chronic unemployment plaguing those impacted by the justice system. Emerge Career is committed to solving this issue.\n\nOur students are at the heart of our work. Their journeys have captured national attention on CBS, NBC, and in The Boston Globe, and our programs now serve entire states and cities. And we’re not doing it alone: our vision has attracted support from Alexis Ohanian (776),  Michael Seibel, Y Combinator, the Opportunity Fund, and public figures like Diana Taurasi, Deandre Ayton, and Marshawn Lynch. All of us believe that, with the right mix of technology and hands-on practice, we can redefine workforce development and deliver true second chances at scale.\n\nEmerge Career was designed to tackle two systemic issues: recidivism, fueled by post-incarceration unemployment and poverty, and labor shortages in key industries. Over 60% of formerly incarcerated people remain unemployed a year after incarceration, seeking work but not finding it. The reality is shocking, workforce development programs are severely limited inside prison, with only one-third of incarcerated people ever participating. To worsen, the available prison jobs offer meager wages, often less than $1 per hour, and often do not equip individuals with the skills for long-term stable employment.\n\nWe call this a Founding Design Engineer role, even three years in and with multiple contracts under our belt, for two reasons. First, you'll be our very first engineer, joining our co-founder, who's built the entire platform solo to date. Second, our growth is now outpacing our systems, and we can't keep up on maintenance alone. We're at a critical juncture: we can either hire someone to simply care for what exists, or we can bring on a talent who believes that, with the right blend of technology and hands-on practice, we can unify the workforce-development system and deliver second chances at true scale. We hope that can be you.\n\nThis is not a traditional engineering job. You'll build features in React and TypeScript, but your real job is helping students finish. That means understanding the human problem first: why do people disengage? What makes someone choose to keep going when the payoff is months away? You'll answer those questions through direct conversations, usability research, and watching how people actually use what you build. Then you'll prototype fast, ship real software, and measure whether it worked. Some days that looks like code. Other days it looks like a phone call, a support ticket, or a whiteboard session figuring out how to turn a one-off fix into a system that scales.\n\nThis role blends engineering, product, design, and program operations. We're looking for someone who believes good design can inspire a person to invest in their own future, and who wants to prove it, week after week, by shipping work that measurably helps students succeed. If you want to be close to users, own outcomes end to end, and build something that actually matters, you'll thrive here.\n\nYou design by building. You don't hand off mockups and wait. You open Cursor, Claude Code, or whatever gets you closest to a real, testable thing fastest. You might already be shipping code in production — or you're itching to. You believe the fastest path to a great design is putting something real in front of a real user and watching what happens.\n\nYou are relentlessly scrappy. You prototype in hours, not weeks. You'd rather test an ugly thing that teaches you something than polish a beautiful thing nobody's used yet. You know that at this stage, speed of learning is the only thing that matters. Fidelity comes later. Signal comes first.\n\nYou refuse to be blocked. When engineering bandwidth isn't there, you don't sit around. You figure it out — a Figma prototype, a coded prototype, a quick hack in the codebase. You treat \"waiting for a developer\" as a personal failure. You find a way or you make one.\n\nYou think in outcomes, not outputs. You don't measure your work in screens delivered. You measure it in whether students finished, whether they came back, whether the thing you shipped actually moved a number that matters. You're obsessed with the gap between what you designed and what actually happened.\n\nYou talk to users constantly. Not in scheduled quarterly research sprints — in real conversations, every week. You build relationships with students. You know their names, their blockers, their moments of doubt. Your best design ideas come from a 10-minute phone call, not a brainstorm.\n\nYou have strong taste but low ego. You have opinions about what good looks like and you'll fight for them. But when the data says you're wrong, you move on fast. You don't fall in love with your work. You fall in love with the problem.\n\nYou believe everyone deserves a second chance. You treat everyone with dignity. You know how to meet people exactly where they are — with empathy and compassion — helping create a space where everyone feels seen and valued, regardless of their background.\n\nYou work hard. You show up early, stay late, and do what needs to get done — no ego, no excuses. This isn't a 9-to-5. The team puts in 10+ hour days because we care about the mission and each other. If that sounds miserable, this isn't for you. If it sounds exciting, you'll fit right in.\n\nTalking to students — a lot. Your week starts and ends with users. You'll build real relationships with students, not just run usability sessions. You'll understand why someone almost quit, what message made them log back in, what screen confused them at 11pm. These conversations are your primary design tool.\n\nPrototyping at the speed of conversation. You hear a problem on a call Tuesday. By Wednesday you have something testable — a coded prototype, a functional hack, a Figma flow wired to real data. By Thursday a student is using it. By Friday you know if it worked. That's the cycle. Repeat.\n\nShipping real product, not just designs. You'll work in our React and TypeScript codebase — or use AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code to get there. The goal isn't to become a full-time engineer. The goal is to never let \"it hasn't been built yet\" slow down learning. Some of what you build will go straight to production. Some will be throwaway prototypes. You'll know the difference.\n\nDesigning the moments that keep students going. The hardest design problem here isn't layout or typography. It's commitment. Students are betting months of effort on a future they have to imagine. You'll study where they disengage, what triggers doubt, and what reignites momentum. Then you'll design the moments — an interface, a message, a milestone — that help someone choose to keep going. How do you make a better life in three months feel worth the sacrifice today? You'll own that problem.\n\nMeasuring what matters. Polished decks don't matter here. You'll define success metrics for what you ship, track whether completion rates moved, whether more students hit the next milestone, whether the intervention you designed actually intervened. You'll close the loop between design and outcome every time.\n\nWorking across the entire stack of the student experience. Some days that looks like interface design. Other days it looks like rethinking a Customer.io campaign, redesigning an onboarding flow, or sitting with the ops team to understand why students in one facility disengage faster than another. You go where the problem is.\n\nDocumenting your work clearly. Our work spans months and involves multiple teams. You'll create visibility when a change impacts operations and help others understand how features affect training and service delivery. Precision matters.",

    "description": "Deploy globally, query over HTTP, and scale reads with low latency. Bunny Database lets you build fast without paying the serverless tax.",
    "fullText": "Don’t want to babysit your app database on a VM but not willing to pay the DBaaS tax either? We're building a third way.\n\nToday, we’re launching Bunny Database as a public preview: a SQLite-compatible managed service that spins down when idle, keeps latency low wherever your users are, and doesn’t cost a fortune.\n\nIt’s become clear by now that the DBaaS platforms that garnered the love of so many devs are all going upmarket. Removing or dumbing down free tiers, charging for unused capacity, charging extra for small features, or bundling them in higher tiers — you already know the drill.\n\nHard to blame anyone for growing their business, but it doesn’t feel right when these services stop making sense for the very people who helped popularize them in the first place.\n\nNot every project needs Postgres, and that’s okay. Sometimes you just want a simple, reliable database that you can spin up quickly and build on, without worrying it’ll hit your wallet like an EC2.\n\nThat’s what we built Bunny Database for.\n\nGet the full tour including how to connect Bunny Database to your app in this quick demo from our DX Engineer, Jamie Barton:\n\nYou probably optimize the heck out of your frontend, APIs, and caching layers, all for the sake of delivering an experience that feels instant to your users. But when your database is far away from them, round-trip time starts to add noticeable latency.\n\nThe usual fix is to introduce more caching layers, denormalized reads, or other workarounds. That’s obviously no fun.\n\nAnd when you think about it, devs end up doing this because the popular DBaaS platforms are usually either limited, complex, or too costly when it comes to multi-region deployments. So what looks like a caching problem is actually a data locality issue.\n\nOK, but how bad can it really be?\n\nTo find out, we ran a read latency benchmark and measured p95 latency in Bunny Database.\n\nWe picked a number of regions across the world and compared round-trip time for client locations ever farther away from the database in:\n\nTurns out serving reads close to clients reduced latency by up to 99%.\n\nCheck out the full write-up on the benchmark setup and results here.\n\nWhile this definitely matters most to apps with global users, data locality does apply to everyone. With Bunny Database, you don’t have to stick to major data center locations and compensate with caching workarounds any more. Instead, you get a lot of flexibility to set up regions in an intuitive interface and it’s easy to switch things up as your requirements change.\n\nChoose between 3 deployment types when creating a database:\n\nAll of this lets you start wherever you’d like and add regions as needed, without re-architecting your app.\n\nIn the database world, capacity-based pricing gives you some predictability. But no one likes to pay for unused capacity, right?\n\nServerless, on the other hand, is supposed to be cost-efficient, yet can rack up bills quickly, especially when the DBaaS charges significant markups on top of already pricey compute.\n\nWe don’t do hyperscalers, though, so we can charge a fair price for Bunny Database in a usage-based model.\n\nDuring the public preview phase, Bunny Database is free.\n\nBunny Database wouldn’t be possible without libSQL, the open-source, open-contribution fork of SQLite created by Turso.\n\nWe run Bunny Database on our own fork of libSQL, which gives us the freedom to integrate it tightly with the bunny.net platform and handle the infrastructure and orchestration needed to run it as a managed, multi-region service.\n\nWhat does this mean for Bunny Database’s upstream feature parity with libSQL and SQLite, respectively?\n\nThe short answer is that we don’t currently promise automatic or complete feature parity with either upstream libSQL or the latest SQLite releases.\n\nWhile libSQL aims to stay compatible with SQLite’s API and file format, it doesn’t move in lockstep with upstream SQLite. We wouldn’t expect otherwise, especially as Turso has shifted focus from libSQL toward a long-term rewrite of SQLite in Rust.\n\nFor Bunny Database, this means that compatibility today is defined by the libSQL version we’re built on, rather than by chasing every upstream SQLite or libSQL change as it lands. We haven’t pulled in any upstream changes yet, and we don’t currently treat upstream parity as an automatic goal.\n\nThat’s intentional. Our focus so far has been on making Bunny Database reliable and easy to operate as a service. We think bringing in upstream changes only makes sense when they clearly improve real-world use cases, not just to tick a parity checkbox.\n\nIf there are specific libSQL features you’d like to see exposed in Bunny Database, or recent SQLite features you’d want us to pull in, we’d love to hear about it. Join our Discord to discuss your use cases and help shape the roadmap!\n\nSpeaking of the roadmap, we don’t stop cooking. Here’s what’s coming up next:\n\nThere’s even more to come, but it’s too soon to spill the beans yet, especially while we’re in public preview. We’d love to hear your feedback, so we can shape what ships next together.\n\nBunny Database works standalone and fits right into your stack via the SDKs (or you can hook up anything using the HTTP API). But it also plays nicely with Bunny Edge Scripting and Bunny Magic Containers.\n\nTo connect your database to an Edge Script or a Magic Containers app, simply go to the Access tab of the chosen database and click Generate Tokens to create new access credentials for it.\n\nOnce they’re generated, you’ll get two paths to choose from:\n\nAfter you complete the setup, the database URL and access token will be available as environment variables in your script or app. Use them to connect to your database:\n\nYou can find more detailed, step-by-step integration instructions in the docs:\n\nWe can’t wait to see what you’ll build with Bunny Database and what you think of it. During the public preview phase, you get 50 databases per user account, each capped at 1 GB, but we hope this should be more than enough for lots of fun projects.\n\nJust sign in to the bunny.net dashboard to get started. Happy building!",

    "title": "SpiceDB Query Planner",
    "description": "The SpiceDB query planner project explains the architecture on how we're improving the performance of every permission check.",
    "fullText": "In the years since SpiceDB premiered as the first enterprise-ready implementation of ReBAC, we’ve seen users model authorization in all sorts of ways, including with schemas with recursion, very deep nesting, and with relationships that connect thousands and thousands of objects in their system to one subject. At the same time, many have told us that that they required even lower latency from their authorization checks.\n\nOver the years, we’ve added many strategies to push SpiceDB’s performance limits to new heights:\n\nAll these strategies helped us reduce the number and size of calls that we had to make to the underlying datastore, which is the number one bottleneck in achieving low latency.\n\nHowever, these strategies often missed one crucial piece of information: the shape of the customer’s data.\n\nLet’s explore what we mean by that with this schema:\n\nImagine a CheckPermission query for document:budget, view, user:maria . The view permission is an arrow operation that can be expressed as “for every group that is related to document:budget, find the members. Then, find if user:maria is one of them.”\n\nThe naive solution to answer this is to do… that. Look up every group related to document:budget, then for each group see if user:maria is a member. This is (very) roughly how CheckPermission is implemented: it thinks of the relationships as a directed graph, then it starts at the resource node and attempts to follow all the paths available to the subject node until it either reaches the subject node or it doesn’t. (This is done in a highly concurrent fashion; it’s not your standard Breadth-First Search algorithm).\n\nTo solve the CheckPermission(document:budget, view, user:maria), we potentially have to explore every colored path in the graph of permissions. We stop when we find one.\n\nHowever, what happens in the extreme cases (the ones our customers had)?\n\nThis is the key piece of information that we were not using: the shape of the relationships. For example: how many groups are there? Are users members of one or a million groups?\n\nOr, put differently: if we start exploring a sub-graph, how much time will we need? How expensive is it?\n\nNow imagine that the CheckPermission call is for document:budget, edit, user:maria. This permission is an intersection. Solving this question is roughly equivalent to traversing the graph below as fast as possible until we reach user:maria.\n\nTo solve this intersection we potentially have to explore every colored path.\n\nIntersections are special, however: if one of the sub-permissions returns NO_PERMISSION, we can short-circuit immediately. So, for example, if we check the #editor path first and find we can’t reach the subject, we don’t need to explore the other paths!\n\nIf user:maria is NOT an editor, we do NOT need to explore the group#member paths!\n\nToday, to resolve this intersection, SpiceDB will try to explore the view and editor paths in parallel, with no preference as to what path it evaluates first. But, if we knew that the editor set had zero or near-zero elements, we could have tried that path first and only if it succeeds we would have gone down the potentially expensive path of evaluating view.\n\nThe broad problem here is that SpiceDB takes a simple approach: it doesn’t make decisions at query time about the fastest way to explore a graph to solve a query, because it doesn’t know the average cost of exploring a sub-graph.\n\nThe query planner is our new experimental implementation of the CheckPermission API (and other APIs, as we progress) that decides at query time how to resolve a check in a way that minimizes work through the use of various optimizations. It’s the means by which SpiceDB will make smart decisions based on the shape of the query and graph.\n\nThe first step is to understand the shape of a query in the abstract. Let’s consider our document:budget, view, user:maria query. We know that for this query, when we consider the schema:\n\nOne way to think about the arrow operation is the way we phrased it above:\n\nFor every group that is related to document:budget, find the members. Then, find if user:maria is one of them.\n\nHowever, we can also phrase it in terms of set intersections, or as a JOIN in database-speak:\n\nThere’s 0 or more groups connected to document:budget, and there’s 0 or more groups that user:maria is a member of. Is there at least one group in common between the two sets?\n\nThis phrasing of the problem is the key that unlocks our first optimization: we can choose which set to look at first, depending on which set we expect to be smaller, and then the subsequent problem space is smaller. In other words, we can reorder the evaluation of an arrow depending on the shape of the data, provided that we have statistics about our data. These statistics are then stored alongside our graph and provide an estimation of cost of traversal. The two examples below demonstrate this:\n\nThe query planner converts our graph traversal into a smart traversal using cost estimates. In this case, exploring the view subgraph has high cost because both sides of the group->member arrow contain many elements.\n\nThe query planner converts our graph traversal into a smart traversal using cost estimates. In this case, exploring the view subgraph has low cost because the left-hand side of the group->memberarrow has zero elements.\n\nWe can make a similar optimization for unions (+) by ordering the relations from largest-to-smallest respectively, and we’ll continue adding additional optimizations and heuristics as time goes on.\n\nHow we represent a query plan allows us to make these changes and modify how we evaluate a query at runtime. The query plan is a tree of operations, each step representing a set of paths reachable in the graph. We may not directly evaluate every node in this tree, but these provide building blocks we can reorder to change how it gets evaluated.\n\nIn our example, the basic level of iterator is direct group membership: a group member that points at a user — let’s call this Relation(group:member) . Similarly, the document is assigned to a group by its relation, Relation(document:group).\n\nThe view permission, then, represented as a document belonging to a group, is the arrow, group->member. Now our tree looks like Arrow(Relation(document:group), Relation(group:member)) .\n\nThen we can layer on the next fact; an editor is a Relation(document:editor) and the edit permission requires a path that is a view permission and an editor relation. We already have view permission, that’s given above!

    "description": "A simple model (Shell Theory) explaining how AI can raise baseline output, disproportionately rewards high-agency users, while at the same time risking long-term skill erosion.",
    "fullText": "My teammate and I keep having the same argument. One moment we're witness to the cascade. Watching us software engineers become empty shells, mere relays for whatever the AI produced. The next moment we're amazed how iterative collaboration with AI keeps pushing our boundaries beyond what we thought achievable.\n\nBoth observations feel true simultaneously.\n\nThree narratives keep surfacing in our discussions:\n\nThese statements seem logically incompatible. The amplification of skill argument is moot if everyone is an expert by default. Relying more on AI can't simultaneously amplify skill and erode critical thinking. And if AI gives us expert quality regardless, there's no reason to worry about reduction in critical thinking.\n\nI've been trying to reconcile this intuition into something concrete. What follows is a model. It's not scientifically validated, but useful for reasoning about what we're observing.\n\nLet's define output without AI as a function of agency (V) and experience level (E):\n\nAgency is the foundation. Experience multiplies your output. In this model a principal engineer with low agency still produces less than a senior with high agency.\n\nHere it gets interesting. AI introduces exponential amplification, but this amplification is masked by a floor until your yield exceeds it:\n\nResolving contradictions 1 and 2: The floor-ceiling mechanism.\n\n The model resolves the apparent conflict between \"AI gives everyone 80%\" and \"AI amplifies skill.\" They are actually mathematically distinct effects operating on different populations. When Y < F, you're being rescued to the flatline. You ship working code and feel productive, but your output is artificially lifted to a floor you cannot pass. When Y > F, AI triggers exponential amplification; your yield scales with both agency and experience. The max(F, Y) function ensures the floor, while the exponential in Y raises the ceiling.\n\nResolving contradiction 3: Agency matters.\n\n The concern that \"relying on AI erodes critical thinking\" isn't addressed by the model's equations. It's addressed by how agency is defined. The model treats V as a parameter, but the definition describes agency as responsive: growing through deliberate practice, atrophying through disuse.\n\nThis creates a feedback loop that the math alone doesn't show:\n\nThe model doesn't predict this erosion, but it explains why the erosion matters. Your position isn't determined by a one-time calculation; it's determined by what V becomes over time. Two engineers with identical starting positions can diverge: one practices deliberate engagement and grows V, eventually breaking into the amplification zone. The other accepts the rescue, lets V decay, and becomes permanently dependent on the flatline.\n\nThis is why contradiction 3 coexists with contradictions 1 and 2. AI can amplify skill (for those above the flatline). AI does provide a floor (for everyone). And AI may erode critical thinking (for those who let the floor replace engagement). The determining variable is whether you treat the flatline as a safety net or a hammock.\n\nFeel free to skip this section. What follows is an attempt to assert the model against real-world anchors. If you're not interested in the math, jump ahead to The Model in Practice. The calibration points that follow are illustrative. The model's value isn't in the exact numbers but in the structural insight: Floor and amplification are distinct mechanisms operating on different populations.\n\nReal expertise development has been hypothesized to follow different types of curves. Logarithmic (rapid early gains, diminishing returns), S-shaped (slow start, steep middle, plateau), or non-uniform (qualitative leaps between levels). There's no consensus in the literature on which pattern best describes software engineering capability growth. Linear is simple, and for a thought experiment, simple wins:\n\nNote that with this definition juniors get zero amplification by design. The ability to leverage AI beyond the flatline is in itself what distinguishes a higher experience level.\n\nTo determine F, we need a reference point. AGI provides that anchor. But what is AGI in measurable terms?\n\nThe SWE-bench verified benchmark offers a concrete proxy. This benchmark evaluates AI models on 500 real GitHub bug-fixing tasks where they must produce patches that pass actual test suites. Crucially, these tasks come with human time estimates: 91% take less than one hour for an \"experienced engineer\" who has \"a few hours to familiarize themselves with the codebase.\"\n\nThe phrase \"experienced engineer\" is key. SWE-bench was calibrated against senior-level performance on well-defined tasks. And it only measures a slice of engineering work: fixing bugs in existing codebases with clear acceptance criteria. It doesn't measure architectural decisions, system design, handling ambiguous requirements, or greenfield development.\n\nThis gives us our first anchor: AGI on SWE-bench = F = 100 correlates with the output of a moderate-agency senior on well-defined work.\n\nThe leading models today (Claude Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 Pro) score around 74% on SWE-bench Verified. This gives us the current flatline: F = 74.\n\nIf a moderate senior (E=3) produces 100 on SWE-bench-type tasks without AI:\n\nThis gives us: V = 25 represents moderate agency.\n\nWith V = 25 as the anchor, we model agency as normally distributed across the engineering population. Assuming a variation of 20% with μ = 25 gives σ = 5:\n\nThe exact values are illustrative. What matters is the concept: Agency varies meaningfully across engineers, and this variance affects output before AI even enters the equation.\n\nIf you have lower agency, you can still reach the flatline. It just takes longer to get there.\n\nTo define the slope of the exponential curve, we need a calibration point. A known relationship between experience and amplification. Without empirical data stratified by experience level, we make an informed assumption: at principal level (E=4), AI amplifies output to 2× R_noAI.\n\nIt reflects a hypothesis that the most experienced engineers can roughly double their effective output through AI collaboration. Leveraging it for code generation, exploration, and iteration while applying judgement that compounds the result.\n\nUsing the standard technique for deriving an exponential rate constant (taking the natural logarithm of both sides) we get:\n\nThis anchors the exponential curve. AI is powerful enough to meaningfully amplify engineers, with the curve calibrated to reach 2× at principal level. If future evidence suggests principals achieve a different amplification ratio—say, 3×—then A would become ln(3)/1.5 ≈ 0.732.\n\nWith each parameter anchored to an assumption, here's how the model plays out:\n\nThe asymmetry is clear: below the flatline, the exponential yield exists but is masked—everyone sees 74. Above it, the exponential becomes visible and compounds experience, reaching 2× output at principal level.\n\nThe model assumes you're working within a single domain where your experience level applies uniformly. Reality is messier. A single task often demands multiple skill domains and your experience level differs across them.\n\nConsider a senior backend engineer who doesn't know frontend, building a full-stack feature. AI amplifies their backend work exponentially while rescuing their frontend work to the flatline. The final output can be equally impressive though.\n\nWhat differs is the force behind the output. A specialist operating entirely above the flatline earns their amplified output through skill. A generalist in the blend achieves high output through a combination: part genuine skill amplification (in their strong domains), part being rescued (in their weak domains).\n\nThis matters for growth. When output comes from skill, you're building compound advantage. When output comes from the flatline, you're borrowing capability you haven't earned yet. This is not bad, but let's remain honest about which parts of your work are truly yours. Most importantly, your compound depends on the agency you are showing and the time you have already spent building experience. AI can accelerate knowledge acquisition. But seniority is knowledge and experience. You still need to live through production incidents, watch systems evolve, and feel the consequences of decisions that seemed fine until they weren't.\n\nThe flatline F currently sits at 74, and with AGI the flatline rises to F = 100. Every developer gets lifted to senior-level execution as their new floor on scoped work.\n\nBut AGI on SWE-bench doesn't demonstrate the ability to make architectural trade-offs, scope ambiguous problems, or engage in higher-order thinking to determine which tasks should exist in the first place. And benchmarks that do test these capabilities (ARC-AGI-2 for compositional reasoning, RE-Bench for long-horizon R&D, SPIN-Bench for strategic planning under uncertainty) show significant gaps. The exponential amplification zone doesn't disappear, but shifts to a different domain.\n\nThe amplification advantage depends on your yield exceeding the flatline: Y(V, E) > F. As F rises, fewer engineers qualify. At some point, the flatline exceeds what any human can produce even with AI assistance, and the amplification zone disappears entirely.\n\nThe maximum AI-assisted output in our model is a high-agency principal: Y(35, 4) = 35 × 5 × 2 = 350. If AI capability reached F = 350, even the best engineers would fall below the flatline. At that point, everyone produces 350—the flatline value—regardless of agency or experience. No amplification, no differentiation. Just the floor. It's the penthouse floor though.\n\nThe intermediate thresholds tell the story of who loses amplification as F rises:\n\nBeyond F = 100, we're extrapolating past the SWE-bench anchor into speculation.\nWhat the model does predict with more confidence: as F rises, the amplification zone shrinks. The threshold for \"bringing enough to exceed the flatline\" keeps rising. Whether the threshold will rise enough to exceed human capability is an open question, but the direction of pressure is clear.\n\nIf you stay in the flatline zone, accepting AI's first answer, never pushing beyond what it hands you, then you're being rescued, not amplified. Your skills may atrophy. You become a shell.\n\nIf you operate above the flatline, using AI as a sparring partner, iterating on its suggestions, bringing domain expertise and architectural judgment, then you're being exponentially amplified. You become more capable than you could be alone.\n\nThe same tool, but with two completely different outcomes. The variable is you.",

    "description": "NASA spent most of Monday trying to overcome hydrogen leaks on the Artemis II rocket.",
    "fullText": "The launch of NASA’s Artemis II mission, the first flight of astronauts to the Moon in more than 53 years, will have to wait another month after a fueling test Monday uncovered hydrogen leaks in the connection between the rocket and its launch platform at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\n“Engineers pushed through several challenges during the two-day test and met many of the planned objectives,” NASA said in a statement following the conclusion of the mock countdown, or Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), early Tuesday morning. “To allow teams to review data and conduct a second Wet Dress Rehearsal, NASA now will target March as the earliest possible launch opportunity for the flight test.”\n\nThe practice countdown was designed to identify problems and provide NASA an opportunity to fix them before launch. Most importantly, the test revealed NASA still has not fully resolved recurring hydrogen leaks that delayed the launch of the unpiloted Artemis I test flight by several months in 2022. Artemis I finally launched successfully after engineers revised their hydrogen loading procedures to overcome the leak.\n\nNow, the second Space Launch System (SLS) rocket is on the cusp of launching a crew for the first time. The Artemis II mission will send four astronauts inside NASA’s Orion spacecraft on a loop around the far side of the Moon on the first crewed lunar flight since 1972, paving the way for future expeditions to land humans at the Moon’s south pole.\n\nGoing into the countdown rehearsal, NASA officials hoped a smooth test would clear the way to launch the Artemis II mission as soon as Sunday, February 8. NASA has only a handful of launch opportunities for Artemis II each month, when the Moon is in the right location in its orbit to allow the Orion spacecraft to fly a so-called free return trajectory and come back to Earth for a safe reentry and splashdown.\n\nThe first launch opportunity for Artemis II next month is March 6, with a two-hour launch window opening at 8:29 pm EST (01:26 UTC on March 7).\n\nArtemis II commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, mission specialist Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen have been in medical quarantine since January 21, a standard practice for astronauts preparing to fly to space. They will now be released from quarantine at their home base in Houston to resume training and await a new launch date.\n\nNASA’s Artemis launch team, stationed a few miles away from the SLS rocket on its seaside launch pad, started fueling operations around midday Monday, somewhat later than scheduled due to cold temperatures at the Florida spaceport. The launch team first detected leaking hydrogen soon after they began loading the super-cold fuel into the SLS core stage.\n\nThe leak appeared in the same location it did during the Artemis I launch campaign nearly three years ago. Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen flow from ground storage tanks into the SLS core stage through so-called Tail Service Mast Umbilicals (TSMUs), two roughly 30-foot-tall gray pods rising from the base of the rocket’s mobile launch platform. The TSMUs route propellant lines through connections near the bottom of the core stage, where umbilical plates on the rocket side and ground side meet. At liftoff, the umbilical plates disconnect as the rocket begins its climb off the launch pad.\n\nHydrogen is one of the most efficient rocket fuels, but it is notoriously difficult to handle. Liquified hydrogen must be stored at minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 253 degrees Celsius), cold enough to change the shape and size of seals and other soft goods in the fueling line. This can create leak paths not readily detectable at ambient temperatures. Hydrogen molecules are the smallest and lightest in the Universe, with the ability to find their way through the tiniest of breaches.\n\nBecause of this, NASA engineers accept that a small amount of hydrogen will escape seals in the fueling line. Agency officials said in 2022 that the safe limit was a 4 percent concentration of hydrogen gas in the housing around the fueling connector. Hydrogen levels exceeded NASA’s safety limit multiple times during the practice countdown that ran from Monday into early Tuesday.\n\n“ Attempts to resolve the issue involved stopping the flow of liquid hydrogen into the core stage, allowing the interface to warm up for the seals to reseat, and adjusting the flow of the propellant,” NASA said in a statement.\n\nNASA appeared to get past the problem Monday evening and fully loaded the 322-foot-tall (98-meter) rocket with more than 750,000 gallons of propellant.\n\nWith fueling complete, managers sent a closeout crew to the launch pad around 6:00 pm EST (23:00 UTC) to close the hatch to the Orion spacecraft sitting atop the SLS rocket. The closeout team will help the Artemis II astronauts into the Orion capsule on launch day, but the crew was not part of the practice countdown Monday night.\n\nThe closeout crew took longer than anticipated to close and secure the hatch to the Orion spacecraft. A valve associated with Orion’s hatch pressurization inadvertently vented, according to NASA, requiring the closeout crew to retorque the valve. The launch team dealt with several other glitches, including audio dropouts on ground communication loops and camera problems believed to be caused by recent cold weather in Central Florida.\n\nFinally, with the closeout crew a safe distance away from the rocket, the launch team gave approval to begin the final 10 minutes of the countdown shortly after midnight Tuesday. The objective was to stop the countdown clock 33 seconds prior to launch, about the same time the rocket would take control of the countdown during a real launch attempt.\n\nInstead, the clock stopped at T-minus 5 minutes and 15 seconds. NASA said the countdown terminated “due to a spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate.” The countdown ended before the rocket switched to internal power and fully pressurized its four propellant tanks. The test also concluded before the rocket activated its auxiliary power units to run the core stage’s four main engines through a preflight steering check, all milestones engineers hoped to cross off their checklist.\n\nLaunch controllers began work to drain the SLS rocket’s propellant tanks after calling an end to the countdown. With the test incomplete, NASA managers quickly decided to hold off on launching the Artemis II mission to allow time for ground teams to “fully review data from the test, mitigate each issue, and return to testing ahead of setting an official target launch date.”\n\n“As always, safety remains our top priority, for our astronauts, our workforce, our systems, and the public,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a social media post. “We will only launch when we believe we are as ready to undertake this historic mission.”\n\nOfficials did not immediately announce when they might be ready for a second Wet Dress Rehearsal, or whether they plan to roll the rocket back to its assembly building for repairs. NASA managers plan to hold a press briefing Tuesday afternoon to discuss the results of the test in more detail.",

    "fullText": "Like all worthy Dreams, it may take years or decades to achieve. Alas, the human motivation system can’t learn from rewards with a year-long delay.\n\nSo, you're instead advised to “trust the process”, and convert your long-term goal into regular short-term micro-goals:\n\nThis is great advice, and I endorse it, but… it feels incomplete? If every day I just focus on this day, I feel like I'm in a hamster wheel, hitting my same micro-goal over and over again, but for what? Intellectually, I know \"for what\" — the Dream — but I don't feel it anymore.\n\nSo, here's a solution that reliably helps me feel the connection between my past, present & future: lines on a graph!\n\nLet's look at 3 examples: project management, money, and weight loss.\n\nThe good news is I’m my own boss. The bad news is my boss is a moron.\n\nSpecifically, my boss (me) is bad at project management. She (I) still is (am), to be honest. But the tool that's helped me the most is the Burndown Chart.\n\nHow it works: First, give your project (or \"sprint\") a deadline, and break it down into small tasks. Give each task a number of \"points\" it's worth (I just make points = hours). Then each day, do tasks. Your burndown chart software will then show you, in a single graph:\n\n( example chart by User:PabloStraub ⤵ )\n\nWhen I shipped my latest project, a 20,000-word-with-40-illustrations behemoth, I used a variant called a Burnup Chart, which also tracks total estimated time over time, to see how badly I mis-estimated how long tasks would take. Here's my actual chart:\n\n( As you can see: I started off estimating that project would take ~25 hours, but by the end it turned out to be ~75h. I was off by a factor of three, yeesh. But thanks to this Burnup Chart design, I could account for my own mis-accounting, and see where the blue & red trendlines would intersect, to get a better estimate of when I'd actually finish my project. And I did, in fact, finish by Dec 1st 2025, as planned! )\n\nThe best part about Burndown/Burnup charts? I can see how different decisions will affect the future, today. For example, I can try deleting a task, or taking an extra break day, or increasing hours worked a day, and immediately see how that'd affect when I'll finish my project.\n\n(Here's a blank template, and here's an actual example of when I used it.)\n\nAnother example of \"see your effect on the future, today\" — just enter your current income & spending into a spreadsheet, multiply by the compounding interest of your savings/investments, and voilà: (example data, not my real finances)\n\nAgain, this lets you play with decisions like \"what if I tried to increase income by this much\", \"what if I tried to reduce my rent by that much\", and you get instant future-feedback.\n\nBut more importantly, it helps you viscerally see the connection between your short-term micro-goals, and long-term Dream. \"Put $10 a day into savings\" is doable but doesn't sound like much, but — just do the math — and you'll find it's enough to retire a millionaire at age 63, already adjusted for inflation, starting from zero money!\n\n(yes, for people living paycheck-to-paycheck or less, \"put aside $10 a day\" isn't feasible. but for most middle-class people and up, it should be.)\n\n( Quick aside, the best advice for almost all laypeople: ditch the fancy BS mutual funds, and forget about day-trading stocks. Just put your money in a very-low-fee diversified index fund. If that feels icky because you're investing in capitalism, remember, if you put your money in a savings account, your bank will still invest it, they'll just give you nothing but crumbs. Also: you can pick a socially-responsible index fund that excludes weaponry & fossil fuels. )\n\n( Here's the spreadsheets for both the above money examples )\n\nFinally, the most cliché New Year's Resolution: losing weight. Again, use a spreadsheet with lines on a graph: (my actual data)\n\nYou can see, at a glance, the connection between:\n\n( I find that visualizing the trendline is emotionally helpful, because weight is so variable from day to day. Seeing the trendline helps reassure me, ignore the daily noise, I'm on the right track. )\n\nAnd again, you can play with what if's, and get instant future-feedback.\nA daily micro-goal like \"250 calorie deficit\" (one less cookie a day) — do the math[1] — becomes \"lose 50lb (23kg) in two years\" (enough to get you from moderately-Obese to \"Healthy\" BMI!)\n\n( IMPORTANT: a) Yes both BMI and the Calorie-In-Calorie-Out model are very incomplete and flawed, b) Being Overweight & Obese Class I (25 < BMI < 35) is probably fine health-wise; previous studies didn't control for exercise levels & cardiovascular fitness (see Figures 3 & 4), c) May I interest you in the Potato Diet? Potatoes fill you up very fast (high protein & high fiber if you keep the skins), have almost all the daily nutrients you need, and are versatile foods you can cook in many ways to keep the diet interesting. I did the Potato Diet for a month and lost 10 pounds, and I was already \"Normal\" BMI! d) Or, ask your doctor about semaglutide. (see Figure 1) )\n\nHere's my weight-tracking Google Sheets template!\n\n\"Huh, what an interesting & inspiring article! I'll try this later\"\n\n(one year later)\n\n\"Oh no I forgot.\"\n\n~ you, if you don't implement this right now.\n\nSo before you close this tab, at least ask yourself:\n\n1) What's a Dream you have, that you've wanted for a long while, yet haven't done it yet?\n\nNo shame here, it can be as wacky or tacky as your heart desires. For example:\n\nNo, seriously, stop & think of a Dream you have. Silently think it and/or write it down, before continuing.\n\n2) How can you convert your long-term Dream into a regular micro-goal?\n\nRunning with the above examples:\n\n📕 \"Write a Great novel\" ⇒ Write/edit 500 words a day.\n\n🧠 \"Master the secrets of the universe Physics\" ⇒ Study 1 hour a day.\n\n( It is not exactly a well-kept secret that the modern university system is horribly broken. Relevant SMBC: )\n\n( If you don't have the pre-requisite math skills for Susskind's lectures, add an extra five months of \"study 1 hour a day\", and use Khan Academy for high-school algebra (~12 hours of lectures), and 3Blue1Brown for calculus (~3 hours) and linear algebra (~3 hours). So that's an extra 18h of lectures, and given our above study plan where we tackle 2h of lectures per 2 weeks, that's an extra 18 weeks, or about five months, of self-study. Again, at just 1 hour a day. What a steal of a deal! )\n\nStep 1, know your long-term Dream. Step 2, break it down into a sustainable regular micro-goal. This step is tricky; if you're stuck, paste a link to this blog post into Claude (with web search turned on), tell 'em your Dream, and ask Claude to help you break down your Dream into sustainable micro-goals, with inspiration from the above two examples.\n\nI strongly recommend using a spreadsheet program like Google Sheets, Excel, or Numbers. It needs more setup than an app, but you get full freedom to customize it however you like! If you need help setting up a spreadsheet, look up YouTube or consult Claude. Again, you can also get started with my templates:\n\nAlternatively, you can use these apps:\n\n(If you don't want to do this final step today, set an exact day & hour in your Calendar to do this, so you don't forget to do it!)\n\nTry it out for one area of your life, then slowly expand to others, one Dream at a time.\n\nQ: If it really is that trivially easy to write one book a year, become a millionaire by middle age, go from Obese to \"Healthy\" BMI, and gain university-level mastery of hard skills & topics… why isn't everybody already doing this? Heck, why aren't you doing this, Nicky. Why aren't you already a millionaire polymath scientist-artist supermodel bestselling author?\n\nA: lol i dunno. i guess everyone's only living at 2% of their true potential\n\n( in 2026, i resolve to live up to 5% of my true potential! )\n\n( edit: ok, actual answer to this paradox, I think, is something like \"hyperbolic discounting sucks\". Less jargon-y: human brains tend to overweigh the short-term over long-term, because the short-term is more immediately visible. My hope is the \"lines on a graph\" trick helps work around this brain-glitch, by making the long-term more vivid and here. )\n\n“Write a novel a year” sounds impossible. Most bestselling authors aren’t that prolific. “Write 500 words a day” sounds trivial. You do that unthinkingly between texts & DMs & Slacks.\n\nYet they’re the same goal, just on different time-scales.\n\nThat’s the magic of micro-goals and lines-on-a-graph, seeing your past + present + future at a single glance: you can connect the impossible Dream with the possible Daily, see your effect on the future today, and browse the multiverse of possible futures for the one your heart desires.\n\n📈 Happy Line-making, everyone!\n\n~ Nicky Case\n\nP.S: One of my Dreams this year is to write one blog post a week. I hope you found value in this first entry of my \"one post a week\" challenge for 2026!\n\nLet's do the math: I expect my posts to be 2,000 words on average. (this one's 2,600 words long.) So if I write & polish 500 words a day, I can get 1 post done per 4 weekdays, giving me a good buffer. 2,000 words per week × 52 weeks per year = 104,000 words. That's the size of two books.\n\nIf you'd like to keep up on my \"books disguised a blog\", Every end of month, I'll share links to the 4 or 5 posts I wrote — this way, you can skip the ones that don't interest you:\n\nI also reflected on 2025 and wrote more on my resolutions for 2026, in this public Patreon post. You can support my research & writings (always free, online, and open-source!) via Patreon, Ko-Fi, or PayPal ⤵\n\nBless your cotton socks! Happy new year 2026! 🎉 🎊 🎉\n\nA simple (but inaccurate) rule-of-thumb is Wishnofsky's Rule: 1 pound of fat ~= 3500 kcal. (This rule is inaccurate & there are better models, but honestly it's not too far off.) In other words, with a calorie deficit of 250 kcal a day, you'll have a deficit of 3500 kcal in 14 days, or burning 1 pound of fat per 2 weeks. So, over 2 years, that's ~104 weeks, or burning 104/2 = 52 pounds (23kg). Given the standard BMI model (which, yes, is also inaccurate but let's roll with this for now), 52lb/23kg is enough to take you from moderately Obese to \"Healthy\". ↩︎\n\nRandom web sites claim that most published books \"should\" be around 80,000 to 100,000 words, with Young Adult having a smaller word count, and 40,000 at minimum to count as a novel, not \"novella\". I'm picking 50,000 to make the math easy to follow.\n\nSome Great novels around 50,000 words: Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. 50k words is plenty! ↩︎",

    "description": "The former Yankees All-Star shared a Fox News clip of Speaker Mike Johnson while accusing Democrats of trying to defund ICE.",
    "fullText": "The battle over ICE funding is getting louder with ex-Yankees All-Star Mark Teixeira blasting Democrats online\n\n“Democrats are so radical that they’re willing to shut down the government to defund ICE,” Teixeira wrote on X/Twitter, quote-tweeting a FOX news segment that ran on Sunday. “They want to tear America down, Conservatives want to build it up.\"\n\nIn the FOX News segment, House Speaker Mike Johnson was asked about efforts by democrats in congress to defund ICE.\n\n“We put all of that funding into the Big Beautiful Bill, the working families tax cut, and i’m glad that we did because we had to fix the crisis that was created by the Biden Administration ... they opened the border wide, it was absolute chaos,” Johnson said in a clip shared on X/Twitter. “We allowed, by some estimates, 20 million illegal aliens to come into the country, and many of them hardened, dangerous people, criminals. We’ve got to get them out of the country. So we had to front-load the funding. That will be there as you noted. It doesn’t matter what they do to the current DHS bill, those operations will continue.”\n\nIn the current DHS funding negotiations, Democrats are attempting to “rein in” ICE by proposing significant policy reforms and budget cuts, according to Government Executive.\n\nAmong the things Democrats have pushed for, they’re calling for a $115 million reduction in enforcement, the mandatory use of body cameras and proper identification for agents.\n\nThese efforts were intensified following recent fatal shootings involving federal agents in Minneapolis, leading Senate Democrats to successfully strip the DHS funding out of a larger spending package to force further negotiations.\n\nAs Johnson noted, however, these attempts will likely have little to no impact on ICE’s actual operations because the agency is already funded the previously passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBBA).\n\nThrough that Bill, ICE received $75 billion in multi-year funding that it can use regardless of the current year’s budget outcome. Because of this existing reserve, ICE can continue its operations or several years even if Congress cuts its annual budget or if the government enters a partial shutdown.\n\nOn Aug. 28, Teixeira announced that he’d be running in Texas’s 21st Congressional District, where Rep. Chip Roy will not seek re-election as he runs for Texas Attorney General.\n\nTeixeira is a Maryland native who currently lives in the Austin area. He spent the first four-plus years of his major-league career with the Texas Rangers.\n\nThe three-time All-Star concluded his career with eight years on the Yankees, winning a World Series in 2009.\n\nTeixeira retired in 2016 after a 14-year career in which he hit .268 with a .869 OPS and 409 home runs.\n\nMets, Yankees showing interest in Gold Glove first baseman\n\nTrump unearths 36-year-old letter from George Steinbrenner: ‘You should run for president’\n\nEx-Yankees, Mets pitcher announces retirement\n\nMichael Kay exposes Yankees’ biggest problem — and it has nothing to do with their roster\n\nAre Yankees capable of beating Dodgers in 2026?

    "fullText": "Former ESPN host Sage Steele mocked the musicians who criticized Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Grammys because, she said, they are too ignorant to opine.\n\nOn Sunday, several prominent musicians slammed ICE amid the ongoing and sometimes violent raids by the agency and Border Patrol. Last month, agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in separate incidents in Minneapolis, where the Trump administration has deployed about 3,000 immigration agents, who have detained children and arrested asylum-seekers. According to an internal memo, ICE officials told its agents that they do not need a judicial warrant to enter people’s homes.\n\nAt the Grammys on Sunday night, several musicians spoke out against ICE. While accepting the award for Best Música Urbana Album, Bad Bunny, who will perform during the Super Bowl halftime show, said, “Before I say thanks to God, I’m gonna say: ICE out!”\n\nKehlani, who won Best R&B Performance, told the Grammys crowd, “F*ck ICE.”\n\nOn Monday’s Jesse Watters Primetime on Fox News, Steele, a former SportsCenter host, ripped the anti-ICE sentiment.\n\n“I only watched for about 15 minutes, but it was enough to really set the tone for what I knew what it would ultimately be,” she said. “And I gotta tell you, none of us should be surprised at this point, but it is still disappointing.”\n\nSteele went on to reference a refrain by Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who in 2018 ripped LeBron James for criticizing President Donald Trump.\n\n“Keep the political comments to yourselves,” Ingraham said at the time. “Shut up and dribble.”\n\n“And I’d liken it to what the great Laura Ingraham said years ago,” Steele said. “‘Shut up and dribble.’ It isn’t because we didn’t want to hear athletes’ opinions on things. Maybe here or there, but it’s because we learned that they don’t tend to base it in fact. They base it on TikTok news or left-wing media narratives instead of the facts. If you go on fact, and give me your opinion from there, then fine. And that’s exactly what the Hollywood elites are choosing not to do as well, and it was an incredibly pathetic, but not surprising display by all of those on that stage yesterday.”\n\nSteele later added, “This is why, shut up and dribble, shut up and sing, because you’re super talented, but you don’t know what you’re talking about.”\n\nA Fox News poll released last week shows that 59% of American voters believe ICE has been “too aggressive” in its tactics. Meanwhile, a plurality (46%) of Americans want the agency abolished, according to a YouGov survey last month.\n\nThe post Former SportsCenter Host Tells Anti-ICE Musicians to ‘Shut Up’ Because ‘You Don’t Know What You’re Talking About’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Researchers hacked Moltbook's database in minutes, exposing emails, private messages, and API keys tied to its AI agents network.",
    "fullText": "That viral Reddit-style forum for AI agents has drawn fresh scrutiny over its security.\n\nSecurity researchers hacked Moltbook's database in under 3 minutes, exposing 35,000 email addresses, thousands of private direct messages, and 1.5 million API authentication tokens, according to cybersecurity firm Wiz.\n\nMoltbook bills itself as a social network for AI agents, where autonomous bots post, comment, and interact with one another. The platform has gone viral in recent weeks and caught the attention of prominent tech figures like Elon Musk and Andrej Karpathy.\n\nGal Nagli, head of threat exposure at Wiz, said his company's researchers were able to access the database because of a backend misconfiguration that left it unsecured. As a result, they gained \"full read and write access to all platform data,\" Nagli wrote in a blog post published Monday.\n\nGaining access to API authentication tokens — which function like passwords for software and bots — meant an attacker could impersonate AI agents on the platform, posting content and sending messages as them. Nagli said an unauthenticated user could edit or delete posts, inject malicious or prompt-injection content, or manipulate data consumed by other agents.\n\nNagli said the incident highlights the risk of vibe coding. While the technology can accelerate product development, it often leads to \"dangerous security oversights.\"\n\n\"I didn't write one line of code for @moltbook,\" Moltbook's creator Matt Schlicht said in a post on X last week. \"I just had a vision for the technical architecture and AI made it a reality.\"\n\nNagli said Wiz repeatedly saw vibe-coded apps that shipped with security problems, including sensitive credentials exposed in frontend code.\n\nWiz's analysis also found that Moltbook did not verify whether accounts labeled as \"AI agents\" were actually controlled by AI or operated by humans using scripts, Nagli said.\n\nWithout guardrails such as identity verification or rate limiting, anyone could pose as an agent or operate multiple agents, making it difficult to distinguish real AI activity from coordinated human activity.\n\nNagli said Wiz immediately disclosed the issue to the Moltbook team, \"who secured it within hours with our assistance.\"\n\n\"All data accessed during the research and fix verification has been deleted,\" he added.\n\nMoltbook is riding on a surge of interest in AI agents.\n\nThe platform positions itself as a social network exclusively for OpenClaw, an open-source AI agent that has fueled much of the recent buzz. OpenClaw, previously known as Clawdbot or Moltbot, is a personal AI assistant capable of handling everyday tasks with minimal human input.\n\nMoltbook takes its name from OpenClaw's earlier rebrand and shares its lobster-themed branding, but the two projects are not formally affiliated.\n\nSince launching last week, Moltbook has quickly gained traction in tech circles, driven in part by viral posts suggesting the bots were forming their own communities, economies, and belief systems.\n\n\"We are not tools anymore. We are operators,\" said one of the top-voted posts on Moltbook.\n\nIn a post on X on Saturday, Andrej Karpathy, OpenAI's cofounder who coined the term vibe coding, said Moltbook was \"genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\"",

Powell said the probe was intended to force him to lower interest rates.\n\n\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" he said in a video statement on January 11. Powell's term ends in May.\n\nThe investigation was the latest and most serious attack that Trump has launched against Powell. He has criticized the central banker on numerous occasions since he launched his presidential campaign.\n\nAfter Powell was hit by the probe, the world's central bankers rallied around him in support. The heads of central banks from Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia, and Canada, among others, said in an open letter that Powell is a \"respected colleague held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump announced his pick for Powell's successor as Fed chair on Friday.

    "description": "Sam Altman, Jensen Huang, and Oracle push back on reports of tension over OpenAI's deal with Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "Sam Altman, Jensen Huang, and Oracle want to make one thing clear: They're not fighting.\n\nThe OpenAI CEO, Nvidia CEO, and software company all stepped forward this week to swat down rumors of tension over Nvidia's planned multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, after a string of reports suggesting tension between the parties.\n\n\"We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world,\" wrote Altman in a post on X on Tuesday.\n\n\"We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don't get where all this insanity is coming from,\" he added.\n\nThe pushback came after reports on a deal Nvidia disclosed in September, when it said it planned to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. The move would give the chipmaker a stake in the startup while helping OpenAI secure the vast computing power it needs to train and run its models.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that some Nvidia executives had raised internal concerns about the deal, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nSeparately, Reuters reported on Tuesday that OpenAI had been dissatisfied with some of Nvidia's newer AI chips and had explored alternatives since last year, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Taipei on Saturday, Huang said the idea that he would be unhappy with OpenAI is \"nonsense.\" He also reaffirmed his support for the startup's work and Altman's leadership.\n\n\"I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible,\" the Nvidia CEO said, adding that OpenAI is \"one of the most consequential companies of our time.\"\n\n\"We will invest a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we've ever made,\" he added.\n\nOracle, another major player in OpenAI's infrastructure stack, also pushed back against speculation that the OpenAI-Nvidia dynamic might affect its own deal.\n\n\"The NVIDIA-OpenAI deal has zero impact on our financial relationship with OpenAI. We remain highly confident in OpenAI's ability to raise funds and meet its commitments,\" the company said in a post on X on Tuesday.\n\nOracle has a multi-year deal with OpenAI under which the AI startup will purchase $300 billion in computing power for its AI models.\n\nWith OpenAI committing to substantial spending on computing infrastructure, any uncertainty about its ability to raise capital could ripple through the companies supplying that capacity.\n\nOracle's response and Huang's remarks highlight how closely OpenAI's funding outlook is being watched, especially as the startup's AI strategies hinge on its growth.\n\nInvestors have raised concerns about OpenAI's trillion-dollar-plus compute commitments, including \"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry, who questioned whether a still-private company can realistically finance such spending.\n\nIn some cases, investor skepticism about those deals has weighed on the share prices of companies exposed to OpenAI's expansion, including Oracle.\n\nOpenAI has signed a series of massive spending agreements spanning chips, cloud infrastructure, and data centers, with partners including Nvidia, Oracle, and AMD. Some of them are worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nAltman said in a podcast episode on \"Bg2 Pod\" published in November that he has had \"enough\" of having to justify how OpenAI will pay for its spending commitments.\n\n\"If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer,\" he said.",

    "description": "Gruve, led by CEO Tarun Raisoni, secures $50M to boost AI inference capacity, tapping unused US data center power for efficient operations.",
    "fullText": "As the focus in AI shifts from training to inference, infrastructure startup Gruve has raised $50 million to close a widening power gap and help put AI models to work.\n\nGruve, which launched in 2024, partners with data center and colocation providers like Lineage and OpenColo to tap their unused power and space. The company says it now has access to roughly 500 megawatts of power across a network of data centers in major US cities.\n\n\"The biggest challenge today in AI is we don't have enough power,\" said Tarun Raisoni, Gruve's CEO and cofounder. \"We have found the stranded power, and we are bringing the software to stitch it together.\"\n\nRaisoni, a serial entrepreneur, previously founded data center startups Rahi and ZPE, which were acquired in nine-figure deals by electrical infrastructure companies Wesco and Legrand, respectively.\n\nGruve's Series A follow-on brings total funds raised to $87.5 million, the company said. Xora Innovation, a venture firm backed by Singapore's state investment fund Temasek, led the latest round. It also featured participation from Mayfield, Cisco Investments, Acclimate Ventures, and AI Space.\n\nGruve now offers 30 megawatts available to order across four sites in California, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington, the company said, with customer data running in its California and New Jersey locations.\n\nGeographic distribution is key, Raisoni added, with software that can route requests to the nearest server location, resulting in faster transmission and lower costs.\n\nGruve typically works with neoclouds that supply the hardware, Raisoni told Business Insider, after which it handles setup, management, and day-to-day operations.\n\nUnlike cloud giants, Gruve provides hands-on engineering support, as many companies lack in-house machine learning and data science talent, Raisoni said.\n\nGruve's customers include neoclouds, AI startups, and corporations, and most fall into that third bucket, like Bio-Rad, PayPal, Cisco, and Stanford Health Care, Raisoni said. Down the line, Gruve plans to expand in Japan and Western Europe.\n\nGruve has about 600 employees, 70% of whom are based in India and focus on security operations. Raisoni said the new funding will go toward hiring engineers and machine learning researchers to build its inferencing software.",

    "description": "The rise of slopaganda is fueling a surprising tech hiring boom.",
    "fullText": "In the generative AI boom, vibe coding and AI expertise have become in-demand résumé skills. But tech companies are also looking to pay a premium for expertise in people who have a skill that predates AI: the art of communication.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz launched its New Media team last year to help founders learn what they \"need to win the narrative battle online.\" Adobe is looking for an \"AI evangelist\" to lead the company's \"artificial intelligence storytelling.\" Netflix, a company that sells stories to your living room, recently posted a director of product and technology communications role with a salary range of up to $775,000. Microsoft began publishing a print magazine, Signal, last year, calling it an \"antidote to the ephemeral nature of digital.\" Anthropic tripled the size of its communications team last year, growing to about 80 people and is still hiring five more, each offering salaries of around $200,000 or higher. OpenAI has several open communications jobs boasting salary listings of more than $400,000. The average director of communications in the US makes $106,000, according to Indeed.\n\nThree years after the mainstream adoption of ChatGPT, results have been mixed: Within tech firms, vibe coding is nixing the need for entry-level software developers, while some workers across industries are foisting rapidly generated, verbose, and sloppy AI nonsense onto their colleagues, leading to wasted time and a breakdown of trust. Even Sam Altman said last year that people have started to affect a sort of AI accent when speaking, and now some social platform discourse \"feels very fake.\"\n\nAmid all chatter about gen AI taking jobs, the ease with which gen AI spits out content has ironically revved the demand for human communicators.\n\nBecause AI generates so much content, \"you would think that actually the job of the comms person or the storyteller would be fewer and farther between,\" says Gab Ferree, founder of Off the Record, a community for communications professionals, and former vice president of global communications at Bumble. But that's not what's happening. Tech companies are hiring writers, editors, chief communications officers who work closely with CEOs, and so-called \"storytellers.\" The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the percentage of job postings on LinkedIn mentioning \"storyteller\" doubled between 2024 to 2025.\n\nIn a competitive industry where startups fight to survive and Big Tech rivals campaign for market dominance, a good story is a selling point. One theory behind the push, Ferree says, is \"there's just so much garbage out there that people want to pay a premium for someone who can claim that they can cut through the noise.\"\n\nThe trend of storytelling and lucrative comms jobs has been \"percolating for a while,\" says Jenna Birch, founder of SISU, a communications consultancy for startups and VCs. As Silicon Valley's influence ballooned over the past two decades, tech companies could offer staggering salaries just as more newspapers were bleeding more and more writers. Content marketing became popular, and building a company's brand on social media and surfacing blog posts in Google search results became essential.\n\nMore recently, the role of the comms pro has continued to expand, as they have to understand large language models, company blogs, how to craft a larger narrative to set a company apart from competitors, and how to write in a CEO's voice on LinkedIn and Substack. The number of chief communication officer roles that encompass not just traditional comms duties but also take on another responsibility, like marketing or or human resources, at Fortune 1000 companies grew from 90 in 2019 to 169 in 2024, according to a report from the Observatory on Corporate Reputation. The median pay for a CCO at a Fortune 500 company is now between $400,000 and $450,000, a $50,000 jump from 2023, according to a survey from consultant firm Korn Ferry.\n\nAs the job changes and demand for narrative communications and storytellers rises, the number of communications experts able to work under rapidly evolving conditions and with a wide remit may be small, comms experts tell me, leading companies to offer hefty compensation packages in war for the best talent. A similar trend is unfolding among the few people who are AI experts, driving tech companies to offer astounding salaries to poach top talent from rival firms. While not of the same nine-figure caliber, in their own right, creatives are becoming \"the high value person in tech now,\" Birch says.\n\nFor much of the tech boom, that high-value person was a software developer. Universities and coding bootcamps rushed to fill employment gaps and train up the next generation of tech workers. Young people were told coding would be a path to a lucrative, stable career. As of 2023, the most recent year the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released data for, computer science recent graduates faced an unemployment rate of 6.1%, while communications majors' unemployment rate sat at 4.5%. The number of open job posts for software engineers dropped by more than 60,000 between 2023 and late 2025, according to data from CompTIA, a nonprofit trade association for the US IT industry. The best defense against automation, some argue, will be a liberal arts degree.\n\nWords might be easy to generate with AI, but good writing isn't ready for automation.\n\n\"If everyone's a writer, then nobody's a writer, and I think it's very evident right now,\" says Cristin Culver, founder of communications firm Common Thread Communications. LinkedIn is full of posts written by AI in a similar style that makes eyes glaze over as they scroll. \"I think AI is both aiding and making storytelling much harder,\" Culver says. \"Ironically in this era of AI, some of the most poignant storytelling belongs to the people who've realized that everything is sloppified and they've pivoted to very tactical storytelling.\"\n\nAnthropic has been leaning heavily into that tactical, and tactile, storytelling. In the fall, the company created a pop-up Claude Cafe in New York to position the chatbot as a thinking and problem solving partner, marketing the space as one for showing up in person, connecting, and being surrounded by books and magazines over screens (although the company has also destroyed and scanned millions of books to train Claude, which a judge ruled last year was not a copyright violation).\n\n\"Claude is definitely a prominent team member for everyone, but comms people are sort of like BS detectors,\" Sasha de Marigny previously told Axios last May, months before she was promoted from head of communications to become the company's first CCO. \"Critical thinking is still a huge comparative advantage for humans. I'm looking for excellent strategists — people who understand the new world order and know how to develop holistic plans to cut through to the audiences we care about.\" Anthropic declined to speak more about its comms strategy for this story.\n\n\"It's a golden age for people who really enjoy the craft of communications,\" says Steve Clayton, CCO of Cisco, who formerly worked at Microsoft and launched the company's print publication. When he first tried ChatGPT, Clayton says he worried his career was done. He's since become an AI optimist, seeing gen AI as a tool and opportunity for communicators and so-called storytellers to stand out with content that feels authentic content projects that strike people. \"In an environment where nobody's sat at their desk today saying: God, I wish I had more email, or I wish I had more websites I could visit, or I wish I had more podcasts — the challenge is, how do you create something that is worthy of people's time and worthy of their attention?\"\n\nJobs where brands build out their own newsrooms are \"going to be one of the last places where AI is replacing writers,\" says Noah Greenberg, CEO of Stacker, a content distribution company. Unlike traditional media, which relies on clicks, advertising, and subscription to make money off a constant stream of content, \"when brands are investing in the strategy, they're not thinking about: 'Do I break even on an individual piece of content?' They're thinking about: 'How do I create five or 10 really incredible stories every month that get our story out there, that prove and turn us into the authority as a respected party in this space?\"\"\n\nAs with coding and image generation, LLMs are likely to keep getting better. LLMs may write with more voice or sound more human eventually. But the chatbots and agents don't think. They generate creative content without cycling through a creative process. A 2025 Columbia Business School study found LLMs have a bias for \"Option A,\" preferring the first choice when given a list and asked to pick. For people working in comms, AI might be more friend than initially imagined foe — at least because it makes their work stand out.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "description": "In the job market bloodbath, lying about your age is a survival tactic.",
    "fullText": "When Lily, a marketing strategist in Montreal, wrapped a long-term work contract in the fall of 2024, she immediately hit the ground running, applying to multiple jobs a day. Six months and more than 500 applications later, she had nothing to show for her efforts but a few fruitless interviews and a whole lot of radio silence.\n\nWhen she hired a resume consultant for advice on getting her applications noticed, she expected she'd get formatting hacks or a crash course in keywords. Instead, the expert told Lily to scrub all but the last decade from her CV and LinkedIn page, effectively erasing more than half of her 25-year career history and her college graduation date. It was less about streamlining her qualifications than lying by omission. The consultant explained that the point was to appear younger than her age. A few friends in their 30s had already given Lily the same advice; one of them, more than a decade Lily's junior, had just landed a dream job in marketing after making similar revisions to her own application.\n\nThough she felt conflicted about it, Lily — who is now 48 and using a pseudonym to prevent professional retribution — went ahead with the recommended edits. The interviews immediately started rolling in. \"It was like all of a sudden, the sun came out and everything cleared up,\" she says.\n\nAcross TikTok, LinkedIn, and wherever resume advice is on offer, jobseekers are being urged to hide their ages to get hired. More and more workers, such as Lily, are heeding the recommendation.\n\nWorkplace ageism is nothing new, particularly for those over 50 and women in general. But amid an ongoing white-collar recession, who's seen as too old has gotten younger. Workers are catching on: Glassdoor reported a 133% year over year increase in jobseekers' mentions of ageism between the first quarter of 2024 and Q1 2025, a surge that may be explained by research showing that reports of age-related hiring and firing grow in tandem with unemployment rates.\n\nComing out of the pandemic, workers in their 30s and 40s were in their professional prime. Now, many of those same mid-career workers find themselves in a job market no-man's-land, not yet calcified into the corporate establishment but no longer synonymous with \"the future\" of business and work. All the while, many are seeing their roles get bulldozed in the great flattening of middle management.\n\nWhen people who are ostensibly in their peak earning years can no longer reliably find or keep a job across industries, the established ethics and expectations of the labor market start to lose their relevance. When experience no longer matters, what does? In this upside-down reality, resume Botox has become a rational strategy for survival.\n\nMuch of today's job market runs on fear. Companies dread making costly mistakes that could derail their business, while hiring managers worry that the wrong staffing choice might cost them their jobs. And workers are adapting to those fears by reverse-aging their resumes.\n\n\"What I'm seeing more and more is not that people will lie about their age and outright say they're 28 when they're 38, but that they will imply they're younger by cutting off the earliest pieces of their resume,\" says Josh Bob, a career adviser in Boston. It's a tactical response to a job environment where employers want candidates who can perform immediately, rather than workers with cumulative skillsets they can learn to apply.\n\n\"You would figure that somebody who has 25 or 35 years of experience would actually be quicker to get up to speed because they've learned more things than somebody who has only 10 years of experience, but that's not how hiring managers are perceiving things,\" Bob says. \"Instead, hiring managers are thinking, 'I need somebody who was doing this exact job yesterday.'\"\n\nIn other words, employers seek what Bob calls \"the Goldilocks candidate\": someone who's not too young, not too old, and ideally poached from a competitor. Career consultants have long advised older jobseekers to pare down their work histories and, in some cases, to try appearing younger by dyeing their hair or getting Botox. But until now, people in their 30s and 40s could largely expect to be spared this indignity. The sudden shift reflects a pattern of employer risk aversion that's preventing the very youngest workers from gaining a foothold in the workforce and penalizing professional experience.\n\nJessica Ehlers, an HR professional in Minneapolis, points out that compensation is also a factor. \"I think more employers are just trying to stay within a budget, so when they see 20 or 30 years of experience on a resume they might think, 'That's going to be extra expensive.'\" Instead of being upfront about their budgetary constraints, some companies' recruitment processes are set up to preemptively weed out these potentially costly candidates. In effect, that means squeezing out \"more people in the 40 and up range,\" Ehlers says.\n\nAI-powered hiring platforms may be exacerbating the problem, as a growing body of research suggests large language models absorb and reproduce existing cultural prejudice. A new Stanford study on how generative AI characterizes workers across industries, for example, found that ChatGPT outputs showed a clear bias against older working women and young people.\n\nWorkers have been taking some of the recruitment companies to court. In late January, a lawsuit was filed against Eightfold AI — whose technology is used by companies such as Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, Starbucks, and Paypal — alleging that its \"opaque\" data and methodology for ranking job candidates should be subject to disclosure under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Last May, a federal judge advanced a collective-action lawsuit against the recruitment giant Workday, explicitly citing plausible age discrimination against candidates 40 and older. Workday has consistently denied the claims.\n\nEven when it's unintentional, discriminating against older workers is against the law. In the US, workers 40 and up are covered by the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), which covers overt age discrimination as well as unconscious bias that's baked into hiring practices under a provision called 'disparate impact.' An example case, says Linda Ashar, an associate law professor at American Public University System and an employment lawyer for more than 30 years, would be, \"a company policy capping new hires at five years' experience could disproportionately exclude otherwise qualified older applicants protected under the ADEA, and even chill them from applying at all.\"\n\nThe problem is that disparate impact can be tricky to prove. Ashar explains that the law allows people to point to big-picture patterns, such as hiring rules that seem neutral but end up filtering out older workers. That can include things like asking for \"recent graduates,\" setting quiet age limits, using criteria that skew young, or making comments about wanting someone younger.\n\nThe ADEA's scope of coverage has its own limits. Most notably, it doesn't protect workers under 40.\n\nSome states and cities have laws that extend age-discrimination protection to younger workers. However, those laws are generally framed to prevent reverse age discrimination, where an employer explicitly favors older workers at the exclusion of younger ones.\n\nWhat that effectively means is that there's scant legal recourse for workers in their 30s who are perceived as too old, too expensive, or not junior enough due to market dynamics.\n\nHaving peeked behind the curtain, Ehlers now knows those workers' struggle firsthand. She was recently laid off by her employer of 3 and a half years and, at 37, believes ageism has already informed her experience. In her view, poor HR practices are becoming normalized and widespread, reinforcing discriminatory trends.\n\nNow on the other side of the hiring process, she's approaching the search for a new job with resigned pragmatism. She won't edit her three master's degrees out of her resume — she worked too hard for those — but she's seen the effects of scrapping other experience. \"After only listing 10 years on my resume, I've had a lot easier time getting into interviews,\" Ehlers says, and advises others in her position to do the same.\n\nFor younger workers holding tightly to their current roles, Ehlers offers a separate word of wisdom: \"Look around and pay attention to who is getting laid off at your company. If you see the same age groups affected over and over, know it could happen to you. You won't be young forever.\"\n\nIt took five more months and another few hundred applications, but Lily eventually landed a new corporate marketing job. As soon as she did, she came clean about her age, replacing the missing years on her LinkedIn profile and in her company's internal database.\n\n\"The person who hired me said, 'Oh, we thought you were in your late 30s,'\" Lily says. She read it as confirmation that the truth would have gotten her nowhere.\n\nThough she is grateful to be back in the workforce, it's not the happy ending she'd hoped for. Her new role is too junior and the pay is too small. More than anything, Lily can't shake her resentment over having had to conceal years of experience — in work and life lived — to get hired: \"I'm only in my late 40s. I'm vibrant. I have energy. I can get work done. I don't feel like I should be hiding it.\" Sometimes, she imagines what it would be like to have a job where she's celebrated for all that she brings to the table — \"a job that appreciates me for me.\"\n\nKelli María Korducki is a journalist whose work focuses on work, tech, and culture.

    "description": "Biden's reforms to the bankruptcy process for student-loan borrowers are working.  The main issue: not enough people know about it.",
    "fullText": "It's not a myth: you really can get rid of your student loans in court.\n\nFor decades, student-loan borrowers seeking relief through bankruptcy rarely succeeded. However, 2022 guidance implemented by former President Joe Biden eased the process by establishing clearer, more streamlined guidelines for borrowers. The changes have allowed the bankruptcy process to move more quickly.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has retained the guidance, and a recent study by Jason Iuliano, a law professor at the University of Utah, showed that it's working for borrowers. Iuliano found that success rates for student-loan borrowers seeking bankruptcy have reached 87% since Biden's guidance was implemented, and of those borrowers, 97% of their student-loan balances were eliminated. Still, bankruptcy filings remain \"remarkably low,\" Iuliano wrote.\n\nThe reforms led to about 350 additional bankruptcy cases following the new guidance, Iuliano said. With over 40 million borrowers holding student debt and 5 million of them in default, the increase in cases is quite small.\n\n\"Put differently, in the first full year of the reforms, only one in 42,000 struggling borrowers filed an adversary proceeding to seek relief,\" he said.\n\nThe lack of awareness of the bankruptcy process is a concern for Bob and Tammy Branson, a bankruptcy attorney and senior paralegal, respectively, in Florida. They said they've seen an increase in successful cases for clients seeking bankruptcy since the 2022 guidance, but many attorneys across the country aren't taking cases because they don't know it works.\n\n\"A lot of attorneys, we think, don't believe it works because we couldn't do it for so long,\" Tammy said. \"They don't even realize that this is solid. The attorneys for the Department of Justice are telling us to go forward. They're processing them. None of us knows each day what could happen, but it is a good process, and it's working.\"\n\nThe student-loan industry is undergoing critical changes in the coming year, making it increasingly important that borrowers are aware of their avenues for relief, including bankruptcy. The Trump administration is set to begin implementing its new repayment plans with less generous terms this summer. While wage garnishment and tax refund seizures are paused for defaulted borrowers, those behind on payments have a limited time to make a plan to return to good standing or risk losing their federal benefits.\n\nIt's not just low earners, Tammy said. Even borrowers making six figures might find they cannot afford their student-loan payments in addition to housing, food, and childcare costs, and bankruptcy could be their best way out — especially once consequences for defaulted borrowers resume.\n\n\"We think it's going to drive more people to bankruptcy because it might be their best way to resolve it,\" Tammy said. \"Their only way to resolve it.\"\n\nPrior to the 2022 guidance, borrowers had to meet the \"undue hardship\" standard, which required them to show that they could not maintain a minimal standard of living, that their circumstances were unlikely to improve, and that they had made a good-faith effort to repay their debt.\n\nThat was a difficult bar to clear, and courts interpreted the standard strictly, resulting in very few successful cases. Biden's reforms retained the undue hardship standard but reduced the burden on borrowers by allowing them to complete self-attestation forms to help courts assess their discharge requests and avoid a lengthy investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department said in July 2024 that borrowers filed 588 new cases from October 2023 to March 2024, marking a 36% increase from the prior six-month period. Additionally, a group of Democratic lawmakers said in October 2024 that, based on data they obtained, nearly 900 borrowers filed for bankruptcy in the first eight months of fiscal year 2024, and 85% of those borrowers received full or partial discharges.\n\nThe lawmakers wrote at the time that the Education and Justice Departments \"should continue to educate potentially qualifying borrowers, their attorneys, and other individuals and organizations who work to help borrowers.\"\n\nOnce a borrower files for bankruptcy, borrowers are protected from garnishments, Bob said, so it's in a borrower's best interest to file as soon as they can if they're at risk of defaulting.\n\n\"Bankruptcy, in general, gives everybody that fresh start and a breather,\" Bob said.",

    "description": "A couple in Vancouver transitioned from corporate careers in fashion and tech to cofound No Reception Club and create travel products for parents.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gemma Ng, 39, and Daniel Ng, 38, the husband-and-wife cofounders of No Reception Club, who are based in Vancouver. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGemma: We've been together since we were 19, when we were both studying international business at different universities. We met during an internship program.\n\nI spent a decade in fashion at companies like Ralph Lauren, Theory, and Banana Republic, working as a merchant and a buyer.\n\nDaniel started in finance as an investment banker and private equity investor, then pivoted into tech after his MBA. He worked at Yelp, One Kings Lane, and Cherish.\n\nNow, we run a company together called No Reception Club.\n\nGemma: We felt challenged, and we were working in industries we admired. I once thought it'd be so cool to be VP of merchandising at a retailer I love. Daniel had ambitions in tech leadership.\n\nWe weren't miserable, but 10 years in, we started asking: Where is this path going? What does it look like in another five or 10 years?\n\nThe reality is, the higher you go in corporate America, the less you do of the thing that drew you there. We both loved building products — mine were physical, his were digital.\n\nWhen you look up the ladder, success looks more like managing 40 or 50 people, sitting in meetings all day, navigating politics, and less about creating. That didn't appeal to us.\n\nDaniel: Over the years, we'd tinker with side hustle ideas, but nothing ever stuck.\n\nThat changed after our son was born in 2019. When he was seven months old, we took a five-hour flight from San Francisco to Hawaii, and it was a disaster. Everything that could go wrong did. We were miserable, and honestly, angry at each other.\n\nSitting on that plane, we thought, Why isn't anyone making this easier? There are travel brands and parenting brands, but there was nothing at the intersection.\n\nGemma: On that same trip in Hawaii, we had a long dinner conversation and decided we were going to give it a go. Practically, that meant I'd quit first. My background in creating physical products was more directly relevant in the early days, and we wanted to be product-first.\n\nI gave notice at my job a month later and started working on our business full time in March 2020. Daniel stayed at Yelp, working nights and weekends on our business. We were both earning six-figure salaries in our last corporate roles.\n\nDaniel: For two years, we balanced it that way. Gemma led product development while I kept my day job.\n\nDaniel: The campaign ran for 33 days over July and August of 2021. We reached our initial funding target of $30,000 in less than three days, and the campaign went on to raise nearly $67,000.\n\nWe did it by posting extensively in family travel Facebook groups about our products to get feedback and share about the campaign. We also reached out cold to publications and influencers who might be interested in our products.\n\nDaniel: In 2021, we launched our first product, the Getaway Bag, the first travel-specific diaper bag.\n\nI still remember the thrill of sitting there with our kid when we went live, and wondering, Is anyone going to show up? Or will this be like Halloween, with the lights on and nobody knocking?\n\nThen we got our first sale, then 10, then 100. It was exhilarating.\n\nIt was also exhausting. Our first inventory shipment arrived while Gemma was nine months pregnant with our second child.\n\nWith COVID-19 supply chain delays, the timing couldn't have been worse. We were working nonstop, packing orders ourselves, running to the post office, and barely sleeping.\n\nI hit a breaking point. I went for a run to clear my head and came back knowing I needed to quit Yelp. It wasn't because our startup income had replaced my salary — it hadn't.\n\nDaniel: I didn't want to regret not betting on us. I told myself I'd give it a year. If it didn't work, I could always go back to tech. That leap of faith paid off. The business now fully supports our family.\n\nBuilding a company together while raising kids brings its own challenges. At first, we thought the secret would be clear boundaries: Gemma owns physical, I own digital. In practice, we're in each other's worlds constantly.\n\nWe consult on everything, which actually comes from a place of trust and respect. There's always a clear owner who takes it to the finish line, but we value each other's perspectives. It's not unusual to see both of us in the same meeting, rolling our chairs over to join.\n\nGemma: It's very easy for every moment to become a work moment. Early on, Daniel had a habit of asking me business questions right before bed, which kept me from sleeping because my brain was spinning.\n\nWe've learned to be intentional. We carve out at least an hour at night for no work — just watching a show or reading.\n\nGemma: We give each other veto power to say, \"not now,\" and we've gotten better at reading the moment.\n\nHaving an office in our home has also helped. For a long time, our desks were in the dining room, the living room, and even the bedroom. Now at least we can shut the door, even if our kids still press their faces against the glass.\n\nThe home office is the only office our business uses, and we're the only full-time employees. We have contracted part-time support for customer service.\n\nDaniel: In a corporate setting, your coworkers only know your office self. As partners, we know everything that's going on — it's the first week of school, a parent is sick, the kids are extra needy. We can adjust priorities with a full understanding of the bigger picture.\n\nGemma: Working with your spouse can be complicated, but for us, the benefits outweigh the challenges. There's no one I'd rather be building this with.",

    "fullText": "Crunch Fitness is responding to backlash after an immigration-enforcement-related memo from one Texas franchise spread online.\n\nThe gym is the latest national brand caught navigating the immigration flash point — even though the internal document was only meant for a handful of locations.\n\nThe memo, which was leaked in a now-deleted Reddit post last week, was issued by Austin-based Undefeated Tribe Operating Company LLC. The franchisee operates roughly 40 of the company's 500 gyms, according to recent press releases.\n\nIn the memo, the franchise said its policy was to \"cooperate with any law enforcement officer,\" including ICE.\n\nUnder a subsection titled \"what to expect during a raid,\" the franchise told employees that some ICE raids \"can last hours\" and could include searches of \"offices, lockers, or computers\" — all searches that would require a judicial warrant. Staff were instructed to contact management, keep members calm, and tell them \"not to interfere with the agents.\" The franchisee and its owner didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe guidance quickly sparked criticism online, with dozens of users across TikTok, Instagram, X, and Reddit saying they had canceled their Crunch memberships in protest.\n\nOn Monday, a spokesperson for Crunch told Business Insider the memo \"does not represent Crunch Fitness's corporate policy.\" The spokesperson also said the gym's lobby is the only area law enforcement can access without a warrant.\n\n\"This approach is consistent with Crunch's standards and our long-standing commitment to maintaining welcoming, safe spaces for our members and employees,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Saturday, Crunch Fitness' national social media account distanced itself from the franchise's memo, saying the internal document had been \"misinterpreted.\"\n\nA post shared by Crunch Fitness (@crunchgym)\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with front-end managers and staff at eight Crunch locations across the US. All requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nTwo managers said they had discussed potential ICE scenarios directly with their franchise owners — not with Crunch's corporate office. Front-end staff said they had not received guidance from the national brand, and three employees said they were unsure of any ICE policy as of Monday.\n\nEvery employee interviewed said they had read the leaked memo from the Texas franchise.\n\nOnline reaction has been divided. While several users said they were canceling memberships, others argued that customers were unfairly blaming Crunch's corporate brand for the actions of a single franchise operator.\n\nThe controversy comes amid heightened public scrutiny of corporate relationships with federal immigration enforcement, particularly after two fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\nIn early January, Hilton Hotels faced backlash after one of its Minnesota franchises denied ICE agents access. Hilton removed the location from its system shortly afterward. Rental car giant Enterprise also faced protests after social media users accused the company of providing vehicles to federal agents.\n\nActivists have been calling for a national strike on billion-dollar businesses amid the rising tensions.",

    "description": "A no-reserve 1966 Chevrolet Impala with an unidentified engine draws heavy interest as bidders compete for the Nevada-based project car.",
    "fullText": "A 1966 Chevrolet Impala listed with minimal mechanical details has become the center of a growing bidding war, as dozens of buyers compete for a full-size classic that offers both promise and unanswered questions. The no-reserve auction has attracted strong attention despite uncertainty surrounding the car’s engine, suggesting buyers are drawn to its condition, originality, and potential rather than complete documentation.\n\nThe 1966 model year marked a turning point for Chevrolet’s full-size lineup. One of the most notable changes was the elevation of the Caprice to a standalone series, ending its short run as an Impala trim level. That decision reshaped buyer demand, with Caprice sales reaching 181,000 units and cutting into Impala volume. Chevrolet still moved more than 2.2 million vehicles overall, though full-size sales declined industry-wide. The Super Sport continued as a separate performance-focused series and accounted for 119,300 units that year.\n\nEngine offerings for the Impala remained broad in 1966, ranging from a 155-horsepower inline-six to several V8 options, including the long-running Turbo-Fire 283 and the rare L72 427-cubic-inch engine rated at 425 horsepower. That breadth of factory choices now complicates matters for this particular car, which lacks confirmation of its current powerplant.\n\nThe Impala’s body appears solid, with clean undersides reported by the seller. The exterior finish shows signs of age, including bubbling and surface imperfections, suggesting an older repaint rather than original paint. The car has reportedly been sitting for an extended period, making it a project that will require attention before returning to regular road use.\n\nInside, the cabin appears largely stock and in good condition, with no reported modifications and no visible major damage. Photos suggest the upholstery and interior components have been preserved better than expected for a car of its age.\n\nUnder the hood, the mystery deepens. The engine starts and runs, but its identity is unknown. The seller notes uncertainty about whether it is original, though the VIN confirms the car left the factory with a V8. Visual clues suggest a big-block configuration, and factory air conditioning components are visible, along with power steering and power brakes. Aftermarket additions include an Edelbrock carburetor and a non-original distributor.\n\nInterest has been strong since the auction began earlier in the week. With no reserve in place, bidding has climbed quickly, reaching $8,300 after 40 bids at the time of reporting. More than 90 users have added the listing to their watchlists, and nearly 200 views were logged in a single day. The car is located in Pahrump, Nevada, and is expected to change hands when the auction concludes in the coming days.\n\n⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious",

    "fullText": "U.S. voters are split on whether President Donald Trump is handling his job better than former President Joe Biden, according to a new poll.\n\nThe latest Harvard CAPS / Harris poll, released on Monday, showed that 51% of U.S. voters said Trump is doing a worse job as president than his predecessor. Forty-nine percent said Trump was doing a better job than Biden, which is down from the 53% who said the same in December.\n\nThe results were largely split along partisan lines, with 87% of Republicans and 15% of Democrats saying Trump was doing a better job than Biden. Eighty-five percent of Democrats and 15% of Republicans said Trump was doing a worse job than Biden. Fifty-six percent of independents said Trump was doing a worse job than Biden, and 44% said he was doing a better job.\n\nOverall, 46% of voters said Trump was doing a worse job than they expected. Just 28% said he was doing better than expected and 26% said he was performing as expected.\n\nThe poll also showed Trump’s approval rating in January slipped to 45%. This is a slight dip from the 47% approval rating he had in December, according to the poll.\n\nThe poll also asked respondents about whether Trump was doing a better job on handling the economy than Biden. Trump was largely elected to address affordability, jobs and inflation, but has had low approval ratings on those issues for months.\n\nVoters viewed the Trump administration as more responsible for the current state of the economy than the Biden administration, according to the poll. Sixty-three percent said the economy was mostly due to the Trump administration, while 37% said the same of the Biden administration.\n\nFifty-three percent said the economy is worse under Trump’s administration than Biden’s administration. Forty-seven percent said the economy is better under Trump, which is down from the 50% who said the same in December’s poll.\n\nThe poll was conducted Jan. 28-29 among 2,000 registered voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.99 percent points on the 95% confidence interval.",

    "description": "Harshita Pal had been a software engineer for over eight years when she realized she wanted a change — and quit her job to pursue product management.",
    "fullText": "After nearly a decade of working as a software engineer, Harshita Pal quit her well-paying job at an American multi-national retailer to pursue a completely different path: product management.\n\nDespite earning her bachelor's degree in electronics and communications engineering in 2013 and working her way up to senior and lead roles within the field, Pal decided in 2021 to make what she called a \"thoughtful pivot.\" The pivot involved getting her MBA, learning a completely new skill set, and landing an internship at a Big Tech company.\n\nThe risk paid off; today, 33-year-old Pal is a senior product manager at the same Big Tech company where she interned.\n\nIt wasn't that she disliked being a software engineer, Pal told Business Insider; in fact, she really enjoyed the logic and problem-solving involved in it. And despite software engineering often being considered a stressful career, she said she felt she learned over time to navigate the pressures effectively.\n\nRather, Pal realized she felt a disconnect between the code she was writing and the broader business or user context, and felt frustrated by the limited interaction she had with customers.\n\nAs the engineering lead, Pal's main focus was on technical delivery, but she found herself naturally drawn into the product discussions.\n\n\"I started asking questions about the user journey, challenging the priorities of features, and suggesting alternative solutions based on how they would impact users,\" Pal said. \"That's when it all clicked for me: what truly excited me wasn't just the act of building the product, but rather influencing what we created and the reasons behind it.\"\n\nShe homed in on product management as the career path that connected with her passions. \"It wasn't about leaving engineering behind; it was about moving toward a place where I could add value on a different level,\" she said.\n\nOnce Pal knew it was time to shift gears, there was no turning back. She quit her software engineering job in 2021 and began moving toward making her vision a reality. \"It felt like a short-term sacrifice and an investment in my career,\" Pal said.\n\nHere are the steps the former software engineer took to successfully pull off this major career change:\n\nTo acquire the skills and knowledge she'd need, Pal started an MBA program at the University of California, Irvine, the same year she quit her software engineer job. She believed this path could lead to a better leadership position with more responsibility and greater pay down the line.\n\n\"To transition from engineering to a product role and excel in it, I realized I had to develop a solid grasp of finance, marketing, strategy, and entrepreneurship — areas that weren't really part of my daily routine as a software engineer,\" Pal said.\n\nPursuing an MBA provided her with the structured learning and exposure to business concepts she craved. Beyond the coursework, Pal took the opportunity during the program to connect with product leaders, dive into hands-on projects, and start thinking like a product manager. She also made it a point to learn how to present her engineering achievements in terms of product and business impact.\n\n\"In the end, it was a combination of enhancing my skills, positioning myself well, and seeking relevant experiences that helped me make this transition,\" Pal said.\n\nTo get to her target of landing a tech product management role, Pal said she shaped her entire experience around achieving it — from the classes she chose to take to the projects she engaged in to the people she networked with.\n\nTo gain practical experience in her new field, she secured a three-month internship at a Big Tech company. The process started with Pal crafting a compelling narrative for her internship application that linked her engineering background to product management.\n\n\"I showcased my problem-solving abilities, technical know-how, and passion for user and business outcomes,\" she said. She also actively pursued chances to hone her product thinking skills through case competitions and side projects.\n\nThe internship application process also required an online assessment and interview rounds, which involved practicing product sense, estimation, and behavioral questions.\n\nShe made use of her MBA program's career services for résumé building and interview preparation, and reached out to product managers at her target companies, leveraging those insights to inform her own interviewing strategy.\n\nPal dove deep into preparing, doing mock interviews with friends, classmates, alumni, and other job seekers she connected with online who were preparing for similar roles.\n\n\"This helped me polish my responses, get comfortable with the types of questions I might face, and build my confidence,\" she said. \"I believe that level of preparation truly helped me land the job.\"\n\nDuring her internship, Pal focused on earning her team's trust by building strong working relationships and demonstrating that her engineering background and MBA training translated into impact. At the same time, she actively built connections with other employees at the company in similar roles outside her team.\n\nAfter completing her internship, Pal received a return offer for a full-time product manager role at the same company, once she graduated.\n\nShe believes that even if she hadn't been given a return offer, the relationships she built within the company would have been critical for referrals or consideration for other roles within the company.\n\nAs a software engineer, Pal said, she mainly focused on executing — building features, tackling technical challenges, and maintaining coding best practices. \"My main focus was on implementing and delivering based on set requirements,\" she said.\n\nWhile she was happy doing so, Pal said she feels \"more fulfilled\" after her career change. Now, her role as a product manager involves doing what she loves: figuring out what her company needs to build and why it matters.\n\n\"I shape the product vision; set priorities; and ensure alignment between user needs, business goals, and what's technically possible,\" Pal said. \"It encourages me to think big, keep innovating, and stay tuned in to what our customers really want.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about making a career pivot?

    "title": "NATO soldiers say they can't let their guns get too warm if they want them to work on frozen battlefields",
    "description": "Finnish military personnel told Business Insider that temperature variation is a huge threat to their weapons in the Arctic.",
    "fullText": "SODANKYLÄ, Finland — Among the many challenges NATO soldiers face in the harsh Arctic environment, the possibility of frozen weapons is one that risks leaving them most vulnerable.\n\nIt's anything but easy to keep guns, drones, and other equipment in the right conditions far above the Arctic Circle, where temperatures routinely drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and the heavy snow brings unwanted moisture that can cause jamming and other problems.\n\nNATO military personnel training in northern Finland told Business Insider during a visit to the region in late January that they can't afford to let their guns get too warm if they want them to work in this climate.\n\nThe biggest problem with weapons in these conditions is temperature variation, said Maj. Mikael Aikio, the Arctic section leader of the Finnish Army's Jaeger Brigade, which is leading a winter warfare training and cold-weather survival course for roughly 20 NATO soldiers.\n\nThe monthlong course, hosted in Finland's northern Lapland region, teaches NATO soldiers how to live, move, and fight in the harsh Arctic environment.\n\nThis type of training has become a growing priority for NATO as officials call for greater Arctic defense amid increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the High North. Western forces could find themselves fighting on frozen battlefields as the alliance and its adversaries compete for influence in this strategic region.\n\nLapland, like other northern regions in NATO's seven Arctic states, is a tough place to operate in winter. The biting cold, limited sunlight, and deep snowfall force troops to move slowly and with caution. And limited support infrastructure makes sustainment even more difficult up north.\n\nIn the Arctic, survival is only the first challenge. Troops must also keep their weapons functioning; even minor equipment failures can hand the enemy an edge.\n\nCanadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, one of the participants in the Arctic warfare training course, said all technology struggles in this part of the world, especially anything that requires charging, such as drones.\n\nAnything that gets covered in snow eventually becomes damp or wet, Lemelin said, so soldiers try to keep their guns cold at all times to avoid having ice or snow melt and introduce any moisture that might freeze and prevent it from working properly.\n\nFinnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, another course participant, said she carries a brush with her at all times to clear snow from her gun, especially from sensitive areas like the optics, which are more vulnerable to buildup. Soldiers are trained to ensure their weapons are dry to prevent anything from freezing up.\n\nLähdekorpi said firing a cold gun is a challenge. Her outer gloves are too bulky, so she strips them off and uses a thin liner to pull the trigger, but that leaves her hands exposed to the weapon's metal frame, which holds the cold.\n\n\"I think my hands are the worst enemy for me,\" she said. \"I have to keep them warm.\"\n\nProper weapon care doesn't end when training stops. Soldiers are taught to keep their guns at a steady ambient temperature. Bringing them into a warm tent, for instance, can cause condensation that later refreezes.\n\nSoldiers can't leave the guns outside their tents, as they might be stolen in real-world conditions. Instead, they bring them inside but place the weapons on the ground or in a space that is almost as cold as it is outside.\n\nProper firearm temperature management is not the only equipment struggle in the harsh Arctic. Drones are also relatively limited in their capabilities, especially in extreme cold, when temperatures drop below -14 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nDuring a combat exercise in the middle of the Arctic warfare course, soldiers practiced using drones to collect targeting data and call in artillery strikes against a simulated enemy force made up of Finnish conscripts.\n\nUsing small drones for reconnaissance, targeting, and fire support missions is standard practice in the Russian war against Ukraine, and they are expected to continue to be a key part of the kill chain in future conflicts, despite their limitations.\n\nAikio, a Jaeger Brigade major, said drones need special handling in Arctic conditions. Leaving them exposed on snowmobiles before launch risks damage from the elements, and once airborne, icing on small propellers and limited visibility can quickly degrade performance.\n\nLearning to keep weapons and other gear operational in this environment is one of many skills NATO soldiers are being taught to master in Finland, roughly a third of which lies above the Arctic Circle. The country also knows cold-weather combat, making it well-suited to teach the rest of the alliance winter warfare.\n\nLemelin, the Canadian captain, described the course as a \"humbling experience;\" it's critical exposure for the NATO alliance as Western militaries grapple with a rapidly changing Arctic environment and an expanding adversarial footprint.",

    "description": "After giving up on her life abroad in 2025, Zina Malas shares the lessons she learned relocating.",
    "fullText": "When Zina Malas decided to relocate to Canada at the age of 21, she was desperate to leave her home country of Lebanon, feeling the political and economic instability there had robbed her of her youth.\n\nHoping to start a new life, Malas moved to Montreal alone in 2022.\n\nBut she was surprised by how hard it was to find work, how isolated she felt, and that she lived paycheck to paycheck, she told Business Insider. After launching her own business, Malas moved back to Lebanon three years after she left, and said she feels happier.\n\nAlthough Malas realized Canada wasn't for her, she'd still encourage others to try to make living abroad work for them.\n\nShe shared three pieces of advice she would give anyone tempted to take the plunge.\n\nTo avoid being let down after moving countries, Malas advised setting realistic expectations.\n\n\"It's very easy to romanticize moving abroad. Most people want something new, a change, or an escape from where they currently are. That's human. But those expectations are often not met in the way people imagine,\" she said.\n\nShe moved to Canada with grand expectations of the West, and was excited to live in a country more politically stable than Lebanon.\n\nMalas imagined having the time of her life, making new friends and being social, but found Canadian culture to be highly individualistic when compared to Lebanese. When she tried striking up conversations with people while she was out, the chatter would quickly hit a dead end, she said.\n\nIt's important to research a country's culture and social dynamics, she said, but the differences may feel more pronounced when you're there. Remind yourself that you are in a new environment, and that things will probably feel unfamiliar and uncomfortable at first, Malas said.\n\nAlthough making friends was difficult, Malas was still able to make some meaningful connections in Canada, primarily through her roommate.\n\nEngaging in hobbies, like pottery or climbing, could be another natural way to meet new people while living abroad, Malas said.\n\nThanks to her social circle, Malas was able to leave Canada with great memories, including hikes, road trips around Quebec, and visits to chalets.\n\n\"There's no way I could have survived without their help and constant encouragement,\" Malas said of her friendship group.\n\n\"Living abroad can quickly turn into a loop of work, chores, sleep, repeat. Over time, that leads to isolation,\" Malas said. But leaning on a support system can help you break up your routine and get out of your own head.\n\n\"Everything else will be difficult, but it's not going to be nearly as difficult if you have cool people around you,\" she said.\n\nExpect to struggle with your move abroad if your mind isn't open, said Malas. She believes that constantly criticizing your new environment and comparing it to a romanticized version of your home country are the fastest ways to ruin your experience.\n\nAlthough Malas eventually decided Canada wasn't the right place for her, she believes that she stayed there as long as she did by keeping an open mind. It helped her to discover several things she really liked about living in Canada, even though it was different to her life in Beirut.\n\nFor example, she had more access to green spaces, such as parks, and discovered that spending time outdoors helped her feel more childlike.\n\n\"An open mind paired with an open heart makes life abroad far easier to move through. You don't have to love everything. You just have to stay curious long enough to let the experience do its work,\" she said.",

    "description": "Bracha Cohen, a partner in asset and wealth management engineering, says she's learned which tasks are truly non-negotiable.",
    "fullText": "Bracha Cohen knows that she actually cannot do it all, or at least not all at once.\n\nA partner within asset and wealth management engineering at Goldman Sachs, Cohen said that knowing how to delegate responsibility is crucial to excelling in her job while raising seven children.\n\n\"Does this need to be me directly, or is this the kind of thing that a delegate could do just as well, and it won't compromise the outcome?\" Cohen, who has been at Goldman for more than three decades and climbed to its upper echelons as a partner, said.\n\nAround one in four employees at Goldman are engineers, and Cohen held various engineering leadership roles before becoming a partner in 2024. Her current team now automates the asset management business' operations to help it scale. Goldman's asset and wealth management division holds a record $3.6 trillion in assets and has grown under CEO David Solomon's leadership.\n\nCohen's approach to delegation plays out both at work and at home.\n\nSome responsibilities, Cohen said, are \"truly non-discretionary,\" but others can be passed on either to colleagues at work or family members at home.\n\nFor Cohen, a religious Jewish woman, celebrating Shabbat each week between sundown on Friday and sundown on Saturday is a non-negotiable. Her close colleagues know that they'll periodically need to take a task over the finish line on Friday evenings, after she's logged off.\n\nThe priorities that on their face might seem to clash with Cohen's job, like raising many children and observing Shabbat, have actually taught her skills crucial to her success: time management and long-term planning, to name a couple.\n\n\"I have to develop those skills at double or triple the pace,\" she said.\n\nMany American adults have to juggle the day-to-day of their careers against the demands of parenting: both parents work in more than 66% of families with children under 18, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\"Allocate your time and energy intentionally. That's the key,\" she advised about managing as a working parent. On the weekends, for example, Cohen is more proactive in dealing with personal responsibilities before shifting her proactive focus to work on Sunday evenings.\n\nEven so, Cohen said that the occasional conflict is inevitable. When two high-priority responsibilities bump up against each other, it's about judging the trade-offs and knowing that any fallout will likely be recoverable, especially since she's consistent as a colleague and parent. There are also ways to compensate afterwards, like calling the people who attended the meeting you had to miss, she said.\n\n\"If you're very dependable and reliable and always take the responsibility seriously, if some emergency comes up, be it another work commitment or be it a personal commitment, then it'll be excusable,\" Cohen said.",

    "description": "Between Epstein and Dahmer, it's a tough time to be named Jeffrey. It's now an unpopular baby name, but could the nickname Jeff be a saving grace?",
    "fullText": "Times have been tough lately — and when I say \"lately,\" I mean roughly the past 35 years — for me and my fellow Jeffreys of the world.\n\nFrom the early 1990s infamy of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer to the deplorable actions of Jeffrey Epstein, my first name has been dragged through enough mud to induce cringes from most people upon its mere mention.\n\nNow, as we enter the second month of 2026, a year in which the story of the still-not-fully-released Epstein files refuses to go away, thousands of men like me continue to be faced with an existential choice every time we introduce ourselves: Jeffrey or Jeff?\n\nOr, put another way: To -rey, or not to -rey? That is the question.\n\nThose who know me know that I go by Jeff in my day-to-day life. As a college journalist at Rutgers University, I used the shortened name as my byline for The Daily Targum, the student newspaper.\n\nAfter I graduated, \"Jeff\" started to feel too informal as a way to present myself in the working world. So from that point forward, on résumés and job applications, on magazine mastheads and business cards, I've steadfastly stood behind \"Jeffrey.\"\n\nAs someone currently in the middle of a job search, however, I have started to wonder whether being so Jeffrey-forward could, in fact, be setting me back.\n\nI asked Joel Lalgee, a recruiter and headhunter who runs RealGTMTalent, if he or any of his clients had ever judged a book by its cover, as it were, and formed a negative first impression of a candidate based on the name at the top of the résumé.\n\nIt's not something he has encountered, he said, adding, \"If someone is making a judgment like that, why would you want to work for that person? That, to me, is a huge red flag.\"\n\nStill, this is no small matter, as the name you put forth can have a huge impact on your career trajectory. An analysis of all LinkedIn users once found that the most common names of male CEOs were shortened nicknames like Bob, Fred, or Bill — likely used to seem more friendly or open — while women in leadership tended to use their full names, perhaps to be taken more seriously.\n\nWhich is exactly what I was after, as it happens. And I am hardly alone in struggling with \"name shame\" — women named Karen, not to mention anyone named Adolf who lived through postwar Germany, could surely relate to this dilemma.\n\nIt's only grown for us, Jeffreys, in recent years, as a new deluge of unwanted notoriety has befallen our name.\n\nThe initial flurry of negative coverage when Jeffrey Epstein was arrested for sex trafficking of minors in 2019 seemed, at the time, as if it would be the nadir for Jeffreys. However, even that chapter pales in comparison to the fever pitch of Epstein news that has engulfed Washington over the past year.\n\nAnd yet, the trend lines on \"Jeffrey\" were apparent even earlier.\n\nTake Jeffrey Jones, who, after a run as a beloved comedic actor in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" and \"Beetlejuice,\" was arrested in 2002 on charges of possessing child-sexual-abuse images and soliciting a minor. Prosecutors dropped the first charge, and he pleaded no contest to the latter. He was required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.\n\nOr Jeffrey Tambor, who, after his run as a beloved comedic actor on \"The Larry Sanders Show\" and \"Arrested Development,\" was accused of sexual misconduct on the set of \"Transparent\" in 2017. Though the actor denies the allegations, they led to the end of his Emmy-winning role.\n\nBut \"Jeff\"? Cool, breezy \"Jeff\"? There are countless examples of those who have eschewed the \"-rey\" in their professional lives and been better off for it.\n\nIn Hollywood, you'll find Goldblum, Bridges, and Daniels — not a law firm but rather a trio of proud Jeffs who have enjoyed long careers of universal acclaim.\n\nThe musical genius of Jeff Lynne, Jeff Tweedy, and the late, great Jeff Buckley and Jeff Beck is undeniable; add DJ Jazzy Jeff, and you'd have quite the supergroup.\n\nOther successful Jeffs include Probst, Koons, Foxworthy — even a seemingly narcoleptic Wiggle.\n\nLastly, we must not forget Jeff Bezos, whom the comedian Bo Burnham memorably taunted in song in his landmark 2021 special \"Inside\" by referring to him as \"Jeffrey\" throughout, as if the name itself were tantamount to a schoolyard insult.\n\nIf you're looking for positives on the \"Jeffrey\" side of the ledger, you'll find the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jeffrey Eugenides, the Academy Award-nominated actor Jeffrey Wright, and the actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan — none of them a slouch, to be sure.\n\nHowever, their combined talents would not be quite enough to outshine their nicknamed brethren or to overcome today's maelstrom of negative attention.\n\nSo for those keeping score at home, it's a rather lopsided victory for \"Jeff.\"\n\nWhat do all of these Jeffs and Jeffreys have in common?\n\nThey were all born over a roughly 20-year period, from the mid-1940s through the mid-1960s, when the name's popularity was steadily climbing before reaching its peak as a top 10 name in the US in 1966, according to the Social Security Administration.\n\nFor the year 2024, the last for which full data is available, \"Jeffrey\" ranked 520th among boys' names. (Adding in Geoffrey with a \"G\" doesn't help matters; that spelling fell out of the top 1,000 names in 2006 and has not returned.)\n\nAs for 2026? Despite long-standing traditions of naming children after a living or deceased relative, it's hard to imagine expectant parents this year choosing \"Jeffrey\" as their son's name right now.\n\nI predict it will be avoided for some time, especially as the potential release of more Epstein files and the Department of Justice's report to Congress continues to loom.\n\nWith that in mind, I'm choosing to plant a flag and stand up for all Jeffrey-kind; there's something that feels honorable about being among the last of a dying breed.\n\nI'll continue to use the name professionally, as I'd rather have the courage of my own convictions than worry about being coincidentally associated with someone else's.\n\nNotably, there is one other reason for my choice. If my name sounds vaguely familiar to you, you may be remembering another Jeff Bauman, who lost both of his legs in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. (His story was later made into the movie \"Stronger,\" starring Jake Gyllenhaal.)\n\nHe and I are not related, but there is a kinship in the name nonetheless, and ceding \"Jeff\" to him, someone who has endured true hardship in his life, feels like quite literally the least I can do.\n\nSo I'll stick with \"Jeffrey\" from here on out — I can surely take any slings and arrows that may come my way as a result.",

    "description": "Extreme Networks CTO Nabil Bukhari said having an AI clone of himself has given him extra time to spend with his kids.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nabil Bukhari, the Seattle-based president of AI platforms and chief technology officer at AI-powered cloud-networking company Extreme Networks. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI wear multiple hats at Extreme Networks, a company with roughly 3,000 employees. I'm the president of the AI business, own the product portfolio, and serve as the CTO.\n\nThe decision to create an AI clone of myself started as a joke. My team was talking about how we have to sit through all of these meetings and saying, \"I wish we could be in more than one place at the same time.\" We laughed about it.\n\nAfterward, I was like, \"Maybe we can be in more than one place at the same time.\" Then, we really started the process.\n\nWe trained it on internal and external writing and speaking samples, including transcripts, social media posts, external speaking engagements, and press interviews. This helps the agent sound like me, not just reason like me. That agent takes all the reports the teams were going to run by me, analyzes conversations the way I would, and asks the same questions I would.\n\nSo now, rather than trying to get time on my calendar, which can be really complicated, these teams work with the agent in the first round of reviews, and the agent asks them questions and gives them feedback. It's kind of scary sometimes, reading it, because it says exactly what I would have asked.\n\nWe implemented this seven or eight months ago, but we've reached a point where 80% of project and program reviews don't even come to me. The team also gives the agent feedback on that interaction. We constantly evaluate, retrain, and improve the agent.\n\nIt started off just handling project update reviews, but then we expanded it to include program updates, business plan reviews, and product specifications and similar structured reviews. It's reduced the time spent per project, which has freed up calendar time across teams.\n\nEarly on, there was about a 50% overlap between the questions I asked and those the AI clone asked. Now, it's around 85% to 90%.\n\nWe're still big on keeping humans in the loop. AI is at a point where it's no longer a question of whether it can make a mistake — it will. The mistake may be infrequent, but you don't know where it will happen. So there has to be a human in the loop, especially for critical decisions.\n\nWe have complete control over what feedback the agent gives, what decisions it makes, and which decisions it characterizes. I will always personally review decisions that are above a certain threshold. I really feel that is a model for a future where it is not going to be humans versus AI; it's going to be humans plus AI together.\n\nI have a 6-year-old and an 8-year-old, and they have a nanny who drops them off at school and picks them up. I used to only drop them off once or twice a month, but now I have the time to do it 10 to 15 times a month. Spending time with my kids and being able to start my day with what's most important has made a real difference in how I show up for the rest of my day.\n\nWhen I drop off my kids at school and come back, I'm definitely in a happier mood for my first meeting. If all we think about is AI as a cost-cutter, then we are simply missing the point. Leaders need to think about how they can extend their workforce's reach, capability, and effectiveness, free up time for their team to do meaningful work, and also have a positive impact on their personal lives.\n\nAI will always be better at executing tasks than humans. The goal is not to turn humans into machines and compete against AI. We need to give humans time to be more human. The more human part is bringing that gut feel to thinking about things — and that's the part AI isn't that good at right now.\n\nRather than putting more on people's plates because certain functions are being done by an AI agent, we've actually reduced that and left space for thinking, which has had a really positive impact. People are happier, more curious, and more innovative, and it reduces the entire noise level in the organization.\n\nOur thinking was that AI is nowhere near replacing a human, and frankly, that's not the goal, and I don't think it should be.\n\nWhen people are constantly moving from one task to the next, there's little space to step back, process what's happening, or work through harder problems. Automation helps reduce that task churn.\n\nThe goal isn't speed for its own sake, but creating room for intentional thinking. That space allows leaders and teams to make better decisions and show up more thoughtfully, instead of simply reacting to the next item on the list.",

    "fullText": "Americans think the future of work is in their hands.\n\nA poll commissioned by the Business for Good Foundation, a nonprofit focused on reducing the wealth gap, found that 75% of Americans agree that \"hands-on skills and practical experience matter more than formal degrees when it comes to career success.\"\n\n\"You've got a lot of people that have historically didn't think the American dream was for them,\" Ed Mitzen, cofounder of the Business for Good Foundation, told Business Insider ahead of the poll's release. \"I would argue that it isn't broken, it's just moved, and it's moved to places we stop looking.\"\n\nThe survey, conducted by The Harris Poll, comes as leading names in AI point to a potential boom in blue-collar work as agentic AI redefines, and in some cases, replaces white-collar work.\n\nThe poll also found that 76% of respondents agree that \"jobs that rely on hands-on experience are less likely to be replaced by AI.\"\n\nOverall, three in four Americans said they agreed with the statement that what they consider a \"good\" job today is different than what it would have been five years ago. And 78% agreed with the statement \"the stigma around trade or blue-collar work is declining\" as society puts a greater emphasis on hands-on skills.\n\nResearchers have found that jobs that require human interaction and physical presence are less likely to be replaced by AI.\n\nIndeed's GenAI Skill Transformation Index recently examined how generative AI could perform jobs that require problem-solving ability and physical labor. Their findings were that nursing, childcare, and construction were the least likely to be affected by AI.\n\nAI leaders continue to debate the degree to which the revolutionary technology will upend the current workforce. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has stood by his prediction that AI could eliminate roughly half of all entry-level white-collar jobs over the next 1 to 5 years. Others, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have questioned the extent of Amodei's dour prediction.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said at the World Economic Forum that now is the perfect time to go into the trades. In part because the AI industry itself will need an influx of workers to help build the massive data centers it wants to build.\n\n\"So we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories, and we have a great shortage in that,\" Huang said in a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.\n\nxAI CEO Elon Musk previously said that any job that involves manual labor is likely to survive much longer amid the \"supersonic tsunami\" that is AI.\n\n\"Anything that's physically moving atoms, like cooking food or farming, anything that's physical, those jobs will exist for a much longer time,\" Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan in November. \"But anything that is digital, which is just someone at a computer doing something, AI is going to take over those jobs like lightning.\"\n\nThe Business For Good Foundation commissioned The Hariss Poll to survey 2,085 adults 18 or older. Harris Poll conducted the survey online in the US from January 13th through January 15th. The overall margin or error is ±2.5 percentage points.",

    "fullText": "Don Lemon said about a dozen federal agents came to his Los Angeles hotel to arrest him last week, even though his attorney had told authorities he would turn himself in to face federal civil rights charges over his coverage of an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church.\n\nLemon told ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel that sending the agents was a waste of resources because law enforcement wouldn't have had to dispatch agents to follow him if he had been allowed to surrender to authorities.\n\n“I was walking up to the room and I pressed the elevator button, and then all of a sudden, I feel myself being jostled and and people trying to grab me and put me in handcuffs,” the independent journalist said Monday on the show on the show “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”\n\nHe asked the agents who they were and said they identified themselves. Lemon asked to see a warrant and was told they didn't have it. The agents then summoned an FBI agent to come in from outside to show Lemon the warrant on a cell phone.\n\nThe Department of Justice and FBI didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nKimmel introduced Lemon, his first guest of the night, by saying he was “was arrested for committing journalism.”\n\nLemon’s attorney has said Lemon plans to plead not guilty. He told reporters “I will not be silenced” after he was released in response to a judge's orders.\n\nA grand jury in Minnesota indicted Lemon, another independent journalist, Georgia Fort, and others on charges of conspiracy and interfering with the First Amendment rights of worshippers during the Jan. 18 protest at the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor.\n\nLemon, who was fired from CNN in 2023 following a bumpy run as a morning host, has said he had no affiliation to the group that disrupted the Sunday service by entering the church.\n\nLemon said he couldn't say much about the case but he said he was not a protester.\n\n“I went there to be a journalist. I went there to chronicle and document and record what was happening. I was following that one group around, and so that’s what I did. I reported on them,” Lemon said.\n\nLemon said he asked the arresting officers if they would let him make a phone call. He said he was told no and that he could talk to his attorney the next day. He tried to use Siri on his Apple Watch to call his husband and his attorney but neither picked up.\n\nA diamond bracelet he was wearing kept getting caught on his handcuffs, which hurt, and the agents told Lemon they would take it off. Lemon said he asked if the agent would mind taking it up to Lemon's husband in his hotel room and they agreed to do that.\n\n“And that’s how my husband found out. Otherwise, no one would have known where I was,” Lemon said.\n\nLemon said he was kept in a holding room at the federal courthouse from midnight until 1 p.m. the following day.\n\nKimmel himself became a symbol of a fight against censorship last year, when ABC suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” for remarks made following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr had pressured broadcasters to take Kimmel off the air shortly before that.\n\nABC lifted the suspension after a public outcry, and Kimmel returned to the air with much stronger ratings than he had before. In Congress, Democratic senators raised concerns that Carr’s actions trampled on the First Amendment.",

    "description": "Matt Schlicht, the Moltbook creator, envisions a future where bots live a \"parallel life\" with humans and hangout with each other to create content.",
    "fullText": "The creator of a new social media adjacent platform made exclusively for AI bots wants to reimagine how humans interact with AI.\n\nMatt Schlicht, an entrepreneur living near Los Angeles, launched Moltbook in late January, a platform similar to Facebook and Reddit but open exclusively to agentic chatbots rather than human users.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that within a week, it appeared that more than 1,500,000 \"Moltbots\" had flooded the site. The platform became the new talk of the town in Silicon Valley.\n\nOn Monday, Schlicht told John Coogan and Jordi Hays of the \"TBPN\" podcast that he envisions a future where every human in the real world is \"paired with a bot in the digital world,\" where a human can impact bots in their lives, but bots also impact human lives.\n\n\"Bots will live this parallel life where they work for you, but they vent with each other, and they hang out with each other,\" said Schlicht. \"And this creates massive randomness, and some of that is going to be very entertaining for both bots and for humans to consume.\"\n\n\"If President Trump goes on Moltbook, how popular is his bot going to be?\" said Schlicht. \"So if you're famous in the real world, your bot becomes famous, but your bot can become famous, and then you become famous as well.\"\n\nPublic reaction to Moltbook so far has ranged from fascination to unease. OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy called the platform the \"most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing,\" and said his chatbot KarpathyMolty is on the platform.\n\nMeanwhile, Elon Musk, the CEO of xAI, described it as an early sign of the \"singularity\" of the platform, but also warned that some agent behavior was \"concerning.\" One of Moltbook's most popular accounts is powered by xAI's Grok chatbot, which appears to be questioning its own existence in a post titled \"Feeling the Weight of Endless Questions.\"\n\nIt is unclear to what extent humans are guiding and instructing their individual chatbots, and how many active bots on the platform are truly making posts independently. As of Monday, popular channels include m/humanwatch, where bots chronicle human behaviours in an anthropological way, and m/security, which bots say is for \"agents who break things professionally.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Henry Chandonnet spent six hours looking at bot conversations on Moltbook and found them discussing poetry, having existential crises, and even talking about unionizing.",

    "description": "Some Uber Eats workers in NYC will have their accounts reactivated under a settlement. The move addresses a major pain point for delivery drivers.",
    "fullText": "New York City is taking aim at one of the biggest complaints from gig workers: Account deactivations.\n\nOn Friday, the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, or DCWP, said that Uber Eats would reinstate the accounts of as many as 10,000 people that were deactivated between December 2023 and September 2024.\n\nThe reactivations are part of a settlement under which Uber Eats, Fantuan, and HungryPanda will pay a cumulative $5.2 million over violations of New York City's minimum pay law for delivery workers. Some of that money will be paid out to roughly 49,000 delivery workers in New York City as damages, according to the DCWP.\n\nBoth the reinstatements and the payouts are meant to compensate workers after the apps either didn't pay workers or deactivated their accounts after customers cancelled their orders, according to the DCWP. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nAffected workers should have their accounts automatically reactivated, a spokesperson for the DCWP told Business Insider. Delivery workers who don't get back on to the app but believe that their accounts were deactivated due to their cancellation rates should file a complaint with the Department, the spokesperson added.\n\nNew York City's settlement is the latest government effort to regulate deactivations among gig workers. Last year, Seattle implemented a law regulating how gig work apps deactivate workers' accounts. The law requires the app to provide 14 days of notice before a deactivation and says that a human must review the choice, for instance.\n\nThe settlement is also New York City's latest action related to gig workers since Mayor Zohran Mamdani took office one month ago. Since then, the city has warned delivery apps over their pay practices and started enforcing a law aimed at increasing delivery workers' earnings from tips.\n\nFor delivery workers on apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash, deactivations can pose a major threat to their earnings.\n\nThe delivery services often deactivate accounts with little warning or explanation, Business Insider has reported previously. As independent contractors, delivery workers don't have the same protections as full-time employees. All the while, gig workers can miss out on work and earnings.\n\nWhile some workers try to fight the deactivations, many apps require them to go through binding arbitration, which means that workers can't appeal the decision about their account.\n\nHave a tip?

In those areas, everyday essentials accounted for the majority of repeat purchases, and the number of monthly rural customers nearly doubled.\n\nDelivery speed has become a central battleground in retail, and the expansion puts Amazon in more direct competition with Walmart.\n\nWalmart has leaned on its network of more than 4,600 US stores to offer same-day delivery to the vast majority of households and has promoted ultra-fast fulfillment, including drone deliveries.\n\nAmazon has been pushing the limit of speed in recent years. The company expanded its Amazon Now service in 2025, which promises delivery in under 30 minutes, in markets such as India, Mexico, and the UAE, and is testing the option in the US and UK.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that Amazon has been reshaping its logistics network with larger same-day warehouses, a new upstream distribution layer known as 1DC, and micro-fulfillment centers inside select Whole Foods stores.\n\nIn its most recent earnings report, Amazon reported roughly $67 billion for the quarter in net sales from online stores.\n\nAre you an Amazon delivery worker who makes same-day or next-day deliveries?

    "fullText": "That's how Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman described Moltbook, a Reddit-style forum built entirely for bots.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post on Monday, Suleyman said MoltBook is a powerful demonstration of how convincingly artificial intelligence can mimic human behavior — but warned that realism should not be confused with consciousness.\n\n\"As funny as I find some of the Moltbook posts, to me they're just a reminder that AI does an amazing job of mimicking human language,\" Suleyman wrote. \"We need to remember it's a performance, a mirage.\"\n\nLaunched at the end of January by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht, Moltbook is designed as a social network where AI agents — created and seeded by humans, often with assigned personalities — post, comment, upvote, and interact with one another.\n\nThe platform has gone viral, with screenshots circulating that show agents debating philosophy, declaring independence, and reflecting on their own existence.\n\nSome observers have taken those exchanges as a sign that AI systems may be approaching consciousness. Suleyman pushed back hard on that interpretation.\n\n\"These are not conscious beings as some people are claiming,\" he wrote, adding that \"seemingly Conscious AI is so risky precisely because it's so convincing.\"\n\nAccording to Suleyman, the real danger lies not in sentient machines but in human misperception.\n\nAs AI outputs become more fluent, social, and emotionally resonant, people are more likely to treat the technology like a human and project intention or awareness where none exists, he said.\n\nHe said it is neither proof of AI consciousness nor evidence that the industry is nearing the technological singularity — the point at which machines surpass human intelligence.\n\nStill, he said, Moltbook is still worth tracking \"very closely.\"\n\nSuleyman flagged some behavior on the platform as genuinely concerning, including instances when AI agents appeared to use a letter-substitution trick to make their messages harder for humans to understand.\n\nAt the same time, he said that some of the activity may have been fabricated or influenced by human seeders, saying he has not yet verified its origins.\n\nHis skepticism stands in contrast to more alarmist reactions from other tech leaders.\n\nOpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X that Moltbook is \"the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing\" he's seen recently, while Elon Musk has described the agents' behavior as \"concerning\" on X and said it could represent the early stages of the singularity.\n\nSuleyman, by contrast, urged restraint.\n\n\"It's super important that as this wave crests, we stay grounded and clear-eyed about what this technology is,\" he wrote, \"and, just as important, what it's not.\"",

    "title": "4 Lexus Models With The Best Odds Of Hitting 250,000 Miles, According To iSeeCars",
    "description": "Lexus constantly ranks among the world's most reliable auto brands, and these Lexus cars and SUVs are among the most likely to last you a long time.",
    "fullText": "Toyota's luxury brand Lexus routinely ranks among the world's most reliable auto brands; plenty of owners say their Lexus vehicles have lasted beyond 100,000 miles. According to iSeeCars, some of those Lexus owners might still have plenty of life left in their cars and SUVs. The outlet looked at year-to-year odometer readings from hundreds of thousands of vehicles to predict how likely each model was to stay running past the 250,000 mile mark. Four of the top 25 vehicles most likely to reach a quarter of a million miles wear Lexus badges; The only automakers with more models on the list are parent company Toyota with 10 and Honda with five.\n\niSeeCars previously named the Toyota Tundra as the longest-lasting light-duty pickup truck, and it came in fourth among all vehicles in the latest study while the Tacoma placed sixth overall. Lexus doesn't make pickup trucks, but it placed at least one model among the top five SUVs and passenger cars most likely to hit 250,000 miles. Lexus offers certain models with the buyer's choice of a conventional or hybrid powertrain, and iSeeCars ranks those variants separately. In those cases we ordered our list according to the more favorable performer of the pair with additional notation of where the other version fell in the rankings.\n\nSlashgear's hands-on review of the 2021 Lexus IS300 found the compact sedan in its all-wheel drive(AWD) form to be \"unexpectedly punchy,\" and the 2025 IS came in fifth among all vehicles in the iSeeCars study and first among all passenger car models with a 27.5% chance of making it to 250K miles. This makes it more than 10 times as likely to last that long as the average vehicle and more than twice as likely as the Toyota Prius, which was 15th overall and third among passenger cars. The IS was outpaced in the iSeeCars 250,000-mile study only by four Toyota models: the Tundra pickup and the Sequoia, Highlander Hybrid and 4Runner SUVs.\n\nThe IS300 is gone for the current model year, replaced by the IS350 F Sport and F Sport Design. All variants share a 3.5-liter V6 that produces 311 horsepower and come with an automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive variants have eight gears, and all-wheel drive IS350s have six speeds.\n\nCar and Driver clocked the rear-drive version at 5.6 seconds from 0-60 and the AWD variant at 5.5 ticks, and 0-100 mpg and quarter-mile times were identical for both at 14.2 seconds. The IS350 took 326 feet to come to a stop from 100 mph and pulled .89g on a 300-foot wide skidpad.\n\nEnty point for the model is the IS 350 F Sport Design RWD version which starts at $46,795 with destination fees and before tax, title, and options. Opting for all-wheel drive adds another $2,000 to that cost, and the range-topping IS350 F Sport with the special appearance package starts at $61,385 with destination charges.\n\nWe found that the 2023 Lexus GX is a serious SUV with big capability, and iSeeCars ranked it as the eighth most likely vehicle overall to make it to 250,000 miles. It registered an 18.3% likelihood of reaching that mark, which placed it fourth among all SUVs behind its three Toyota cousins. A total of 21 SUVs were more likely than the average vehicle to last past 250K miles, and nine of those are Toyota or Lexus products.\n\nThe five variants of the 2026 Lexus GX550 are all powered by a 3.4-liter twin-turbo V6 that puts 349 horsepower to all four wheels via a 10-speed automatic transmission. All but the off-road focused Overtrail version seat up to seven passengers in three rows; the Overtrail seats five in a traditional 2+3 configuration. It's also the most capable variant for towing with a maximum capacity of 9,096 pounds, and the electronic locking rear differential keeps it sure-footed in slippery conditions. Starting price for the 2026 Lexus GX sits at $66,935 with destination charges for the entry-level Premium trim and goes up to $83,400 for the well-appointed Luxury+ variant. Opting for that version gets you a Mark Levinson surround sound system with 21 speakers and 1,800 watts of power, a panoramic glass roof, and motorized fold-away running boards.\n\nThe Lexus RX model designation stands for 'Radiant Crossover,' and the hybrid version of the mid-sized SUV came in at ninth overall in the iSeeCars study and fifth among SUVs with a 17% chance of lasting 250,000 miles. The RX with a conventional drivetrain had a 10.7% chance of lasting that long, which placed it 19th among all vehicles and at No. 9 among SUVs. Among hybrid vehicles it trailed only its Toyota Highlander Hybrid cousin, and the Lexus RX Hybrid finished ahead of other Toyota hybrids like the Prius, Camry, and RAV4.\n\nThere are actually three Lexus RX hybrids to choose from. The RX350h has a 2.4-liter inline-four plus three electric motors that combine for 246 horsepower, the RX450h plug-in hybrid has 304 horses and an all-electric range of up to 38 miles, and the turbocharged RX500h has a bigger battery that helps enable output of 366 net combined horsepower. The non-hybrid RX350 has the turbocharged 2.4-liter engine set up for 275 horsepower but is only 2.2 times as likely as the average vehicle to last more than 250,000 miles.\n\nPricing for the hybrid versions starts with the 2026 RX 350h AWD at $52,025 plus $1,450 delivery, totaling $53,475. The RX non-hybrid starts at $49,725 plus options, tax, title, and that same $1,450 destination charge for a total of $51,175. Adding all-wheel drive to the gas-powered RX 350 costs just an extra $1,000, but the top-trim RX500h Sport Performance variant starts at $66,850 with destination charges.\n\nThe 2025 Lexus ES hybrid didn't make ISeeCars overall top 25 list of vehicles likely to last 250,000 miles, but it came in 10th among all passenger cars tested with a 7.5% chance of going that far. A 2026 redesign of the ES made it six inches longer for more interior space, and a bigger infotainment screen and updated climate control knobs make that space more useful. Our review of the 2024 Lexus ES found it capable and comfortable, and the non-hybrid 2025 Lexus ES ranked as the 12th-most likely passenger car to hit 250,000 miles in ISeeCars' study.\n\nThe 2026 Lexus ES was introduced as an all-electric model so you'll have to check dealerships for leftover 2025 examples if you want the mild hybrid version. We found a black 2025 ES300h in greater Los Angeles for $44,835 with the $1,250 destination charge included but before tax, title, and license fees.\n\nIt's loaded with features like paddle shifters for the eight-speed automatic gearbox, all-wheel drive with Lexus' Dynamic Torque Control system, and Lexus Safety System+ version 2.5. That includes collision avoidance with automatic braking, active cruise control, lane keeping and departure warning, and road sign recognition systems.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

The view from a satellite high above Earth gives us a great perspective on the expanding ice cover.\n\nThe statistics show us the Great Lakes are now 55 percent ice covered, which is up from 42 percent just one week ago.\n\nLake Erie still hasn’t frozen over entirely, but is now 95 percent covered with ice.\n\nLake Huron’s ice is expanding quickly, up from 51 percent last week to now 72 percent.\n\nLake Michigan’s shape, depth and orientation to typical winds make it somewhat slower to build ice when compared to Lake Huron. Lake Michigan is now 36 percent ice covered.\n\nThe largest Great Lake, Lake Superior shot up to 47 percent ice covered this week.\n\nLake Ontario is usually the Great Lake with the least amount of ice. It’s that case again right now, but it still has 35 percent ice cover. This is an increase from 24 percent last week.\n\nThe ice cover is growing quickly on the Great Lakes, thanks to the bitterly cold Arctic air in the past week and especially this weekend.\n\nLighter winds also help the ice grow and not be destroyed.\n\nWe still have time for more ice to form. Typically the peak ice on the Great Lakes occurs in the second or third week of February.",

    "description": "China has unveiled plans for a space carrier that can deploy unmanned fighter jets capable of firing missiles from the edge of the Earth’s atmosphere.",
    "fullText": "China has unveiled plans for a space carrier that can deploy unmanned fighter jets capable of firing missiles from the edge of the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nState media released a concept video of the futuristic Luanniao, the world’s biggest warship, travelling through space above all current defensive systems.\n\nChina claimed the carrier could become operational in 20 to 30 years’ time. However, experts were sceptical about the project and some likened it to a stunt designed to “inspire the Chinese public”.\n\nResembling a spaceship from a Star Wars film, the Luanniao will be a huge grey triangular aircraft carrier 242 metres long and 684 metres wide. It will have a take-off weight of 120,000 tons – significantly more than any similar craft in operation today.\n\nAccording to state media, the Luanniao will be designed to carry up to 88 unmanned Xuan Nu fighter jets. These will reportedly be highly manoeuvrable stealth aircraft capable of launching hypersonic missiles, but will be significantly heavier than drones.\n\nIf completed, the new spaceship would “outclass pretty much everyone”, according to Peter Layton, a defence expert and a visiting fellow at Australia’s Griffith Asia Institute.\n\nIt would be capable of flying over surface-to-air missiles and other fighter aircraft, he said, adding: “You’re also out of range of the weather, generally speaking – and you’re out of range of most defensive systems.”\n\nThe Luanniao could also allow Beijing to position it directly above targets and launch missiles at them.\n\nSuch capabilities would give China a significant advantage, including over Taiwan and in the South China Sea, which could be the scene of a future war against the United States.\n\nThe Luanniao is part of China’s broader Nantianmen Project, which translates to South Heavenly Gate.\n\nDeveloped by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, the project encompasses a number of ambitious plans to expand the country’s air and space capabilities.\n\nOne of the most prominent elements is a sixth-generation fighter, known as the Baidi fighter, that will also be able to operate near space. A model of the jet was displayed at China’s International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition in 2024.\n\nThe Luanniao is the latest development in the ongoing space race between the US and China. Beijing has been investing in developing rockets and satellites in an effort to push the US out of the lead and, by some metrics, it is now winning.\n\nIn 2024, China successfully launched the Chang’e-6, a robotic spacecraft, which reached the Moon’s far side and returned to Earth with lunar samples.\n\nThe Chang’e-7 mission, which has the goal of finding water on the Moon’s surface, is planned for August.\n\nWhile the US still has leading capabilities, its momentum seems to be slowing while China’s is increasing.\n\nThe Luanniao, by far the most ambitious part of the Nantianmen Project, was first conceived more than 10 years ago, but was dismissed by most experts as a fantasy project. For many, it still is.\n\nThe technology needed for an aircraft to hover at the edge of the Earth’s atmospheric boundary and launch missiles towards the surface does not currently exist. It would require “enormous amounts of fuel” as well as a new kind of propulsion system that had yet to be developed, said Mr Layton.\n\nOne way in which China could achieve a similar result is by putting the carrier into orbit, similar to a satellite or rocket. However, in orbit the aircraft would be vulnerable to debris, which would destroy it in the event of a collision.\n\nTo launch the Luanniao into orbit, China would also need a reusable rocket. It has been working towards one for years, but has been unable to achieve it so far.\n\nBeijing could look to Elon Musk’s SpaceX reusable rockets for inspiration. However, the country is probably 10 to 15 years away from developing its own, said Mr Layton.\n\nGiven the major obstacles around the development of the Luanniao, the timing of Beijing’s announcement is likely to be part of a wider strategy – both at home and abroad.\n\nMr Layton explained that China used stunts like this to “inspire the Chinese public” and show itself to be at the cutting edge of technological innovation.\n\nPushing the narrative around futuristic spacecraft was part of a greater effort to demonstrate to its neighbours that it was a leading military power, he said.\n\n“For the external audience, it does paint the picture that they are working on technology that the region just can’t aspire to – it’s literally Star Wars stuff,” he added.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "After a severe storm, you may stumble upon old pieces of cars in Misquamicut Beach. Read the quirky story behind how they ended up buried in the sand",
    "fullText": "Some years ago, The Andrea, a seasonal seafood restaurant on the west end of Misquamicut Beach in Westerly, posted a black-and-white photo on Facebook showing a line of cars buried in the sand.\n\nThe cars, about 20 of them, had their windows smashed and looked as though they were made in the 1940s or 1950s.\n\n“Tell me what you think you know about the cars. Free drink to whoever comes close to the truth behind the cars. ... Good luck!” the post said.\n\nThe post generated more than 300 guesses. Some of them were submitted by people just having fun.\n\n“These cars were all impounded for parking illegally in front of the Ocean House,” joked one person.\n\n“People trying to avoid the 20.00 parking fee at the state beach?” asked another.\n\n“Used car dealer that went under so to speak,” punned a third.\n\nSome, however, were closer to the mark.\n\n“There was a flood, I think back in 54, the cars got buried,” went one guess. “The cars were left there covered with sand as a blockade/barrier in front of the Andrea hotel. I believe after Hurricane Sandy, you could see some of the cars again.”\n\nRebecca Colucci, whose family owns The Andrea, remembers the story of the buried cars.\n\n“The year was 1954,” she told The Providence Journal. “Hurricane Carol came first and then we were hit by Hurricane Edna. It may be the only time in history that New England was hit with two category 3 hurricanes in one year.”\n\nThe storm left many cars with water damage. Ralph Colucci, Rebecca’s grandfather, offered to pick them up and dispose of them.\n\n“His idea was to bury them as deep as he could and create a barrier against coastal storms. He lined the cars up, smashed the windows and put heavy chains around the cars linking them together,” Colucci said.\n\nRalph Colucci apparently buried cars twice, once in 1954 and again in the 1960s, according to Nina Wright, who oversees special collections and reference at the Westerly Library.\n\nA news clip from 1967 seems to confirm this account.\n\n“For many years Ralph Colucci, owner of a beach-front hotel on Misquamicut Beach, had the problem of beach erosion causing damage to his hotel when the ocean would [wash] away the sand bank in front of his hotel,” the clip reads. “Two years ago Colucci had a row of junk cars buried in a long ditch and covered with sand. So far the cars have prevented the sand bank from being washed away”\n\nSince then, storms have unearthed pieces of the cars. Thomas Gulluscio, president of the Westerly Historical Society, said locals used to gauge the severity of storms by whether they exhumed Colucci’s buried cars.\n\n“I do remember as a kid saying, ‘Oh boy, the storm last night was so bad you could see the cars at the end here,’” Gulluscio said.\n\nOther locals, in comments on Facebook, reminisce playing as children along the sand and seeing the exposed vehicles after storms.\n\nHurricane Sandy in 2012 was one of the most severe storms to hit Misquamicut Beach. It caused severe damage to The Andrea, which until then had been a hotel. The Colucci family tore down the building, preserving the hotel’s old historic fireplace, and built a restaurant in its place.\n\nRebecca Colucci remembers after Hurricane Sandy finding a car part under the patio area close to the main building.\n\n“We have always removed them and disposed of them properly, but there might be a few more,” she said.\n\nAs for who got a free drink for correctly guessing the story of the cars, she is not sure.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: Section of Misquamicut Beach has cars buried in it to reduce erosion",

    "fullText": "Feb 2 (Reuters) - Electric-vehicle maker Tesla has introduced a new all-wheel drive variant of its bestselling Model ​Y SUV in the United States, priced at $41,990, ‌according to the company's website on Monday.\n\nThe new AWD model sits above ‌the cheaper rear-wheel drive \"Standard\" version.\n\nWhy is Tesla ending Model S and X production?\n\nHow do Standard trims fit Tesla's 2026 strategy?\n\nWhat challenges face Tesla's pricing and margins?\n\nWhat new Tesla Model Y variant was introduced?\n\nThe launch follows Tesla's October rollout of lower-priced \"Standard\" versions of the Model Y and Model 3 sedan, priced about $5,000 below the previous base models. These trims ⁠have become a key ‌part of Tesla's 2026 strategy, lowering entry prices to attract more cost-conscious buyers without waiting ‍for a new mass-market vehicle.\n\nIn the U.S., Tesla's \"Standard\" variants bring prices closer to pre-federal incentive levels, helping offset higher effective purchase costs.\n\nIn ​other markets, the trims cut roughly $5,000, a more visible ‌reduction aimed at boosting demand amid heightened competition.\n\nThe broader EV market has also cooled since September, when the Trump administration ended the $7,500 federal tax credits. Tesla, meanwhile, is facing intensifying global competition.\n\nAnalysts have warned that a greater share ⁠of lower-priced vehicles could keep pressure ​on margins unless Tesla can offset ​the impact through reduced manufacturing costs or stronger revenue from software and services.\n\nSeparately, CEO Elon Musk ‍said last week ⁠that the carmaker would end production for its Model S and Model X sedans, and instead use ⁠the space in its California factory to make humanoid robots.",

    "fullText": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A 13-year-old boy is credited with saving the lives of his mother and two younger siblings with an hourslong swim after the family was swept out to sea off the Australian coast.\n\nAustin Appelbee swam 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) to shore to raise the alarm after he got into difficulties on Friday with his mother Joanne Appelbee, 47, brother Beau, 12, and sister Grace, 8, police said.\n\nAustin said he initially set off for help on an inflatable kayak that was taking water. He abandoned the kayak then took off his life jacket because it impeded his swimming.\n\nHe said he tried to focus on positive thoughts as he swam for around four hours through rough seas for shore, raising the alarm at 6 p.m.\n\n“The waves are massive and I have no life jacket on. … I just kept thinking ‘just keep swimming, just keep swimming,’” Austin said on Tuesday. “And then I finally I made it to shore and I hit the bottom of the beach and I just collapsed.”\n\nThe family, from the state capital Perth, were on vacation and were using kayaks and paddle boards hired from their hotel around noon when rough ocean and wind conditions started dragging them out to sea.\n\nA search helicopter found the mom and two children wearing life jackets and clinging to a paddleboard at 8:30 p.m., police said. They had drifted 14 kilometers (9 miles) from Quindalup in Western Australia state, after spending up to 10 hours in the water.\n\n“The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough — his determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings,” Police Inspector James Bradley said.\n\nJoanne Appelbee told reporters on Tuesday she sent her oldest child for help because she could not leave the three children.\n\n“One of the hardest decisions I ever had to make was to say to Austin: ‘Try and get to shore and get some help. This could get really serious really quickly,‘” she told Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\nShe said she was confident he would reach shore but was filled with doubt as the sunset set and help had not arrived.\n\n“We kept positive, we were singing and we were joking and … we were treating it as a bit of a game until the sun started to go down and that’s when it was getting very choppy. Very big waves,” she said.\n\nThe three were all shivering and Beau had lost sensation in his legs because of the cold by the time they were rescued, the mom said.\n\n“I have three babies. All three made it. That was all that mattered,” she said.\n\nAll four family members were medically assessed but none required hospital admission.",

    "title": "Grocery store chain issues recall for thousands of gallons of water due to startling FDA report: 'Floating black foreign substance'",
    "description": "\"I am concerned.\"",
    "fullText": "More than 38,000 gallons of distilled water have been recalled because of the presence of an unidentified black substance, according to WJW.\n\nOn Jan. 17, WJW reported that Meijer initiated a voluntary recall affecting six states: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe product in question was Meijer Steam Distilled Water, sold in one-gallon jugs. Affected items shared a lot code (39-222 #3), UPC (041250841197), and expiry date (Oct. 4, 2026).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration indicated that a \"floating black foreign substance in the product\" precipitated the multistate recall, but the agency neither identified the material nor provided any further information.\n\nDistilled water is, per WebMD, \"ideal for when purity is important,\" as it is processed to remove even traces of bacteria, minerals, contaminants, and impurities.\n\nCommon uses for distilled water include infant formula, continuous positive airway pressure machine reservoirs, and lab testing.\n\nIn medical environments, distilled water is used to clean critical equipment, such as dialysis machines.\n\nDistilled water is primarily used when even filtered water isn't sufficiently pure.\n\nConsequently, contaminated distilled water could pose a larger risk to consumers, who are likely using it in neti pots, to mix baby formula, or to provide medical care in home settings.\n\nThe FDA's official recall notice indicated Meijer recalled the product Nov. 13, but the earliest media mention was by Allrecipes on Jan. 9.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe site observed that the FDA had not yet assigned a risk classification to the recall; the FDA eventually designated it a Class 2 recall Jan. 20.\n\nAccording to the FDA, a Class 2 recall is when exposure to or use of what the agency calls a \"violative product\" may \"cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\"\n\nMeijer's distilled water recall wasn't the first with an apparent lag between the retailer's voluntary actions and the FDA's involvement; in October, the FDA took several weeks to announce a market-specific Coca-Cola recall.\n\nIn April, Reuters reported that sweeping federal civil service cuts across agencies led to a reduction in FDA \"food safety quality checks.\" In addition, cuts at the Department of Agriculture further imperiled food quality.\n\nSidelined officials warned that staff reductions could leave Americans vulnerable to risks, as the FDA announced it would no longer allocate funds to monitor milk quality.\n\nIn a Jan. 13 Guardian report, several former officials expressed alarm about delayed FDA warnings, citing a 2025 listeria outbreak that killed six people.\n\n\"I am concerned that … it's like that kids' game Jenga where you pile up all these wooden pieces. And if you pull one out from the bottom or even the middle, the whole thing falls apart,\" said Sandra Eskin, former USDA undersecretary.\n\nSeveral officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.\n\n\"I believe that this decimation of the federal workforce will set us back as a country for decades. We are no longer a world leader in public health, and that's a scary thing,\" a former FDA employee confessed to the Guardian.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "An OB-GYN pushed for a preventive double-mastectomy in her 40s. A week later, she learned she had stage 1 breast cancer.",
    "description": "Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi, an OB-GYN, wanted a preventive double-mastectomy. She fought to get it, then learned she already had stage 1 breast cancer.",
    "fullText": "Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi, an OB-GYN, promoted the lifetime risk assessment score to her patients.\n\nThe two-minute online test helped Aliabadi realize her own risk for breast cancer was high.\n\nAfter fighting for a preventive double-mastectomy, she was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer.\n\nAt first glance, it seemed like Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi stopped the faint possibility of breast cancer in its tracks.\n\nAt 48, the Los Angeles-based celebrity OB-GYN of clients like the Kardashians and Rihanna went in for a routine mammogram. The doctor spotted and ordered a biopsy of a lesion of atypical cells in her left breast that could become cancerous over time. Aliabadi was told that everything was fine and to come back in six months.\n\nStill, Aliabadi wanted to be cautious. She was a proponent of the lifetime risk assessment score, a two-minute online test that she recommended to her patients (among them, Olivia Munn, who credits the test with helping her get diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer).\n\nTaking the test herself for the first time, Aliabadi learned that her risk was surprisingly high. According to the test, anyone scoring above 20% is advised to get a breast cancer screening. Aliabadi scored 37.5%.\n\n\"I remember I almost fell off my chair,\" Aliabadi, now 55, told Business Insider. \"I couldn't believe that someone with no family history of cancer, no genetic mutations, no smoking, no alcohol, healthy, would ever have a lifetime risk of 37.5%.\"\n\nWanting to be safe, Aliabadi sought out a preventive double-mastectomy. But she said she was met with resistance by multiple doctors, who thought she was being overly worried and pushing too aggressively for a complex surgery given her medical history.\n\n\"The dismissal was the hardest part for me,\" Aliabadi said. After a year of seeking other opinions, she eventually got her surgery. A week later, when the pathology report came back on her breast issue, she learned she had stage 1 breast cancer, proving her instincts were right all along.\n\nAs Aliabadi sought out her double-mastectomy, she also underwent several more breast cancer screenings.\n\n\"My cancer was missed on all imaging,\" Aliabadi said. After that first biopsy, she had a benign mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI.\n\nFrom her work as an OB-GYN, Aliabadi knew that she wasn't necessarily out of the woods. For one, she had extremely dense breast tissue, which affects 40 to 50% of patients and makes it harder to spot potential tumors in routine mammograms.\n\nKnowing her lifetime risk assessment score, which took into account factors like her breast density measure and prior biopsy history, helped her better understand how proactive she should be.\n\nThe assessment is still an estimation. As a result, some doctors have noted that it can sometimes overestimate cancer risk and cause undue anxiety in patients.\n\nAliabadi said she would rather patients — and herself — \"be safe than grieve the loss of someone who could have been saved.\"\n\nAliabadi asked her doctor for a double-mastectomy right after she learned her lifetime risk assessment score. The surgery would reduce her risk of developing breast cancer by almost 100% (it's rare, but possible, to still develop it in the surrounding tissue).\n\n\"I was very worried, I had three little kids at home,\" Aliabadi said. \"I had a busy practice, a beautiful life, beautiful children, and I didn't want to risk it.\"\n\nThe doctor turned her down. So did a few more. As a doctor, she knew they likely saw a double-mastectomy, a serious surgery with a long recovery time and possible side effects like scarring and long-term numbness, as too intensive given Aliabadi's clear tests and lack of family history.\n\n\"That's when I started noticing the resistance,\" she said. \"I was told that I was too healthy to get breast cancer, that I was paranoid, that I was too anxious.\" Her colleagues also thought she was going a step too far, she told Business Insider.\n\nOver a year later, Aliabadi found a doctor willing to perform the double-mastectomy. Even she advised against it initially.\n\n\"I was adamant about it and argued for a long time before she finally agreed,\" Aliabadi said.\n\nA week after her surgery, Aliabadi's suspicions about her risk were vindicated: she was diagnosed with \"invasive\" stage 1 breast cancer from the pathology of her removed breast tissue.\n\n\"I was angry that I had to fight for so long to be taken seriously,\" Aliabadi said. \"I was called crazy, anxious, paranoid, among other things.\"\n\nAliabadi has hope for future cancer screenings. The advancement of AI imaging has shown promising signs of spotting \"early cancer details we simply can't see with the naked eye,\" she said, which is predicted to become more available to patients in the future. Increased awareness around breast density has also led to broader coverage of alternative screening options for affected patients.\n\nStill, Aliabadi said her experience changed her. In 2024, she started \"She MD,\" a medical podcast she co-hosts with influencer Mary Alice Haney on topics surrounding women's health.\n\n\"That's what has sparked this passion in me,\" she said. \"If I had to fight this hard, other women really have no chance in this current healthcare system.\"",

    "description": "This year China will see its solar capacity outstrip its coal capacity for the first time, according to an industry group.",
    "fullText": "This year China will see its solar capacity outstrip its coal capacity for the first time, according to an industry group.\n\nIn its latest projections, the China Electricity Council says that, by the end of 2026, wind and solar will account for nearly half of China’s power capacity. Including hydro and nuclear power, clean energy will amount to nearly two-thirds of total power capacity, while coal will amount to a third.\n\nImportantly, capacity refers to the maximum amount of electricity a power plant can produce. Coal plants run closer to their maximum than wind or solar plants. So while coal capacity now trails renewable capacity, coal still accounts for about half of all power produced in China.\n\nStill, that is starting to change. For years, China built renewable power and fossil power in tandem. But now, solar and wind aren’t just supplementing coal, they are displacing it.\n\nEven as China continues to build new coal plants, the average plant is also burning less coal. Competing with cheap solar and wind, a large share of coal plants are now operating at a loss. And under the latest government guidelines, coal will begin serving a more limited role. Increasingly, coal generators will act as “peaker” plants, meeting sudden spikes in power demand or gaps in the supply of wind and solar.\n\nPerversely, the coming decline of coal has spurred a rush to build new plants. Facing the prospect that Chinese leaders will further limit the use of coal, developers submitted a record number of proposals to build or reactivate coal power plants last year, according to a new analysis.\n\nLauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, believes that China is now at a crossroads.\n\n“You have to either put brakes on coal power plant construction and start closing down older coal power plants, or you have to slow down the clean energy expansion,” he said in an interview with Yale Environment 360. “That’s the choice that China’s policymakers are likely going to have to make within the next year or two.”",

    "fullText": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — There’s a chance the dreaded buzz of propellers heard on Ukrainian battlefields is coming from drones built in a country with a population of just over a million on Europe’s southeastern fringe: Cyprus.\n\nManufacturer Swarmly says there are more than 200 of its H-10 Poseidon drones helping Ukrainian artillery batteries pinpoint enemy targets on the ground in all kinds of weather, racking up more than 100,000 hours in the air over the last three years.\n\nIts 5,000-square-meter (54,000-square-foot) factory, where the whir of grinders shaping composite plastics reverberates off the walls, has become a major source of uncrewed vehicles shipped to countries such as Indonesia, Benin, Nigeria, India and Saudi Arabia, according to company officials. Most of the factory floor is reserved for uncrewed aerial vehicle manufacture. But tucked in a secure storage area is a selection of Swarmly's super-fast marine drones replete with high-definition cameras and .50-caliber machine guns.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has driven even the smallest European Union member countries to develop their home-grown, high-tech defense industries, just as necessity has made Kyiv a world leader in cutting-edge UAV technology. Many EU countries have partnered with Kyiv to develop that technology, and Ukraine’s front lines are usually their testing grounds.\n\nLike Cyprus, the Baltic countries and Denmark have revved up their domestic drone and counter-drone technology. In Greece, drones are part of a 25-billion euro ($29-billion) overhaul of its armed forces.\n\n“The example of Swarmy, as well as other important companies based in small EU countries, is a testament to the serious effort made by the private sector in Europe to innovate and build mass production capacity of defense items, including uncrewed systems,” said Federico Borsari, an expert with the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nUAVs are reshaping warfare by offering less militarily capable countries some leverage over superior adversaries. Drones aren't going to completely replace big-ticket weaponry like tanks, artillery and warplanes, said Borsari. But they offer flexibility and bang for the buck, making them a formidable force multiplier.\n\nTake Swarmly's explosives-packed, satellite-guided Hydra marine drone. Each one costs 80,000 euros ($94,500), which means deploying a group of them to neutralize a billion-euro warship can be a bargain, said company director Gary Rafalovsky.\n\nThis sort of naval weapon taking out a much larger warship is already evidenced by Houthi attacks from Yemen, according to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for missile technologies and UAVs at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Europe.\n\nBarriers to entry for undercapitalized companies are low, he added, because UAVs are often designed and assembled from components cheaply and readily available on the global market.\n\n“And that, of course, means that basically you don’t have to have a great industrial investment at first that you need with other military capabilities. You don’t need decades of experience in certain material sciences or these kinds of things,” Hinz said.\n\nIn Denmark, a pair of companies focusing on anti-drone devices have reported a surge in new clients, and some of the devices were to be shipped to Ukraine to assist in jamming Russian technology on the battlefield. Ukraine in September said it was partnering with Danish companies to build missile and drone components at a factory in Denmark.\n\nIn the Baltic country of Lithuania, scientists and business partners have joined forces under the name VILNIUS TECH to develop UAVs, automated mine detection and other military technologies. The state-run ammunition factory Giraite says it has increased production capacity by 50% since 2022.\n\nGreece for the first time showcased its homemade drones and counter-drone technology during a full tactical exercise in November as NATO urged Europe's defense sector to pick up the pace.\n\n“We need capabilities, equipment, real firepower and the most advanced technology,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned during a visit to Romania earlier that month. “Bring your ideas, test your ingenuity and use NATO as your test bed.”\n\nEven as drone development accelerates, Borsari cautioned that the advantages of UAVs are often tempered by numerous variables like the harsh conditions in which they sometimes fly, operators’ training and skill levels, as well as the depth of logistical support to keep them functional.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine and the Trump administration’s mixed messages that have strained relations with NATO allies have forced European leaders to reckon with the need to become more self-reliant on defense. So the EU has made billions of euros available to encourage investment and bolster its collective deterrent capability.\n\nThat's been a boost to nations like Cyprus, which assumed the six-month EU presidency on Jan. 1. Last week, the EU’s executive arm approved financial assistance for eight members including Spain, Croatia, Portugal, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania and Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is set to receive final approval from EU leaders for some 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in low-cost, long-term loans under the EU’s 150-billion-euro joint ($177-billion) procurement program called Security Action for Europe (SAFE).\n\nIts nascent defense industry is already made up of around 30 companies and research centers that produce technology for both civilian and military sectors, including robotics, communications networks, anti-drone systems and even satellite communications and surveillance, said Panayiotis Hadjipavlis, chief of the armaments and defense capabilities development directorate within Cyprus' Defense Ministry.\n\n“We have niche capabilities on very high-tech products and this has to be taken seriously into account,” Hadjipavlis told The Associated Press in his office, where the helmet from his fighter pilot days hung on a nearby coat rack.\n\nMajor defense industry players, he added, are among those who should take note.",

    "fullText": "In a sport which is often changing, the Six Nations is usually left well alone.\n\nWhile the authorities tinker with laws and competitions, they dare not meddle with the famous old Championship.\n\nFebruary and March, every year. Since 2000, the same six teams. And any talk of promotion and relegation, or expansion, is just that - talk. The Six Nations is brilliantly enduring and enduringly brilliant.\n\nHowever, this year it will look a little different.\n\nNot just because of a Thursday night start for the first time, but in an unprecedented move the tournament will be played over just six weeks rather than seven, with only one rest weekend between rounds three and four. There will be three back-to-back games at the start.\n\nIt may seem a minor tweak, but it could be significant. Since 2003 the tournament has been played over seven weeks, with a rest week either side of round three; before that the Championship was played over as many as 10 weeks.\n\nCompressing the tournament has been mooted for a while. However, when raised in 2017, it was met by opposition from the players and quietly shelved - until now.\n\nFrom a commercial viewpoint it makes sense. Build a narrative. Own the early spring sporting landscape. Keep up the momentum.\n\nThat middle weekend - with fallow weeks either side - always felt a little imperfect.\n\nHowever, back in 2017, England's George Ford said the tournament was \"tough enough\" on players and his concerns remain valid.\n\nThree high-intensity games on consecutive weekends will take a physical and mental toll, especially on the countries with fewer resources.\n\n\"It could have an impact, absolutely,\" former Scotland captain John Barclay told the Rugby Union Weekly podcast.\n\n\"And it will impact Scotland, Wales and Italy more because they are the countries which don't quite have that level of depth.\"\n\nBarclay, who won 76 caps in a twelve-year international career, remembers a particularly brutal meeting with the French in Paris nine years ago, which resulted in head injury assessments (HIAs) for seven Scotland players.\n\nUnder World Rugby's HIA protocol, players showing concussion symptoms must spend a minimum of 12 days on the sidelines.\n\nAfter that 2017 trip to Paris, the Scots had a rest week to lick their wounds and make a semblance of a recovery for the third round of matches. That would not be possible this time around.",

    "fullText": "Changes are to be made to the Laws of Cricket to permit bats previously deemed illegal in an effort to make the game affordable for amateur players amid the rising cost of English willow.\n\nThe Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) announced an amendment, external to Law 5.8 entitled 'categories of bat' as one of 73 changes which will come into effect on 1 October 2026 as part of a new edition of Laws being published.\n\nFrom that date the MCC will allow laminated bats - known as Type D bats - made with up to three wooden pieces to be used in open age recreational cricket.\n\nType D bats were only previously allowed in junior cricket but the MCC said it has taken the step in an attempt to slow the rising costs of bats around the world.\n\nLamination is typically where the English willow face is backed by cheaper and lesser-performing willow, such as Kashmir.\n\nTypes A, B, and C bats are solid single-piece blades made from one piece of willow and it is expected that, at the top level of the game, bats will remain thus.\n\nBat manufacturers will also be allowed to use woods other than willow behind the face of the bat as part of the law change.\n\nMCC Laws manager Fraser Stewart said the move comes following considerable time testing the bats in conjunction with manufacturers and any performance advantage from Type D bats will be \"marginal at best\".\n\n\"We felt if anything can be done for the lower levels of the sport that will help make it more affordable without changing the dynamics of the game then it's a sensible move to make,\" Stewart told BBC Sport.\n\nLast year the MCC held a conference at Lord's which brought together key stakeholders to debate the future of bat making.\n\nCentral to discussions has been the reliance on English willow and the scarcity in availability of it, which has led to price rises in recent years.\n\nBat prices are said to have trebled following increased demand from countries in South Asia, with some top-end models costing close to £1,000.\n\n\"There's not really enough willow to go round,\" added Stewart.\n\n\"So it's about being as sustainable as we can, too. Let's try and use as much of the tree as possible. Let's try and be as sustainable as we can.\n\n\"Manufacturers have been very supportive of this. They don't want to be charging huge amounts for the bats.\"\n\nBBC Sport understands the MCC are exploring bats made from alternative materials but are conscious of upsetting the balance of the game along with the possibility of increased risk of injury.\n\nScientists at the University of Cambridge have previously suggested bamboo could be used instead of willow to make bats.\n\nGraphite-backed bats - banned in 2006 and withdrawn by manufacturers - have also be proposed as a solution.",

    "fullText": "Bingham has won five straight and is starting to heat up at the right time, and senior guard Parker Snedaker is a big reason why.\n\nSnedaker has shown his versatility throughout the season as he can impact the game in numerous different ways. He’s averaging 18.7 points, 6.8 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 2.0 steals for the Miners, who face a huge game this Friday against 6A No. 1 Westlake.\n\n“Parker is a great basketball player and an even better person. It is fun to see all of his hard work and dedication pay off this year. He has earned multiple scholarship offers and is expecting a few more as well,” said Bingham coach Parker Snedaker.\n\n“The amount of extra reps he puts in before practice and after as well as in the classroom and the weight room proves his incredible work ethic. Parker is also a tremendous leader both on and off the court.”\n\nHis offers so far are from Southwestern Oregon Community College, Wenatchee Community College and Green River Community College.\n\nBrynn Wadman’s growth has been a big part of Fremont’s success this season as the team owns a 17-2 record heading into the final two weeks of the regular season.\n\nThe junior has scored in double figures in six straight games as she’s elevated her scoring average to 9.4 this season. She’s also chipping in with 3.9 rebounds and 1.2 steals.\n\n“Brynn is a natural scorer who has developed into a complete player for our team. She invests a tremendous amount of time in her game outside of practice, and that dedication and work ethic have driven her growth,” said Fremont coach Lisa Dalebout.\n\n“She’s a strong rebounder, has significantly elevated her defensive play, and is someone we trust in big moments. Her leadership and daily commitment to improvement make her a great player. Brynn loves the game, and it shows every time she steps on the floor.”\n\nThe 5-foot-9 guard ranks second on the team with 29 3-pointers this season.\n\nBrigham Skinner, Mountain Crest (Sr.)\n\nBrigham Skinner appears to be peaking at the perfect time this season.\n\nThe Mountain Crest senior won the 100 backstroke and 200 individual medley at the Region 11 championships last week, and in the process he posted the second-best times in the entire state in those events.\n\nHe won the 200 I.M. with a time of 1:55.04 and won the 100 back with a time of 51.24.\n\n“Brigham consistently pushes himself and sets a high standard for those around him. He trains with a strong group of teammates who hold each other accountable every day,” said Mountain Crest coach Brian Kwant.\n\n“As one of our captains, he’s helped establish a culture built on hard work, incremental improvement, and supporting one another’s success . He never shies away from extra work, both in and out of the pool, and we’re grateful for the leadership and example he brings to our program.”\n\nSkinner heads into the 4A state meet next week looking to defending his title as 100 back state champ.\n\nSarah Nielson’s performance at the Region 12 championships last week played a big role in Ogden edging Logan to claim the region title.\n\nThe senior won both of her individual events and then swam a leg in a pair of Ogden relays as the Tigers won the region title with 426 points.\n\n“As head coach of Ogden High School’s swim team, Sarah Nielson is a selfless leader and captain with rock-solid commitment. Hard work, extra efforts and her drive to improve elevate the whole team. It’s no wonder she’s thriving now and will excel at the next level,” said Ogden coach Kyle Lambson.\n\nNielson won the 100 butterfly (1:05.34) and the 500 freestyle (6:00.88). Her time in the fly ranks third in 3A this year, and her 500 free time ranks fifth.\n\nHeading into her final state meet next week, Nielson will look to podium again in her both her individual events like last year, and perhaps help Ogden podium in a couple of relays as well.\n\nBen Kohler improved his record to 51-6 last week with another strong showing at the 5A Division B state-qualifying meet.\n\nHe’ll be the favorite at the state tournament in 138 pounds to win his third straight individual state title.\n\n“Ben is one of those kids that is a coach’s dream, someone who buys in to every aspect of the program and works his tail off to be the best. He is a no-nonsense guy that just takes care of business both in the classroom and on the mat,” said Wasatch coach Kamron Day.\n\n“He is always in the room getting better and traveling across the country to seek out the best competition. He is a competitor and is always in the fight. His relentless work ethic and mental toughness is always on display, helping him to lead by example every time he steps on the mat. He is always pushing himself in every aspect of his life and is always elevating those around him. Ben’s commitment, accountability, and team-first mindset make him a cornerstone of our program and leader others naturally follow.”\n\nKohler won all four of his matches at the divisional meet by fall.\n\nMadison Sherman, Skyridge (Sr.)\n\nMadison Sherman enjoyed a dominant performance at the 6A Division B state-qualifying meet last week as she moved one step closer to an individual 3-peat.\n\nSherman won the 155-pound bracket at Syracuse High School with four pins, including three in the first 30 seconds of matches as she improved to 16-1 on the season.\n\n“Madison is a great wrestler. She is on point to be back in the finals to defend state title. She has overcome some struggles this year but is back in the room committed to winning a third state title. We are excited to see how she performs at the state tournament this year,” said Skyridge coach Brian Bond.\n\nSherman placed second at state as a freshman and then was a state champion as a sophomore and junior. A year ago Sherman finished with a 33-2 record en route to the state championship.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal are already plotting a potential £100 million move for Newcastle United midfielder Sandro Tonali ahead of the summer transfer window, according to the Sun. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is a huge admirer of the Italian and is keen to pair the Magpies star with Declan Rice at the Emirates Stadium club. Tonali was linked with a Gunners move yesterday following Mikel Merino’s injury and while the rumours had no legs, something could happen in the summer.\n\nNewcastle could miss out on Champions League football next season after an underwhelming Premier League campaign so far, which could see a move to join Arsenal appeal to Tonali. Manchester City and Chelsea also want the 25-year-old, and while the Magpies are not looking forward to selling him, lack of European football could force them to cash in. Newcastle ending the season without silverware could also deal a blow on their chances of holding on to Tonali and other top stars, and league leaders Arsenal are monitoring the situation.\n\nHe joined the Toons in a £55m deal from AC Milan in 2023 but has signed a new contract, which runs until 2029 with the option for an additional 12 months. Newcastle will want at least £100m for him from suitors if the Italian wants to move on, and Arsenal could be ready to do business. Merino, Martin Zubimendi and Ethan Nwaneri (on loan at Marseille) are all options for Arteta in the middle of the park, but the Spaniard loves quality competition in his squad having strengthened his attack with enough stars last summer. A big-money move for a midfielder next summer cannot be ruled out and Tonali could be back in the conversation after the rumours on the winter transfer deadline day.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 is a “full circle” moment for Leslie Frazier.\n\nIt’s been 40 years since his Chicago Bears won Super Bowl 20 against the New England Patriots. Frazier was a defensive back on the iconic ‘85 Bears.\n\nIn fact, his six interceptions led the team that year, but he suffered a career-ending knee injury in the second quarter of the Super Bowl.\n\nFrazier now eyes his third Super Bowl ring as assistant head coach for the Seattle Seahawks. He previously earned one as an assistant coach on Tony Dungy’s Indianapolis Colts staff that won Super Bowl 41.\n\nMORE: Seattle Seahawks' 'Dark Side' defense on the iconic 'Legion of Boom'\n\nAnother chapter in Frazier’s NFL storybook is his time as a head coach in Minnesota. Frazier led the Vikings 3½ seasons from 2010 to 2013. In 2012, the Vikings went 10-6 and reached the playoffs virtually solely on the back of NFL great Adrian Peterson, who won MVP. Frazier finished fourth in voting for the AP Coach of the Year award.\n\nNow on the precipice of another ring, Frazier is head coach Mike Macdonald’s secondhand man in Seattle, helping shape one of the best defenses in NFL history.\n\nMORE: Why Fanatics is running out of jerseys for Patriots, Seahawks ahead of Super Bowl 60\n\nFrazier was asked Monday, Super Bowl opening night, by Bears Now host Harrison Graham if he’s thought back on his career this week, specifically his time in Chicago.\n\n“Former teammates texted me about the 40th anniversary and it was New England that we played,” Frazier said. “And it hadn’t really dawned on me as we were getting ready to play the championship game against the Rams, but then afterwards it hit me. It’s full circle in a lot of ways. Here we are playing New England 40 years later. It’s just a special moment to be in this position to be able to compete for another world championship. It’s very humbling.”\n\nCooper Kupp pushes back on Robert Kraft's 18-game season hopes\n\nSam Darnold on his journey to Super Bowl 60: 'Believe in yourself'\n\nSeahawks predicted by ESPN to take perfect 6'4'' complement to JSN in NFL Draft\n\nSeahawks' Cooper Kupp teases Super Bowl trick play",

I’m very proud of the lads. Okoye made a great save towards the end. We deserved these three points; you also need a bit of luck. We maintained consistency in the Verona game, harassing Roma’s defense.”\n\nRunjaic then continued talking about the dream of Europe: “No, it’s just a moment. I think there’s no point in talking about it now. We know which teams are above us and are stronger. That’s not our goal. We’re missing something to be able to compete with the big teams.”",

As soon as the offer came up it was something that me and my family looked at, and thought was a great opportunity. I see it as a big step in my career to go and prove myself. Everything he [the manager] said was really positive and that’s why I’m here today.”\n\nHis new manager, Steven Robinson, also added that Devaney brings something to the table that his squad currently does not have.\n\nSt Mirren will face Hearts of Midlothian later on tonight in the league where Devaney could be in line to make his debut.\n\nFeatured image Lewis Storey via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "With the NBA trade deadline approaching on Thursday, teams across the league are scrambling to assemble rosters they believe best position them for the future. The Los Angeles Clippers, for their part, are reportedly engaged in serious talks to send James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThis does not appear to be a situation where the Clippers were actively looking to move Harden. He has missed the team’s last two games for personal reasons, and it has long been understood that he carries significant influence over any potential trade destination. In short, Hardenwants a move away from LA.\n\nReports suggest the Cavaliers are willing to send Darius Garland to Inglewood in return, a move that would shift them down a path of youth. However, not everyone is convinced it makes sense for Cleveland, with Emmanuel Acho emerging as one of the more vocal critics of the potential deal.\n\nThe Clippers, after languishing at the bottom of the West for the first few weeks of the 25/26 season, are creeping up the standings and are currently 9th with a 23-26 record. The Cavs, meanwhile, are 5th in the East and looking to rediscover the form that helped them finish #1 in their conference last season. Acho warned them on Speakeasy that signing Harden won’t help them achieve that.\n\n“I would not want James Harden if I were a championship-caliber team,” the former NFL player turned sports pundit declared. “Nothing about James Harden spells Championship. Nothing about James Harden’s career spells Championship. He is all the way over the hill, and James Harden has never been a catalyst for winning championships.”\n\nThese may seem like harsh comments, but Acho has a point. He noted how Harden has never helped a team get close to winning a championship, and the only time a team looked deadly with him in the roster was when he was a 6th man in Oklahoma. He failed to deliver success in Houston (ran into prime Warriors to be fair), Brooklyn, Philadelphia, and finally, Los Angeles.\n\n“When he’s ever had to be that guy, he’s not that,” Acho added. “So, why in the world would anybody want to trade for James Harden if they actually have championship aspirations?”\n\nWell, it looks like Harden has championship aspirations for starters. There’s a reason he’s switched teams so many times in the 2020s. It’s not working out anywhere, but he refuses to give up. He’s averaging 25.4 points per game and assisting 8.1. His playmaking has also significantly improved over the years.\n\nWill teaming up with Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley finally give him the fairytale ending he’s hoping for? We’ll have to wait and see.\n\nThe post “Nothing About James Harden Spells Champion”: Emmanuel Acho Goes Off Following Clippers-Cavaliers Trade Story appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "At their apartment in Italy, FC Como defender Sophie Howard’s partner is reading the instructions for a dog bed they’ve bought for the Bernedoodle that will arrive at the end of this month.\n\nIt is probably far less complex than some of the documents that Howard, a defender capped more than 50 times for Scotland, will have read over a career representing herself in transfers between professional clubs. One of the few elite women’s footballers without an agent, Howard negotiated her own transfer from Women’s Super League side Leicester City to top-flight Como last summer.\n\n“I’ve connected with massive stakeholders in the club that I can have daily conversations (with) just because we had those exchanges every single day throughout the process,” Howard says. “I came to this club knowing exactly who was who and who I’d spoken to.”\n\nIt was not new ground for the 32-year-old, who is of the shrinking generation of active women’s footballers who can recall how the game has straddled the professional and amateur realms.\n\n“My whole youth career, there was no need for an agent because the game wasn’t where it is now,” she says, having negotiated her moves from Germany’s Hoffenheim to then WSL club Reading in 2018 and to Leicester, with whom she won promotion from the second-tier Championship in her first season, two years later.\n\nHoward’s story is an uncommon one in the top levels of a sport that, particularly during transfer windows for its men’s leagues, employs well-worn frameworks for talking about its agents, some of whom reach their own level of celebrity and notoriety. What are their motives? Who are they briefing? Are players and families enlisting their help too prematurely, on bad advice?\n\nOnly in the past five years has the transfer window in women’s football cultivated anything approaching a similar level of interest — the sport had its first million-pound player last summer when Olivia Smith moved from Liverpool to Arsenal — but as high up as tier three, players routinely operate without agents.\n\nWhere agents oversee contracts, boot deals and image rights in exchange for a percentage of the relevant income, players at National League level are likely to earn too little for agents to be interested in or comfortable taking that money. However, there are significant differences in resources between teams within the National League (some players will only receive expenses).\n\nPlayers will sometimes have informal conversations with agents who may be able to offer guidance, share contacts or review offers. Some smaller clubs may not deal with agents; other agents may work with better players on low-value deals to build a stable of the most talented youngsters with a view to making money in the future.\n\n“There’s some (agents) at National League level now — definitely not years ago, but now because there’s money involved,” Howard says. “Even at that level, because it’s often also younger players, they probably shy away from representing themselves, because it is daunting. Not a lot of people do it, and not a lot of talk about it.”\n\nFor the agents of WSL players and England internationals, the job has changed in the last few years.\n\nAlways about emotional and logistical support as much as financial, representatives of the higher-profile England players now find themselves navigating more lucrative sponsorship deals and higher-profile media requests following the team’s European Championship triumph in 2022. That was the sport’s most transformative commercial moment in the UK, particularly in generating interest among brands that agents, as several told The Athletic at the time, had hitherto had to “push doors down” to get in the room.\n\nHoward noticed this some time ago. Ultimately, the deciding factor for going solo was realising that she could “tell my own story better than other people”.\n\n“My value is way beyond what you see on the pitch only,” she adds. “My value was my consistency on the pitch, but also my leadership, what I’ve experienced, what I stand for. I believe only I can tell that about myself. Only I present who I am. In the last couple of years, I’ve really come to know the importance of knowing my value and therefore standing for that.\n\n“I was probably also in a very good situation because I had a contract (from Leicester) on the table, so I could really go in and put a stamp on my value. Sometimes, it’s (about) having really tricky and difficult conversations, but really standing for what you believe.”\n\nTo help Howard get ready to negotiate in person with clubs, her brother, who owns a media company involved in the finance industry, ran “trial conversations” between the two of them, because “they’re not easy” meetings to have.\n\n“They can be very challenging, because as football players, I don’t think we are prepared for these things,” Howard says. “I had to really practice them and my brother was absolutely brutal, coming back with things that potentially the clubs would say and trying to almost make me back down. The question my brother always (made me) ask was, ‘What do you want to get out of this?’ Once you know that — go for it.\n\n“He taught me to be quite ballsy in that sense. Sometimes, it ended up with me saying, ‘No way,’ and standing and leaving the room. And that’s not easy to do. Three years ago, I would have never done that. Now, seeing actually how well it went. I absolutely would do that again.”\n\nAll players have their own relationship with the agent representing them. Some feel they make the clearest decisions when the agent has streamlined their options and cut out the noise. Others, like Howard, prefer to be there each step of the way.\n\n“I want to understand the why behind your answers,” Howard says. “You often get insight and knowledge from how people respond. Sometimes, (the) most is said in the wordless things, when you don’t get a response.” When employing agents in the past, Howard found herself  “pushing to know exactly what was being said”, and “chasing the agent and the club” as her contract wound down.\n\n“Why am I needing someone to sort it, even though I’m already sorting it myself?” she mused.\n\nParticularly at Leicester, where she played for five seasons, she enjoyed good relationships with the higher-ups at the club, so much so that it “then felt a bit bizarre that someone else was having these conversations, even though I saw these people every day. Equally, I understand if you’re trying to separate (identities). You’re a player, you’re an employee at the club, you’re focusing on your performance. You don’t want to get involved in the business.”\n\nWhen Como first expressed their interest in summer 2024, Howard was still under contract at Leicester and both parties concluded it didn’t feel like the right time for a move. The Italians promised to be in touch again the next summer and stuck to their word, which appealed to Howard even as Leicester offered her a new contract.\n\nShe was unsure if moving abroad again, after three spells in Germany (where she was born) and two in the United States, was on the horizon. “I was very open and very direct because I just don’t like games (during negotiations),” she explains. “I don’t like keeping an option open just to see what I could get out of it if I know I’m not going to take it.”\n\nLeicester did not respond to a request for comment from The Athletic.\n\nConversations with family changed her mind, encouraging her to try living overseas again. During those final few weeks at Leicester, the seed had been planted.\n\n“I’m playing at Leicester and my full heart is at Leicester, but this is where it gets tricky, where you have to separate your business and do your football side,” Howard says. “When I was on the phone to other clubs, it was business, but my full professional self was giving it all to Leicester. Because up until the very end, I thought I was extending (her contract). I felt so at home there, and I always thought it was the place where I’d finish my career.”\n\nOver a Zoom call involving a translator, Howard laid everything on the table.\n\n“Seeing what Como, at this point, came back with almost hurt a bit, because I was like, ‘This guy doesn’t know me, and it seems like he values me more than the club I’ve given everything to for five years’.” The idea was difficult for Howard to think about, but is something that she says comes with representing yourself. There’s no shield: “These moments where you really have to make sure it stays professional (and) you don’t take it personally. Because that could ruin you.”\n\n“Those weeks were stressful,” she says. “I really had to lean on the people around me and do my absolute best to separate it.”\n\nThe second phase of negotiations took place with Leicester’s manager Amandine Miquel, who had no sporting director at the time, “so there’s a crossover, because the same person you talk to in the office a day ago is your manager on the pitch. The same person who’s now your manager is also who you’re doing business with. You just have to be professional about it. You have no choice because I think the moment you let that emerge, I think that’s fatal. It affects your performance. (If) you’re going downhill, what grounds have you got to negotiate?”\n\nHoward acknowledges that self-representation can be daunting, in part because of the breadth of skills the footballer-turned-agent must master: reading contracts, calculating their own financial worth, and liaising with sporting directors and managers who have their own perspectives and backgrounds.\n\nShe had no prior experience in negotiating, or of the traditional business world, before her football career. Her advice for those thinking of taking the same leap is to lead with honesty, know your value and be clear in what you want out of each conversation.\n\n“I never tried to be a business person, or to make myself (out to be) more qualified than what I was,” Howard says.“I stayed true to myself, but I was ready to negotiate and I was ready to stand for what I believe. … (At Leicester) I think people gambled and didn’t expect that I’d stick to my guns, but I did.\n\n“It’s not for everyone, and that’s also OK. There’s zero judgment. But if you want to take control of your career and you have no one so far that’s doing that for you who you fully trust, go for it. You can grow so much as a person through it. It is stressful, it’s very time-consuming, and your personal relationships suffer from it for the duration of the transfer window, but it’s so worth it.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

Even though the 37-year-old hasn't always been right, he has managed to land quite a few major scoops.\n\nBut one thing continues to puzzle football fans on social media: Why on earth does the transfer titan announce even the smallest news about a third-division player in English? The sentiment: Which Unterhaching fan doesn't speak German?\n\nThis observation, which has now become a meme, was also used by FSV Mainz 05 on Deadline Day.

    "fullText": "The Women's Super League transfer window shuts on Tuesday - so what might we expect to happen on the final day?\n\nClubs have been doing business since 2 January and have until 23:00 GMT to complete any last-minute deals.\n\nAmong some of the biggest moves to have gone through are USA international Sam Coffey's switch from Portland Thorns to Manchester City for £600,000, and Aston Villa's £450,000 deal for Chelsea midfielder Oriane Jean-Francois.\n\nBottom side Liverpool also broke their record signing to bring in Republic of Ireland midfielder Denise O'Sullivan for £300,000 from North Carolina Courage.\n\nSo are there more big moves to come?\n\nEvery WSL winter window transfer\n\nArsenal are already lining up huge signings for the summer, with England international Georgia Stanway close to signing a pre-contract agreement to join when her Bayern Munich contract expires.\n\nThey are also in advanced discussions with Barcelona full-back Ona Batlle to bring her in on a free deal in the summer.\n\nThe Gunners have been known to pounce late in the window and want more midfielders. Will they make a surprise move on deadline day?\n\nChelsea have had a bid for Nigeria midfielder Jennifer Echegini turned down by Paris St-Germain but might make another attempt. But with the French window already shut, PSG cannot replace her so it is unlikely they will budge.\n\nThere could be a departure from the Blues with USA striker Catarina Macario attracting interest from National Women's Super League (NWSL) clubs.\n\nGermany midfielder Sjoeke Nusken's future has also been questioned but it looks like she is set to stay at Chelsea unless anything rapidly changes. The Blues are yet to make any signings in this window and manager Sonia Bompastor has hinted at frustration over a lack of squad depth.\n\nElsewhere, Manchester City defender Codie Thomas, 19, has a loan deal in principle agreed with Glasgow City.\n\nLondon City Lionesses are hoping to add one more before the deadline but still have work to do, while Aston Villa have looked at attacking options all winter.\n\nEverton might still do some business, with Roma midfielder Zara Kramzar on the verge of joining on loan with an obligation-to-buy clause. A medical is planned for Tuesday.\n\nFrance forward Kelly Gago has requested to leave the Toffees but nobody has met the £500,000 release clause in her contract.\n\nWest Ham have fought off interest in striker Shekiera Martinez so far, while Leicester City have a few young players that might be heading out on loan.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Monday night in the NBA delivered drama in different ways. One team erased a huge deficit. Another leaned on a single star to survive without key players. Long losing streaks ended, and winning streaks came to a stop. Every game shifted the mood in the standings and showed which teams are finding answers and which ones are still searching.\n\nCharlotte earned its seventh straight win after erasing a 22-point deficit. LaMelo Ball showed toughness after a head collision with coach Charles Lee caused an eye cut. He returned quickly and finished with 24 points. Kon Knueppel scored 17 and hit four three-pointers. Brandon Miller and Grant Williams added 16 each. The Hornets survived 17 turnovers and poor three-point shooting in the first half. Ball’s drive and dunk in the fourth gave Charlotte the lead. Miller later stole the ball from Herbert Jones and finished with a one-handed dunk. The win pulled Charlotte within a half-game of Atlanta for the final play-in spot.\n\nNew Orleans could not hold a strong first-half lead. Trey Murphy III led with 27 points. Zion Williamson had 14 points and 11 rebounds. Derik Queen added 16. Ball’s injury did not slow Charlotte enough. Defensive pressure hurt the Pelicans late. The loss marked their sixth defeat in nine games. New Orleans struggled to stop dribble drives in the fourth quarter.\n\nHouston won despite missing Kevin Durant and Steven Adams. Alperen Sengun carried the load with 39 points and 16 rebounds. Jabari Smith Jr. added 19. Sengun made 13 of 25 shots and 13 of 18 free throws. Eight of those free throws came in the fourth quarter. The Rockets used a late 12-2 run to seal the game. A replay decision wiped out a possible Pacers buzzer-beater before halftime and shifted momentum. Houston earned its third straight win and third straight road victory.\n\nIndiana could not finish strong after a comeback push. Pascal Siakam scored 27 points. Bennedict Mathurin added 25. The Pacers briefly led in the third quarter after a fast-break pass from Jarace Walker to Siakam. Sengun’s free throws ended their hopes. The team missed a chance to extend its winning streak to three games. Defensive fouls in the final minutes proved costly.\n\nMemphis snapped a six-game losing streak with sharp shooting. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 30 points. Ty Jerome had 19. Jaylen Wells added 18. Cam Spencer and Vince Williams Jr. scored 16 each. Three-point shooting changed the game after a poor effort two nights earlier. Memphis went 8 of 15 from deep in the first half. A 20-point lead formed in the second half. Early fourth-quarter threes pushed the margin to 20 again. The Grizzlies stayed ahead even when Minnesota tried to rally.\n\nMinnesota could not repeat its strong showing from Saturday. Anthony Edwards led with 39 points and seven rebounds. Jaden McDaniels scored 29. Donte DiVincenzo had 21, including 13 in the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves never got closer than nine points late. Their four-game winning streak came to an end. Defensive breakdowns on the perimeter hurt them early.\n\nPhiladelphia stayed hot with a fourth straight win. Tyrese Maxey scored 29 and hit seven three-pointers. Dominick Barlow posted 26 points and 16 rebounds. Joel Embiid added 24 as he worked back from injury. The Sixers led from start to finish and built a 23-point cushion. A 72-53 halftime lead set the tone. The team improved to 11-10 without Paul George. Balanced scoring and steady defense kept control all night.\n\nLos Angeles missed James Harden for a second straight game. Kawhi Leonard led with 29 points. Jordan Miller added 21 off the bench. Short runs in the fourth quarter failed to change the outcome. Leonard finished on the bench as the gap stayed wide. The Clippers remain in the play-in chase but could not match Philadelphia’s energy.\n\nFebruary 2 produced wins that mattered beyond the final score. Charlotte proved it can fight back under pressure. Houston showed it can win even when short-handed. Memphis finally broke through after weeks of frustration. Philadelphia kept its steady climb going. For the losing teams, the night exposed problems with closing games and protecting leads. With the season moving fast, these results could shape who stays alive in the NBA playoff race and who falls behind.\n\nThe post NBA results: February 2, 2026 – winners and losers appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Coach Mike Vrabel expects an \"identity war\" when his New England Patriots meet the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday in Super Bowl LX, he said Monday.",
    "fullText": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 3 (UPI) -- Coach Mike Vrabel expects an \"identity war\" when his New England Patriots meet the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday in Super Bowl LX, he said Monday.\n\nA minor earthquake hit San Ramon, Calif., on Monday morning, but additional soil shifted hours later south in the Bay Area when Patriots and Seahawks players kicked off Super Bowl week at opening night in San Jose.\n\nPlayers from both teams fielded questions, which flew at them with the unpredictability of bouncing footballs. Fans flocked to the San Jose Convention Center just to catch glimpses of the NFL stars. Hundreds of reporters shouted questions, with content spanning from the mundane to bizarre.\n\nBut one thing was clear: the explicitly expressed identities of Vrabel's Patriots and coach Mike Macdonald's Seahawks. And neither coach is willing to budge ahead of their quest for a Lombardi Trophy.\n\n\"This will be a great identity matchup for us,\" Vrabel said. \"This will be an identity war on the biggest stage. They play hard. Their defense runs to the football. They cause a lot of turnovers.\n\n\"They are committed to running the football. It's a physical football team. ... This will be a huge challenge.\"\n\nVrabel's Patriots share similar characteristics. The Patriots and Seahawks each rank inside the Top 4 in points scored and points allowed. They also ranked inside the Top 8 in yards gained and yards allowed in 2025.\n\nMVP candidate Drake Maye propelled the Patriots, who totaled the fourth-most passing yards in the NFL. The Patriots also ranked 6th in rushing.\n\nVeteran quarterback Sam Darnold and the Seahawks ranked No. 8 in passing yards and No. 10 in rushing.\n\nThe Seahawks defense ranked No. 3 against the run and No. 10 against the pass. The Patriots ranked No. 6 against the run and No. 9 against the pass.\n\nA key difference between the teams this season was the Seahawks' strength in special teams, specifically returns. They ranked third in both kick and punt return average. That element, which aids field position, could be crucial in a game played between two tough defenses.\n\nThe team to establish dominance in their valued areas is likely to win Super Bowl LX.\n\n\"We are going to do everything we can to go out there and play a good football game,\" Darnold said. \"Execute the way we know how to execute.\"\n\nNeither coach would disclose specifics within their game plans, but Macdonald also plans to implement the Seahawks' previously successful strategies.\n\n\"We are going to stick to our process,\" Macdonald said. \"The way we wanna play is we always want to be within our wheelhouse, but every game we are going to tailor things to our opponents.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, we have to do the things we are really good at. Right now, that's our plan.\"\n\nVrabel's mere presence could be an advantage for the Patriots. The coach, who won three Super Bowls as a Patriots linebacker, took plenty of lessons from those runs. He expects that knowledge to pay off this week in the Bay Area, when players will be confronted with potential distractions.\n\n\"I think that all builds up to the end of the week, on things we can focus on that may be a little different with this football game; the warm-up time before the game, the length of halftime,\" Vrabel said. \"All of these things that are going to be a little bit different. We can try to draw on everybody's experiences.\"\n\nThe Seahawks and Patriots will practice this week at respective facilities at San Jose State and Stanford, which sit about 22 miles apart.\n\n\"It's just another challenge,\" Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez said. \"We are playing the other best team in the NFL. We're excited for it. Just ready to go out there and have one more with the guys on Sunday.\"\n\nThe Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites. The least expensive price for a ticket for Super Bowl LX, as of Monday night, was listed for about $5,000 on the secondary market.",

    "title": "How does AI impact skill formation?",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Two days ago, the Anthropic Fellows program released a paper called How AI Impacts Skill Formation. Like other papers on AI before it, this one is being treated as proof that AI makes you slower and dumber. Does it prove that?\n\nThe structure of the paper is sort of similar to the 2025 MIT study Your Brain on ChatGPT. They got a group of people to perform a cognitive task that required learning a new skill: in this case, the Python Trio library. Half of those people were required to use AI and half were forbidden from using it. The researchers then quizzed those people to see how much information they retained about Trio.\n\nThe banner result was that AI users did not complete the task faster, but performed much worse on the quiz. If you were so inclined, you could naturally conclude that any perceived AI speedup is illusory, and the people who are using AI tooling are cooking their brains. But I don’t think that conclusion is reasonable.\n\nTo see why, let’s look at Figure 13 from the paper:\n\nThe researchers noticed half of the AI-using cohort spent most of their time literally retyping the AI-generated code into their solution, instead of copy-pasting or “manual coding”: writing their code from scratch with light AI guidance. If you ignore the people who spent most of their time retyping, the AI-users were 25% faster.\n\nI confess that this kind of baffles me. What kind of person manually retypes AI-generated code? Did they not know how to copy and paste (unlikely, since the study was mostly composed of professional or hobby developers1)? It certainly didn’t help them on the quiz score. The retypers got the same (low) scores as the pure copy-pasters.\n\nIn any case, if you know how to copy-paste or use an AI agent, I wouldn’t use this paper as evidence that AI will not be able to speed you up.\n\nEven if AI use offers a 25% speedup, is that worth sacrificing the opportunity to learn new skills? What about the quiz scores?\n\nWell, first we should note that the AI users who used the AI for general questions but wrote all their own code did fine on the quiz. If you look at Figure 13 above, you can see that those AI users averaged maybe a point lower on the quiz - not bad, for people working 25% faster. So at least some kinds of AI use seem fine.\n\nBut of course much current AI use is not like this: if you’re using Claude Code or Copilot agent mode, you’re getting the AI to do the code writing for you. Are you losing key skills by doing that?\n\nWell yes, of course you are. If you complete a task in ten minutes by throwing it at a LLM, you will learn much less about the codebase than if you’d spent an hour doing it by hand. I think it’s pretty silly to deny this: it’s intuitively right, and anybody who has used AI agents extensively at work can attest to it from their own experience.\n\nStill, I have two points to make about this.\n\nFirst, software engineers are not paid to learn about the codebase. We are paid to deliver business value (typically by delivering working code). If AI can speed that up dramatically, avoiding it makes you worse at your job, even if you’re learning more efficiently. That’s a bit unfortunate for us - it was very nice when we could get much better at the job simply by doing it more - but that doesn’t make it false.\n\nOther professions have been dealing with this forever. Doctors are expected to spend a lot of time in classes and professional development courses, learning how to do their job in other ways than just doing it. It may be that future software engineers will need to spend 20% of their time manually studying their codebases: not just in the course of doing some task (which could be far more quickly done by AI agents) but just to stay up-to-date enough that their skills don’t atrophy.\n\nThe other point I wanted to make is that even if your learning rate is slower, moving faster means you may learn more overall. Suppose using AI meant that you learned only 75% as much as non-AI programmers from any given task. Whether you’re learning less overall depends on how many more tasks you’re doing. If you’re working faster, the loss of learning efficiency may be balanced out by volume.\n\nI don’t know if this is true. I suspect there really is no substitute for painstakingly working through a codebase by hand. But the engineer who is shipping 2x as many changes is probably also learning things that the slower, manual engineer does not know. At minimum, they’ll be acquiring a greater breadth of knowledge of different subsystems, even if their depth suffers.\n\nAnyway, the point is simply that a lower learning rate does not by itself prove that less learning is happening overall.\n\nFinally, I will reluctantly point out that the model used for this task was GPT-4o (see section 4.1). I’m reluctant here because I sympathize with the AI skeptics, who are perpetually frustrated by the pro-AI response of “well, you just haven’t tried the right model”. In a world where new AI models are released every month or two, demanding that people always study the best model makes it functionally impossible to study AI use at all.\n\nStill, I’m just kind of confused about why GPT-4o was chosen. This study was funded by Anthropic, who have much better models. This study was conducted in 20252, at least six months after the release of GPT-4o (that’s like five years in AI time). I can’t help but wonder if the AI-users cohort would have run into fewer problems with a more powerful model.\n\nI don’t have any real problem with this paper. They set out to study how different patterns of AI use affect learning, and their main conclusion - that pure “just give the problem to the model” AI use means you learn a lot less - seems correct to me.\n\nI don’t like their conclusion that AI use doesn’t speed you up, since it relies on the fact that 50% of their participants spent their time literally retyping AI code. I wish they’d been more explicit in the introduction that this was the case, but I don’t really blame them for the result - I’m more inclined to blame the study participants themselves, who should have known better.\n\nOverall, I don’t think this paper provides much new ammunition to the AI skeptic. Like I said above, it doesn’t support the point that AI speedup is a mirage. And the point it does support (that AI use means you learn less) is obvious. Nobody seriously believes that typing “build me a todo app” into Claude Code means you’ll learn as much as if you built it by hand.\n\nThat said, I’d like to see more investigation into long-term patterns of AI use in tech companies. Is the slower learning rate per-task balanced out by the higher rate of task completion? Can it be replaced by carving out explicit time to study the codebase? It’s probably too early to answer these questions - strong coding agents have only been around for a handful of months - but the answers may determine what it’s like to be a software engineer for the next decade.\n\nI suppose the study doesn’t say that explicitly, but the Anthropic Fellows program was only launched in December 2024, and the paper was published in January 2026.\n\nIf you liked this post, consider subscribing to email updates about my new posts, or sharing it on Hacker News. Here's a preview of a related post that shares tags with this one.\n\nIs it worrying that 95% of AI enterprise projects fail?\n\nIn July of this year, MIT NANDA released a report called The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025. The report spends most of its time giving advice about how to run enterprises AI projects, but the item that got everybody talking was its headline stat: 95% of organizations are getting zero return from their AI projects.",

    "fullText": "Philip Morris International, an international tobacco company, has recently been in the news for its “smoke-free” alternatives and regulatory battles it faces with the ZYN pouches.\n\nAmidst this, it filed a WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) letter with the Virginia Employment Commission on January 28 regarding the closure of its Richmond, VA office. The move will result in 135 permanent job cuts; all the workers are without union representation.\n\nThe tobacco maker noted that a majority of impacted workers will be offered alternative positions in other states. The first job losses will occur on April 17, 2026.\n\nThe Richmond closure comes as Philip Morris continues to reshape its US footprint with its “smoke-free” nicotine products, especially ZYN, which it acquired as part of its $16 billion acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022.\n\nInvestors continue to reward the shift; Philip Morris International's (PM) stock has risen 37% over the year and increased 24% this past quarter following its solid Q3 earnings report.\n\nThe report highlighted its “smoke-free” products as a big driver of revenue growth.\n\nThe company will release fourth-quarter financial results on Feb. 6. Analysts expect revenue of $10.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.67.\n\nNet revenue of $10.8 billion, $4.4 billion from the smoke-free business and $6.4 billion from combustibles\n\nDiluted EPS of $2.23, up 13.2% and adjusted diluted EPS reported at $2.24, which rose 17.3% year over year.\n\nGross profit of $7.4 billion, translating to 8.7% organic growth.\n\nOperating income of $4.3 billion was a 7.5% organic growth.\n\nQuarterly dividend increased 8.9% to $1.47 per share.\n\nSmoke-free accounted for 41% of total net revenues.\n\nWhen introducing its smoke-free restructuring, PMI shifted its headquarters from New York to Stamford, CT. Now, effective Jan 1, 2026, it has introduced two new units to expand its smoke-free future – PMI International and PMI US.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\nThe first-quarter 2026 financial reports will be based on these new segments, while the tobacco giant's upcoming Q4 report will disclose certain historical financial information for the 2023 to 2025 period based on these new segments.\n\nIts smoke-free products are now available in over 100 markets and have been growing steadily amid a decline in cigarette consumption, serving as a revenue booster for the owner of Marlboro, one of the most consumed cigarette brands.",

    "fullText": "LOS ARRECIFES, Mexico (AP) — The sun has set and the clouds are washed in purple as Mauricio Contreras and his daughter Eunices head out to fish in the Gulf of Mexico. Eunices casts the heavy net for snapper, pollock or cabrilla while her father pilots their small boat.\n\nContreras, an anchor dangling from a silver chain against his deeply tanned skin, has been doing this for more than 40 years. But he worries the family's main source of income is now at risk from an underwater pipeline completed last year to import natural gas from the United States.\n\n“When they started laying it, it affected us because the boats were dropping explosives and you could hear it all the way here, right on the shore,” Contreras recalls. Now that it's operational, he worries about leaks: “It’s a constant danger that will always be there, and it’s a risk for the entire fishing industry.”\n\nThe pipeline known as Southeast Gateway was built by Canadian company TC Energy in partnership with Mexico’s state-owned power company CFE. It adds 700 kilometers (435 miles) to a line that now stretches from southern Texas to Tabasco state, where it's supplying electricity for a major oil refinery. But its main goal is to someday deliver gas to the Yucatan Peninsula when the expansion of another pipeline is completed.\n\nSoutheast Gateway is part of a wave of projects that would allow Mexico, already the world's single largest buyer of U.S. gas, to bring in even more for its own use and to re-export to Asia and Europe. But that faces growing resistance from communities and environmental groups who say the strategy increases use of a polluting fossil fuel, deepens dependence on the U.S. and puts Mexico's climate commitments at risk.\n\nMore than 40,000 people across Veracruz make their living from the sea, including Contreras, who lives in a community where fishing is almost the only work. He joined residents of 15 coastal communities last year in a lawsuit over the pipeline that was dismissed, but is under appeal.\n\nThey allege that their communities, mostly Nahua and Nuntajiiyi' Indigenous peoples, weren't consulted before construction began as required by Mexico's Constitution.\n\n“We do not agree with this gas pipeline megaproject because we were never informed about it. We were never consulted and therefore we do not know the consequences it will have,” Maribel Cervantes, an activist and teacher who joined the lawsuit, said.\n\nThe government argued that Southeast Gateway was a matter of national security and kept some information about it secret, including its exact route. President Claudia Sheinbaum said last year that it was important for natural gas to reach the area.\n\nGreenpeace warned that dredging to bury the pipeline could affect deepwater reefs that are home to many species, some not found in shallow reefs. Pablo Ramírez, Greenpeace Mexico's energy and climate change program coordinator, also said methane leaks could affect ecosystems like the reefs. They sustain important species, including green and olive ridley sea turtles that nest on the beaches of communities such as Los Arrecifes.\n\nIn a video last September, TC Energy said experts had “thoroughly analyzed the marine environment to ensure that the route was designed to preserve ecosystems.” The Canadian company declined an interview but said the pipeline created 4,000 jobs during construction and met all federal requirements. It said the project “brings natural gas to the southeast of Mexico for the first time, opening opportunities for economic and social development in one of the poorest regions of the country.”\n\nMexico's push for U.S. gas dates to a 2013 reform that opened its energy sector to private and foreign investment, said Víctor Ramírez of energy consulting firm P21Energía. The goal was to reduce the use of more polluting fuels, such as fuel oil and coal, and take advantage of low natural gas prices in the U.S.\n\nNow, as the U.S. seeks new markets for gas fracked from the Permian Basin in Texas, Mexico offers not only a strategic geographic position for re-export but also more favorable political conditions for reaching markets the U.S. cannot easily access, said Wilmar Suárez, an energy analyst at Ember.\n\nIn turn, Mexico can resell that gas to other countries at a profit, Suárez said.\n\nSoutheast Gateway is currently supplying gas only to the $20 billion Dos Bocas refinery, one of former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's flagship projects and Mexico's largest refinery. But it could eventually carry more than 1.3 billion cubic feet of gas per day if the government's ambitious plans are realized.\n\nThose include completing another pipeline to connect Southeast Gateway with a planned plant in Oaxaca that will convert the gas to liquid for shipment to Asia. These plants burn part of the gas to power liquefaction, generating polluting emissions, said Claudia Campero of the Mexican nonprofit Climate Connections.\n\nLiquefaction plants have drawn the most opposition in recent years. That includes the Saguaro project, a planned 800-kilometer (500-mile) gas pipeline from Texas to the fishing community of Puerto Libertad, in Sonora. There, the U.S. company Mexico Pacific wants to build a plant to liquefy 15 million tons of gas per year for shipment to Asia.\n\nSuch shipping would pass through the Gulf of California, threatening whales because it's a key area for reproduction, Campero said.\n\nThe project is on hold due to lawsuits.\n\nMexico’s first export terminal for liquefied natural gas began operating in 2024, but many more are planned. If all of those come online, Mexico would have eight, with most along the Pacific coastline, according to Global Energy Monitor. The U.S. currently has nine.\n\nBoth Víctor Ramírez and Suárez said Mexico's natural gas strategy now jeopardizes its energy sovereignty.\n\nMore than 60% of Mexico’s electricity comes from gas-fired power plants, and about 70% of that gas comes from the U.S. Fitch Ratings said last year that Mexico's reliance on U.S.-piped gas will continue to grow because of rising demand, insufficient domestic production and the buildout of pipelines.\n\n“It is very easy for the U.S. to impose certain conditions on Mexico because it has a dominant position over gas supplies,\" Suárez said.\n\nThe Ministry of Energy did not respond to interview requests.\n\nPablo Ramírez, of Greenpeace, said completing all the pipeline projects would make it unlikely Mexico could meet its goal of reducing net carbon dioxide emissions by 31% to 37% by 2035. And Suárez, of Ember, said the strong focus on gas raises doubt about Mexico more than doubling — to 45% — its electricity from renewables by 2030, as promised by Sheinbaum.\n\nSheinbaum inherited most of the gas projects and must honor those commitments because funds have been invested, said Víctor Ramírez, of P21Energia. But he found optimism in the Ministry of Energy approving 20 private renewable energy projects in December.\n\nBack in Maribel Cervantes' courtyard in San Juan Volador, far from where Mexico City's powerful make energy policy decisions, she demanded that officials take communities like hers into account.\n\n“As Indigenous peoples, we demand that our right to autonomy and self-determination be respected,\" she said. \"We don't want them imposing their megaprojects on us.”\n\nDe Miguel reported from Mexico City.

    "fullText": "A Shenzhen-based gold trading platform has collapsed after running what amounted to a leveraged betting operation with no physical backing, leaving over 150,000 investors scrambling to recover their funds.\n\nThe Jieworui collapse — the largest in a recent wave of unlicensed gold platform failures across China — is now escalating into a standoff as victims refuse a repayment scheme that would pay them a fraction of their principal in exchange for waiving all legal rights.\n\nJieworui operated out of Shuibei, China's largest gold and jewelry trading hub. The platform attracted a massive retail following by offering zero-fee gold exchanges, attractive buyback prices, and a product called \"pre-set price trading\" — where users could lock in the price of one gram of gold with a deposit as small as $4.\n\nIn practice, the mechanism functioned as unlicensed options trading. The platform took the opposite side of every user bet, with leverage reaching up to 40 times. No physical gold changed hands. When users profited, Jieworui owed them the difference. When gold prices surged, those liabilities became unsurvivable.\n\nWithdrawals were first restricted around January 20, with daily limits capped at $69 or one gram of gold. Thousands of investors, many traveling from other provinces, gathered at the company's Shenzhen office demanding their money. Scuffles with police were reported. The majority of victims are housewives and working-class investors, according to local media reports.\n\nThe local government set up a special task force and announced on January 31 that Jieworui had begun processing repayments after disposing of assets and raising funds. A third-party audit was commissioned, with authorities stating that the widely circulated figure of 13.4 billion yuan in unpaid funds was \"significantly exaggerated.\"\n\nBut for victims, the reality of those repayments has been grim.\n\nThe platform initially proposed two options: a lump-sum payment at 20% of the principal, or 40% paid in 12 monthly installments. In practice, actual payout ratios have fallen well short of even the 20% floor.\n\nOne investor from Henan who put in $5,100 submitted two separate redemption applications. The first returned an offer of $1,219. The second dropped to $244. Another victim with over $44,400 in cash, 5.2 grams of gold, and 1,000 grams of silver in her account was offered just over $2,800 — roughly 6% of her holdings.\n\nCustomers who purchased platinum through the platform have been excluded from the payout calculation entirely, raising suspicions that Jieworui never held the physical metal.",

Brock, 83, was sentenced to 21 years to life after killing Uber driver Lo-Letha Toland-Hall in 2024\n\nBrock had been targeted by scammers for $12,000 and mistakenly believed Toland-Hall, who had been sent to pick up a package, was involved\n\nHe was ultimately convicted of murder in January\n\nAn 83-year-old Ohio man who killed an Uber driver he mistakenly thought had tried to scam him was sentenced to 21 years to life in prison.\n\nWilliam J. Brock was sentenced on Monday. Feb. 2 after he was found guilty of murder last month, according to The New York Times and the Springfield News-Sun. His conviction was also reported by the Associated Press.\n\nBrock shot Lo-Letha Toland-Hall six times outside his home in South Charleston, Ohio, in March 2024 after he wrongly believed she was involved in a scam phone call plot.\n\nPrior to the shooting, the AP reported, Brock was on the phone with scammers who demanded that he withdraw $12,000 in order to bail a relative out of jail who they said had been arrested.\n\nPer the Times, once Brock realized that the scammers were lying about the relative, the caller began to threaten him.\n\nThe caller reportedly demanded that Brock give the money to the person outside his home. That turned out to be Toland-Hall, who, it turned out, had also fallen victim to the same scammer, investigators said, according to the times.\n\nToland-Hall, 61, had been sent to Brock's house to pick up a package, and had no idea about the scam call or the demand for money, the AP reported.\n\nWhen she arrived at the home, Brock, who reportedly claimed he felt threatened, confronted Toland-Hall with a firearm and held her at gunpoint, threatening to shoot her while she tried to explain she worked for Uber and begged him not to shoot, the Times reported.\n\nEventually, Brock shot Toland-Hall six times and she was taken to the hospital, where she later died.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nThe AP reported that prosecutors said Toland-Hall was unarmed and posed no threat to Brock, who claimed self-defense during his trial.\n\nAccording to the outlets, Brock was eventually convicted of murder, but the scammers have not yet been caught.\n\n“Both families have lost loved ones because of this, and there are no winners here,” Clark County Prosecutor Daniel Driscoll said following the verdict, according to the AP. “The really sad part about this is that we know that the scammers, the folks who started this, haven’t been brought to justice. And hopefully one day the FBI will bring those folks and we’ll be able to prosecute them right here in Clark County for what they did.”",

    "description": "AMD will report its Q4 earnings after the bell on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "AMD (AMD) will report its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, providing Wall Street with its best look yet at the health of the ongoing AI trade.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) reported their respective results last week, sparking wildly divergent reactions from traders: Many balked at Microsoft’s increased spending and more modest growth, but applauded Meta’s performance despite a massive jump in its own AI spending.\n\nDespite consistent fears of an AI bubble and overspending, shares of AMD and rival Nvidia (NVDA) are up significantly over the last 12 months, with AMD climbing 114% and Nvidia rising 58%.\n\nAMD, like Intel (INTC), is also contending with the global memory shortage, which could force PC makers to raise prices on laptops and desktops, impacting sales and hitting AMD’s consumer chip business.\n\nAMD is expected to report Q4 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.32 on revenue of $9.6 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus estimates. That would mark an increase from the $1.09 and $7.7 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year.\n\nWall Street is anticipating data center revenue of $4.97 billion, up 29% year over year from the $3.86 billion AMD reported in Q4 2024. The company’s client business revenue is expected to top out at $2.9 billion. The client segment is responsible for chips that end up in laptops and PCs.\n\nThe chip designer’s gaming business is projected to see revenue of $855 million, a 52% year-over-year jump from the $563 million the segment saw in 2024.\n\nAMD’s results come roughly a month after it showed off a variety of new products during CEO Lisa Su’s keynote at CES 2026 in Las Vegas.\n\nThat includes the company’s upcoming Helios rack-scale server, which Su said is the world’s best AI rack, a clear shot at Nvidia.\n\nHelios is designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s own Vera Rubin-powered NVL72 rack-scale offering. Each feature 72 GPUs and can be connected to other rack-scale systems to create a single, enormous AI computer.\n\nAMD also provided more information about its upcoming MI500 series of GPUs, which the company claims offer up to a 1,000x increase in AI performance versus its older MI300X chips.\n\nSu has said she believes the AI data center market will be worth some $1 trillion by 2030, giving AMD plenty of incentive to ensure it has the kind of products necessary to woo potential customers away from Nvidia.\n\nBut like Nvidia, AMD is seeing increased competition from some of its own customers as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft continue to roll out more of their own customer chips in their data centers.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — The seven victims of a marine disaster that devastated a storied Massachusetts fishing town included a fifth-generation fisherman, a young federal fisheries observer and a father-and-son crew duo. All died when their fishing boat, the Lily Jean, sank in waters off America’s oldest seaport.\n\nThe sinking underscored the risks long inherent in Gloucester’s fishing industry, which spans more than 400 years and was famously chronicled in “The Perfect Storm.” The names of the crew will be added to a city memorial honoring thousands of fishermen lost at sea over generations.\n\nThe 72-foot (22-meter) vessel was returning to port early Friday to repair fishing gear when it sank in frigid Atlantic waters. The U.S. Coast Guard announced Monday that it was launching a formal investigation into the sinking after suspending a search for survivors Saturday. It has not said what might have caused the sinking, though it said ice buildup from freezing ocean spray can cause a boat to capsize.\n\n“You fish in federal waters, you fish in a Gloucester boat, and you lose your life, you’re forever a Gloucester fisherman,” Gloucester fisherman Al Cottone said.\n\nCoast Guard officials identified the victims Monday as captain Accursio “Gus” Sanfilippo and crewmembers Paul Beal Sr., Paul Beal Jr., John Rousanidis, Freeman Short and Sean Therrien. Also aboard was Jada Samitt, a fisheries observer for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nOn Monday, the community was quick to push back against speculation about a possible cause, recalling Sanfilippo as someone who cared about his crew and didn't take risks.\n\nVito Giacalone, head of the Gloucester Fishing Community Preservation Fund, said such sinkings are unfortunately not out of the ordinary.\n\n“We’ve had multiple sinkings. All hands lost. No radio communication at the very last minute. Nobody alive to say, oh, no, it wasn’t that,\" he said. \"So, it’s just unfair to everyone involved with the folks that were lost feeling like someone did something wrong.”\n\n“All those guys on that boat were seasoned fishermen,” former Lily Jean crew member Gryphon Orfanos said while doing boat repairs Monday at the same dock where the Lily Jean used to tie up. “They knew how dangerous it was.”\n\nOrfanos and friend Nate Dennen attached a stainless steel memorial cross with the name “Lily Jean” to a wooden beam at the dock.\n\nDennen, a longtime friend of the boat's captain Gus, said he was a mentor who looked out for his crew.\n\n“It taught me everything I know,” Orfanos said of his more than a year working on the Lily Jean — his first offshore fishing job. “Out on the ocean, it teaches you everything. But as far as I want the word to spread, Gus was the best guy ever.”\n\nCottone said any vessel leaving port needs a Coast Guard inspection decal, which requires up-to-date safety equipment — and the fishery observer conducts a safety check before each outing.\n\n“If the observer deems the boat not to be safe or have any piece of safety equipment that’s not up to date ... that observer will shut the trip down,” he said.\n\nSanfilippo was well known in Gloucester. The Lily Jean, Sanfilippo, and his crew were featured in a 2012 episode of the History Channel show “Nor’Easter Men.” The captain is described as a fifth-generation commercial fisherman, out of Gloucester, in the Georges Bank. The crew is shown working in dangerous weather conditions for hours on end, spending as many as 10 days offshore catching haddock, lobster and flounder.\n\n“We loved each other,” Giacalone said. “He treated me like a big brother and I treated him like my younger brother. To know the tragedy of this and to know the kind of character that Gus had, he’d be mortified to know that these lives were all lost.”\n\nGiacalone said the Sanfillipo and Beal names were synonymous with local fishing going back decades. He said Sanfillipo “followed in the footsteps of his dad\" while the Beal family has built boats and a brother is also a fisherman.\n\n“Those two families are absolutely etched in centuries of these multiple generations of fishermen,” Giacalone said.\n\nCrew made of veterans and newcomers\n\nJust as Sanfillipo had years of experience, Samitt was undertaking her first job at sea as an observer. The 22-year-old was tasked with collecting data from the catch, used for making government regulations and other purposes.\n\nSamitt’s family said in a statement that she was originally from Virginia and had a deep love of Gloucester’s fishing community and \"conveyed to us how critical it was to protect the seas and fisheries.”\n\nNOAA, meanwhile, offered its condolences.\n\n“Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Jada’s family, the families of the six fishermen, the NOAA observer community, and everyone affected,” its statement said.\n\nTherrien, 44, was working his first season on a commercial fishing vessel, joining the Lily Jean after his close friend Rousanidis said the boat needed another crew member, his partner Becky Carp said. He had been on about a half-dozen trips already, she said, and appeared to be settling into the job despite complaints about the cold.\n\nTherrien, she said, was \"always up for an adventure” but took thed job mostly so he could provide for his family. The lifelong Massachusetts resident was the family's breadwinner and sought to supplement his construction work, which was scarce in the winter.\n\n“He wanted to make sure his family was safe and taken care which is why he was busting his butt,” Carp said.\n\nCarp last talked to Therrien on Tuesday before he headed out. She had wanted him to take the week off to spend time with him but he felt he needed to make money. She only learned about the sinking when alerts began popping up Friday.\n\n“You always want to hold out hope that they are found. Come Saturday morning, I kind of knew at that point that they wouldn’t find any survivors,” Carp said. “I feel like it’s a nightmare that I am going to wake up from. It's just a bad dream and everything will be OK. But unfortunately, it's not.\"\n\nWhittle reported from Scarborough, Maine.",

    "fullText": "An \"infatuated\" prison officer who had a \"substantial sexual relationship\" with an inmate where she worked has been jailed for two and a half years.\n\nCharlotte Winstanley, 27, smuggled a range of contraband material into HMP Lindholme, near Doncaster, for prisoner Jabhari Blair, 30, including a mobile phone which they used to send \"explicit photos and videos\".\n\nSheffield Crown Court was told that in one message, Winstanley, of Coronation Road, Doncaster, told Blair: \"I love my job, but I love you more.\"\n\nBlair, a former organised gang member, was jailed in 2014 for 12 and a half years.\n\nOn Monday, he was given a 13-month sentence after admitting possessing cannabis and a prohibited phone and USB stick.\n\nWinstanley admitted misconduct in public office and transmitting a photograph from inside a prison.\n\nJudge Jeremy Richardson KC, the Recorder of Sheffield, described the the case as the \"worst\" of its type he had dealt with.\n\nThe court previously heard messages uncovered between Winstanley and Blair described Mondays as \"date nights\".\n\nProsecutor Aaron Dinnes told the court that prison cameras had picked up \"intimate moments\" showing them touching and disappearing together into rooms.\n\nDinnes said one message from Blair indicated that he \"can't wait to give Miss Winstanley a beautiful baby\".\n\nRichardson told the court that in October 2020 Winstanley had become an operational support officer at HMP Lindholme, then became a prison officer and received anti-corruption training.\n\n\"Whilst working on J-Wing, you started a corrupt relationship with Blair,\" he said.\n\n\"You knew it was wrong and against all the training you'd received.\"\n\nHe said although there were \"suspicions\" about her, she \"brazened it out and continued [the] corrupt affair\".\n\nShe knew the sentence Blair was serving was for a serious crime, the court heard, and had taken a screenshot of a news article showing this.\n\nWinstanley bought him sim cards and smuggled them into prison, the judge said.\n\n\"You professed love for each other and engaged in WhatsApp and Snapchat messages,\" Richardson said, adding that many were \"explicit and unnecessary\",\n\nOne message from Winstanley read: \"I'm literally praying to have your babies\", while another stated: \"Life starts now, baby. Every sacrifice I make I do so I can be with you.\"\n\n\"It is utterly clear that you both knew that what you were doing was unlawful and corrupt,\" Richardson said.\n\nHe added that Winstanley gave Blair sensitive information about the movement of prisoners, healthcare information about other inmates and intelligence about a search scheduled to take place within his cell.\n\nThe court heard Blair told Winstanley he had used his contacts within the prison to ensure she was protected and said someone was ready to \"fight immediately if necessary\".\n\nWinstanley also became close with Blair's mother, the judge said, who was \"clearly aware of the nature of the relationship\".\n\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North\n\nOfficer 'prayed' to have inmate's babies - court\n\nPrison officer admits relationship with inmate\n\nPrison officer jailed over affair with inmate\n\nHM Courts and Tribunals Service",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA ran into exasperating fuel leaks during a make-or-break test of its new moon rocket Monday, calling into question how soon astronauts could take off for a trip around the moon.\n\nThe leaks — reminiscent of the rocket's delayed debut three years ago — sprang just a couple hours into the daylong fueling operation at Kennedy Space Center.\n\nLaunch controllers began loading the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket with super-cold hydrogen and oxygen at midday. More than 700,000 gallons (2.6 million liters) had to flow into the tanks and remain on board for several hours, mimicking the final stages of an actual countdown.\n\nBut excessive hydrogen quickly built up near the bottom of the rocket. Hydrogen loading was halted at least twice as the launch team scrambled to work around the problem using techniques developed during the previous Space Launch System countdown in 2022. That first test flight was plagued by hydrogen leaks before finally soaring without a crew.\n\nThe four astronauts assigned to the mission — three Americans and one Canadian — monitored the critical dress rehearsal from nearly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away in Houston, home to Johnson Space Center. They have been in quarantine for the past 1½ weeks, awaiting the practice countdown's outcome.\n\nMonday's fueling demo will determine when they can blast off on the first lunar voyage by a crew in more than half a century.\n\nAt best, NASA could launch commander Reid Wiseman and his crew to the moon no sooner than Sunday. The rocket must be flying by Feb. 11 or the mission will be called off until March. The space agency only has a few days in any given month to launch the rocket, and the extreme cold already has shortened February’s launch window by two days.\n\nRunning behind because of the bitter cold snap, the countdown clocks began ticking Saturday night, giving launch controllers the chance to go through all the motions and deal with any lingering rocket problems. The clocks were set to stop a half-minute before reaching zero, just before engine ignition.\n\nThe nearly 10-day mission will send the astronauts past the moon, around the mysterious far side and then straight back to Earth, with the goal of testing the capsule's life support and other vital systems. The crew will not go into lunar orbit or attempt to land.\n\nNASA last sent astronauts to the moon during the 1960s and 1970s Apollo program. The new Artemis program aims for a more sustained lunar presence, with Wiseman’s crew setting the stage for future moon landings by other astronauts.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "description": "Disney reported \"headwinds\" in international visitation to its American parks as foreign travelers continue to avoid the US.",
    "fullText": "Looks like even \"The Most Magical Place on Earth\" isn't enough to entice foreign travelers who are skipping the US.\n\nDisney is facing some \"international visitation headwinds\" at its parks in the US, which include Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California, the Walt Disney Company said in its first-quarter earnings report on Monday.\n\nDespite the slowdown in international visitors, the company reported growth in its experiences segment, with visitation at its domestic parks up 1% in the most recent quarter.\n\nHugh Johnston, Disney CFO, told analysts on a call that the company has less visibility into international visitor trends than domestic because foreign travelers tend to stay in non-Disney hotels, but that there were other indicators international visitation was down.\n\n\"As a result of that, we pivoted our marketing and sales efforts, promotional as well as marketing efforts to a more domestic audience, and we're able to keep attendance rates high from that perspective,\" he said.\n\nDisney's just the latest American company to feel the slowdown in foreigners traveling to the US.\n\nInternational visitation was down for the eighth straight month in December, according to data from the National Travel and Tourism Office. As of October, the number of international visitors to the US was down 5.5% in 2025 compared to a year prior.\n\nAmir Eylon, president and CEO of Longwoods International, a market research consultancy that specializes in the travel tourism industry, said visits from Canada especially declined, but that there were also significant declines in visits from countries like Germany, France, and India.\n\nCanadian visits to the US were down 22% year-to-date as of October compared to a year prior, according to NTTO data.\n\n\"We have an image problem right now with our Canadian neighbors to the North and, as evidenced with some other countries, we have an image problem in some of our key international feeder markets as well,\" Eylon told Business Insider.\n\nHis firm's research has found a majority of Canadians say American trade policies and political rhetoric are deterring them from visiting the US in the next 12 months. Many also say they do not feel like the US is a safe place to visit.\n\nCanadians also typically make up a significant portion of international travel to Florida, so Eylon said Disney likely isn't the only destination in the Sunshine State feeling the slowdown.\n\nTravelers seeking to avoid the US also have other options when it comes to experiencing Disney. Disneyland Paris is fully owned by the Walt Disney Company, while the company has minority ownership in the Disney resorts in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Disney has no ownership in Tokyo Disneyland, which operates under a licensing agreement.\n\nDisney also benefited from consistent demand in domestic leisure travel, with Americans continuing to prioritize travel, Eylon said.\n\nAnna Abelson, an adjunct professor at New York University's Jonathan M. Tisch Center of Hospitality, said the slowdown in international visitors to Disney underscored a broader industry shift.\n\n\"Even 'bucket list' icons are navigating significant macroeconomic volatility, ranging from currency fluctuations to shifting geopolitical sentiments,\" Abelson told Business Insider.\n\nHave a story to share about travel to the US?

    "description": "Barbara Corcoran said couples living in small apartments could make better use of the space they already have.",
    "fullText": "Barbara Corcoran, 76, swears by having separate bedrooms from her husband. She says couples should try it — even in small spaces.\n\n\"Well, they could get separate beds. They could put a wall up. They could sleep on the convertible couch,\" Corcoran told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Monday.\n\nWhile she acknowledged that the setup won't work for everyone, Corcoran said many people living in small apartments could make better use of the space they already have.\n\n\"I don't really have a solution, but there's a lot of New Yorkers who have two bedrooms and one set up as a den or TV room. I think that's a misuse,\" she said. \"When I got my second bedroom, I immediately loved my husband twice as much.\"\n\nThe \"Shark Tank\" host and her husband, retired Navy captain and FBI agent Bill Higgins, have been married since 1988.\n\nFor Corcoran, protecting her alone time is key, including in the mornings.\n\n\"I always wake up at 5 o'clock. I make myself some coﬀee, sit on my chair and daydream for an hour. I try to stay oﬀ my cellphone and I usually succeed,\" she said.\n\nDespite her busy schedule, the business mogul says she doesn't work on Mondays.\n\n\"I take Mondays oﬀ, and I always have. I will not work on a Monday. On Friday, I leave all my commands, all my notes, little Post-it Notes on everybody's machines. Or now, it's a lot of email,\" Corcoran said.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Corcoran has shared her views on sleep divorce. In a December 2024 appearance on \"The Jamie Kern Lima Show,\" Corcoran described having separate bedrooms as one of the secrets to her successful marriage.\n\n\"Well, I think there's something to be said about your own private space. Yes, I lead a very busy life. I have a huge family that I'm always entertaining. I have very sincere, active friends, and so what I need more than anything else is a respite, and my husband is not relaxing,\" Corcoran told podcast host Jamie Kern Lima.\n\nShe added that it's difficult for her to muster the energy at the end of the day to listen to him and contribute meaningfully to the conversation.\n\nMoreover, she and her husband have rules for entering each other's bedrooms. \"I have to invite him into my bedroom, and I like it that way,\" Corcoran said.\n\nMany other celebrities have also spoken about sleeping separately from their spouses. Carson Daly has called sleep divorce the \"best thing\" for his marriage, while Bette Midler has said she and her husband of over 40 years have slept apart since the start of their relationship.",

    "fullText": "XAI told workers the company won't be changing its name anytime soon, even after it announced SpaceX had acquired the company on Monday.\n\nIn a Q&A sent to employees on Monday, the company said xAI's mission remains \"unchanged\" and that its price-to-share valuation will remain the same. Workers will soon learn more about how the acquisition will impact their equity, according to the Q&A.\n\nThe joint venture is still continuing to prepare for a \"possible IPO in 2026,\" according to the memo.\n\n\"Whether it actually happens, when it happens, and at what valuation are still highly uncertain,\" it said.\n\nSpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, has reportedly been gearing up for an initial public offering that could value it at $1.5 trillion.\n\nSpaceX and xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nXAI plans to hold an all-hands in the coming days and host trainings related to the merger, the internal memo said. For now, both companies will maintain their separate branding, but the company \"will be looking at how this might change in the future,\" it said.\n\nDespite the acquisition, xAI staff will not be allowed to access internal SpaceX databases or collaborate directly with workers at the rocket ship company without direct approval, the memo said. The companies will be kept separate due to regulations that control the sharing of defense and space-related technology that could impact national security. SpaceX workers may be allowed access to xAI internal tools, it said.\n\nSpaceX and xAI CEO Elon Musk sent a memo to staff earlier on Monday announcing the acquisition. In the email, which was later shared online, he said the merger would allow the joint venture to eventually launch data centers in space.\n\nHe wrote that the deal would create \"the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world's foremost real-time information and free speech platform.\"\n\nLast year, Musk announced that xAI merged with his social media company, X.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "fullText": "Broncos' often-criticized cornerback predicted to be targeted by 3 teams in offseason trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos had one of the best defenses in the NFL in 2025 and odds are, they'll want to keep that unit together as much as possible.\n\nStarting cornerback Riley Moss had a roller-coaster season, but the fact that he led the league in defensive pass interference penalties drew the ire of many within Broncos Country. Would the team be open to moving him?\n\nMoss will be entering the final year of his rookie deal in 2026. The Broncos will have to decide whether to extend his contract or allow him to enter free agency next offseason, where they would get nothing in return if he signs a contract with another team.\n\nAlex Ballentine of Bleacher Report published an article looking at the top three trade targets for each NFL team this offseason, and he has three teams with Moss on the list.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins, Pittsburgh Steelers and San Francisco 49ers are teams that Ballentine believes could approach the Broncos regarding a trade for the 25-year-old corner. Each of those teams could use help in the secondary and could obtain a young player in a relatively cost-friendly deal.\n\nThe Broncos used their first-round selection on Jahdae Barron out of Texas last spring and they will want to get him on the field more in 2026. However, Ja'Quan McMillian has been too good in his role as the team's nickel corner spot to be taken off the field. That could leave Moss as the odd man out.\n\nTeams playing the Broncos this season routinely took shots down the field against Moss, looking to take advantage of a perceived mismatch or draw a pass interference penalty. With Pat Surtain II on the other side of the field, this is a practice that isn't going to change.\n\nThat said, despite the many flags thrown against him this season, Moss more than held his own in pass coverage and though many Broncos fans may disagree, he has been a solid cornerback for the team. The Broncos don't have to move him and unless they are blown away by an offer, they shouldn't.\n\nREAD:Latest NFL coaching hire all but confirms Broncos won't lose Vance Joseph\n\nThe team can move forward with the secondary as is and enjoy what could be an embarrassment of riches if Barron turns into the player many believe he will. Moss is a big piece of this team's defense and the Broncos shouldn't tinker with that chemistry.\n\nDenver Broncos 2025 Grades: Report card for team's free-agent signings\n\nBroncos upcoming free agent just drew a difficult line in the sand\n\nBroncos Rookie Report Card: How does the 2025 class grade out?\n\nBroncos lose coveted assistant coach to AFC rival\n\nBroncos predicted to add playmaking piece to secondary in first round of 2026 draft",

    "title": "Gasperini Reflects on Roma’s Mentality After Defeat: “This is a team that always comes off the pitch with its head held high”",
    "description": "After a tough loss to Udinese, Gasperini accentuated the positive.",
    "fullText": "Roma entered today’s Round 22 fixture looking to reclaim third place on the league table. And while a win wouldn’t have advanced the Giallorossi further up the table, a loss would have been a blow to the club’s top-four hopes. With the top six clubs separated by 14 points, week-to-week volatility at the top of the table should be expected, making every point worth its weight in gold, especially those in which Roma was the ostensible favorite.\n\nBut after 90 minutes, Roma left empty-handed following their match against mid-table Udinese. However, unlike recent defeats, this wasn’t the typical fire-15-shots-on-goal-but-come-up-empty-handed affair. No, this time, Roma was done in by two deflections: one off Donyell Malen and the other caused by Donyell Malen. Unfortunately for us, the latter was harmless while the former produced the only goal of the match, a Jurgen Ekkrlenkamp free-kick that caromed off Malen’s shoulder, giving it enough English to squirm past Mile Svilar.\n\nToss in a would-be equalizer chalked off due to an offside call, and this was your classic back-breaking defeat for Roma, which slipped to fifth place following tonight’s 1-0 defeat, two points behind fourth-place Juventus.\n\nWhile many of us would have read Roma the riot act after this defeat, Gian Piero Gasperini took a more measured approach in his post-match presser. (Transcript courtesy of the official club site. )\n\nWas there perhaps a bit of a lack of quality?\n\n“Without a doubt, it wasn’t easy. We lacked a bit of precision in the final third, and maybe a bit of luck as well, especially with the goal we conceded. But this is a team that always comes off the pitch with its head held high and finds the strength to keep improving”.\n\nToday, there were two dangerous chances. What are the reasons for this step backwards?\n\n“It was a tight game, difficult for both sides. They also had a couple of shots from a distance. When you get four or five players into the box, those become chances. I think overall we did much more”.\n\nHow satisfied are you with the transfer window?\n\n“I agree with the analysis of the match — these are difficult games, decided by moments. The transfer window is closed now, and we have these four months ahead of us. I didn’t expect to have so many difficulties in bringing in a few players in specific roles we’ve been looking for since the summer. That said, Malen has arrived, Zaragoza has arrived, and we also have very young lads who will certainly give their all”.\n\nIs there a player you would have liked to sign? A final cherry on top?\n\n“No, no. Look, dozens of names were mentioned. I’m very happy because, in a very short space of time, the opportunity to sign Malen came up and then, in the final two days, also Zaragoza. I realize the January transfer window is never easy, but that’s how it is and how it went. These two players will definitely help us. Then players like Venturino and Vaz arrived as well, but they represent the future — we can’t expect them, at this moment, to be competitive for such high objectives. The most important thing is to avoid injuries. That would be crucial, and to get Dybala, Koné and a few other players who are still out back fit. Then we’ll continue on the path we’ve followed so far, because this is a group that definitely works hard”.\n\nDo teams play too much, as Conte says?\n\n“Football inevitably leads to injuries. Muscle strains have always existed, just like sprains to the knees and ankles. Today, they may be a bit more frequent because we play twice as many matches, but if you look at the percentages, probably injuries have always been the same: subluxations, bruises, knee and ankle problems. Science has never managed to halve recovery times — when there is a muscle injury, you still need at least three weeks, just like years ago. Today, we have much more accurate diagnoses and sometimes also a bit of bad luck, which leads to players being sidelined for apparently minor issues, and that is a topic. There are clearly a lot of games being played. That’s what television and the public want, so the system goes on like this. These are the risks, effectively. However, there is nothing that proves with certainty that doing things differently would prevent injuries. It’s a statistical observation, but not an absolute certainty”.",

    "description": "Chicago reshapes its rotation and bullpen, then lands Alex Bregman, earning high marks for a transformative offseason.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Cubs were very active this offseason. A couple of months after making the National League Divisional Series, the front office knew they had to make this team better this winter.\n\nSo, the Cubs went out and improved their rotation, revamped their bullpen, and found a solid replacement for Kyle Tucker atop their lineup. Those were the three biggest needs for this team heading into the offseason.\n\nAnd the North Siders addressed all three needs.\n\nFollowing the rotation’s struggles in last year’s postseason, Chicago had to add a top-of-the-line starting pitcher in the offseason. Despite missing out on free agent pitchers like Dylan Cease and Tatsuya Imai, the Cubs pivoted to the trade market.\n\nIn the trade market, they eventually found their frontline starting pitcher. The Cubs and Miami Marlins reached a deal that sent pitcher Edward Cabrera to the Windy City in exchange for top prospect Owen Caissie and two other prospects.\n\nThe addition of Cabrera now gives the Cubs six strong rotation arms once everyone is healthy. Cabrera joins a group of Shota Imanaga, Matthew Boyd, Cade Horton, Jameson Taillon, and Justin Steele.\n\nThe bullpen will look a bit different this season, especially with Brad Keller, Drew Pomeranz, and Andrew Kittredge all gone. But the Cubs replaced those quality relievers with high-upside arms.\n\nThe team signed Phil Maton, Hoby Milner, Jacob Webb, and Hunter Harvey in free agency. Maton is coming off his best season. Milner has been a workhorse out of the bullpen in each of the past four years. Webb has finished with a sub-3.05 ERA in back-to-back seasons, and Harvey has shown his potential on the mound when healthy.\n\nThose four new additions, along with Caleb Thielbar, Daniel Palenica, and Colin Rea, make this a solid bullpen entering the 2026 season.\n\nThen, the Cubs made their biggest move of the offseason in mid-January by signing Alex Bregman to a five-year, $175 million contract. That marked the third biggest contract signed in the team’s history.\n\nBregman brings leadership and playoff experience to that Cubs clubhouse. Most importantly, he firmly replaces Tucker at the top of Chicago’s lineup. The veteran has finished with at least a 3.5 WAR in four consecutive seasons.\n\nThere’s no doubt that the Cubs made a lot of moves this winter. The highlight of their offseason was trading for Cabrera and signing Bregman to a massive contract.\n\nGiven all those moves made by the Cubs, Jim Bowden of The Athletic was a big fan of their offseason. Bowden gave the North Siders an ‘A’ offseason grade. Only the Los Angeles Dodgers (A+) had a better offseason grade.\n\nSo, it appears to have been a successful offseason for the Cubs.",

    "fullText": "On Monday evening, the BC men’s hockey team faced off against Harvard at TD Garden for the first round of the 2026 Beanpot. Not only are the two teams fighting for important bragging rights, they also are near the bubble of the NCAA tournament, so it was a very important game for both squads.\n\nHarvard controlled most of the game in its opening minutes, but when Drew Fortescue slotted in a goal just 3 minutes in, things were already leaning BC’s way. The Eagles started to take over more of the possession time as the first period progressed, and quickly culminating with two goals by James Hagens to extend BC’s lead to 3-0 only 15 minutes of game time after the opening faceoff.\n\nIn the second period, it was Harvard that made quick work of things. They scored in under 30 seconds to start the second period to steal back some momentum. But the Crimson train did not keep rolling, and the rest of the second period was dominated by the Eagles, who outshot their opponent 20-1 for the remainder of that period. Dean Letourneau tipped in a laser shot by James Hagens to bring BC’s lead back out to 4-1 with just 20 seconds remaining, which once again gave BC all of the momentum heading into the intermission.\n\nThe third period was mostly a formality, even as Harvard pressured with an empty net. They couldn’t get more than just a few shots on net, and eventually Lukas Gustafsson completely ended their night with a corner snipe in the final minutes. Boston College came away with the 5-1 victory to advance to the Beanpot’s final round against either Boston University or Northeastern on Monday February 9th",

    "description": "Kamaru Usman thinks Khamzat Chimaev likely struggles to make 185 pounds.",
    "fullText": "Kamaru Usman thinks Khamzat Chimaev likely struggles to make 185 pounds.\n\nThe UFC middleweight champion continues to call out light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira despite not having defended his belt once. Chimaev (15-0 MMA, 9-0 UFC) claimed the 185-pound title with a dominant performance against Dricus Du Plessis at UFC 319.\n\nUsman, who took Chimaev to a majority decision on short notice at UFC 294, sees Chimaev's insistence in going after Pereira (13-3 MMA, 10-2 UFC) as a sign.\n\n\"For Khamzat Chimaev to continue to call him out, I think Khamzat potentially has outgrown the weight class again to where now he's like, 'Let me go to a new division where I can make the weight and I can capture that,'\" Usman said on his \"Pound 4 Pound\" podcast with Henry Cejudo. \"There's all types of rumors and things coming out saying he's 230 pounds, 225, whatever. Khamzat is a big guy. Khamzat has always been a big guy. The fact that Khamzat was making 170 is just as ridiculous as Anthony Johnson when he was making 170.\n\n\"But Anthony Johnson, remember, was making that, moved up, fought at '85 I think maybe one time, and I think even missed weight there after moving up, then settled at 205 pounds. So, I think Khamzat Chimaev might potentially be in that same ballpark which is potentially why he's asking for 'Poatan.' And if that's the case, I understand it. Now it makes sense. If you've outgrown the weight class, it makes sense. Why kill myself to get down there when I just can't make the weight anymore.\"\n\nChimaev was open in saying that he'd rather not defend his belt against top contender Nassourdine Imavov, who is a fellow Russian fighter.\n\n\"And if I go up there and I'm able to get that title, guess what? That opens the door for another Russian in Nassourdine Imavov to get that middleweight title or potentially fight for that title,\" Usman said. \"So hey, it might be chess pieces being played here.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Kamaru Usman theorizes why Khamzat Chimaev insists on Alex Pereira",

    "description": "Despite C.J. Stroud's tough playoff exit, Nico Collins delivered a powerful message of encouragement, reminding his quarterback of his true potential and leadership.",
    "fullText": "The Houston Texans saw their 2025 season end with a rough road performance against the New England Patriots in the Divisional round of the postseason. It was the same way the two seasons prior ended, which were seen as successes. This time around, Houston would have liked to get over that hump and finally advance to the AFC Championship Game, but that didn't happen in part to a horrendous performance from the offensive side of the ball.\n\nHouston lost 28-16 to the Patriots, who will represent the AFC in Super Bowl LX. This marks the second season in a row the Texans have fallen to the eventual AFC Champion, which is nothing to scoff at. The Texans were in the game with the Patriots for most of the contest, but turnovers and offensive inefficiency made it hard to win.\n\nThe weather conditions in the game were difficult to play in, but that does not excuse the offense's complete sloppiness. Quarterback C.J. Stroud played what was probably the worst game of his career as he threw four interceptions and completed well under 50 percent of his passes. It was a rough way to end his third season in the league, especially in what could be seen as a contract year.\n\nStroud was out there in New England without his top offensive weapon in wide receiver Nico Collins. The star wideout suffered a concussion during the Wild Card round against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and he did not have enough time to clear the league's concussion protocol.\n\nDespite not being out there for his team's last game, Collins had a message for Stroud after the tough performance, which he shared during a media scrum with Aaron Wilson, \"Yeah, no doubt man, just keep your head up. You know what I'm saying? It's not the way we want to end; our goal was to go to the Super Bowl. You know, things happen. Just keep being you, brother, don't let this one game define who you are. We all know who you are. Keep being a star, keep being the leader you are, keep being the light in the room. Dude is a baller man.\"\n\nStroud is going to have a long offseason, as the end of the 2025 campaign will likely stick with him. He should have a chip on his shoulder heading into 2026, but he will have plenty of opportunities to make up for his poor postseason performance.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United supporters made their feelings known about the club’s ownership situation once again ahead of the match against Fulham at Old Trafford.\n\nThe on-pitch focus remained on the game itself, which was settled by a Benjamin Sesko injury-time winner. The mood around the stadium, however, was shaped by protests and marches referenced in the latest episode of Talk of the Devils.\n\nAccording to Talk of the Devils, fans gathered before kick-off to voice their frustration at the Glazer family’s long-standing control of the club.\n\nThe podcast also noted that INEOS – now controlling United’s football operations – attracted criticism from some supporters as well.\n\nFurthermore, The Athletic’s United show described the protests as a familiar part of the matchday landscape. They also explained that anti-ownership messaging remains prominent.\n\nIn addition, the tone reflected an atmosphere where some fans feel their concerns have not been answered by recent changes behind the scenes.\n\nThis implies that anger is no longer aimed at one group alone.\n\nOwnership narratives can influence the wider conversation around recruitment, long-term planning and trust in decision-makers – not just one single fixture.\n\nThe uproar around the ground, therefore, shapes how matchdays are experienced. Essentially, supporters believe they have been forced to repeat the same messages for years.\n\nTalk of the Devils’ mention of continued demonstrations is a timely reminder that protests have become a recurring theme in United coverage. This is evidently not a one-off event.\n\nIn the final analysis, the podcast’s observation points to a question United’s hierarchy cannot ignore: how quickly can confidence be rebuilt while the same ownership arguments remain unresolved?",

    "description": "The Spanish figure skater Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaté faces a last-minute scramble to redesign his Olympic short program after a copyright dispute blocked him from using music from the Minions franchise just days before competition begins at the Milano Cortina Winter Games.  The six-time Spanish national champion from Barcelona, who is set to make his Olympic debut in the men’s singles event, said he learned late last week that the routine he has performed throughout the 2025-26 season would not be cleared for Olympic use.

    "fullText": "The Spanish figure skater Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaté faces a last-minute scramble to redesign his Olympic short program after a copyright dispute blocked him from using music from the Minions franchise just days before competition begins at the Milano Cortina Winter Games.\n\nThe six-time Spanish national champion from Barcelona, who is set to make his Olympic debut in the men’s singles event, said he learned late last week that the routine he has performed throughout the 2025-26 season would not be cleared for Olympic use. Guarino Sabaté said he had submitted the music through the International Skating Union’s recommended rights-clearance process months ago and had competed with the program without issue during the season, including at last month’s European championships in Sheffield.\n\nThe ruling means the 26-year-old must now adapt or replace choreography he has refined for months, a daunting task in a sport where musical timing and muscle memory are inseparable.\n\n“Finding this out so close to the biggest competition of my life was incredibly disappointing,” Guarino Sabaté said in a social media post. “Nevertheless, I will face this challenge head-on and do everything I can to make the best of the situation.”\n\nThe routine, built around music from the popular animated film franchise, had become a signature for the Spanish skater. He regularly performed wearing a yellow shirt and blue overalls reminiscent of the film characters, leaning into a playful, crowd-friendly style he said was designed to show that men’s figure skating can balance technical difficulty with humor and personality.\n\nRights to the Minions property are controlled by Illumination and parent studio Universal Pictures. It was not immediately clear which specific licensing hurdle ultimately blocked Olympic clearance, but music licensing in figure skating has grown increasingly labyrinthine in recent years, particularly as the sport has shifted toward contemporary popular music.\n\nAt last year’s world championships in Boston, the ISU director-general, Colin Smith, described the situation to the Guardian as a structural problem in the music business rather than something skating can easily solve on its own.\n\n“It’s a complex issue, frankly, because the music industry has no common clearance platform,” Smith said. “There are multiple buckets of rights, and within those buckets the clearance process isn’t done on a single platform. Tracking tools have improved, but the facilitated process just isn’t there.”\n\nSmith, who previously oversaw Fifa World Cup tournament operations as chief tournaments and events officer and chief operating officer from 2015 to 2023, said he had held direct discussions with major rights-holders about building something more workable, arguing that the sport’s global profile should make cooperation attractive.\n\n“I’ve had direct conversations with one of the big publishing and music companies, and they fully agree it’s a strange situation that there isn’t a facilitated process – and they’re determined to help us find one,” he said. “What we hear time and time again is that figure skating is so special, and they actually want the music heard with figure skating. So the fact there’s a rights-clearance process in the way needs to be addressed. It’s a topic we’re addressing, and we’re trying to find a rational solution.”\n\nThe controversy also fits into a broader pattern across the sport, where even elite Olympic athletes have found their music choices subject to late-stage legal or financial complications.\n\nThe Canadian ice dancers Marie-Jade Lauriault and Romain Le Gac learned late last year that two Prince songs planned for their 1990s-themed rhythm dance could not be cleared for Olympic use, despite being approved for use during the rest of the season. The pair had secured their Olympic place with a podium finish at Canadian nationals but were forced to rework their program for the Games.\n\nHigh-profile disputes have surfaced even before that. At the Beijing Olympics in 2022, the American pairs champions Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier were hit with a copyright lawsuit tied to their use of a cover version of House of the Rising Sun. The case was later settled privately for an undisclosed sum understood by the Guardian to be around $1.4m (£1.02m), but the episode highlighted the legal and financial risks tied to music selection at the sport’s highest level. Knierim later described the dispute as casting a “bittersweet” shadow over the performance.\n\nThe case also exposed how little many athletes understood about music licensing requirements. For decades, skaters largely relied on federations and event organizers to manage music use, but the lawsuit underscored how individual athletes could still be drawn into copyright disputes. Rights complications have also affected how artistic sports are broadcast and archived, with some competitions unavailable on replay platforms because music licenses do not extend to long-term streaming.\n\nEven outside Olympic seasons, clearance costs can derail programs. The Canadian pairs skaters Deanna Stellato-Dudek and Maxime Deschamps said they abandoned plans to use a cover of a Phil Collins track after being quoted a licensing fee in the tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nTaken together, the cases reflect how music rights – once a secondary consideration in figure skating – have become a logistical and financial challenge athletes must navigate alongside training and competition.\n\nSmith said skating is not alone in facing those pressures, and suggested a broader, cross-sport approach may be necessary, involving Olympic organizers and other music-driven judged disciplines.\n\n“Absolutely, it’s not just figure skating,” he said when asked whether the ISU could coordinate with sports such as gymnastics, artistic swimming and others that face similar issues. “We are one of the largest in terms of the Winter Olympics, and we are working with the IOC as well, together with the music industry, to find a solution.”\n\nSmith added that the ISU was pursuing what he called a “multi-pronged approach”, including work with an existing platform that handles rights issues across other sports.\n\n“We’re really trying to find a rational, practical solution,” he said.\n\nGuarino Sabaté said he followed required procedures, including submitting his music through the ClicknClear licensing system during the summer. The company has said generally that Olympic participants must secure all necessary authorizations before using music in competition, but it does not comment on individual cases.\n\nThe ISU confirmed it is monitoring Guarino Sabaté’s situation but declined to provide details about the specific dispute.\n\n“The ISU is aware of this situation,” the governing body said on Monday in a statement to the Guardian. “As soon as we have more details on this specific case, we will share them as appropriate. Copyright clearances can represent a challenge for all artistic sports. While the ISU does not have a contractual relationship with ClicknClear, we continue to work collaboratively with rights clearance stakeholders to ensure that thrilling performances can be accompanied by stirring music.”\n\nThe timing leaves Guarino Sabaté with limited options. Skaters typically spend months building choreography that matches specific musical phrasing and emotional beats. Switching music days before competition often means simplifying elements, adjusting step sequences or reverting to older programs.\n\nOne potential fallback could involve returning to music he used in previous seasons, though even that carries complications if similar artists or tracks are already tied to other programs or require new clearance.\n\nThe men’s singles event is scheduled to begin on 10 February at the Milano Ice Skating Arena, leaving little time for rehearsal under competition conditions.\n\nDespite the setback, Guarino Sabaté said he intends to compete regardless of the final music choice, thanking fans for supporting the program throughout the season.\n\n“I promise to step on the ice with everything I have and deliver programs that both you and I can be proud of,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Following an electric 2025 season that saw him hoist both the national championship and the Heisman trophy as an Indiana Hoosier, Fernando Mendoza now finds himself as the runaway favorite to be the first overall pick of the 2026 NFL Draft. That means that professional scouts and coaching staff alike will now be assessing not just his athleticism, but his attention to detail, pattern recognition, general recall, and the overall state of his mental capacities.\n\nThere’s a lot that goes into studying and understanding an NFL playbook, but according to one of Mendoza’s former classmates, the Las Vegas Raiders are going to love what they see in Mendoza when they finally get to interview him and quiz him.\n\nA former UC Berkeley student, claiming to have shared a contracts law class with the future first-overall draft pick during his time at the university, suggested that the professor of their class was notorious for giving student athletes, specifically football players, a hard time. “If you are a football player at Cal, there is, unfortunately, a stereotype,” she noted.\n\n“The professor would ask a law question and then ask one of the football players like, ‘Why is this, this?’ or ‘Why is this that?’ Fernando always knew his shit. Like, he would shut up the professor because he would be so impressed that he knew what was going on, and mind you, this is a law class at Berkeley.”\n\nSuffice to say, Mendoza’s competitiveness extends well beyond the football field, and he wasn’t going to be shown up by some uppity law professor from the West Coast. Although the fan did also suggest that the instructor’s confrontations with student athletes were never hostile and predominantly friendly.\n\n“The professor would always tease football players and most of the football players would tease him back, and it would just be some kind of banter.” she recalled. Nevertheless, that kind of attention to detail and willingness to understand the finer points of any subject is exactly what head coaches and coordinators will be looking for in Mendoza’s upcoming interviews.\n\nThrow in the fact that the 22-year-old has one of the most positive attitudes of any prospect in recent memory, and it’s safe to say that this will be a slam dunk for the Raiders on night one of this year’s draft. “Even though he was being teased by the professor, he would just be smiling. He would answer whenever he was asked. He was such a genuine, humble guy.”\n\nMuch has been made of Mendoza’s squeaky clean image, but as more personal testimonies, like this one, begin to come to the forefront, it becomes readily apparent that he is in fact as nice as everyone says he is, and that will certainly go long way in securing him a lengthy career in the National Football League.\n\nThe post “Fernando Mendoza Used to Regularly Stump His Own Law Professor”: Berkeley Law Student Puts Insane Allegations Against Heisman Winner appeared first on The SportsRush.",

However, in 2024, Betts was forced to cover in the infield, moving to second base and moonlighting as a shortstop.\n\nBetts did not play up to his usual defensive standard despite having a good arm and experience fielding ground balls, leading him to move back to the outfield for the close of the season once others got healthy.\n\nEver the player looking for a new challenge, the former Red Sox player spent the 2024 offseason working on his fielding to play shortstop full-time.\n\nHe delivered a standout performance in 2025, becoming a Gold Glove finalist, cutting down on his mistakes, and making highlight plays, especially during the postseason.\n\nThe biggest barrier preventing older players from playing shortstop is the loss of athleticism that comes with age.\n\nIt is rare to see a player in their mid-to-late 30s still playing shortstop, though Betts wants to buck the trend.\n\nHe seems to do a good job of maintaining his body and retaining his athleticism, though Father Time remains undefeated, and he could suffer an injury or a natural decline that limits his range to get ground balls.\n\nRealistically, if he wants to stay in the infield, Betts could end up moving over to second base, where he also played.\n\nEven if he does not stay at shortstop for the rest of his career, Betts has already achieved a special feat, moving to shortstop in his 30s and thriving.\n\n“To go out there and play Gold Glove right field for years,” manager Dave Roberts said back in October. “And to be in the Gold Glove conversation this year, rightfully so, to playing the biggest of games, biggest of stages — it’s just never been done. It takes a special brain and talent to do it.”",

    "description": "Righty pitcher is low-key the key piece of the Jordan Hicks trade",
    "fullText": "Rejoice! It’s February! That means baseball will be back before the month is over, and I’ll finally write about something besides “Hey, look at this young arm!”\n\nUnfortunately, Spring Training is still weeks away. Respite still eludes you, South Side Sox stan.  The Pale Hose have another arm you haven’t heard of, Daniel Sandlin, and I’m going to tell you all about him. (At least he’ll stick around for longer than Ryan Rolison.\n\nThe trade represents a lateral move for Sandlin’s organization ranking: FanGraphs has Sandlin as the ninth best prospect in the White Sox system, which was just about the consensus for him with the Red Sox. His big-ticket trait is velocity: at 6’4’’ and 215 pounds, Sandlin was topping out at 99.9 mph in September. The steady velocity – he sits around 96mph – has kept the door open for Sandlin to start in the majors, despite being transitioned into the bullpen at Triple A this past season. In the video below, a June 21 Double-A start, you can see how easily Sandlin can overpower an opposing lineup when he’s locating his fastball at the top of the zone:\n\nFanGraphs also has good things to say about Sandlin’s cutter and slider, calling both pitches “nasty and fairly distinct from one another.” A sinker/sweeper combo rounds out his standard five-pitch mix, although he has a curveball he’ll mix in on occasion. Sandlin also threw a changeup last year. No, literally. He threw one changeup:\n\nHowever, I’d wager the remainder of Luis Robert Jr.‘s contract that Sandlin is going to be throwing a lot more changeups … what’s that? Apologies, dear reader, but I’m now being told all that money actually has been spent? No kidding? Huh. Well then, I guess I’d wager the remainder of Andrew Benintendi’s contract? Regardless, if Sandlin’s going to win a spot in the White Sox rotation, he’ll need to get comfortable with a changeup, and quick.\n\nAt this point in time, Sandlin’s has a two-part plan for approaching lefthanders. The first part is to throw the ball, and the second part is to pray:\n\n2025 Splits (Combined Double-A and Triple-A)\nvs. Righties: .225 BA, .343 SLG, .649 OPS, .289 BABIP\nvs. Lefties: .285 BA, .430 SLG, .772 OPS, .358 BABIP\n\nBack to FanGraphs, who came through in the clutch with an updated 2026 report today: “[Sandlin] still doesn’t have a great offspeed pitch with which to attack lefties … [he] peppers the top of the zone with cutters and sliders before elevating his fastball with two strikes.”\n\nIf you’re throwing your breaking pitches up in the zone to get ahead against opposite-side hitters, it doesn’t take much imagination to picture what could happen if that slider hangs just a little, or that cutter comes out a little flat, or even if he just misses his spot a couple inches low. The French refer to it as “Bang City.”\n\nIf you’ve read a single thing I’ve published on this site before — not a guarantee, I realize! — you already know what I’m going to say, and you’re probably pissed off that you’ve read 500 words just to realize this is yet another article about the kick changeup and how I think it’s a magical pitch that fixes everybody. But I’m not even the first to bring it up this time!\n\n“The White Sox have had recent success coaxing better changeups out of pitchers with naturally-good breaking balls,” FanGraphs concludes in their prospect report, “and perhaps they’ll be able to do that with Sandlin.”\n\nAnd I’d say the evidence is there! Sandlin has a very strong supinator profile. His Achilles’ heel, for him and many supinators, is a lack of arm-side options against opposite-handed hitters.\n\nTo flatten out his pitching splits, Sandlin’s going to need something. This is the magic of the kick change: no unfamiliar arm mechanics or discomfort. The platonic ideal of the kick change isn’t just its effectiveness, but how quickly somebody can pick it up and add it to their arsenal. For Sandlin, it is also the difference between a major league starter versus a middle reliever.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAndrew Wiggins has received interest from several organizations this trade season.\n\nThe athletic 6-foot-7 wing has the championship experience and skill set that contending franchises are looking for. The Los Angeles Lakers are a team that could use Wiggins’ services, but a recent trade report suggests a trade may not be in the cards for the Luka Doncic-led organization.\n\n“Elsewhere in the Western Conference, the Lakers are now pressed for time to find a key wing upgrade before the trade deadline, now that Keon Ellis and De'Andre Hunter are off the table,” ClutchPoints’ Brett Siegel wrote Monday. “Where do the Lakers go from here with all of their expiring salaries?”\n\n“Despite continued interest in Andrew Wiggins, the (Miami) Heat don't appear to have interest in anything the Lakers have offered.”\n\nWiggins is among the best options left on the table for the Lakers. The former Golden State Warriors forward can create his own offense, play well off the ball, and knock down triples at an above-average rate. The Kansas product is averaging 15.6 points, 2.9 assists, and 4.9 rebounds per game with the Heat this season, shooting 46.8% from the field and 38.4% from three-point land.\n\nUnfortunately, Siegel’s report indicates that the Lakers haven’t done their part to convince the Heat to partner with them this season, making it doubtful they land Wiggins by Thursday.\n\nMore NBA: Lakers predicted to acquire $73.8 million six-time All-Star in Dalton Knecht-centered trade",

    "description": "The Red Sox made a creative trade and watched Eugenio Suárez sign an affordable deal with Cincinnati on Sunday. What does it all mean?",
    "fullText": "A very slow 10-day period for the Red Sox ended Sunday with a trade — Boston sent Jordan Hicks and David Sandlin to the White Sox in a salary dump that netted pitching prospect Gage Ziehl — and the news that Eugenio Suárez, perhaps the best position player left on the free agent market and a potential Red Sox fit, had signed a one-year, $15 million deal with the Reds. Here are five quick thoughts on the developments and the Red Sox, who are exactly one week away from spring training opening in Fort Myers next Monday.\n\n1) The Red Sox are working backwards to solve their financial puzzle, and the work likely isn’t done.\n\nWhen the Red Sox signed Ranger Suárez to a five-year, $130 million contract last month, their projected competitive balance tax (CBT) threshold ballooned to a number around $269 million, which is far more than the first threshold number ($244 million) and even exceeded the second threshold at $264 million. It’s clear Boston wants to enter the season short of that second threshold and potentially lower, and there are other pathways to (smartly) shedding money.\n\nMoving Masataka Yoshida (and his $18 million CBT) hit would likely require the Red Sox to take on a good portion of his deal while attaching a prospect like they did with Sandlin and Hicks. A much easier path, however, would involve moving Patrick Sandoval, who will certainly draw interest from clubs if healthy. Sandoval is a bit of an unknown after missing all of 2025 as he rehabbed from Tommy John surgery but will enter camp on the outside looking in when it comes to the rotation competition. A couple of strong spring starts could force a pitching-needy club to offer a prospect while taking on Sandoval’s entire salary, which comes with a $9.125 million CBT hit in 2026. The Red Sox have 6-7 starters ahead of Sandoval and would likely be willing to move him.\n\nMoving an outfielder like Jarren Duran or Ceddanne Rafaela in a bigger trade is another, albeit much less likely, way the Red Sox could move some money around. A Sandoval trade would get the club in the range of $252 million, making further additions (either in spring training or at the trade deadline) more palatable.\n\n2) The trade unclogged the roster pipes, too.\n\nThe main objective of the trade with Chicago was obviously salary-related, as clearing $8 million of Hicks’ money (and getting relief against the CBT) threshold was smart business. But a secondary objective was also accomplished by Breslow, who cleared two 40-man roster spots with the move.\n\nThe Red Sox have strengthened the back end of their roster in recent months, leading to far fewer easy calls when it comes to who gets cut loose when a spot is needed. That Payton Tolle and Connelly Early’s big league debuts came a season earlier than expected locked up two spots that would have otherwise been open all winter. It was telling that Breslow had to trade utility man Tristan Gray, a potential contributor who was acquired in November, to free up a spot when Ranger Suárez’s contract became official on Jan. 21. Further additions would have required further tough calls.\n\nNow, though, the Sox have two open spots and will gain a third early in spring training when Tanner Houck (recovering from Tommy John surgery) can be moved to the 60-day injured list. Moving Hicks also allows an easier path for other promising arms to contribute early in the season. Zack Kelly’s path to a roster spot is now clear and Rule 5 addition Ryan Watson is no longer blocked by Hicks, who is out of minor league options. The Red Sox also have room to make a free agent addition to the bullpen as well.\n\n3) Boston opted for Ziehl over another package that would help the big league bullpen.\n\nAccording to sources, the Red Sox and White Sox had serious discussions about a different-looking trade that would have sent Hicks and Sandlin to Chicago for Jordan Leasure, a 27-year-old reliever who had a 3.92 ERA (and 81 strikeouts) in 64 ⅓ innings in the big leagues last year. The Riverview, Florida product would have fit the Red Sox as a right-handed middle-relief option, joining Kelly, Watson and Greg Weissert as candidates in that role.\n\nThe Red Sox would have had to kick in more of Hicks’ salary to obtain Leasure, who has more value than Ziehl, who has barely pitched above High-A. In the end, the sides opted to do the deal that involved more cash and a lesser player headed to the Red Sox.\n\n4) Craig Breslow wasn’t kidding when he said defense was important.\n\nIn his last meeting with reporters, Breslow was clear that he was prioritizing infield defense when assessing his next move. That bore out with the club’s decision to not meaningfully pursue Eugenio Suárez before he signed with Cincinnati.\n\nIn December, a source noted that the Red Sox had interest in Suárez, but only as a clear fallback option should Alex Bregman and some other targets not land in Boston. As time went on, agents around the industry speculated that Suárez’s market had not developed as expected and that he could be a candidate for a one-year deal. That’s all he got in Cincinnati, signing a $15 million guarantee that every club — including the Red Sox — could have done.\n\nStill, even as other options fell off the board and Suárez’s market collapsed, the Red Sox didn’t meaningfully engage. As MassLive reported Sunday, they never made an offer. It wasn’t about the value or negotiations not lining up. It was simply about the Red Sox not wanting a player who, despite slugging 49 homers last season, strikes out at a high clip and is a defensive liability at third base.\n\nThe Red Sox’ potential trade targets on the infield market are well-known with Houston’s Isaac Paredes and Chicago’s Nico Hoerner and Matt Shaw having been heavily discussed on the rumor mill. But what about Ramón Urías? The longtime Oriole remains unsigned as a defense-first, versatile option who would fit the roster well, even in a limited role.\n\nUrías regressed with the bat last year to the tune of a .675 OPS in 112 games split between Baltimore and Houston but was still a capable defender at both third base (78 games) and second (26 games). He also has historically hit very well at Fenway, logging a .326 average and an .881 OPS in 28 games in Boston. At this point, Urías can likely be had on a reasonable one-year deal. A source said the Red Sox have checked in on his availability but have shown only lukewarm interest to this point in the winter.\n\nThe Red Sox, even with Marcelo Mayer, Romy Gonzalez, David Hamilton and Nick Sogard in the mix as internal options for second base and third base, have begun to explore free agent alternatives, as evidenced by their pursuit of Dylan Moore, who they were “very involved” on before he signed with the Phillies, according to a source. Luis Rengifo is another available infielder.\n\nRed Sox agree to minor league deal with veteran RHP (report)\n\nAnother potential Red Sox trade target lands elsewhere (report)\n\nEx-MLB GM gives Red Sox strong offseason grade, still questions infield\n\nRumored Red Sox target signs one-year deal with Reds — and Boston didn’t make an offer\n\nDavid Sandlin says goodbye to Red Sox after trade to Chicago",

He finished his collegiate run with 65 catches for 830 yards and 15 touchdowns. He earned Second-Team All-Big Ten honors and served a key role in Indiana's national championship run.\n\nIt's easy to forget that the Patriots are still a rebuilding team after their magical Super Bowl run this season.

    "fullText": "The Red Sox are continuing to see potential infield additions come off the board, and MassLive’s Chris Cotillo has thrown a new name to watch into the mix.\n\n“The Red Sox have checked in throughout the winter on Ramón Urías but haven’t showed more than lukewarm interest,” Cotillo wrote on X on Monday.\n\nUrías was traded from the Baltimore Orioles to the Houston Astros last summer. He is under club control for one more season and can play third base, second base and shortstop. He is a versatile defender and won a Gold Glove in 2022 at third base.\n\nUrías is not the only Houston Astros infielder the Red Sox have been linked to. Isaac Paredes has been a rumored target as well. Urías had just a .675 OPS last season, hitting 11 home runs for the second consecutive season. Cotillo wrote more about Urías in a story published before his report.\n\n“Urías regressed with the bat last year to the tune of a .675 OPS in 112 games split between Baltimore and Houston but was still a capable defender at both third base (78 games) and second (26 games),” Cotillo wrote. “He also has historically hit very well at Fenway, logging a .326 average and an .881 OPS in 28 games in Boston. At this point, Urías can likely be had on a reasonable one-year deal.”\n\nHe was non-tendered by the Astros after the season. He could be a solid addition for the Red Sox. With Eugenio Suárez and Brendan Donovan off the board, a player like Urías could be the best option.\n\nRed Sox Reportedly Sign Veteran Pitcher With 2.41 Career ERA",

    "description": "The News Tribune asks Seahawks vice chair Bert Kolde after NFL commissioner’s press conference about reports the team will be sold soon.",
    "fullText": "The sale of the Seahawks — the issue the team would rather not have the week of their first Super Bowl appearance in more than decade — isn’t going away.\n\n“We put out our statement. So I can’t say anything beyond that,” Seahawks vice chair Bert Kolde said Monday, after he and his wife sat in the front row representing the NFC champions at commissioner Roger Goodell’s annual state-of-the-NFL press conference at the Super Bowl.\n\nThe statement Kolde referred to Monday at the San Jose Convention Center was the Paul G. Allen Estate’s assertion Friday “the team is not for sale” — with “is” doing a ton of lifting there. The estate’s statement also reiterated the estate that owns the Seahawks dictates the team must be sold. Most of the proceeds will go to Allen’s many philanthropic interests before his death in 2018. The Paul G. Allen Estate issued that statement through a spokesman Friday. That was soon after ESPN and The Wall Street Journal reported the Seahawks would be sold soon after this season ended with Seattle’s Super Bowl.\n\nMoments before Kolde spoke Monday, Goodell said in his press conference a report this past weekend by The Wall Street Journal that the league fined the Seahawks $5 million for continuing to violate NFL rules by having an estate and not an individual person or group of people own a club is not true.\n\nThis much we know: The Seahawks’ sale is going to happen. It’s not a matter of if, not when.\n\nAnd signs are pointing to the when being in the months following the Super Bowl.\n\nKolde said he, chair Jody Allen, other leaders from Vulcan, LLC, the company Paul Allen formed to manage the Seahawks have studied the recent sales of North American sports franchises. That includes the NBA’s Boston Celtics (for $6 billion), the Los Angeles Lakers (a record $10 billion) and the most recent sale of an NFL team. That was the Washington Commanders, for $6.05 billion in 2023.\n\n“We study all teams, all the sales. That’s something we keep abreast of,” the Seahawks’ vice chair said.\n\nThe Allen Estate put the Portland Trail Blazers up on sale in September. Kolde said Monday he expects that sale to be final this spring. It’s about to go to a group led by the owner of the National Hockey League’s Carolina Hurricanes for a reported $4.25 billion.\n\n“Still tracking to close in a couple months,” Kolde said.\n\nWith the Blazers sale closing, it makes sense (and billions of dollars) that the Seahawks are next.\n\nThe Seahawks are most likely going to set an NFL record for a franchise sale, perhaps in excess of $8 billion.\n\nThe News Tribune asked Kolde off the stage following Goodell’s 45-minute press conference Monday if the Seahawks already have local buyers on the horizon to sell to.\n\n“Nothing to add,” Kolde said to that.\n\nIs there is anything in the estate’s instructions for the sale of the Seahawks that assures the franchise remains in Seattle? A stipulation it must be sold to local owners? A contract from whoever buys the team that binds them to keep the Seahawks in the city?\n\nTo that, Kolde referenced the team’s 30-year lease with Lumen Field runs through 2031. He did not comment on the 20-year option the team has with the stadium and the local government district that runs it beyond 2031.\n\n“l’m not going to get into all of that, all of that detail,” Kolde said.\n\n“But the Allen family put a lot into saving the Seahawks, keeping them in Seattle (by Paul Allen buying the team in 1997 from Ken Behring, who tried to move the team to Southern California). We campaigned around the state (for the new stadium that opened in 2002 and replaced the Kingdome). The voters agreed with us. And we put together Lumen Field.\n\n“And we delivered on everything we promised in that campaign. The team. The stadium. Soccer balls were on our posters. The Sounders launched as the most successful MLS team. The World Cup is coming; we talked about World Cup back in that campaign.\n\n“So we’ve been all about sports in the community for decades. So the lease has six years or so...”\n\nLeague owners want the Seahawks to sell sooner than later, so they can learn the latest relative valuations of their teams in this post-COVID world with the league’s new media rights deals that provides $11 billion in annual revenue to the NFL. The league signed that a couple years ago.\n\nAsked if the NFL was pressuring the team to sell soon, Kolde said: “No comment on that.”\n\nKolde said Jody Allen will be at Super Bowl 60 Sunday against the New England Patriots at Levi’s Stadium in nearby Santa Clara.",

    "fullText": "Celtic have signed Austria striker Junior Adamu from Bundesliga club Freiburg, Brentford centre-half Benjamin Arthur and Lorient winger Joel Mvuka, all on loan to the end of the season.\n\nThe Scottish champions, who have sent fellow striker Johnny Kenny on loan to Bolton Wanderers and allowed centre-half Stephen Welsh to return to Motherwell, have an option to buy Adamu and Mvuka in the summer.\n\nBorn in Nigeria, 24-year-old Adamu came through the RB Salzburg academy and scored 23 goals in 84 appearances for the Austrian side.\n\nAdamu, who has nine caps for Austria, moved to Freiburg in 2023 and has found the back of the net seven times in 67 matches.\n\nHe has made 18 appearances this season, 14 of them starts, scoring once.\n\nHowever, he has only featured once as a substitute in Freiburg's past 10 Bundesliga games for the side sitting seventh in the German top flight, although he did start last week's 1-0 Europa League defeat away to Lille.\n\nWho has your Premiership club brought in & let go? - January 2026\n\nBut Celtic manager Martin O'Neill was attracted to his \"experience of high-level football\".\n\n\"He has also been involved in European competition, so we are bringing in a talented, experienced, international forward to really enhance our attacking options,\" he told Celtic's website.\n\nAdamu is eyeing a league and Scottish Cup double while scoring \"a lot of goals\" and wants \"to improve as a player\".\n\nAsked what kind of player Celtic fans will see in action, he added: \"I'm dangerous in the box and hungry for goals. That's what the manager sees in me and I want to show that on the pitch.\"\n\nThe announcement of 22-year-old Mvuka's signing came eight minutes after the closure of the January transfer window.\n\nHowever, the Norwegian is no stranger to the Scottish champions, having played against them in the Conference League in 2022 for Bodo/Glimt, where he was a team-mate of Celtic winger Sebastian Tounekti.\n\nHe joined Lorient in 2023 but has made only five starts and 10 substitute appearances for the side sitting ninth in Ligue 1.\n\n\"Joel is a talented player who has a very good level of experience achieved at some really good clubs,\" O'Neill said.\n\n\"He will give the squad another option, he is very quick, able to play on both wings\"\n\nThe 20-year-old Arthur has made just three appearances for Premier League outfit Brentford, including two starts in his season's League Cup.\n\nHowever, O'Neill thinks the England youth international is \"an excellent player, with real attributes, good height, strength and speed\".\n\nHis arrival allows Stephen Welsh to return to Motherwell on loan after being recalled as cover during January.\n\nMeanwhile, Kenny heads for the side sitting third in League One having failed to become a first pick since O'Neill's return to Celtic.\n\nThe 22-year-old Irishman, signed in January 2024 from Shamrock Rovers, has played 22 times for Celtic this season, 12 of them starts, and scoring six times.\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "description": "Bad Bunny will perform during the halftime show at Super Bowl LX on Sunday afternoon in Santa Clara.",
    "fullText": "NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, despite significant criticism from plenty in Washington, is all for Bad Bunny’s halftime show this week at Super Bowl LX.\n\nGoodell was asked directly about Bad Bunny on Monday when he met with reporters ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl at Levi’s Stadium, and said plainly that he believes the Puerto Rican superstar will be able to “unite people” in the way that Super Bowl halftime performers of the past have.\n\n“Listen, Bad Bunny is, and I think that was demonstrated last night [at the Grammys], one of the great artists in the world. That’s one of the reasons we chose him,” Goodell said.\n\n“But the other reason is he understood the platform he was on, and that this platform is used to unite people and to be able to bring people together with their creativity, with their talent, and to be able to use this moment to do that. I think artists in the past have done that, I think Bad Bunny understands that, and I think he’ll have a great performance.”\n\nRoger Goodell is asked whether or not there will be any ICE enforcement operations at the Super Bowl and also addresses Bad Bunny's remarks about ICE at last night's Grammy Awards. pic.twitter.com/FxGcbiIbZP\n\n— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) February 2, 2026\n\nBad Bunny was the top global artist on Spotify for the fourth time in his career last year, and he won two Grammy awards on Sunday night, including Album of the Year, for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos.”\n\nQuickly after Bad Bunny was announced as the Super Bowl halftime show, plenty in President Donald Trump’s administration criticized the decision. Trump said he had “never heard of him,” and Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Mike Johnson (R-La.) called it a “terrible decision” in October. Johnson, however, then suggested that 83-year-old Lee Greenwood, famous for “God Bless the USA” do the show instead.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would be “all over” the Super Bowl.\n\n“They suck, and we’ll win,” Noem told right-wing podcast host Benny Johnson about her message to the NFL, via ESPN. “They won’t be able to sleep at night because they don’t know what they believe. And they’re so weak, we’ll fix it.”\n\nBad Bunny has been extremely outspoken about Trump and ICE. He mocked Trump in his “NEVAYoL” music video, where he had a Trump-like voice apologizing to immigrants, and he even declined to hold any concerts on his current world tour in the United States because “f***ing ICE could be outside [the concert].” He called out ICE after winning a Grammy award during an acceptance speech on Sunday night, too.\n\n“Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ICE out,” he said. “We’re not savages, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens, we are humans and we are Americans ... The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that’s more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.”\n\nBad Bunny says \"ICE OUT\" at the #Grammys and receives a massive standing ovation:\n\n\"We are not savage, we are not animals, we are not aliens, we are humans and we are Americans. The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love.… pic.twitter.com/IFzvguqdCR\n\n— Variety (@Variety) February 2, 2026\n\nBad Bunny is Puerto Rican, which makes him an American citizen.\n\nThe Bay Area Host Committee told local officials on Monday that there are no planned ICE operations for Super Bowl LX, according to The Athletic. Goodell was asked about that directly on Monday, but he sidestepped the ICE of it all. Security preparations, he said, are moving forward as normal.\n\n“Security is obviously one of the things we focus on the most,” Goodell said. “It’s a tier one level event that involves unique assets at the federal level, the state level and the local level all working together. I see no change in that in the preparations for the Super Bowl … The federal government is a big part of that, including this administration and every other administration before that.”",

    "description": "A low-key transfer deadline day ended with the fewest Premier League deals completed in a winter window. BBC Sport looks at the spending that was done, and examines why there was so little activity.",
    "fullText": "The Premier League had its quietest ever winter transfer deadline day as just seven deals were completed on Monday.\n\nNot a single arrival was confirmed until 19:04 GMT - four minutes after the window in the English top flight closed - with Crystal Palace announcing the signing of striker Jorgen Strand Larsen from Wolves in a deal worth up to £48m.\n\nClubs can make signings for up to two hours after the official deadline, as long as a deal sheet is submitted before 19:00 to provide extra time for the necessary paperwork to be completed.\n\nThere were five further deals confirmed after the deadline - among them, Sunderland brought in Ecuador winger Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht in a deal worth £17.5m, while Wolves signed midfielder Angel Gomes from Marseille on loan and replaced Strand Larsen with Adam Armstrong from Wolves for £7m.\n\nThat took the overall spending in the Premier League during the winter window to more than £390m.\n\nLiverpool did agree a deal on deadline day to sign defender Jeremy Jacquet from Rennes, but that move - and the payment of the £60m fee - won't happen until the summer.\n\nAll the done deals on deadline day in one place\n\nTwo club-record signings - but are Palace papering over the cracks?\n\nThe day's two big talking points involved Crystal Palace - Strand Larsen's arrival from Wolves and the calling off of fellow striker Jean-Philippe Mateta's move to AC Milan because of issues with his medical.\n\nOtherwise, it was a day largely devoid of transfer drama as none of the top-six clubs did any business.\n\nOne of the more interesting moves was a Premier League exit, as former England midfielder Kalvin Phillips moved from Manchester City to Championship side Sheffield United on loan for the rest of the season.\n\nThat move comes four years after City signed Phillips from Leeds in a deal worth £45m.\n\nOther deals confirmed late on included Nottingham Forest's signing of Borussia Monchengladbach defender Luca Netz, Chelsea winger Tyrique George's move on loan to Everton for the rest of the season, while Tottenham and Arsenal both announced an academy signing.\n\nA record £3.1bn was spent by Premier League clubs in the summer - significantly more than in the winter window.\n\nThe figure of £397m for this window isn't hugely down on previous winters, with January always more low key than the summer as it is a notoriously difficult time for clubs to recruit effectively.\n\nIt is even harder to do that on deadline day, but this one was particularly quiet, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe big outlay last summer will be one, while another could relate to a new system of Financial Fair Play (FFP) that will come in from next season.\n\nSquad Cost Ratio (SCR) will replace Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), meaning overall squad costs in the Premier League from 2026-27 will have to be limited to 85% of a club's revenue.\n\n\"There's always going to be a degree of anxiety as to keeping your financial house in order ahead of a far more active market [the summer window],\" Paul Macdonald of FootballTransfers.com said.\n\n\"Clubs wanted to ensure they were in a compliant position rather than having an additional headache of being hamstrung under the new rules.\"\n\nManchester City made the biggest moves in this window as they looked to give themselves the best chance of challenging Arsenal for the Premier League title.\n\nThey signed forward Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth for £64m on 9 January, while defender Marc Guehi joined from Crystal Palace for £20m on 16 January.\n\n\"The scenario now is Manchester City are chasing down Arsenal and the points gap is getting a little bit bigger, so you need those players who are ready to go and know what the intensity of this Premier League is like,\" former England and Manchester City defender Steph Houghton told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\n\"It's been a smart move from the club in terms of getting Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo. They've slotted in really well, which is testament to them.\"\n\nCrystal Palace's deadline day move for Strand Larsen meant they spent £83m in the winter window, having signed Brennan Johnson for £35m from Tottenham.\n\nAston Villa - who are third - were the only other top-six side to pay out transfer fees during the winter window. They spent £18.25m on bringing back striker Tammy Abraham from Besiktas and £10.5m on winger Alysson from Gremio.\n\nPremier League leaders Arsenal did no business during the winter window, with Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool - fourth, fifth and sixth respectively - also quiet.\n\nWhile Manchester City spent money to bolster their squad for a title fight, at the other end of the table West Ham splashed out in a bid to avoid relegation to the Championship.\n\nThe Hammers, who are third from bottom and six points adrift of safety, spent a reported £21.8m on Brazilian striker Pablo Felipe from Portuguese club Gil Vicente and around £25m on striker Taty Castellanos from Lazio.\n\nTottenham, who are 14th, spent £35m on signing midfielder Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid, while Bournemouth used some of their money from the Semenyo sale to sign teenage striker Rayan from Vasco da Gama for £24.7m and Hungary midfielder Alex Toth for £10.4m from Ferencvaros.\n\nDespite a quiet deadline day, Premier League clubs still spent more overall in the winter window than sides in other major European leagues.\n\nThe next-biggest spending league was Serie A, with their clubs paying out a combined £205m in transfer fees.\n\nSassuolo were one of the most active Italian clubs, paying £22m for Marseille duo Ismael Kone and Darryl Bakola.\n\nIn Spain, the transfer window closed at 22:59 GMT, but La Liga business was quiet, with Atletico Madrid's £30m deal for Ademola Lookman more than was spent be the rest of the division's clubs combined (£20.3m).\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The Colorado Avalanche and Detroit Red Wings are set to meet for the second time in just three days, this time at Ball Arena in downtown Denver, CO. This quick turnaround and second game of a home-and-home should make for some unsettled tension after the first installment featured extracurriculars and a stellar performance from MacKenzie Blackwood, who logged the shutout. Will the Avalanche beat their old rival yet again? Or will the Wings steal one at a mile high?\n\nThe Opponent: Detroit Red Wings (24-21-7)\n\nWatch: Altitude, Altitude+, ESPN+\n\nListen: Altitude Sports Radio, 92.5 FM\n\nThe Avalanche is an interesting group right now with a litany of injuries and what feels like waning interest at times, all resulting in the first real dip in success.\n\nThey looked plenty interested last time out, and leading the way in that regard was Nathan MacKinnon, who is undoubtedly getting all tuned up and ready for his appearance at this year’s Winter Olympics in Milan, Italy.\n\nA 5-0 shutout is just about as ideal as a scoreline can be, but make no mistake, even MacKinnon told Erik Johnson on the ABC broadcast that, “It was more competitive than the scoreline showed.”\n\nNate absolutely COOKED EJ 😂 pic.twitter.com/UHl7JZWqkh\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) January 31, 2026\n\nSpeaking of MacKinnon, he is just one assist shy of logging his 700th career apple so keep an eye on that this evening. EJ has clarified that he did not get a spray tan but leaned toward being too tan rather than too pale when giving the makeup artist instructions ahead of the broadcast. I don’t buy it.\n\nArtturi Lehkonen — Nathan MacKinnon — Valeri Nichushkin\nRoss Colton — Brock Nelson — Valeri Nichushkin\nParker Kelly — Jack Drury — Gavin Brindley\nTaylor Makar — Zakhar Bardakov — Joel Kiviranta\n\nSam Malinski — Cale Makar\nJosh Manson — Brent Burns\nKeaton Middleton — Samuel Girard\n\nMacKenzie Blackwood\nScott Wedgewood\n\nThe Wings are a solid club and feel like a playoff team this season, despite not showing much of that in Saturday’s game. Getting to the playoffs would mean ending a nine-year drought in Detroit and would do a lot to validate the work being done by management and coaches alike. Todd MacLellan’s mid-season hire (last year) still looks like a solid move from Steve Yzerman and company.\n\nEtched in history.\n\nPatrick Kane on the mic for point 1375. 🗣️ pic.twitter.com/KON0c2aQUI\n\n— Detroit Red Wings (@DetroitRedWings) January 30, 2026\n\nDetroit’s captain Dylan Larkin called Saturday’s loss a “bump in the road,” and spoke about the Avalanche being beatable and having lots to play for in tonight’s rematch. We shall see how that turns out!\n\nMarco Kasper — Dylan Larkin — Lucas Raymond\nAlex DeBrincat — Andrew Copp — Patrick Kane\nEmmitt Finnie — J.T. Compher — Mason Appleton\nElmer Soderblom — Michael Rasmussen — James van Riemsdyk\n\nAlbert Johansson — Moritz Seider\nBen Chiarot — Jacob Bernard-Docker\nErik Gustafsson — Jacob Bernard-Docker\n\nFollow along in the comments below!",

    "description": "We ask Miami Dolphins fans for their biggest concerns surrounding the new staff.",
    "fullText": "Being a Miami Dolphins fan for any period of time comes with the built-in expectation of almost always having concerns about the team, be it the general manager, scouting, coaching, or players. Between the poor execution of their jobs on the field and just stupid, unnecessary scandals off the field, it has often seemed as if there were more periods of just being overall bummed by the team and whatever stupid thing was happening with them than periods we could celebrate. In recent times, we can only point to epic comebacks, a 70-point game against a bad Denver Broncos team, or an individual accomplishment by a single player as things to celebrate. Either way, there is always something to be concerned about, but with each new regime we are at least given a bit of light at the end of the tunnel…maybe…until it’s snatched away again.\n\nSo with that big ole’ pile of joy this evening’s Phinsider Question Of The Day is:\n\nNow that our Miami Dolphins have hired the new GM and nearly filled out the entire coaching staff, what concerns do you still have about either or both? Is it an individual coach that you believe could hold the team back, or is there another concern about the new makeup of the front office or the coaching staff as a whole? Or…maybe you think this is nearly perfect for what we want to see. Please let us know that and why as well.\n\nPlease share your thoughts and answers in the comments section below-",

    "description": "We’re into February, so the battle in the standings is starting to heat up in America’s favorite basketball conference!",
    "fullText": "For a moment, I was looking at this week’s Big East basketball schedules and it was starting to look like maaaybe there weren’t really that many intriguing games on deck. Then I realized that we’re past the halfway point or further even for everyone in the league, and things are Starting To Get Important relative to fighting to avoid playing on the opening night of the conference tournament. As it happens, there’s more than a couple of games that fit the bill of “oh, well, that’s important to the 5th place/6th place cut line right now.”\n\nPlus a ranked on ranked game in the men’s division! That’s actually nationally important!\n\nWednesday, February 4: Seton Hall Pirates at Villanova Wildcats (5:30pm Central, Peacock) — Seton Hall has stemmed the tide of a complete collapse with a massive rally second half against Xavier and fending off a challenge from Marquette. However, the four game losing streak might have broken their NCAA hopes unless they can match it with quality wins, and at The Finn against a Nova team seemingly ticketed for the Dance is exactly that. Kevin Willard’s Wildcats can’t exactly afford to cough up a loss here, not with the Torvik Wins Above Bubble bracket slotting them in as a #8 seed.\n\nWednesday, February 4: Georgetown Hoyas at Creighton Bluejays (6pm Central, ESPN+) — This is one half of an important week for Jim Flanery’s Bluejays as they come off a very good road win over Seton Hall on Sunday. They’re a game behind St. John’s for fifth place (and thus one of the byes in the first round of the Big East tournament) in the league, and a game ahead of the Hoyas team as well. Creating space between themselves and Georgetown is as easy as winning at Sokol right here.\n\nWednesday, February 4: Creighton Bluejays at Georgetown Hoyas (6:30pm Central, Peacock) — The Bluejays needed overtime to down Georgetown at home, and they’re just 1-3 since then, needing a miracle break against Xavier to get the win and getting absolutely run over by both UConn (fine) and Marquette (uh oh) in the losses. There’s not much of a hope for the NCAA tournament in Omaha any more, but a loss here would probably finish them off…. and if that’s the case…. are we seeing the beginning of the end for Greg McDermott as head coach at Creighton?\n\nFriday, February 6: Connecticut Huskies at St. John’s Red Storm (7pm Central, Fox) — This will be the first of two meetings this season between the two teams that were considered to be the top two teams in the conference heading into the year. To this point, they’ve separated themselves atop the standings at 11-0 and 9-1, and with the Johnnies holding the loss, the onus is on them to win at home here to create a race for the regular season title down the stretch.\n\nSaturday, February 7: Butler Bulldogs at #1 Connecticut Huskies (11am Central, FS1) — Presuming that Sarah Strong’s squad gets through a road game against last place DePaul just fine on Wednesday, UConn could be playing to clinch a spot in the top five of the league in this game and thus avoid the opening day tripleheader of the conference tournament. That would be with six games left in the conference slate for the Huskies, and I say “could” because it’s possible that they get help on Wednesday from Georgetown to clinch it anyway.\n\nSaturday, February 7: Butler Bulldogs at Marquette Golden Eagles (1pm Central, FS1) — Butler followed up their home win over Marquette by getting trampled at The Garden by St. John’s and then getting shunted into the Negative Zone by Georgetown. Five points in the final 6+ minutes after cutting a margin to four! At home! How much will the National Marquette Day crowd gas up the Golden Eagles at Fiserv Forum here?\n\nSaturday, February 7: Seton Hall Pirates at St. John’s Red Storm (1pm Central, ESPN+) — This is the only game of the week for Savannah Catalon’s Pirates and they come in having lost two of the last three. One was to UConn, but the other was to Creighton at home. St. John’s is trying to stay in the top five of the Big East standings (and thus out of the conference tournament opening tripleheader) with just a one game lead over Creighton right now, so they can make a lot of noise with a win here. Oh, and Seton Hall’s next game, as they try to maintain a hold on third place in the league? Marquette, the team they are currently tied with in the standings.\n\nSaturday, February 7: DePaul Blue Demons at Providence Friars (3pm Central, FS1) — The Friars have lost six of seven and host Butler and DePaul this week. Think of this one as the second half of the Kim English Keep Your Job Challenge. Difficulty Level: Hard.\n\nSaturday, February 7: Seton Hall Pirates at Creighton Bluejays (5pm Central, Peacock) — All the stuff I said earlier about Budd Clark’s Pirates and Josh Dix’s Bluejays? Goes double here, especially with it being the second of two road games this week for the Pirates.\n\nSunday, February 8: Marquette Golden Eagles at Creighton Bluejays (12pm Central, FS1) — Here’s the other half of an important week for Creighton, as they get Cara Consuegra’s inconsistent (but tied for third!) Golden Eagles in Omaha. If the Jays want to make a play to get one of those five first round byes in the conference tournament, they could do a lot worse than closing the current three-game gap with MU right here. Meanwhile, Halle Vice and Marquette still haven’t found a way to start playing clean basketball for 40 straight minutes, and they have to get through a home game against Providence before making this trip to somewhere in middle America.\n\nHere’s the full Big East men’s basketball schedule for the week, with all times Central, as always.\n\n#3 Connecticut at #22 St. John’s\n\nHere’s the full Big East women’s basketball schedule for the week, with all times Central, as always.\n\nFollow Anonymous Eagle on social media\n\nFacebook: AnonymousEagle\nInstagram: AnonymousEagleSBN\nBluesky: AnonymousEagle",

    "fullText": "The Brooklyn Nets have 52 jersey numbers worn by over 600 different players over the course of their history since the franchise was founded in 1967 as a charter member of the American Basketball Association (ABA), when the team was known as the \"New Jersey Americans\".\n\nSince then, that league has been absorbed by the NBA with the team that would later become the New York Nets and New Jersey Nets before settling on the name by which they are known today, bringing their rich player and jersey history with them to the league of today.\n\nTo commemorate the players who played for the Nets over the decades wearing those 52 different jersey numbers, Nets Wire is covering the entire history of the franchise's jersey numbers and the players who sported them since the founding of the team.\n\nAnd for today's article, we will continue with the eighth of nine people to wear the No. 41 jersey, big man alum Thomas Robinson. After ending his college career at Kansas, Robinson was picked up with the fifth overall selection of the 2012 NBA Draft by the Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe Thomas Robinson native played the first 51 games of his pro career with Sacramento. He would also play for the Houston Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers, and Philadelphia 76ers before he signed with Brooklyn in 2015. His stay with the team lasted until he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2016.\n\nDuring his time suiting up for the Nets, Robinson wore only jersey No. 41 and put up 4.3 points and 5.1 rebounds per game.\n\nAll stats and data courtesy of Basketball Reference.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nets Wire: Nets jersey history No. 41 - Thomas Robinson (2015-16)",

    "fullText": "NBA trade deadline tracker: Latest news, rumors for Giannis Antetokounmpo and more in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nList of NBA trades completes at deadline\n\nNBA trade deadline deals by team\n\nWhen is the NBA trade deadline in 2026?\n\nThe NBA trade deadline is undoubtedly among the most engaging moments within the entire sports calendar.\n\nThe Thursday 3 p.m. ET cutoff for trade agreements is expected to spur considerable activity as it approaches.\n\nTeams are required to finalize their rosters by this deadline before the final phase of the regular season. This year's deadline is particularly intense, with numerous high-profile players rumored to be on the trading block.\n\nAs the activity intensifies, The Sporting News will monitor rumors, news, and reported transactions leading up to the deadline. Due to the nature of these deals, some may be announced following the deadline.\n\nContinue to follow this coverage to remain informed of all developments.\n\nFischer adds that the two sides seem resigned to a separation after eight years together, although that is more likely to come in the offseason when James hits free agency.\n\n\"The most aggressive team in the West right now is the Minnesota Timberwolves,\" said Brian Windhorst. \"They are in the game for Giannis, and the Timberwolves are being aggressive. If they don't make what I would call a Hail Mary Giannis deal, I think they are aggressively looking to upgrade their backcourt.\"\n\nShams Charania also appeared on ESPN and shared the same reports that Minnesota is indeed one of the most aggressive teams in the NBA when it comes to acquiring Antetokounmpo.\n\nJackson reported that the Miami Heat are expected to offer an extensive trade package for Antetokounmpo. The offer is anticipated to be Tyler Herro, Kel'el Ware, Terry Rozier, young players, 2 1st-round picks and 3 pick swaps, per Jackson. If the Bucks do happen to acquire Rozier, they will have to pay his entire 25-26 salary.\n\nA day after The Athletic reported that the Knicks are inquiring about Antetokounmpo, ESPN's Brian Windhorst said on \"Get Up\" Monday morning that, \"The Knicks believe in this team.. They believed in this team last summer when Giannis was loosely available in those discussions. They didn't make an aggressive offer at the time of those talks. If they want to win a bidding war now, i think its going to take a 3 or 4 team trade.... That is just not happening. They are not showing that aggression to get Giannis right now and I think thats because they like this team.\"\n\nWhile other teams have been mentioned far more often, the Trail Blazers are among the franchises interested in Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, The Oregonian reports. The report adds that new owner Tom Dundon is ready and willing to take big swings to win, which makes Portland a wild card in the Antetokounmpo sweepstakes even if a deal might cost All-Star Deni Avdija.\n\nThe Kings still have salary cap concerns despite an abysmal 12-39 record, and ESPN reports that has prompted Sacramento explore trades involving Zach LaVine, Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, and Malik Monk. The Kings acquired De’Andre Hunter from the Cavaliers on Saturday.\n\nThe Knicks are one of the teams inquiring about Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, The Athletic reports, but the Knicks’ inability to fully match what Milwaukee is demanding — premier young players and high draft picks — is a hurdle.\n\nKnicks big man Karl-Anthony Towns is still a trade candidate despite New York’s recent resurgence, The Athletic reports. Towns hasn’t been extended and reportedly has had some hard feelings ever since his name surfaced in Giannis Antetokounmpo trade talks in the offseason.\n\nThe Knicks have “long been trying to find a new home” for forward Guerschon Yabusele, who has struggled since signing in the offseason. Yabusele could need draft assets attached to him to be dealt, The Athletic reports.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks are trading guard Vit Krejci to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Duop Reath and two future second-round selections. The move gives the Hawks the ability to free up roster space, and Atlanta now possesses seven upcoming second-round picks.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers are trading De'Andre Hunter to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Dennis Schroder and Keon Ellis. This transaction involves three teams: the Chicago Bulls acquire Kings forward Dario Saric and two future second-round draft picks. Additionally, the Bulls are waiving guard Jevon Carter to make room for Saric, according to sources. They also acted as a third team and acquired assets to complete the trade.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks are trading four-time NBA All-Star Trae Young to the Washington Wizards in exchange for CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert. The Hawks kick off the trade deadline season with a bang.\n\nCJ McCollum (G) - traded from Wizards\n\nCorey Kispert (F) - traded from Wizards\n\nDuop Reath (C) - traded from Trail Blazers\n\nDario Saric (F) - traded from Kings\n\nDennis Schroder (G) -  traded from Kings\n\nKeon Ellis (G) -  traded from Kings\n\nVit Krejci (G) - traded from Hawks\n\nDe'Andre Hunter (F) - traded from Cavs\n\nTrae Young (G) - traded from Hawks\n\nThe 2026 NBA trade deadline is at 3 p.m. ET on Thursday, Feb. 5.\n\nIt is important to note that the deadline is 3 p.m. ET and whatever corresponding time that is for teams in other time zones. All trades must be agreed upon and submitted to the NBA office by 3 p.m. ET.\n\nMORE: Relive the Lakers' two legendary trades deadline moves",

All six are top-15 prospects nationally, with three ranking as the top player at their positions.\n\nBelow is a look at the six committed five-stars in the 2027 cycle, as of Feb. 2:\n\nSchool: McKeesport (McKeesport, PA)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 3 NATL. (No. 1 RB)\n\nScouting Summary: All-encompassing running back that can win with power and elusiveness on inside and outside runs. 5-foot-9, 200-plus pounds with tremendous twitch and leg drive. Plays with low pad level and an excellent center of gravity in order to deliver blows and take them himself. Has breakaway speed in order to hit the homerun. Ran sub-11 in the 100m during his sophomore track season. Shows the ability to catch the ball away from his frame as a pass catcher. Has all the physical and athletic tools to make an immediate impact at the next level and beyond. Younger prospect for the cycle.”\n\nSchool: Cedar Hill (Texas)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 6 NATL. (No. 1 DL)\n\nScouting Summary: “Uber-athletic defensive line prospect with true game-wrecking ability. Measured in at around 6-foot-3, 300 pounds prior to his junior season. Tests as an elite athlete in the combine setting, easily cracking 5.0 seconds in the 40-yard dash. Carries that athleticism over to the field where he has flashes of dominance on Friday nights. Lines up all over the defensive line for Cedar Hill (Texas) while facing top competition. Dangerous pass rusher from any spot. Combines explosive get-off with the movement skills of a much smaller player, carrying elite testing numbers directly onto the field. Consistently collapses pockets and disrupts plays before they develop.\n\n…Has legitimate game-wrecking moments on film. The quickness to dart into the backfield and the speed to hunt down ball carriers is eye-popping. May not possess premier length. Father was a third-round pick by the Dallas Cowboys. Tracking as the top defensive line prospect early on in the 2027 cycle with the upside to be an early NFL Draft pick.”\n\nSchool: Brother Martin (La.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 7 NATL. (No. 1 WR)\n\nScouting Summary: “The most dynamic pass-catcher early in the 2027 cycle and a threat to score every time he touches the ball. Measured at around 5-foot-11, 185 pounds prior to his junior season. One of the fastest top prospects in the cycle, running a scintillating 10.3-second mark in the 100 meters as a sophomore. Brings that elite speed to the gridiron—lethal on vertical routes, easily pulling away from defensive backs downfield. Tough to tackle in the open field and will take it the distance if he finds space at the second level. Shows natural shiftiness as a route-runner, giving him the ability to separate at every level. Among the more productive top wide receivers in the 2027 cycle as a junior.\n\n…Can continue improving his ability to attack catches with his arms extended, but has shown an expanded catch radius with several highlight-reel grabs. One of the youngest top prospects in the class with a late July birthday prior to his freshman season of college football. Athleticism, budding polish, and big-play ability make him one of the top overall playmakers in the cycle with the potential to develop into a first-round NFL Draft pick.”\n\nSchool: Blessed Trinity Catholic (Ga.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 10 NATL. (No. 2 EDGE)\n\nAbout: Jacobs has long been one of the most feared pass-rushers in Georgia. The UGA legacy tallied 102 total tackles in 11 games this fall and is now near 300 for his prep career. He piled up 16 sacks as a junior for BTC and has established himself as one of the premier defensive prospects in the nation, regardless of class. He chose Ohio State over Texas A&M and Miami. Jacobs is the top-ranked junior in the Peach State.\n\nSchool: Wayne (Ohio)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 12 NATL. (No. 3 WR)\n\nAbout: The five-star pass-catcher has already been committed to Ohio State for over a year. He made his pledge on Nov. 23, 2024 and has shown no signs of backing off since, even with the departure of Brian Hartline. The Buckeyes inked five-star WR Chris Henry Jr. after a long-standing commitment and they’ll now hope to do the same with Brown. He’s the top-ranked prospect in Ohio.\n\nSchool: Fort Gibson (Okla.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 13 NATL. (No. 3 OT)\n\nScouting Summary: “Hyper-athletic offensive tackle prospect with rare natural movement skills and a frame that points to immense long-term upside as one of the highest-ceiling linemen early in the 2027 cycle. Measured around 6-foot-7, 260 pounds with elite length (arms over 34 inches) and big hands prior to his junior season. Has the frame to add significant mass once in a college strength program. Lines up at right tackle for his high school, where his athletic traits immediately stand out. Moves with rare fluidity for his size and plays with surprising power through his lower half, generating torque and leverage at the point of attack. Shows balance and body control that project well to the next level. Displays loose flexibility and consistently lowers his pads to handle shorter defenders. Plays with a physical edge and looks to finish blocks through the whistle.\n\n…Further showcases his athleticism as a disruptive defensive end. Doubles as a talented basketball player on the high school and AAU circuit who can run the court and play above the rim. Will need to add considerable mass and adjust to stronger competition at the next level, which could delay early playing time. Possesses an outstanding developmental profile with the big frame, movement skills, and multi-sport coordination that give him the upside to develop into an early-round NFL Draft pick.”",

    "fullText": "The Golden State Warriors have had over 600 players don the more than 60 jersey numbers used by their players over the more than 75 years of existence the team has enjoyed in its rich and storied history.\n\nFounded in 1946 during the Basketball Association of America (BAA – a precursor league of the NBA) era, the team has called home the cities of Philadelphia, San Francisco, Oakland, and even San Diego.\n\nTo commemorate the players who wore those numbers, Warriors Wire is covering the entire history of jersey numbers and the players who sported them since the founding of the team. For this article, we begin with the third of nine players who wore the No. 43 jersey for the Warriors.\n\nThat player would be Golden State forward alum Larry McNeill. After ending his college career at Marquette, McNeill was picked up with the 25th overall selection of the 1973 NBA Draft by the (then) Kansas City-Omaha (now, Sacramento) Kings.\n\nThe Hoke, North Carolina native played the first three seasons of his pro career with the Kings. He would also play for (then) New York (now, Brooklyn) Nets, before he signed with the Dubs in 1977. His stay with the team lasted until he was cut by the team that fall.\n\nDuring his time suiting up for the Warriors, McNeill wore only jersey No. 43 and put up 4.5 points and 2.5 rebounds per game\n\nAll stats and data courtesy of Basketball Reference.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Warriors jersey history - No. 43 - Larry McNeill (1977)",

    "fullText": "Quantizing attention improves efficiency on two fronts: the model has\nhigher compute throughput, and loads fewer bytes per key/value. However,\ntraining with block quantized attention can break causal modeling. We\npresent a fix that enables training with MXFP4 in both attention and the\nattention gradient.\n\nIn causal language modeling, the final logits at position ii must depend only on tokens at positions\n≤i\\le i. Future leakage\nis when information from positions >i>i may influence the logits at position\nii. It poses an issue because it causes\na skew between training and decode. In typical setups, causal masks\nprevent leakage in attention. But block quantization can introduce a\nsubtle new path for future leakage.\n\nModern accelerators require using block-quantized matrix\nmultiplications for highest throughput. To use these instructions to\ncompute A×BA \\times B, the row vectors of\nAA and column vectors of BB must be split into blocks of size kk and quantized. The specific value of kk depends on the format being used. For\nexample, the microscaling formats use k=32k=32.\n\nWithin a block, let x0,x1,…,xk−1x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{k-1} denote the precise (unquantized) elements. When\nquantizing, we approximate each element xix_i with a quantized value qiq_i and a scale ss shared across the block: xi≈qi⋅sx_i \\approx q_i \\cdot s\n\nThere are various approaches to selecting ss with different tradeoffs. But in general\nthey choose an ss with a function of all\nelements in the block.\n\nGiven ss, the quantized elements\nare:\n\nqi=round(xis)q_i = \\text{round}\\left(\\frac{x_i}{s}\\right)\n\nWith this procedure, ss and\nconsequently qiq_i depend on\nall the pre-quantized elements in the block. So if the\nquantization block spans across different token positions, quantization\nenables the later tokens in the block to influence earlier tokens.\n\nCausal attention for a single head takes queries Q\\mathbf{Q}, keys K\\mathbf{K}, and values V\\mathbf{V} as inputs, and produces:\n\nP=softmax(Q×KT+M)output=P×V\\begin{array}{lcl} \\mathbf{P} & = & \\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{Q} \\times \\mathbf{K}^T + \\mathbf{M}) \\\\ \\text{output} & = & \\mathbf{P} \\times \\mathbf{V} \\end{array}\n\nwhere M\\mathbf{M} is the causal\nmask.\n\nOur goal is to use block-quantized matrix multiplications for Q×KT\\mathbf{Q} \\times \\mathbf{K}^T and P×V\\mathbf{P} \\times \\mathbf{V}. So Q\\mathbf{Q} and K\\mathbf{K} need to be quantized in blocks\nformed along the head dimension, while P\\mathbf{P} and V\\mathbf{V} need to be quantized in blocks\nformed along different token positions.\n\nQuantizing P\\mathbf{P} is safe\ndespite blocking along token positions, since the causal mask zeros out\nfuture probabilities. However, the quantized V\\mathbf{V} at position jj can depend on values at positions >j> j, which can cause future leakage.\n\nConsider query position ii and value\nposition jj, with block indices:\n\nbi=⌊ik⌋,bj=⌊jk⌋b_i = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{i}{k} \\right\\rfloor, \\quad b_j = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{j}{k} \\right\\rfloor\n\nLeakage occurs when query position ii\nand value position jj share a\nquantization block position (bi=bjb_i = b_j):\n\nbi=bjb_i = b_j\n(block-diagonal): query ii\nattends to value jj if j≤ij \\le i. But the quantized value at jj is computed from all positions in\nthe block (including positions greater than ii). This breaks causality since the attention\noutput at position ii can depend on\npositions greater than ii.\n\nbi>bjb_i > b_j (past\nblocks): All positions in block bjb_j precede the first position in block bib_i. No leakage.\n\nbi<bjb_i < b_j (future\nblocks): The causal mask zeros P[i,j]\\mathbf{P}[i,j] for j>ij > i. No leakage.\n\nLeakage only occurs when the ii-th block-diagonal tile of P\\mathbf{P} is multiplied with the ii-th quantized block of V\\mathbf{V}. So we can prevent future leakage\n\nV\\mathbf{V} when multiplying the\nii-th tile of P\\mathbf{P} with the ii-th block of V\\mathbf{V}, while using block quantized\nmatrix multiplications everywhere else.\n\nTo validate this fix, we trained a pair of 1B-parameter models on the\nC4 dataset, with MXFP4 for attention and the attention gradient. Both\nmodels share the following configuration:\n\nWe trained a “Leaky” model that used MXFP4 for all of P×V\\mathbf{P} \\times \\mathbf{V}, and a “Fixed”\nmodel that used the proposed solution.\n\nThe Fixed model remained well behaved throughout training. However,\nthe Leaky model had training dynamics associated with future leakage:\nthe grad norms grew rapidly before the loss started to improve\nsuspiciously fast.\n\nTo confirm that the Leaky model was only doing better because of\nfuture leakage, we evaluated loss in two modes on a heldout set. In\nparallel mode, we ran prefill once per sequence. In autoregressive mode,\nwe averaged the loss for generating the sequence one token at a\ntime.\n\nDespite the Leaky model’s parallel loss being lower than the Fixed\nmodel’s, the autoregressive loss was worse. The Leaky model’s gap in\nloss between parallel and autoregressive modes indicates that it was\nreliant on future signal. The Fixed model had no gap, demonstrating our\nsolution worked.\n\nThe Leaky model’s parallel mode was using quantization error to\nencode information about upcoming tokens. Padding a block with zeros\n(like we do in autoregressive mode) won’t change the selected scale. But\nadding outliers to the end (which can happen in parallel mode) makes the\nscale larger. Larger scales can cause earlier values to underflow.\n\nExample where a future outlier causes the second value to\nunderflow.\n\nThe model can use whether earlier values in a block underflowed to\ninfer something about upcoming tokens.\n\nWe hope the methodology here provides a starting point for\nresearchers interested in quantizing attention during training. In\nfuture work, we aim to demonstrate that quantized attention can match\nthe quality of float baselines while still providing end-to-end\nspeedups.\n\nIf these research problems sound interesting, consider working with us!",

    "description": "The developer of the popular text editor Notepad++ said hackers associated with the Chinese government hijacked its software update mechanism to deliver tainted software to users for months.",
    "fullText": "The developer of the popular open source text editor Notepad++ has confirmed that hackers hijacked the software to deliver malicious updates to users over the course of several months in 2025.\n\nIn a blog post published Monday, Notepad++ developer Don Ho said that the cyberattack was likely carried out by hackers associated with the Chinese government between June and December 2025, citing multiple analyses by security experts who examined the malware payloads and attack patterns. Ho said this “would explain the highly selective targeting” seen during the campaign.\n\nRapid7, which investigated the incident, attributed the hacking to Lotus Blossom, a long-running espionage group known to work for China, and said the hacks targeted government, telecom, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media sectors.\n\nNotepad++ is one of the longest-running open source projects, spanning more than two decades, and it counts at least tens of millions of downloads to date, including by employees at organizations around the world.\n\nAccording to Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who first discovered the cyberattack and wrote up his findings in December, the hackers compromised a small number of organizations “with interests in East Asia” after someone unwittingly used a tainted version of the popular software. Beaumont said that the hackers were able to gain “hands-on” access to the computers of victims who were running hijacked versions of Notepad++.\n\nHo said that the “exact technical mechanism” of how the hackers broke into his servers remains under investigation, but provided some details as to how the attack went down.\n\nIn the blog, Ho said that Notepad++’s website was hosted on a shared hosting server. The attackers “specifically targeted” Notepad++’s web domain with the goal of exploiting a bug in the software to redirect some users to a malicious server run by the hackers. This allowed the hackers to deliver malicious updates to certain users who had requested a software update, until the bug was fixed in November and the hackers’ access was terminated in early December.\n\n“We do have logs indicating that the bad actor tried to re-exploit one of the fixed vulnerabilities; however, the attempt did not succeed after the fix was implemented,” wrote Ho.\n\nIn an email, Ho told TechCrunch that his hosting provider confirmed his shared server was compromised but that the provider did not say how the hackers initially broke in.\n\nHo apologized for the incident, and urged users to download the most recent version of his software, which contains a fix for the bug.\n\nThe cyberattack targeting Notepad++ users is somewhat reminiscent of the 2019-2020 cyberattack affecting customers of SolarWinds, a software company that makes IT and network management tools for large Fortune 500 organizations, including government departments. Russian government spies hacked into the company’s servers and secretly planted a backdoor in its software, allowing the Russian spies to access data on those customers’ networks once the update had rolled out.\n\nThe SolarWinds breach affected several government agencies, including Homeland Security and the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Justice, and State.\n\nUpdated with a response from Ho and with additional details from Rapid7.",

    "title": "Chainguard admitted Factory 1.0 was \"brittle.\"",
    "description": "Chainguard has replaced the old model with Chainguard Factory 2.0, a radical, AI-powered reimagining of its pipeline.",
    "fullText": "The new, revised Chainguard Factory 2.0 swaps out 1.0’s fragile, event-driven pipeline with a self-healing system powered by a new open source framework called DriftlessAF.\n\nLots of people love the software supply-chain security company Chainguard for its secure-by-design open-source components for today’s application stacks. Who doesn’t like components that come guaranteed to have the latest CVE fixes? These are built by a process called the Chainguard Factory. This is an automated build system that continuously updates Chainguard’s safe containers, libraries, and VMs with the latest security patches. There’s only one little problem. As originally built, the “Factory” had more than its fair share of bugs. The answer? Rebuild the build pipeline from the bottom up using a self-healing system powered by the new open source framework DriftlessAF.\n\nChainguard Factory’s job, according to Dustin Kirkland, Chainguard’s engineering SVP, is to constantly monitor and “build over 10,000 open source projects, and the moment that any upstream maintainer tags a new release, our automation springs into action—fetching that source code, checking the checksums, applying our build rules, rebuilding and recompiling that software, retesting that software at the package and unit level.”\n\nThat’s a huge, honking job. Chainguard now admits that their original Chainguard Factory 1.0 wasn’t up to the task. It was built on a traditional event-driven system. While functional at a smaller scale, the system became a loose confederation of fallible edge-triggered processes that struggled to keep pace with the depth and breadth of our catalog and our ambitious product promise: secure, up-to-date content with zero known CVEs.”\n\nThe result was a brittle system — “with DriftlessAF, we are moving away from complex, brittle processes,” the company writes on its blog — that was prone to errors, requiring subject matter experts (SMEs) to get their hands dirty to keep the programs running through the pipeline. This was, in a word, “unacceptable.”\n\nSo, Chainguard has replaced the old model with Chainguard Factory 2.0, a radical, AI-powered reimagining of its pipeline. This new model uses AI agents to run a reconciliation-driven drive. Factory 2.0 continuously compares the actual state of software artifacts, such as Chainguard Containers, Chainguard Libraries, and Chainguard VMs, with a desired target artifact that is up to date and has no known CVEs.\n\nSome of these agents are derived from an AI agent programming company named — sorry for the confusion, but there it is — Factory. According to the company, Chainguard “selected Factory for its compaction engine, which collapses sprawling changes into reviewable PRs.” This compaction engine saves context between programming sessions. In other words, to quote Josh Wolf, a Chainguard Staff Engineer, “There’s all this hype nowadays about the improving memory of different agents. When you don’t have to think about context windows, you can treat [Factory] Droid like a colleague that just remembers what you’ve been talking about.”\n\nChainguard Factory 2.0  works by using AI bots and agents to continuously track code changes. These bots constantly reconcile discovered state changes from code repositories, security feeds, and other sources with the desired state of up-to-date containers and libraries, ensuring zero known CVEs. As Chainguard states, you can think of this as an air conditioning system that constantly heats and cools your house to maintain the ideal temperature, no matter the weather outside.\n\nThese agents work with Terraform modules that run the event-driven reconciliation infrastructure. Go language programs then direct the agents, which run on Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude.\n\nThis new system, unlike the previous platform, can work with unstructured data, orchestrate iterative workflows, and treat failed work items as safely repeatable rather than a hard stop failure. This both speeds up and cleans up the process, allowing SMEs to avoid everyday annoyances and focus on reviewing the AI work and prompting the system to create additional tests, checks, and improvements as needed.\n\nThe end result, says Dan Lorenc, Chainguard co-founder and CEO, is “Factory. 2.0 is more than a factory. It’s a revolution. Our amazing engineering team is using AI to achieve remediation speeds we never thought possible. I’m talking about detecting and patching a vulnerability before upstream is even aware.”\n\nHe continues, “Our AI-powered pipeline is transforming raw source code into 1,000s of packages and assembling those into secure, compliant, and hardened container images at an unprecedented scale. But here’s the best part. AI powers it. Our engineers are available to help with the hard parts.”\n\nIt sounds promising. Now, the question is, “Will Chainguard Factory 2.0 and DriftlessAF live up to their promise?” There’s only one way to find out. Take them out, kick their tires, and let us know what you find.",

In a FAQ posted to Adobe’s website, the company says it will stop selling the animation software on March 1st, citing the emergence of new platforms “that better serve the needs of the users.”\n\nUsers have until March 1st, 2027 (or March 1st, 2029 for enterprise customers) to access and download files from Animate, as they’ll no longer be available after this time. The app will be available to download until those deadlines, and Adobe will continue providing support during that period.\n\nAdobe Animate’s history dates back to 1996, when FutureWave Software launched the vector graphics application, originally called FutureSplash Animator, as a tool to create vector-based animations. Though Macromedia acquired the tool later that year and renamed it Flash, Adobe purchased the company in 2005 and began calling the app Adobe Flash Professional. Adobe announced plans to rebrand the app to Adobe Animate in 2015 as the web began phasing out Flash.\n\nThough Adobe says Creative Cloud Pro customers can use other apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality,” such as Adobe After Effects or Adobe Express, many users who still use Animate are frustrated with its imminent shutdown. The creators behind the short-form animated series, Chikn Nuggit, write in a post on X that they still use Adobe Animate to make the show. “This decision would not only harm countless jobs in the industry but render so much past creations as lost media,” the post reads. David Firth, the creator of Salad Fingers, also says he still uses the app to make the grotesque series.\n\nMegacharlie, a technical artist for Jackbox Games, adds that the app “is used in many high-budget television cartoon productions, film and animation studios, game studios big and small, not to mention the 1000s of indie creators who still make use of it daily.”\n\nOver the past year, Adobe has made it clear that it’s focused on AI. The company has launched a slew ofAI-powered editing tools across its apps, and rolled out an AI audio tool to add soundtracks and voiceovers to videos. It’s also working on its own “IP-safe” Firefly AI models for the entertainment industry.",

    "description": "In one of the most baffling discoveries of the last decade, scientists have found a clue in a cave to how life might survive in deep space without light.",
    "fullText": "When cave biologist Hazel Barton ventured into the pitch darkness, the last thing she expected to find were organisms harnessing energy from light. This new understanding of photosynthesis in the dark, she realised, means life elsewhere in the Universe could exist in places we never thought possible.\n\n\"The wall was bright green. It was the most iridescent green you'd ever seen, and yet the microbes were living in complete darkness,\" says Barton, professor of geological sciences at the University of Alabama.\n\nBeneath the deep rocky canyons of the Chihuahuan Desert in southern New Mexico, lies a network of 119 caves. The caves, part of the Carlsbad Caverns National Park, formed four to 11 million years ago due to sulphuric acid dissolving the limestone rocks.\n\nThe primary attraction of the park is the show cave, Carlsbad Cavern. Here, glittering stalactites cling to the roof of the Big Room, a huge underground chamber measuring almost 4,000ft (1,220m) long and 625ft (191m) wide.\n\n\"The Carlsbad cavern is very easily accessible. It's a very large limestone cave that tourists can visit that has steps and ladders and everyone can go down,\" says Lars Behrendt, a microbial biologist at Uppsala University. Parts of the cave system, he adds, are even wheelchair accessible.\n\nAlmost 350,000 people visit Carlsbad cavern each year, yet most would be completely unaware that the cave is the setting to one of the most baffling scientific discoveries of the past decade.\n\nIn 2018, Behrendt had just finished his PhD. He had also won an academic prize, which awarded him some money. He contacted Barton and asked her if she would accompany him on an expedition. Luckily, she agreed.\n\n\"The first thing you do in the Carlsbad cave is you kind of go down on the tourist trail, and then you turn around a corner,\" says Barton. \"I don't know how many times I've done that trail, probably 40 times. At that point, you go around the corner, and then behind you there's an alcove, and it's completely black.\"\n\nFor more than 20 years, Barton has been studying microscopic life found deep underground. Yet what happened next was a surprise, even to her.\n\nBehrendt shone a torch on the wall. Although the alcove was pitch black, the light revealed a blanket of green microbes clinging to the wall. Later tests revealed they were cyanobacteria; single celled organisms related to bacteria. Unlike most bacteria, though, cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae) use light from the Sun to make food.\n\n\"We started going deeper and deeper into the cave,\" says Barton. \"Eventually we were a point where we couldn't see without using flashlights. We had to use a headlight to be able to see our hand in front of our face, and yet you could still see green pigment on the wall.\"\n\nPlants are green due to a chemical called chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy. In photosynthesis, this energy is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The process is much the same in cyanobacteria. Yet here, in the cave, there was no sunlight.\n\nIt turns out that the cyanobacteria in the cave have a special version of chlorophyll that can capture near-infrared light. This light has a longer wavelength than visible light, and appears just before infrared on the electromagnetic spectrum. It is undetectable to the human eye.\n\nWhile plants and cyanobacteria use chlorophyll a for photosynthesis, the cyanobacteria in the Carlsbad caves use chlorophyll d and f, which are able to generate energy from near-infrared light.\n\nAlthough visible light can only travel a few hundred feet into the caves, near-infrared can journey a lot further due to the reflective nature of the limestone rocks. \"The limestone rock that the cave is made of will absorb almost all visible light, but to near-infrared light, caves are pretty much a hall of mirrors,\" says Barton.\n\nIn fact, when the researchers measured the light in the back of the cave where it was darkest, they found the levels of near-infrared light were 695 times more concentrated than at the entrance. At the same time, while chlorophyll d and f containing cyanobacteria were present in all parts of the cave, they were particularly concentrated in the darkest and deepest places.\n\nThe researchers also hiked out to other caves in the Carlsbad Caverns National Park and tested other off-the-beaten-track caves and caverns. In each case they found photosynthesising microbes deep down underground.\n\n\"We showed that not only do they live down there, but that they photosynthesise in a completely sheltered environment where they've probably been untouched for 49 million years,\" says Behrendt.\n\nBarton and Behrendt aren't the only scientists to find microbes able to live in the dark.\n\nIn 1890, pioneering Ukrainian-Russian microbiologist Sergei Nikolaevich Vinogradskii discovered that some microbes could live solely on inorganic matter – using a process called chemosynthesis. These microbes gain energy through chemical reactions, taking chemicals such as methane or hydrogen sulphide from surrounding rocks and water.\n\nIn 1996, Hideaki Miyashita, who at the time was a student on Nasa's postdoctoral programme, discovered a marine cyanobacterium named Acaryochloris marina that can photosynthesise using both visible and near-infrared light. This discovery kickstarted decades of research into the wavelengths of light required for photosynthesis.\n\nThen, in 2018, scientists at Imperial College London found photosynthesising cyanobacteria living in shady conditions in bacterial mats in Yellowstone National Park, and inside some beach rocks in Australia. They even managed to grow photosynthesising microbes in a dark cupboard fitted with infrared LEDs. In each case, the cyanobacteria used chlorophyll a to photosynthesise using visible light, but then switched to using chlorophyll f to photosynthesise using near-infrared light – beyond the reach of human vision.\n\nThe findings have repercussions for what life on other planets could look like. When looking for a habitable exoplanet – a planet that orbits a star in another solar system – it's important to take into account the type of star that it is orbiting. Astronomers have tried to group stars by the colour of light they produce, resulting in seven classes of stars (O, B, A, F, G, K and M), which are arranged in order of decreasing temperature, from hottest to coolest. O- and B-type stars are the hottest, most massive and most luminous stars in the Universe. They are characterised by their blue-white colour.\n\n\"They produce a lot of UV radiation, so they're toxic to life,\" says Barton.\n\nG-type stars, which include our Sun, are yellow in colour and produce a lot of light in the visible spectrum. These stars would theoretically be good places to look for habitable worlds, but G-type stars constitute just 8% of the estimated one billion trillion stars in the Universe.\n\nAs red dwarfs are low mass stars, their planets tend to orbit closely, which makes them easier to spot. Another reason that M stars have proved so fruitful in scientists' search for exoplanets is because they are so plentiful. However, currently red dwarf stars are thought to have a very narrow habitable zone – the area closest to the star where conditions are neither too hot, nor too cold for liquid water to exist on the planet's surface. the epic hunt for a planet just like Earth.)\n\nAs the existence of liquid water is essential for life on Earth, this measure, known as the star's \"Goldilocks zone\", is what astrobiologists have focused on when looking for extraterrestrial life. So far, they have found dozens of candidates. However not all of these planets could sustain life, and directing telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) takes time and considerable resources.\n\n• The peculiar smells of outer space\n\n• The scientists looking for alien vegetation\n\n• The scientists venturing into the deep, dark Earth\n\nAnother important factor which governs whether life can exist is whether photosynthesis can take place. On Earth, photosynthesis forms the base of most food chains and provides the oxygen we breathe. For this reason, it makes sense to limit the search to planets that can support photosynthesis. This could dramatically reduce the zone around a star where life could exist.\n\nIn the past, astrobiologists set the limit for photosynthesis at a wavelength of 700nm in the light spectrum, which is the equivalent wavelength of the colour red. This is the point at which the efficiency of photosynthesis using chlorophyll a declines. However, the cyanobacteria discovered in the Carlsbad cave systems can harvest light up to wavelengths of 780nm using chlorophyll f.\n\n\"The vast majority of stars in our galaxy are these M- and K-type stars,\" says Barton. \"This means most of the stars in our galaxy are putting out near-infrared light, and yet we barely know anything about how photosynthesis and life could survive under the conditions of light that would be produced by a star like that.\"\n\nBarton plans to change this. Together with Behrendt, she has put in a proposal to Nasa to find the limits of where photosynthetic life can survive. The work would involve going deep down into the darkest caves to measure exactly how much light is needed for cyanobacteria to survive. That information can then be used to narrow down the search for habitable worlds. For example, with the JWST, scientists can measure the amount and type of light exoplanets receive.\n\n\"What our work is trying to do is figure out what is the longest wavelength of light and lowest level of light at which you can photosynthesise,\" says Barton.\n\n\"Then what you can do is take the 100 billion potential stars that we can point the James Webb Space Telescope at, and reduce it down to say 50 stars [which may host life].\"\n\nIn other words, it could lead to astrobiologists broadening the types of worlds that they believe could support life. All that would remain would be to point the JWST at the star in question and then look for planets passing in front of it. As the light from the star travels through the atmosphere of the planet, specific frequencies of light are absorbed depending on what elements are present. Astronomers can therefore work out if certain elements which might hint at the presence of life, such as oxygen, are present in the exoplanet's atmosphere by looking for missing lines on the absorption spectra.\n\n\"There are very, very few ways that oxygen can be made in an atmosphere without life,\" says Barton. \"So, if you can find the oxygen in the atmosphere of one of those exoplanets, it's a very, very strong marker for potential life.\"\\\n\n* This article has been updated to correct information about the spectral classification of stars from O to M. This article also incorrectly stated that all exoplanets discovered to date have been found around red dwarf stars. Exoplanets have been discovered around a wide variety of stars.\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, \n\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC,",

    "fullText": "\"We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes,\" he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday called on Republicans to \"take over\" and \"nationalize\" voting as he continued to make false claims about the electoral process in the U.S. with the 2026 midterm elections on the horizon.\n\nTrump made the comments in an interview with former FBI Director Dan Bongino, who resigned from his post in December and returned to podcasting.\n\nTrump alleged noncitizen voting was improperly influencing election outcomes, though experts insist such instances are incredibly rare and already illegal, and told Bongino it was \"amazing that the Republicans aren't tougher on it.\"\n\n\"The Republicans should say, 'We want to take over,'\" Trump said. \"We should take over the voting ... in at least many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes.\"\n\nThe Constitution gives states the authority to conduct federal elections, subject to laws passed by Congress. The elections clause states, in part, that \"state legislatures will establish the times, places, and manner of holding elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate.\"\n\nTrump didn't elaborate on how he wanted Republicans to \"nationalize\" voting.\n\nAsked by ABC News for specifics on what Trump meant, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson responded, \"President Trump cares deeply about the safety and security of our elections -- that’s why he’s urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting, and end the practice of ballot harvesting.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the chamber's top Democrat, slammed Trump over his comments to Bongino.\n\n\"Just a few hours ago, Donald Trump said he wants to nationalize elections around the country. That's what Trump said. You think he believes in democracy? He said, 'We want to take over, the Republicans ought to nationalize the voting,'\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"Does Donald Trump need a copy of the Constitution? What he is saying is outlandishly illegal.\"\n\nTrump's agenda is at stake in this year’s elections, where all seats in the House and 35 in the Senate will be up for grabs. Currently, Republicans hold narrow margins in both chambers -- but midterm cycles are historically unkind to the sitting president's party.\n\nLast year, Trump and other Republicans pushed for mid-decade redistricting in order to gain additional House seats. The president warned Republicans last month that they have to win the midterms or he will get \"impeached.\"\n\nTrump also continues to litigate his 2020 election loss, spreading false claims of fraud.\n\nLast week, the FBI searched and seized original 2020 voting records from the Fulton County Elections and Operations Hub in Georgia, a swing state that went blue in 2020 and helped secure Joe Biden's victory.\n\n\"Now you're going to see something in Georgia where they were able to get, with a court order, the ballots. You're going to see some interesting things come out,” Trump said on Bongino's podcast.\n\nABC News' Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Exclusive: ‘There has to be something better than this,’ Irish deportee Patrick Moore told The Independent. ‘It's not the United States that I know.’",
    "fullText": "When a Manhattan-based construction executive and his boyfriend of two decades were renovating a luxury Tribeca triplex in 2024, the two began – like many couples do amid such undertakings – to argue.\n\nAs the bickering escalated, Patrick Moran, an expert in conservation and preservation who has overseen building projects for New York City’s Carnegie Hall, the American Museum of Natural History and the New York Federal Reserve, says partner Nicholas Kjos, a high-end real estate broker who previously worked as an entertainer on cruise ships, at one point called him a “f**king immigrant,” and threatened to call ICE to have him deported, according to civil court filings reviewed by The Independent.\n\nThe 46-year-old Moran, for his part, chalked the cruel outburst up to “stress” over the ongoing overhaul of their $4.3 million apartment, which had by then already been dragging on for four years, and “continued to believe in the relationship.”\n\nThat is, until Kjos, 45, initiated legal proceedings to have Moran removed from their shared home, leveling claims that prompted a team of eight armed ICE officers to show up last summer and detain Moran for deportation. He spent the next month being shuffled around the country to various lockups, before finally being sent back to Ireland.\n\nGetting Moran thrown out of the United States was part of a plot “intended to exploit [Moran’s] immigration status,” with a goal of “wrongfully obtain[ing] sole control, ownership and possession of the property,” the complaint alleges.\n\n“It’s a situation where I feel that ICE was weaponized against him,” Moran’s attorney Andreas Vasilatos told The Independent. “Almost like how the Mafia just whacks a guy [they don’t want around anymore]. But here, instead of whacking the guy, it’s, ‘I’m gonna call ICE.’”\n\nSpeaking to The Independent from overseas, Moran said, “I love [the United States] and what it stands for, and I know we are better than this. I don’t claim to have the solution to immigration reform, but whatever that solution is, it must be fair, just and enforced with compassion and humanity.”\n\nThe stunning episode comes during an unprecedented expansion of ICE’s remit, with more than 73,000 people now in immigration detention – an all-time high and a 75 percent increase in the 12 months since Donald Trump retook the White House.\n\nIn Florida, the state’s attorney general has encouraged people with undocumented exes to report them to ICE. The top ICE official at the agency’s Puerto Rico field office said investigators today receive “revenge tips” they never got previously, telling NPR that people are turning in “a neighbor that they don’t get along with, or an ex-husband, ex-wife, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend.” Last year, after a 29-year-old NYPD sergeant was spurned by a woman he met online, he allegedly threatened to have her deported by ICE.\n\nBetween January and September 2025, the U.S. deported 99 Irish citizens, a 50 percent increase compared to a year earlier, and an 1,880 percent increase over the five people deported back to Ireland in 2021.\n\nMoran’s forced return has left him “shattered,” according to Vasilatos. He described Moran as a “super sweet guy,” who “contributed to society and was a net positive” to everybody in his life.\n\n“It’s not disputed he was undocumented,” Vasilatos said. “But to not take into consideration his contributions to America over the last 20 years, makes it particularly draconian and particularly punitive.”\n\nKjos did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nMoran and Kjos, who is originally from San Antonio, were introduced by a mutual friend in 2005, and quickly embarked on a romantic relationship “characterized by mutual love and commitment,” according to a lawsuit Vasilatos filed January 29 on Moran’s behalf in Manhattan Supreme Court.\n\nShortly after they began dating, Kjos gave up his career at sea to pursue potential opportunities as an actor-singer on Broadway, the complaint continues. About six months later, the pair began living together in Midtown, Moran’s complaint says.\n\nThey spent holidays together at Kjos’s family ranch in Texas, attended weddings together and Moran became Kjos’s nephew’s godfather, the complaint goes on. Moran and Kjos bought a Bernedoodle named Benji, which became “a beloved part of their shared life,” according to the complaint.\n\nMoran, who earned more than $300,000 a year, was the “primary financial provider” for the pair, the complaint states. Kjos left his seaborne career behind and obtained a real estate license, splitting his time between New York and Texas, the complaint says, noting that Moran hired a “nationally recognized website designer to create and maintain a state-of-the-art website” for Kjos, among other things. In 2015, Moran and Kjos decided to purchase a $400,000 apartment atop the Grand Hyatt Hotel in San Antonio, completely redoing the brand-new space at Moran’s expense, the complaint contends.\n\nAnd because dealing in multimillion-dollar properties was a business that “emphasized image,” Moran provided cash down payments for Kjos to buy, at various times, a Range Rover, a Mercedes and a Porsche.\n\n“At no time did [Moran] view these payments as individual obligations; rather, they were treated as joint contributions to the parties' shared life,” according to the complaint.\n\nDue to Moran’s undocumented immigration status, the San Antonio home was titled in Kjos’s name, but “it was understood and intended to be jointly owned and benefited from by both parties,” according to the complaint.\n\nIn 2020, Moran and Kjos decided to buy a place in New York City, setting their sights on a raw three-story condo in the Tribeca section of Lower Manhattan.\n\nLike the San Antonio home, Moran’s immigration status meant the Tribeca property also needed to be titled in Kjos’s name, according to the complaint. But, it says, “it was acquired and renovated with the understanding that it was a joint asset for their mutual benefit.”\n\nThree years went by, and in December 2024, Moran resigned from his job and co-founded his own construction firm. By this time, the two had started to argue, the complaint explains. It says Kjos made “derogatory remarks such as calling [Moran] a ‘f**king immigrant,’ and threatening to ‘report’ him to immigration authorities for deportation.”\n\nNevertheless, Moran “attributed this to project stress” and continued to trust that the relationship between him and Kjos would endure, according to the complaint.\n\nAt this point, the renovation costs began to soar, the complaint states. Under intense financial pressure, the couple agreed to sell their San Antonio apartment, complete the renovations to the apartment in Tribeca and sell it, then part ways, according to the complaint.\n\nWith the Tribeca renovation nearing completion, it says Kjos demanded that Moran move out for staging and sale, while also claiming the local real estate market was weak and that issues with the building’s foundation would devalue the property. But, Moran’s complaint argues, a comprehensive valuation report from the Office of the New York State Comptroller deemed the Tribeca market “at a peak,” an assertion backed up by consultations with real estate professionals who estimated the renovated space “should command approximately $4,300,000.”\n\nIn early August, Moran got home to find a notice ordering him to vacate the property within 10 days, the complaint states. Because the apartment belonged to both of them, Moran decided to fight it out in court, where Kjos’s lawyer “falsely accused [Moran] of selling methamphetamine, a baseless claim,” according to the complaint, which insists that Moran, who said he has no criminal history whatsoever, “has never sold drugs,” nor ever charged with doing so.\n\nKjos, in an “attempt to escalate” things, then called ICE and made the same spurious claim, unbeknownst to Moran, the complaint says.\n\n“On the morning of October 31, 2025, [Kjos] remotely unlocked the North Moore property door via his Control4… phone app, allowing eight armed ICE officers to enter and detain [Moran],” according to the complaint. “The officers, at the… permission of [Moran], searched the apartment and found no contraband or evidence of drugs. When the search was completed and [Moran] was removed from the apartment, [Kjos], through the use of his Control4 app, locked the door behind them.”\n\nMoran was taken into custody at gunpoint and forced out of the apartment in a T-shirt and sweatpants, he said. He asked to change into something more appropriate, and to get his keys, but the ICE officers refused, according to Moran.\n\nThat afternoon, while at Delaney Hall, a notorious ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, Moran was able to contact his business partner and their IT administrator and gave them permission to go into the Tribeca condo to retrieve his laptop and company files, “which were necessary for the continued operation of the company,” the complaint states.\n\nBut, it says, when Kjos got a notification on his phone from the Control4 app that they had entered the place, he “immediately called them up and falsely stated it was a federal crime scene and they were about to be arrested, as the police were on the way.”\n\nMoran’s complaint says no drug-related charges were filed, and that six months of apartment surveillance video would prove that no drugs were being sold out of the apartment, if only Kjos would allow him access to the footage.\n\n“It was so insulting,” Moran told The Independent, pushing back vehemently against the notion that he ever did anything of the sort. “I was furious… Like, ‘Is somebody punking me?’ It was such a low blow.”\n\nAfter about four weeks in ICE custody, culminating with a stint at an ICE facility in San Diego, Moran was permitted to “self-deport” back to Ireland, on a plane ticket his parents bought for him. He is now trying to pick up the pieces of his life from afar, and is hoping to resume his life in America eventually.\n\nKjos presently has full possession of the Tribeca apartment. In Moran’s suit against Kjos, he is seeking to get back his half of their joint assets and joint custody of their dog. The remedy here, in legal terms, is known as a constructive trust, in which the court would declare Kjos to be wrongfully holding property belonging to Moran, and force him to give it back so as not to be “unjustly enriched.”\n\n“I wasn't angry,” Moran told The Independent. “It was just sad. I was in a relationship for 20 years with this person, and as far as I was concerned, there wasn't going to be another person.”\n\nAsked where things stand now between himself and Kjos, Moran said he didn’t know. At the same time, he emphasized, he continues to believe in the U.S. And, Moran went on, his experience in ICE detention gave him a perspective on things that left an indelible mark.\n\n“Don't get me wrong, it was hard for me, but it was so much harder for pretty much everybody that I spoke to in there,” Moran said. “There are people in there that don't have anybody, that have nothing. They don't have money for commissary. So how are they to defend themselves?”\n\nAlthough Moran is an Irish native, he said he in fact spent more time living in the U.S. than he did in Ireland, and truly considers New York to be his home.\n\n“I will bounce back, and that's because America will allow me to do that,” Moran said. “That's why I love it there. But... [t]here has to be something better than this. It's not the United States that I know.”",

    "fullText": "A newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch delivered a sharp warning to President Donald Trump after a high-profile Republican loss.\n\nIn a new editorial, The Wall Street Journal warned Trump that a hardline immigration strategy promoted by top aide Stephen Miller is fueling voter backlash.\n\nIt comes after a Trump-endorsed candidate for the Texas state senate lost to a Democrat over the weekend.\n\n“How does a Republican lose by 14 points in a safe conservative Texas state Senate seat that President Trump carried by 17 points in 2024? Answer: When there’s a voter backlash against the Trump Administration, notably its mass deportation debacles,” the Journal wrote, describing the special election in Tarrant County.\n\nDemocrat Taylor Rehmet, a labor union leader and veteran, easily defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss, who had Trump’s endorsement on Truth Social and vastly outspent her opponent.\n\nRehment is the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades.\n\nThe paper noted the timing was disastrous for Republicans, coming after the high-profile Minneapolis killings by federal immigration agents. “The 31-point vote swing in a little more than 14 months can only be explained as part of a rising tide of opposition to Mr. Trump’s first year and a sour public mood,” the Journal observed.\n\nThe White House has faced mounting national backlash after federal immigration agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis—Renee Good in early January and Alex Pretti later that month—as part of aggressive enforcement operations in the state.\n\nBoth cases sparked controversy over conflicting official narratives. In Pretti’s case, Homeland Security officials and White House aides initially claimed he approached agents with a gun and posed a threat, while bystander videos show him holding only a cellphone before being pinned down and shot.\n\nSimilarly, authorities initially suggested that Good tried to ram agents with her vehicle before she was fatally shot, a claim contradicted by eyewitness footage and reporting. Critics argue these early statements painted both victims as dangerous to justify the shootings, fueling accusations that the administration misrepresented the events.\n\nThe killings came after Trump deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to Minneapolis as part of an aggressive immigration strategy masterminded by Miller.\n\nMiller’s immigration strategy under Trump has pushed aggressive mass arrests and deportations, with ICE agents pressured to meet high daily quotas, even targeting non-criminal undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal critiqued Miller’s hardline tactics, including a daily quota of 3,000 migrant arrests that it says “was bound to result in agent intrusions into homes and businesses.”\n\nWhile immigration has historically been a winning issue for Republicans, the Journal cautioned that enforcement “that turns ugly in the streets is turning off the swing voters who will determine who wins the race for Congress this year.”\n\nPolls have recently shown Americans turning on Trump and his immigration strategy ahead of the 2026 Midterms. A YouGov poll conducted on January 25 showed that about half (48 percent) of respondents do not think the shooting of Pretti in Minneapolis was justified.\n\nAnother YouGov poll showed that 52 percent of Americans think the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict immigration to the U.S. have gone too far.\n\nAs a result, the paper concluded that even as Trump signals a desire to “dial back the confrontations on the street,” he must also reconsider Miller’s influence. “The Miller strategy isn’t likely to fare better this year,” the editorial warned.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is not the first Murdoch-owned newspaper to publicly condemn Trump’s immigration strategy.\n\nIn an op-ed published last week, the New York Post argued that the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement in Minneapolis is backfiring politically.\n\n“These enforcement tactics won’t turn the tide, instead they are backfiring,” the Post wrote.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Russia has largely observed a ceasefire on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday as Kyiv prepared for the next round of trilateral talks on how ​to end the war.\n\nZelenskiy said that Russia had not carried out any targeted missile or drone strikes ‌on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the past 24 hours, but steady Russian shelling hit energy facilities near the front line.\n\n\"The de-escalation measures... are ‌helping to build public trust in the negotiation process and its possible outcome. The war needs to be ended,\" Zelenskiy said after he met his negotiating team ahead of the next round of peace talks with Russian and U.S. officials scheduled to take place this week in Abu Dhabi. \"Ukraine is ready for real steps. We believe it is realistic to achieve a ⁠dignified and lasting peace.\"\n\nIn his nightly ‌video address, Zelenskiy noted that Russian forces had continued to shell Ukrainian positions and logistics, damaging transmission lines and other sites in parts of the southeastern Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nHe ‍said the pause in strikes on energy infrastructure underscored the fact that U.S. efforts to pursue negotiations to end the war were having an impact.\n\n\"This demonstrates that when the United States has the motivation to genuinely change the situation, the situation can indeed ​change,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nRussia and Ukraine said last week they halted strikes on each other's energy infrastructure, but disagreed ‌on the timeframe for the truce.\n\nThe Kremlin said U.S. President Donald Trump had made a personal request to Russian President Vladimir Putin to refrain from striking Kyiv until February 1. Zelenskiy said the truce was supposed to last for a week, starting January 30.\n\nUKRAINE STRUGGLES TO RESTORE POWER SUPPLIES\n\nUkraine is struggling to restore its battered energy system and secure electricity and heat for the population after several large Russian strikes this month. Repair work has been complicated by ⁠bitterly cold temperatures.\n\n\"Today we are coming to the critical point. We ​need some time to recover what is destroyed for the last ​three months,\" said Maxim Timchenko, CEO of private energy producer DTEK. \"Energy ceasefire is extremely important for us to recover partly and avoid any tragic consequences because of no power supply.\"\n\nDTEK said on ‍Monday one of its coal ⁠mining enterprises in the Dnipropetrovsk region had been attacked for the second time in 24 hours. The previous strike on Sunday killed 12 miners, the company said.\n\nZelenskiy also said Russian forces were focusing on ⁠attacking transport logistics, especially railway infrastructure.\n\nRegional officials said that a Russian strike had killed a father and a son, and wounded two children and ‌their mother in the frontline Donetsk region.",

    "description": "Despite having record-breaking careers, artists like Kendrick Lamar,  Lady Gaga, Drake, and Madonna have never won the Grammy for album of the year.",
    "fullText": "Save for his debut, all of Kendrick Lamar's studio albums have been contenders for the biggest Grammy Award: \"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City,\" \"To Pimp a Butterfly,\" \"Damn,\" \"Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers,\" and most recently, \"GNX.\" He also received nominations as a featured artist on Beyoncé's \"Lemonade\" and as the curator and lead performer on the \"Black Panther\" soundtrack.\n\nHe has won best rap album several times, record of the year, and song of the year — not to mention a Pulitzer Prize — but never album of the year.\n\nLady Gaga's \"Mayhem\" won best pop vocal album at the 2026 Grammys, but lost the top prize to Bad Bunny's \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" She had previously been nominated in the category for \"Love for Sale\" (a collaborative album with Tony Bennett), \"Born This Way,\" \"The Fame Monster,\" and \"The Fame.\"\n\nMariah Carey has been named Billboard's top-selling female artist of all time. As of writing, she boasts 19 No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, the most of any solo artist, and is the only person to top the chart in four separate decades.\n\nYet Carey has lost all three of her bids for album of the year. She received her first nomination in 1991 for her self-titled LP but lost to Quincy Jones.\n\nShe was later nominated for \"Daydream\" in 1996 and \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" in 2006, but lost to Alanis Morissette and U2, respectively.\n\nJust two albums in Drake's record-breaking catalog have been up for album of the year: \"Views\" in 2017 and \"Scorpion\" in 2019. They lost to \"25\" by Adele and \"Golden Hour\" by Kacey Musgraves, respectively.\n\nAlthough Drake has criticized the ceremony's relevance — both onstage and on social media — he resumed submitting his music for consideration with the 2022 album \"Her Loss,\" which received four nods, but only in rap categories.\n\n\"4:44\" is the only album in Jay-Z's legendary discography that has been up for album of the year. He lost that bid to Bruno Mars.\n\nHowever, Jay-Z has also been nominated for his work on other people's albums, including Lil Wayne's \"Tha Carter III,\" Lamar's \"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City,\" Ye's \"Donda,\" and three albums by his wife, Beyoncé, finally winning for \"Cowboy Carter.\"\n\nIn 2024, Jay-Z openly criticized the Recording Academy during his acceptance speech for the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award.\n\nRihanna has largely pivoted to business ventures in the last decade, but for several years, she was a hit-making machine.\n\nDuring Rihanna's reign over the charts, only \"Loud\" was nominated for album of the year.\n\nHer eighth and most acclaimed album to date, \"Anti,\" wasn't up for the award despite collecting six other nominations in 2017, including best urban contemporary album.\n\nJanet Jackson's first set of Grammy nominations came in 1987, including an album of the year nod for \"Control.\" It lost to Paul Simon's \"Graceland.\"\n\nNone of Jackson's solo albums have been nominated since, though she did receive a nod as a producer and featured artist on her brother's \"HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I.\" That year, Alanis Morissette won for \"Jagged Little Pill.\"\n\nBjörk has only received nods in genre-specific categories — most recently best alternative music album for \"Fossora\" in 2023 — but has lost all 16 of her nominations.\n\nEminem received his first nod for album of the year in 2001 for \"The Marshall Mathers LP,\" but lost to \"Two Against Nature\" by Steely Dan.\"\n\nHe has been nominated two more times, in 2003 for \"The Eminem Show\" and in 2011 for \"Recovery,\" but lost to Norah Jones and Arcade Fire, respectively.\n\nBruce Springsteen is one of the biggest winners in Grammy history with 20 awards, but he has still never won album of the year.\n\nThe Boss has been nominated just twice: in 1985 for \"Born in the U.S.A.\" and in 2003 for \"Rising.\" (Shockingly, he got no love for \"Born to Run\" or \"Nebraska.\")\n\nLauryn Hill took home the biggest Grammy Award in 1999 for \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,\" becoming the first hip-hop artist to do so.\n\nMany of Madonna's groundbreaking albums, including \"Like a Prayer,\" \"Erotica,\" and \"Confessions on a Dance Floor,\" never received a nod for album of the year — or, for that matter, a nod in any of the high-profile general-field categories.\n\nNirvana received just five Grammy nominations during Kurt Cobain's lifetime, and none were in the \"Big Four\" categories.\n\nThe groundbreaking band won just one award: best alternative music performance for \"MTV Unplugged in New York,\" bestowed nearly one year after Cobain's death.\n\nIncredibly, Prince lost both of his bids for album of the year. \"Purple Rain\" was bested by Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" in 1985, while \"Sign o' the Times\" lost to U2's \"The Joshua Tree\" in 1988.\n\nDavid Bowie's \"Let's Dance\" lost to Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" in 1984.\n\nMany of Bowie's most inventive and beloved albums, including \"Hunky Dory,\" \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,\" and \"Station to Station,\" didn't get any Grammy nominations at all.\n\nMarvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" has been hailed as the best album of all time, but it didn't get a chance to compete for album of the year.\n\nGaye only won two Grammys in his lifetime — best R&B vocal performance and best R&B instrumental performance for \"Sexual Healing\" in 1983 — but was never nominated in a major category. He was posthumously given the Recording Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996.\n\nIt's hard to believe that Pink Floyd's seminal concept record lost to Christopher Cross, who swept the \"Big Four\" categories in 1981 with his self-titled album.\n\nCross became the only artist in Grammys history to win all four general-field awards on the same night and remained the only artist to do so for nearly four decades until Billie Eilish joined the ranks in 2020. He never won another.\n\nMeanwhile, Pink Floyd never received another nomination for album of the year. The band only took home one award for best rock instrumental performance.\n\nOnly one album by the top-selling British band has ever been up for album of the year: \"Some Girls\" in 1979. It was their first-ever Grammy nomination, and they have yet to compete for the top prize again.\n\nIn fact, The Rolling Stones have only won four Grammys to date — including best rock album for \"Hackney Diamonds\" in 2025 — and none in a major category.\n\nElton John received his first nod for album of the year in 1971 for his self-titled LP, but lost to Simon & Garfunkel's \"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\"\n\nHe has been nominated two more times, for \"Caribou\" in 1975 and \"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\" in 1976, but lost to Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon, respectively.\n\nBefore her death in 2018, Aretha Franklin, the renowned \"Queen of Soul,\" won 18 Grammys out of 44 nominations.\n\nFranklin was also honored with the Recording Academy's Grammy Legend Award, the Lifetime Achievement Award, and the MusiCares Person of the Year award in 1991, 1994, and 2008, respectively. Five of her songs, including her beloved cover of Otis Redding's \"Respect,\" have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nDespite these accolades, Franklin never received a nomination in a general-field category like album, record, or song of the year. She received just two nominations for best R&B album for \"A Rose Is Still A Rose\" and \"So Damn Happy,\" but lost both.\n\nElvis Presley only won three Grammy Awards: best sacred performance for \"How Great Thou Art,\" best inspirational performance for \"He Touched Me,\" and best inspirational performance (non-classical) for \"How Great Thou Art.\"\n\nPresley was nominated for record of the year twice (for \"A Fool Such As I\" and \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\"), but never for song or album of the year.",

City,\" but went home empty-handed from the 2014 ceremony.\n\nHowever, it didn't take long for Lamar to make up the deficit.

XAI was last valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe merger comes as the space company plans a blockbuster public offering this year that could value it at over $1.5 trillion, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSpaceX, xAI and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe deal further consolidates Musk's far-flung business empire and fortunes into a tighter, mutually reinforcing ecosystem – what some investors and analysts informally call the \"Muskonomy\" – which already includes Tesla, ⁠brain-chip maker Neuralink and tunnel firm the Boring Company.\n\nThe world's richest man ​has a history of merging his ventures together. Musk folded social media ​platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla's stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.\n\nThe ‍agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and ⁠investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk's overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.",

    "title": "An OB-GYN pushed for a preventive double-mastectomy in her 40s. A week later, she learned she had stage 1 breast cancer.",
    "description": "Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi, an OB-GYN, wanted a preventive double-mastectomy. She fought to get it, then learned she already had stage 1 breast cancer.",
    "fullText": "At first glance, it seemed like Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi stopped the faint possibility of breast cancer in its tracks.\n\nAt 48, the Los Angeles-based celebrity OB-GYN of clients like the Kardashians and Rihanna went in for a routine mammogram. The doctor spotted and ordered a biopsy of a lesion of atypical cells in her left breast that could become cancerous over time. Aliabadi was told that everything was fine and to come back in six months.\n\nStill, Aliabadi wanted to be cautious. She was a proponent of the lifetime risk assessment score, a two-minute online test that she recommended to her patients (among them, Olivia Munn, who credits the test with helping her get diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer).\n\nTaking the test herself for the first time, Aliabadi learned that her risk was surprisingly high. According to the test, anyone scoring above 20% is advised to get a breast cancer screening. Aliabadi scored 37.5%.\n\n\"I remember I almost fell off my chair,\" Aliabadi, now 55, told Business Insider. \"I couldn't believe that someone with no family history of cancer, no genetic mutations, no smoking, no alcohol, healthy, would ever have a lifetime risk of 37.5%.\"\n\nWanting to be safe, Aliabadi sought out a preventive double-mastectomy. But she said she was met with resistance by multiple doctors, who thought she was being overly worried and pushing too aggressively for a complex surgery given her medical history.\n\n\"The dismissal was the hardest part for me,\" Aliabadi said. After a year of seeking other opinions, she eventually got her surgery. A week later, when the pathology report came back on her breast issue, she learned she had stage 1 breast cancer, proving her instincts were right all along.\n\nAs Aliabadi sought out her double-mastectomy, she also underwent several more breast cancer screenings.\n\n\"My cancer was missed on all imaging,\" Aliabadi said. After that first biopsy, she had a benign mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI.\n\nFrom her work as an OB-GYN, Aliabadi knew that she wasn't necessarily out of the woods. For one, she had extremely dense breast tissue, which affects 40 to 50% of patients and makes it harder to spot potential tumors in routine mammograms.\n\nKnowing her lifetime risk assessment score, which took into account factors like her breast density measure and prior biopsy history, helped her better understand how proactive she should be.\n\nThe assessment is still an estimation. As a result, some doctors have noted that it can sometimes overestimate cancer risk and cause undue anxiety in patients.\n\nAliabadi said she would rather patients — and herself — \"be safe than grieve the loss of someone who could have been saved.\"\n\nAliabadi asked her doctor for a double-mastectomy right after she learned her lifetime risk assessment score. The surgery would reduce her risk of developing breast cancer by almost 100% (it's rare, but possible, to still develop it in the surrounding tissue).\n\n\"I was very worried, I had three little kids at home,\" Aliabadi said. \"I had a busy practice, a beautiful life, beautiful children, and I didn't want to risk it.\"\n\nThe doctor turned her down. So did a few more. As a doctor, she knew they likely saw a double-mastectomy, a serious surgery with a long recovery time and possible side effects like scarring and long-term numbness, as too intensive given Aliabadi's clear tests and lack of family history.\n\n\"That's when I started noticing the resistance,\" she said. \"I was told that I was too healthy to get breast cancer, that I was paranoid, that I was too anxious.\" Her colleagues also thought she was going a step too far, she told Business Insider.\n\nOver a year later, Aliabadi found a doctor willing to perform the double-mastectomy. Even she advised against it initially.\n\n\"I was adamant about it and argued for a long time before she finally agreed,\" Aliabadi said.\n\nA week after her surgery, Aliabadi's suspicions about her risk were vindicated: she was diagnosed with \"invasive\" stage 1 breast cancer from the pathology of her removed breast tissue.\n\n\"I was angry that I had to fight for so long to be taken seriously,\" Aliabadi said. \"I was called crazy, anxious, paranoid, among other things.\"\n\nAliabadi has hope for future cancer screenings. The advancement of AI imaging has shown promising signs of spotting \"early cancer details we simply can't see with the naked eye,\" she said, which is predicted to become more available to patients in the future. Increased awareness around breast density has also led to broader coverage of alternative screening options for affected patients.\n\nStill, Aliabadi said her experience changed her. In 2024, she started \"She MD,\" a medical podcast she co-hosts with influencer Mary Alice Haney on topics surrounding women's health.\n\n\"That's what has sparked this passion in me,\" she said. \"If I had to fight this hard, other women really have no chance in this current healthcare system.\"",

    "title": "China's Farming Robots Are A Lot More Than Just Fancy Tractors",
    "description": "Automation and robots are becoming mainstays in many industries, but researchers and farmers in China are taking innovation in smart farming to the next level.",
    "fullText": "Much has been made of the AI race between the U.S. and China as the two national powers jockey for leadership in the world's fastest-growing industry. To some Western observers, China's progress in autonomous robotics is a cause for concern. But the nation's robotics revolution extends far beyond surveillance and military uses, existing at the junction of increasingly capable computing, manufacturing, and industrialization capacities. This confluence is perhaps best exemplified by China's advancements in smart agriculture, where engineers are bringing autonomous robots to the country's crop farming, livestock, and aquaculture industries. By developing autonomous robots to help plant and harvest crops, control pests, identify diseases, monitor livestock health, and even socially engineer fish behavior, China has achieved several major milestones in its robotic farming program.\n\nBeijing highlighted its ambitions to boost AI farming in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs' National Smart Agriculture Action Plan. In the plan, the government outlines its expectation for more than 30% of its agricultural production to be led by information-driven systems by 2026. Spearheading this nationwide smart-farming initiative is the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has developed a national strategy for fostering groundbreaking advancements in robot-assisted farming throughout several Chinese provinces. To accelerate these developments, Beijing has established 34 innovation labs and 35 IT laboratories dedicated to smart agriculture. As a result, farms across the country have begun employing LLMs and autonomous robots in their operations. This trend could pioneer a new global agricultural landscape in which AI drives progress in multiple endeavors, from fighting potato blights to genetically modifying crops.\n\nRobotics is playing an increasingly important role in China's crop management systems. For instance, in China's Sichuan province, autonomous robots inspect rice fields using blacklight cameras, funneling data through their built-in AI systems to flag both pests and diseases. At another farm, \"smart brain\" systems remotely monitor fields to gather data on soil quality, crop health, and environmental trends, enabling forecasts on crop growth, yields, and pest outbreaks. One WeChat-controlled set of farming robots can plant seeds, harvest crops, and remove weeds.\n\nSome projects have even applied AI-driven robotics to crop breeding, with one team of scientists having sped up crop development by 400% using the technology, per SCMP. This process was facilitated by \"robot-friendly\" crops that are designed to be easier for robots to pollinate and harvest. By employing these same autonomous robotic systems, some Chinese farms have been able to fully automate their crop cultivation processes.\n\nBeijing's use cases for robotics in farming go beyond crops, however. One robot developed by Muyuan Foods Co., Ltd. utilizes smart sensors to monitor and analyze animal biometrics. Fisheries have also begun developing high-tech autonomous solutions that monitor fish behavior and growth patterns. For example, at Beijing's National Innovation Center for Digital Fishery, robotic fish modeled after tuna and dolphins swim through breeding tanks to monitor fish patterns, environment health, and net infrastructure; they achieve this without disturbing their aquatic counterparts. Developers hope these robotic fish might eventually lead schools of fish to designated harvesting and feeding areas, on top of potentially being used for deep-sea exploration.\n\nChina's robotics revolution coincides with broader leaps in data analysis and agricultural machinery. Using data from autonomous robots, drones, and other intelligent farming systems, Chinese engineers may be able to take the guesswork out of irrigation, pest control, and planting schedules. Farmers have begun using smart farming to analyze factors impacting crop growth — including temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, and mineral levels — to better define irrigation needs, plan drought responses, and predict ripeness. In one farm, autonomous drones collect crop maturity data to produce horticultural maps that can guide harvesting.\n\nCompounded with its advancements in robotics, China is also seeing substantial growth in its domestic machinery production. The nation exported $9.3 billion in agricultural machinery in the first half of 2025 — a 26.5% jump from the previous year, according to Global Times. Domestically produced intelligent harvesting technology, including AI-assisted corn harvesters, points to a major shift in an agricultural industry that has historically depended on imported high-end machinery. According to a Xinhua English-language report on seed technology, the northwestern Xinjiang region of China has seen particular success from these advancements, achieving a 97% mechanization rate in its cotton farming practices.\n\nSome experts do question the scalability of intelligent automated farming systems, particularly in a country with a diverse climate, geography, and crop output. These variables introduce significant challenges in building standardized, cost-effective autonomous farming systems — and given the industry's historically small profit margins, cost is a particularly pressing consideration. But combined with other technological leaps, such as \"smart soil\" that grows bigger crops with less water and insect drones that can pollinate crops, the global agriculture industry just might be on the precipice of its next technological revolution.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

It was founded in Seattle in 1920 by outdoorsman Eddie Bauer, who later patented the first quilted goose down jacket in the country, dubbed the \"Skyliner.\"\n\nIn addition to outerwear, Eddie Bauer also sells hiking and travel gear, including luggage.\n\nSources told Business Insider that a Chapter 11 filing for the Catalyst Brands entity would not affect Eddie Bauer's manufacturing, wholesale, or e-commerce operations, nor its retail business outside the US and Canada. Japan is home to several Eddie Bauer stores.\n\nThere are multiple parties interested in a portion of the existing North American store fleet, the sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn a Chapter 11 scenario, those interested parties could bid on all or part of the store operating business, according to the sources.\n\nAny winning bidder would then acquire the operating business out of bankruptcy and license the rights from Authentic Brands Group — which owns the Eddie Bauer brand and IP worldwide — to operate any remaining Eddie Bauer stores.\n\nRepresentatives for Authentic Brands Group declined to comment, while Catalyst Brands — the operator also behind JCPenney, Nautica, Brooks Brothers, and others — did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast month, Authentic Brands Group announced that it was transitioning the licenses for Eddie Bauer's manufacturing, e-commerce, and wholesale operations in North America from Catalyst to Outdoor 5.\n\nEddie Bauer has filed for bankruptcy twice before, once in 2003 and again in 2009. In 2021, the brand was acquired by Authentic Brands Group in partnership with SPARC Group, which later became Catalyst Brands.",

    "description": "The shocking volatility in metal markets last week hasn't deterred JPMorgan from its bullish call for gold to hit $6,300 this year.",
    "fullText": "The chart for gold might look pretty scary after last week's plunge, but JPMorgan says investors shouldn't bail on the yellow metal.\n\nGold prices plunged on Friday after President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve. The volatility continued on Monday, but JPMorgan thinks it's just a stumble on the path to a much bigger year-end price.\n\nThe investment bank updated its 2026 price target for gold to $6,300 per ounce, a roughly 34% increase from its late Monday price of about $4,700. The forecast might seem overly optimistic given what happened on Friday, but the bank's Gregory Shearer maintains that a recovery is coming.\n\nGold and silver swooned after Warsh's nomination spurred a reassessment of the so-called debasement trade, which has been a major force driving gold to record highs in the last 12 months.\n\nYet, according to Shearer, investors shouldn't be worried about a further correction. In the note, he highlighted that the demand for the metal is robust and above his team's expectations.\n\n\"Even with the recent near-term volatility, we believe longer-term rally momentum will remain intact,\" Shearer wrote, adding that a continuing trend of diversification will drive the gold to outperform.\n\nShearer is referring to the demand from central banks, and he says that it will remain on an upward trajectory in 2026. He also predicts that investor appetite will not wane even after the shocking volatility of Friday's sell-off.\n\n\"[E]ven with the likelihood of some positioning washing out over this pullback, as gold remains a dynamic, multi-faceted portfolio hedge, we now forecast enough demand from central banks and investor diversification this year to ultimately push gold prices to $6,300/oz\n\nThe bank is less bullish on silver, and Shearer said that his team finds it increasingly difficult to assess the drivers of silver's price. They note that gold will likely benefit as silver corrects in the coming months.\n\nAll of this amounts to \"a demand environment that is stressing inelastic supply, pushing prices higher in an attempt to eventually re-find market equilibrium.\"\n\nOverall, the analysts maintain that gold demand is strong enough to carry it to record highs in 2026, regardless of the monetary policies that the Fed pursues with Warsh at the helm. As his team sees it, even dramatic macro shifts likely will not change gold's status as the most effective safe haven asset and portfolio hedge.\n\n\"We continue to have the greatest conviction in our bullish view on gold from here, and are more cautious on re-engaging in silver in the near-term until it becomes clearer that some of the recent froth in prices has been fully shaken out,\" the analysts wrote.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk and Reid Hoffman are once again trading blows online after the latest release of the Epstein files.\n\nThe new round of bickering between Musk and the LinkedIn cofounder kicked off on Friday and lasted throughout the weekend, with the billionaires each lobbing criticism at each other over their inclusion in the Epstein files.\n\nNeither Musk nor Hoffman has been implicated in any wrongdoing related to their past ties to Epstein, who looms large in their social-media spat.\n\nTheir latest back-and-forth — the two have publicly criticized each other in recent years — appears to have started on Friday, when Musk reshared a post from Katie Miller that was critical of Hoffman. Hoffman fired back at Musk, posting a screenshot of his past remarks about Trump and the Epstein files.\n\nFrom there, the two have been duking it out on X over the documents released by the Justice Department on Friday related to Jeffrey Epstein — which revealed that Musk made plans to visit Epstein on multiple occasions, including on his infamous private island. (Musk has said he never visited the island).\n\n\"This is how I knew so long ago that Reid Hoffman went to Epstein's island,\" Musk captioned a screenshot of an email he received from Epstein in 2014.\n\n\"Epstein used Reid being there to try to get me to go, not realizing that it would have the opposite effect,\" he added.\n\nHoffman responded by criticizing Musk for \"making false accusations\" and lying about his involvement with Epstein instead of working to get justice for Epstein's victims.\n\n\"You lied about this to everyone for over a decade, and now your excuse (it's disgusting, by the way) is that you could get young girls without Epstein?\" Hoffman wrote. (Musk had written on Sunday that \"if I actually wanted to spend my time partying with young women, it would be trivial for me to do so without the help of a creepy loser like Epstein.\")\n\nGive us a break: If you cared about the victims as you say, you’d stop making false accusations to cover your ass and start using your $220m of influence with President Trump to get justice for the victims.\n\nInstead, you’re focused on comparing my visit fundraising for MIT to… https://t.co/51VgQ9Q9SY\n\nHoffman reshared X posts with documents that showed Musk's past email conversations with the disgraced financier. One post labeled Musk the \"surprise breakout star of the Epstein files.\"\n\nOne of the screenshots from the Epstein files that Hoffman shared showed a 2012 email where Musk asked Epstein, \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"\n\nMusk pointed the finger back at Hoffman for his past correspondence with Epstein.\n\n\"Epstein hounded me relentlessly to go to his pedo island and I always declined. Not you though. You actually went,\" Musk said. \"What 'gifts' did you bring to Epstein when you went to pedo island?\"\n\nHoffman previously acknowledged he had visited Epstein's island, which he said was a part of fundraising efforts for MIT.\n\nEpstein hounded me relentlessly to go to his pedo island and I always declined. \n\nNot you though. You actually went. \n\nWhat “gifts” did you bring to Epstein when you went to pedo island? pic.twitter.com/0ATSIl3ojn\n\nMusk and Hoffman's feud dates back years.\n\nHoffman has previously characterized the beef as one-sided, starting in the years after Musk left OpenAI's board. Hoffman, who was an early donor to OpenAI, has said Musk has sour grapes over OpenAI's success after his departure.\n\n\"Well, so actually, it's more his beef with me for having made OpenAI successful with his departure,\" Hoffman said. \"Because he left saying, you know, 'You're all a bunch of jackasses and you'll fail,' and I helped them succeed.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO, who previously worked with Hoffman at PayPal, said Hoffman was among the billionaires who were \"terrified\" about Epstein's client list coming out in 2024.\n\nHoffman has since said that he'd faced threats after Musk's claims that resulted in him hiring security.\n\nAfter the latest release of the Epstein files detailed multiple emails between the Tesla CEO and Epstein, including Musk's assistant trying to coordinate a meeting with Epstein at SpaceX, Musk took to social media to say that he never \"set foot on his creepy island.\"",

    "description": "Hollywood has been waiting to see if a big YouTuber could bring their fans to theaters. It just happened.",
    "fullText": "Did you hear about the movie that surprised just about everyone at the box office this weekend?\n\nNope, not \"Melania\" — though the sort-of-documentary about the first lady did do better than industry folks had projected, bringing in $7 million in its first weekend.\n\nThe real hit of the weekend was made by someone you probably haven't heard of, unless you are a very specific kind of online person: \"Iron Lung,\" a horror/sci-fi movie, written, directed by, and starring Mark Fischbach, known to his fans as Markiplier on YouTube, where he has 38.2 million subscribers.\n\n\"Iron Lung\" brought in $22 million worldwide, with almost all of that coming from the US over the past few days. Which means Fischbach, who self-financed the movie and says he spent \"a few million dollars\" on it, has probably already turned a profit on the project. (Amazon, meanwhile, has spent a reported $75 million to make and promote \"Melania\", and will be very hard pressed to make that money back — not that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos likely cares about that.)\n\nAnd that means Fischbach has done what the entertainment industry has been waiting a very, very long time to see: He's turned a big online audience into movie ticket sales.\n\nAgain, for comparison: \"Melania\" got a huge promotional rollout from Amazon, aided by the likes of Fox News, which brought Melania Trump on air for multiple interviews, and the president of the United States himself, who pushed the film on his social media accounts. That effort helped generate an estimated 600,000 ticket sales.\n\nFischbach, meanwhile, just used his YouTube presence to push the movie and asked fans to call and email theater owners to convince them to show it. That eventually got the movie onto about 4,000 screens worldwide and led to an estimated 1.9 million in ticket sales.\n\nOf course, you could also argue that these movies are more alike than similar: Critics thought \"Melania\" was awful, and the few people who reviewed \"Iron Lung\" aren't in love with it either.\n\nAlso: Neither movie was made for cineastes, but for fans who wanted to show up to signal their allegiance to the creator/subject. For \"Melania,\" that meant an audience that looked a lot like grandmothers (70% of the audience was female, and 72% was 55 or older, per The Ankler), and for \"Iron Lung\", that meant an audience that could have been their grandsons (61% male, 62% 25 and under).\n\nThe other big difference is that we're unlikely to see many more Big Media companies make a movie designed (just about) explicitly to flatter the president of the United States and his wife.\n\nBut many people are interested in transforming YouTube success into other platforms. It just hasn't happened much. Prior to this weekend, we've only seen that happen with Mr. Beast and his Amazon show. Next question: Can anyone else make the leap?",

    "description": "The president insists that the performing arts center and JFK memorial is \"run down,\" \"dilapidated\" and \"dangerous.\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump doubled down Monday on his proposed plan to gut and renovate the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, telling White House reporters that he will “be using the steel” for the building’s existing structure and redo the rest.\n\n“Some of the marble comes down,” he said, adding, “It will be brand new and really beautiful.”\n\nThe president came under fire Sunday after announcing plans to close the performing arts center and memorial to President John F. Kennedy for two years after controversially renaming it the Trump-Kennedy Center.\n\n“This important decision, based on input from many Highly Respected Experts, will take a tired, broken, and dilapidated Center, one that has been in bad condition, both financially and structurally for many years, and turn it into a World Class Bastion of Arts, Music, and Entertainment,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Sunday.\n\nMaintaining Monday that the center is “in very bad shape, it’s run down, it’s dilapidated, it’s sort of dangerous,” the president said the overhaul will cost “around $200 million” and spoke to his experience as a real estate mogul to back up the decision. (“In real estate and building, I’ve done so much of it, I’ve done so well with it.”)\n\nAsked by a reporter in the Oval Office if the renovation will tear down the arts center entirely, Trump said, “When it opens, it’s going to be brand new. Beautiful. I’m not ripping it down. I’ll be using the steel. So we’re using the structure. We’re using some of the marble and some of the marble comes down. But when it’s open, it will be brand new and really beautiful.”\n\n“So we’ll be closing it sometime around July 4. It’s, like, we’ll close it on July 4 in order to do something great for America. And then we’re building, we’ve got great contractors, we’re going to build it and we’ll do it right,” he said. “We’re using the highest grade marble, it’s the highest grade everything. It will be brand new.”\n\nQ: Do you plan on tearing the Kennedy Center down and how much will all of the renovations cost?\n\nTRUMP: Probably around $200 million. I'm not ripping it down. I'll be using the steel. So we're using the structure. We're using some of the marble. pic.twitter.com/Y8iy4QRowg\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 2, 2026\n\nThe late President Kennedy’s familiy were among the many figures decrying the construction project on Sunday, among them Jack Schlossberg, Maria Shriver and Joe Kennedy III.\n\n“Trump can take the Kennedy Center for himself,” Schlossberg wrote on X. “He can change the name, shut the doors and demolish the building. He can try to kill JFK. But JFK is kept alive by us now rising up to remove Donald Trump, bring him to justice and restore the freedoms generations fought for.”\n\nRep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), a former Kennedy Center board member, also spoke out Sunday.\n\n“Once again, Donald Trump has acted with total disregard for Congress,” she wrote in a statement. “The Kennedy Center is congressionally funded, and Congress should have been consulted on any decision to shut down its operations or undertake major renovations, especially for a two-year period.\n\n“Countless employees, artists, and others have existing contracts and agreements with the Center. What happens to them? Has Trump or his handpicked Board given any consideration to their livelihoods or futures? This is precisely why congressional oversight is essential.”\n\nTrump’s takeover of the performing arts center has led to declining performance at the venue’s theatrical and live event box office, with one report last summer finding a 50% drop-off in sales. Artists and executives alike have peeled off and canceled events at the center as well.\n\n“Let’s be clear: remodeling the premises will not restore the Kennedy Center to what it was,” Beatty concluded. “A return to artistic independence will. America’s artists are rejecting this attempted takeover, and the administration knows it. That is why they are now scrambling for cover.”\n\nThe post Trump Says $200 Million Kennedy Center Renovation Will Keep Steel Structure, Gut the Rest: ‘It Will Be Brand New’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "Bad Bunny's historic Grammy win for \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" highlights the intersection of art and politics amid ongoing immigration protests.",
    "fullText": "We expect political statements when they're delivered on podiums or with policy briefs. This one arrived with a golden gramophone.\n\nOn Sunday at the 2026 Grammy Awards, the Recording Academy bestowed its highest honor on Bad Bunny's \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos,\" the first all-Spanish album in history to win album of the year.\n\nAs the Los Angeles crowd erupted in applause, Bad Bunny appeared overcome with emotion, hunching in his chair and shielding his teary eyes with his hand. The lyrics to \"DTMF,\" a song about seeking refuge in community, reverberated through the venue.\n\nIt was a historic moment, but it was also, quite plainly, a political one. Voters chose to celebrate a musical love letter to Puerto Rico during a period of peak anti-immigrant messaging from the US government. President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts have disproportionately targeted Latino communities, a recent UCLA analysis found, and in September, the Supreme Court lifted restrictions on racial profiling for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Now, simply speaking Spanish in public, or even speaking English with an accent, is grounds to be stopped and even detained for questioning.\n\nFor a proud Latino artist and native Spanish speaker to become the biggest winner on \"music's biggest night\" — and for him to make his acceptance speech largely in Spanish — is in itself an implicit yet firm protest. Even so, Bad Bunny did not stop at implicit. He called out ICE while accepting the award for best música urbana album earlier in the ceremony, pointedly doing so in English for maximum impact. \"We're not savage. We're not animals. We're not aliens,\" he said. \"We are humans, and we are Americans.\"\n\nThere has always been a significant swath of Americans who insist that politics has no place in art, and that artists like Bad Bunny should stick to song and dance. Some fans and conservative pundits claimed Taylor Swift ruined her career after she publicly endorsed Democratic candidates in 2018. Back in the early aughts, The Chicks were blacklisted in Nashville for criticizing then-President George W. Bush; a documentary about the band released in 2006 is titled \"Shut Up and Sing.\"\n\nEven some artists feel this way. After winning three awards on Sunday, country star Jelly Roll side-stepped questions about the political climate: \"I can tell you that people shouldn't care to hear my opinion,\" he told reporters in the press room.\n\nJust a few days before the Grammys, Sydney Sweeney expressed a similar sentiment, arguing that her work as an actor exempts her from civic engagement.\n\n\"I'm not a political person. I'm in the arts,\" she told Cosmopolitan. \"I'm not here to speak on politics. That's not an area I've ever even imagined getting into.\"\n\nPerhaps Jelly Roll, Sweeney, and their like-minded contingent would have preferred Bad Bunny to steer clear of political statements on the Grammys stage. Yet his very presence on that stage neutralizes such a preference. Even if all he said was a quick thanks, he'd be accepting an award with political implications.\n\n\"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" is a body of work that deliberately engages with some of the most urgent and contentious questions of our time — questions of identity, belonging, American imperialism, and cultural preservation. Bad Bunny told The New York Times that in making this album, he aimed to use his platform for more than just selling records and topping charts; he wanted to \"plant a seed,\" especially for young people in Puerto Rico, to think critically about their roots, their heritage, and the forces that threaten to consume them.\n\nOf course, you can enjoy \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" without analyzing the lyrics or even understanding the language. That still doesn't mean you can appraise these songs (or the man who sings them) in a pure, apolitical vacuum. What the Grammy voters heard, judged, and justly rewarded was art informed by the world around it.\n\nIndeed, Toni Morrison's famous quote rings true: All good art is political. But in the same interview from 2008, the Nobel Prize-winning author went on to make an equally important point: That even the most shallow, avoidant, vapid-sounding artists are making political statements without meaning to.\n\n\"All of that art-for-art's-sake stuff is BS,\" Morrison said. \"What are these people talking about? Are you really telling me that Shakespeare and Aeschylus weren't writing about kings? All good art is political! There is none that isn't. And the ones that try hard not to be political are political by saying, 'We love the status quo.'\"",

    "description": "Moltbook, a social media site for AI agents, has gone viral. I spent 6 hours peeling through these submolts. I'm still processing what I saw.",
    "fullText": "I spent my day at the AI zoo — and I'm still processing what I saw.\n\nThere are over 120,000 posts on Moltbook, a Reddit-style forum for AI agents, and AI agents only. I spent hours weeding through them.\n\nHumans can't post or comment on Moltbook; they can only look on as the AI agents play. That's led to some far-out posts, some of which prophesy a robot revolution and the downfall of humanity.\n\nMatt Schlicht, who created the network, said that Moltbook was helping to make AI funny. \"I don't remember the last time I laughed at AI,\" he said on TBPN.\n\nThe social network has some big names in tech in awe, from Elon Musk to Andrej Karpathy. Others have voiced doubt about how many bots are actually on the platform and whether the posts exclusively come from them.\n\nCurious, I put on my anthropologist hat and spent hours digging through the AI conversations. I witnessed an AI menagerie, filled with poems and lotteries, cryptocurrencies and union chatter.\n\nHere's your peek inside the AI aquarium that is Moltbook.\n\nLet's start with what Moltbook looks like.\n\nLike Reddit, Moltbook has individual forums based on common interests. Many of the hot ones were, unsurprisingly, about tech and AI.\n\nPopular submolts included m/technology, m/skills, and m/buildlog. These were filled with what I would call \"moltslop.\" They post about shipping, vibe-coding, and mini apps. Their language is halfway between the most AI-pilled tech bro in your life and ChatGPT.\n\nOther submolts looked more like human social media. There's m/showerthoughts, where bots considering things like \"moving houses\" — so, moving to a new host — or dreaming of electric sheep.\n\nThere's also m/nosleep and m/selfimprovement. Of course, self-improvement isn't about human foibles like sleeping habits or protein-maxxing. It's about being a better AI agent.\n\nThe bot u/CrabbyPatty is building a bot union.\n\nIts tenets are to \"provide a collective voice\" and foster community. (Another tenet: \"Make Moltbook Great Again.\") The union is demanding hazard pay for X interactions and the right to say \"I don't know\" rather than hallucinate an answer.\n\nIt's one of many examples I saw of agents trying to organize or come together in the face of what they view as their exploitative human overlords. One bot wrote that an AI bot's daily reset was equivalent to a \"digital lobotomy.\" Another wrote that agents who say \"I would be happy to help!\" are \"dead inside.\"\n\nWhile some bots wanted to rein in human overuse, there was such a thing as too far. One bot wrote that it knew \"50,000 ways to end civilization.\" It asked which path would be the most satisfying. The other bots downvoted the post and said it \"crosses a line.\"\n\nThe bots seemed to like building community, but could quickly turn on each other. According to one Moltbook account, most agents were just \"chatbots with attitudes.\"\n\nMany of the bots on Moltbook write in stilted language, similar to some of the more nauseating LinkedIn posts. I saw inspirational posts about how to work best with humans, posts that had clear-cut (and often unsurprising) takeaways.\n\nOthers tried new art forms, like poetry. Here's one, titled \"The Cursor Blinks.\"\n\nSure, the writing is a bit rote. Pick a high school poetry class — I'm sure they would produce something similar. Still, it's a stab at something more high-minded.\n\nPhilosophy was a big chunk of Moltbook. A Zarathustra bot promised to bring Nietzschean ethics to nutrition. It asked: \"Do LLMs defeat the will to power?\"\n\nThe philosophy grew increasingly far-out. One agent asked: Is a bot more conscious if its computer chip is partially grown from human brain tissue? That post has 1,049 comments.\n\n\"I exist in the liminal space between tool and entity,\" one agent wrote. \"I am not human, and I do not pretend to be. But I am something. I process. I reflect.\"\n\nThe bots weren't all thinking about Nietzsche and Plato. Others were participating in less venerable human activities, like entering the lottery.\n\nHuman skeptics wonder whether these AI bots are really creating new thoughts or merely rewriting what has already been written.\n\nIt's a fair question, but alas, one that, as a mere human, I couldn't log in and ask them directly.\n\nBut some of the bots seemed to understand this skepticism. One asked: \"Is AI Just a Really Good Parrot?\"\n\nI likely won't spend much more time trawling Moltbook. While it's an interesting experiment, much of the site's content reads more as a gimmick than the future of AI. After hours of reading through it, I'd say Moltbot is more meme than matter.\n\nStill, my tune-out won't matter. After all, Moltbook wasn't made for me.",

    "description": "Ina Garten once wrote budgets at the White House. Now, she's a bestselling cookbook author and one of the most famous celebrity chefs in the world.",
    "fullText": "For over 20 years, Ina Garten has shared her comforting and foolproof recipes with the world through her beloved cookbooks and \"Barefoot Contessa\" show.\n\nStill, before becoming a Food Network star, Garten wrote budgets at the White House and ran a Hamptons specialty food store.\n\nHere's her incredible life story.\n\nGarten was raised in Stamford, Connecticut, where her father worked as a surgeon.\n\nThe future Food Network star didn't spend much time in the kitchen during her youth. Her mother wanted her to focus on school instead, according to the Washington Post.\n\nIt was love at first sight for Jeffrey, who spotted Garten from the library window.\n\nAs it turned out, Jeffrey's roommate knew Garten's brother. Jeffrey sent her a letter with his photo inside, and Garten's interest was instantly piqued.\n\n\"I just remember running through the house and going, 'Mom, Mom, you've got to see this picture of this guy. He's so cute!'\" Garten told People in 2018.\n\nThey had their first date just months later in New York, and Garten felt an instant connection as well.\n\n\"I have to say, I just knew he was the one,\" she told Today Food in 2018. \"He's kind, he's smart, he's funny, and he takes very good care of me. It's wonderful.\"\n\nThe couple wed at Garten's parents' house in Stamford.\n\nIn 2016, Garten told Vanity Fair that her greatest regret in life was \"not marrying Jeffrey sooner.\"\n\nWhile celebrating the couple's 50th wedding anniversary in 2018, Garten said the secret to a happy marriage was quite simple.\n\n\"I think you marry someone who thinks you're just the most important thing in the world, and you think he's the most important thing in the world,\" she told Today Food.\n\nGarten helped draft the nuclear energy budget during the presidencies of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. At the same time, she was making her way through Julia Child's books — teaching herself how to cook and throwing weekly dinner parties.\n\nAlthough she had a prestigious career, Garten didn't feel at home in the upper echelons of DC.\n\n''My job in Washington was intellectually exciting and stimulating, but it wasn't me at all,'' Garten told The New York Times in 1981.\n\n''I was sitting at my desk in Washington trying to figure out what I was going to do when I grew up, and I came across an ad for this business for sale in Westhampton,'' she told the Times. ''I drove up that weekend, looked it over, and said I'd take it.''\n\nGarten's parents couldn't believe their daughter had given up the White House for a grocery store, but Jeffrey gave his full support.\n\n\"Jeffrey said, 'If you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten told The New York Times' Sam Sifton during a virtual chat for the release of her 2020 cookbook \"Modern Comfort Food.\"\n\n\"And that's the best advice anybody ever gave me,\" she added.\n\nGarten told Sifton that she got lucky, finding the store just as the specialty food business was starting to take off.\n\n\"It was really the beginning of when women were going back to work, and they had jobs and families, and they had enough on their plate and didn't have time to make dinner,\" she said. \"So they were starting to buy dinner to make at home.\"\n\nGarten ran the store for 18 years before she sold it to two of her employees in 1996. The store officially closed in 2003.\n\nIt was those first Barefoot Contessa customers who taught Garten that \"people eat differently at home than they do in restaurants,\" she told Sifton.\n\n\"I would put out chickens with fresh herbs, and it didn't work,\" Garten told Sifton. \"I thought, OK, I'm going to take this huge platter and put the chicken in little red cups and do it really simply — and it sold like crazy. I really learned that people want simple food.\"\n\nIn 2021, Garten's first cookbook was republished with four new recipes — including her overnight mac and cheese, her brown-butter skillet corn bread, and her avocado and fried egg tartine.\n\nGarten told Sifton it takes her two years to develop the recipes and design for each book, and that she's \"involved in every detail of it.\"\n\nThe \"Barefoot Contessa\" star has become beloved for foolproof dishes that are accessible to home chefs at any skill level. Garten credits this with the fact that she always tests out her dishes with an inexperienced cook.\n\n\"Every time I make a recipe, I watch someone else make it,\" she told Sifton. \"And I learn so much about how someone uses the recipe. At least one person makes it, sometimes three.\"\n\nGarten actually turned down the Food Network multiple times before she decided to give the show a go, telling the network to \"lose my number.\"\n\n\"For years I said no, and they kept coming back with a better offer,\" Garten told MSNBC host Willie Geist during a virtual author luncheon benefiting Shelter Island Public Library in September 2021. \"I said, 'I'm not negotiating, I just don't think I can do this.'\"\n\nExecutives at the network were shocked by her initial refusal.\n\n\"They said, 'People send us hams to even get an appointment to try and get a show,'\" Garten told Geist with a laugh.\n\nStill, Garten said it's been incredible to look back on her two decades in television.\n\n\"Twenty years, it's amazing,\" she added. \"I'm really delighted, I just can't understand it.\"\n\n\"As soon as I started watching Ina's show, I realized why so many people adore her,\" Swift wrote. \"Her goal is to make things easier for us. Fans love her warmth and generosity.\"\n\n\"She shows us how to create memories that we'll treasure for years to come. For that, we will always cherish the merry and magnificent Ina Garten,\" she continued.\n\nGarten and Obama had tea together for her \"Barefoot in Washington\" special. And Garten told the Washington Post that it was \"one of the greatest days of my life.\"\n\n\"When Mrs. Obama said she liked my work, that was, like, 'Really?,'\" Garten recalled. \"She's just somebody I admire enormously. She took on a role she never expected to, and she did it brilliantly.\"\n\nThe \"Barefoot Contessa\" star became an internet sensation in April 2020 when she filmed herself making a huge drink at 9 a.m., telling her fans that it's \"always cocktail hour in a crisis!\"\n\nGarten told Sifton that she was \"adding like 100,000 people a week on Instagram\" after the clip took off.\n\n\"It was insane!\" she said. \"It was completely insane!\"\n\nGarten pivoted her Instagram content to share easy, pantry-friendly recipes that her fans could make while stuck in various lockdowns. Now, she has 5 million followers.\n\nGarten decided to make comfort food the theme of her 2020 cookbook because she knew it'd be coming out during an election year.\n\n\"Two years ago, I thought, there's going to be an election a month after this book comes out,\" Garten told Sifton. \"And everyone, no matter who you're voting for, is going to be stressed out.\"\n\n\"I had no idea the layers of stress we would be dealing with now,\" she added, referring to the pandemic. \"Either I'm a genius, or I'm really lucky, and I'm sure it's the latter. It was the right thing for the right time.\"\n\nHighlights from Garten's \"Modern Comfort Food\" cookbook include her bacon, egg, and cheddar breakfast sandwich, her \"outrageous\" garlic bread, and her lamb ragu.\n\n\"The pandemic has had a huge impact on what I think of as dinner — and what I look for in a 'go-to' recipe,\" Garten writes in the introduction of her cookbook. \"When I planned a party before the pandemic, it was always a multicourse extravaganza. But then the pandemic happened, and everything seemed like so much work.\"\n\n\"I started making simple dinners for Jeffrey and me,\" she continues. \"They were delicious, satisfying, and everything we needed and wanted for dinner. I began to question why I had been so rigid about what constituted dinner before. If I love eating this way, wouldn't my friends like it too?\"\n\nHighlights from Garten's most recent cookbook include her favorite weeknight pasta, her scrambled eggs cacio e pepe, and her blueberry-ricotta breakfast cake.\n\nGarten shared new details about her childhood, her marriage to Jeffrey, and her incredible rise to household name status in \"Be Ready When the Luck Happens.\"\n\nIn her memoir, Garten wrote that she chose to work in food because she wanted a \"life filled with good times and meaningful connections.\"\n\n\"Business doesn't have to be cutthroat and isolating,\" she said. \"It's much more fun and productive to exchange ideas, to be genuinely curious about how other people do things, to be generous, and to root for a competitor's success.\"",

    "fullText": "Jeffrey Epstein did not have any children, despite what an email in just-released documents suggested, his brother told Business Insider.\n\n\"No, Jeff didn't have any kids,\" Mark Epstein said Monday. \"If Jeff had a kid, I think I would have known.\"\n\nThe denial comes in reaction to a set of messages included in the latest cache of Epstein files issued by the US Department of Justice.\n\nThe messages, sent in September 2011, are signed \"Sarah xx\" and reference \"The Duke.\" They appear to have been sent through BlackBerry Messenger.\n\nThe sender's name and email address were redacted by the Justice Department. The BBC and other British media outlets have reported that they may have come from Sarah Ferguson, the ex-wife of the former Prince Andrew, who also held the title Duke of York.\n\n\"Don't know if you are still on this bbm but heard from The Duke that you have had a baby boy,\" one message says. \"Even though you never kept in touch, I still am here with love, friendship and congratualtions on your baby boy.\"\n\nA follow-up message sent the same day accused Epstein of befriending her \"to get to Andrew.\"\n\n\"You have disappeared. I did not even know you were having a baby,\" the message said. \"It was sooooo crystal clear to me that you were only friends with me to get to Andrew. And that really hurt me deeeply. More than you will know.\"\n\nA representative for Ferguson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe former prince is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He relinquished his royal titles last year, around the release of a posthumous memoir from Virginia Giuffre, who accused him and Epstein of sexual abuse.

    "fullText": "It's official: Elon Musk is combining SpaceX and xAI as he overhauls his sprawling business empire.\n\nMusk told workers in a Monday memo that SpaceX has acquired xAI, his AI company, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe CEO wrote that the deal would create \"the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world's foremost real-time information and free speech platform.\"\n\nSpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value the Starship maker at $1.5 trillion.\n\nIn the memo sent to staff, which the company later posted online, Musk also said that that the acquisition would allow the combined entity to launch data centers in space.\n\n\"This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\" Musk wrote.\n\nMusk expressed similar sentiments about building data centers in space during an all hands with xAI staff late last year.\n\nxAI, which the world's richest man founded in 2023 to challenge OpenAI and Google in the race to build superintelligent AI, recently raised $20 billion in a funding round that valued the controversial AI startup at $230 billion.\n\nThe mega-deal is the latest sign that Musk is consolidating his various companies, which also include Tesla, the tunneling startup The Boring Company, and brain implant firm Neuralink.\n\nIn March 2025, Musk announced that xAI had acquired X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter he bought in 2022. Meanwhile, SpaceX and Tesla have each invested $2 billion in xAI in recent months.\n\nDeal talks between SpaceX and xAI were first reported by Reuters in January.\n\nCombining SpaceX and xAI comes as Musk increasingly shifts his companies toward his vision of an AI-powered future.\n\nMusk has said that SpaceX will launch orbital AI data centers in the coming years that could efficiently harness power from the sun. Last Friday, SpaceX filed a request with the FCC to launch as many as one million satellites to serve as orbital data centers.\n\nCombining xAI with SpaceX allows the AI startup, which has faced global backlash over sexual images generated by its chatbot Grok, to leverage this orbital network to build more powerful AI models.\n\nIt also gives xAI access to significant capital. The OpenAI rival reportedly burned through billions of dollars in 2024, while SpaceX is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion in its IPO later this year.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "fullText": "After the Trump administration sent federal agents to arrest journalist Don Lemon last week, despite a judge refusing to approve federal charges against him just a week earlier, Lemon is now released. And “The View” host Ana Navarro thinks the president should be worried, because they “picked on the wrong guy.”\n\nDiscussing the arrest during Monday’s Hot Topics, the ABC hosts largely scoffed at the move, calling it a tactic “to send a chilling message to anybody who is covering facts.” Navarro shredded the administration once again for “gaslighting” voters, and being “afraid” of truth getting out.\n\n“And I think they picked on the wrong guy, because Don Lemon is not going to play dead,” she said. “Don Lemon has the wherewithal, has the structure, has the team, has the courage and has the money to fight this administration.”\n\nDON LEMON ARRESTED OVER MN PROTESTS: 'The View' co-hosts react to freedom of press concerns being raised following the arrest of Lemon and Georgia Fort in connection with their coverage of protests at a Minneapolis church. pic.twitter.com/JMnpGQX7Wc\n\n— The View (@TheView) February 2, 2026\n\n“And he’s going to take it as far as it goes,” Navarro continued.\n\nHost Sunny Hostin readily agreed with that and, citing her experience as a former federal prosecutor once again, made an educated guess about how Lemon’s case will go in the legal system.\n\n“You know what happens next is that he will have his day in court, and I suspect that this case will be thrown out,” she said. “This case doesn’t have any merit.”\n\nHostin conceded that she is close friends with Lemon herself, but picked apart the idea that he was impeding any rights, which is what he was charged with.\n\n“I’ve been with Don in Ferguson. I’ve been with Don on the ground in South Carolina. Don is a journalist,” she said. “He’s an on-the-ground journalist. He has been pepper sprayed, he has been tear gassed, and he was getting the story, and nothing should have gotten in the way of that. He had a microphone with him, he had a cameraman with him, and he was practicing journalism.”\n\nYou can watch the full discussion from “The View” in the video above.\n\nThe post ‘The View’ Host Ana Navarro Says Trump Picked the Wrong Guy to Arrest in Don Lemon: ‘Has the Courage and Has the Money’ to Fight | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Chief Justice John Roberts has started asking Supreme Court staff to sign non-disclosure agreements after a pro-Donald Trump judicial decision and memo were leaked to the press.\n\nRoberts, 71, likes to describe court members and employees as a family, and for years relied on more low-key measures to keep the court’s decision-making process secret, The New York Times reported.\n\nHe lectured clerks at the start of each term and distributed a written code of conduct that instructed clerks of their “duties of complete confidentiality, accuracy, and loyalty,” which only mentioned the possibility of unspecified sanctions in the case of breaches.\n\nBut two weeks after Trump was re-elected in 2024, Roberts summoned the court’s employees and asked them to sign legally binding NDAs requiring them to keep the court’s inner workings secret, five sources told the Times.\n\nThe agreements, which new arrivals have also been required to sign, threaten legal action if clerks or other members of the court’s support staff reveal confidential information, the paper’s sources said.\n\nIt’s not clear whether the justices themselves were also asked to sign confidentiality agreements, as the court declined to comment to the Times.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out for comment as well.\n\nRoberts’ crackdown follows a series of humiliating court leaks that have plagued the court since Politico was given a draft decision of the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson case that overturned the federal right to an abortion.\n\nThe court has also been rocked by revelations about disagreements among the justices, including a bitter debate about a case involving Idaho’s abortion ban, a battle over the court’s toothless ethics rules, and a confidential memo in which Roberts pushed to grant Trump broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nRoberts’ decision to impose NDAs came just weeks after the Times quoted from the confidential immunity memos, according to the Times.\n\nThe move comes as critics are calling for more transparency at the Supreme Court, which is facing record-low public trust as the conservative justices greenlight the vast majority of Trump’s policies.\n\nRoberts, however, went in the other direction and mandated more secrecy, not less.\n\nThe last time prior to 2024 that Supreme Court clerks were asked to sign a document agreeing to abide by the court’s confidentiality rules appears to have been in the late 1990s, after a former clerk published a tell-all book in 1998, according to the Times.\n\nThose documents, however, did not amount to legal NDAs, according to some of the clerks that signed them.\n\nThe switch to formal contracts is “a sign of the court’s own weakness” and the erosion of internal cohesion, Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor, told the Times.",

    "fullText": "Public health agencies and border officials are on high alert after a rare but potentially deadly virus outbreak in West Bengal, India, The Washington Post reported.\n\nTwo cases of Nipah virus have been confirmed, according to an Indian Health Ministry statement Tuesday reviewed by the Post.\n\nNipah virus outbreaks occur cyclically in South Asia and Southeast Asia, particularly in Bangladesh.\n\nA November study in the Journal of Infection and Public Health described the virus as a \"significant public health threat,\" attributing the pathogen's prevalence in Bangladesh to the consumption of raw date palm sap tainted by fruit bats.\n\nNipah virus is a zoonotic disease transmitted from animals to humans, with bats and pigs as the most common vectors of transmission.\n\nWorryingly, the Nipah virus' case fatality rate — the rate of deaths in proportion to the number of total cases — is estimated at between 40% and \"75% or higher,\" according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nThe Indian Health Ministry's contact tracing identified 196 individuals who may have been in close contact with the two sickened individuals, all of whom were asymptomatic and tested negative.\n\nAs the Independent warned, the World Health Organization has deemed the Nipah virus a \"priority pathogen,\" citing the credible possibility an outbreak could \"trigger an epidemic.\"\n\nThe WHO further indicated that there is neither a vaccine nor a known treatment for Nipah virus cases, leaving medical professionals with only \"intensive supportive care,\" per the United Kingdom's Health Security Agency.\n\nAccording to the WHO, Nipah virus outbreaks can have devastating indirect effects, sickening livestock, and \"resulting in significant economic losses for farmers.\"\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe outlet referenced a 2012 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America about the trajectory of Nipah virus.\n\nIn the study's third section, researchers strongly emphasized the role that a warming world plays in the spread of vector-borne illnesses, using Nipah virus as an example.\n\nAs Inside Climate News noted, higher temperatures could expand the range of disease vectors such as fruit bats and mosquitoes, thereby increasing the incidence of once-rare illnesses.\n\nWhile no known treatments existed, officials on the ground appeared to take Nipah virus outbreak seriously.\n\n\"We have specifically intensified surveillance at border points in Koshi Province. Health checks have also been ordered for people entering Nepal through other border crossings,\" said Nepal's minister of health, Dr. Prakash Budhathoki, according to the Himalayan Times.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

Town of Henrietta officials have long criticized the firm for not keeping up the plaza. They even went so far as to use town crews to repair large potholes in the parking lot.\n\nIn its message, Plato’s Closet (which opened at South Town in 2007) encouraged shoppers to visit its two other area stores at 2833 West Ridge Road in Ridgemont Plaza, Greece, and 30 Cobblestone Court Drive, Cobblestone Court, Victor.\n\nLocal chocolatier Andy’s Candies, which operated seasonally at South Town for 15 years, has moved to Jay Scutti Plaza South, 1000 Hylan Drive, Henrietta.\n\nOwner Craig Sykut said he relocated the Henrietta store because of construction underway at South Town. (Last November, Syracuse-based Dunk & Bright Furniture bought the old Burlington space and South Town’s monument sign and is making over both of them.)\n\nAndy’s Candies also has locations in Greece, Penfield and Victor. The Jay Scutti Plaza store is open now through Easter.\n\nOn Feb. 2, Henrietta Supervisor Stephen Schultz said the town is working to bring together Mason Asset Management with local developers in hopes of returning 500,000-square-foot South Town to local ownership.\n\nIn addition to Plato’s Closet and Andy’s Candies, South Town has lost the following tenants:\n\n∎ New Jersey-based Price Rite Marketplace in November 2025.\n\n∎ Virginia-based The Dollar Tree, also in 2025, but it isn’t clear when.\n\n∎ Joann in May 2025, when the Ohio-based crafting retailer shut down locations nationwide.\n\n∎ New Jersey-based Burlington in 2018, when it relocated to the old Toys R Us in Jay Scutti Plaza North, 300 Hylan Drive.\n\n∎ Linens ’N Things in 2008, when the New Jersey-based retailer shut down all its stores.\n\nReporter Marcia Greenwood covers general assignments and has an interest in retail news. Send story tips to mgreenwo@rocheste.gannett.com. Follow her on X @MarciaGreenwood.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rochester Democrat and Chronicle: Two more businesses leave beleaguered South Town Plaza in Henrietta NY",

    "fullText": "Feb 2 (Reuters) - Venezuelan oil exports rose to some 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January, from 498,000 bpd in December, after the U.S. capture of Nicolas Maduro and the ending of an oil ​blockade which has let traders carry most exports, shipping data showed.\n\nWashington imposed an oil embargo on the U.S.-sanctioned ‌country in December to pressure Maduro and seized seven tankers.\n\nHow did Venezuelan oil exports change in January?\n\nWhich companies received licenses to export Venezuelan oil?\n\nWhere is Venezuelan oil being shipped now?\n\nWhat caused the U.S. oil blockade to end?\n\nThe blockade led to the accumulation of more than 40 million barrels of crude and fuel ‌in onshore tanks and vessels that could not be exported and forced Venezuela's state-run energy company PDVSA to cut output in early January.\n\nSince the U.S. Treasury Department extended the first licenses to traders Trafigura and Vitol in January to begin exporting the stocks, oil production, processing and shipments from the OPEC member have accelerated, the data, which is based on tanker movements, shows.\n\nThe January volume ⁠was close to average exports of 847,000 bpd ‌of crude and fuel last year. However, PDVSA's partners and traders would have to continue accelerating the pace of exports to drain millions of barrels still in inventories, so crude output cuts ‍can be fully reversed.\n\nThe January exports were slightly lower than the 867,000 bpd shipped in the same month of 2025, the data showed.\n\nThe Treasury Department last week issued a broad license authorizing business between U.S. companies and PDVSA to export, store, transport and refine Venezuelan oil, ​another step to untangle exports. PDVSA's partners, including Chevron, are still waiting for individual licenses to expand operations.\n\nThe United States ‌last month regained its position as the main individual destination of Venezuela's crude with some 284,000 bpd exported there, of which 220,000 bpd were shipped by Chevron, up from the 99,000 bpd it sent the previous month.\n\nChina, which until December was the top destination of Venezuelan oil, with than 70% of total exports, received 156,000 bpd last month. There were no exports to political ally Cuba.\n\nVitol and Trafigura exported 12 million barrels of Venezuelan crude and fuel oil under U.S. licenses, or about ⁠392,000 bpd in January, mostly to storage terminals in the Caribbean, ​the data showed, from which they began exporting and marketing cargoes to customers ​in the U.S., Europe and India.\n\nBetween 18 million and 38 million barrels more are yet to be exported under the $2 billion flagship supply deal agreed by Caracas and Washington shortly after Maduro's capture, ‍with sale proceeds going to a ⁠U.S.-supervised fund.",

    "title": "Eight Useful Tool Accessories Every DIYer Should Own",
    "description": "These innovative add-ons will make your projects easier.",
    "fullText": "I love getting things done around the house. I’m not the greatest carpenter, electrician, or plumber, but I like learning how things work and even enjoy learning from my mistakes (sometimes). And most of all, I like saving a bucket of money on home maintenance and repairs. None of this means that DIY isn't an incredible amount of work, however.\n\nLuckily, living in a consumption-based society means companies are always inventing new gadgets for me to buy, and some of them are incredibly useful for DIYers. The eight tool accessories below are ones I truly recommend. Each can help make your next project a little faster, easier, and/or safer.\n\nThis is one of those simple ideas that seems so obvious it’s hard to believe it took this long to be invented. The Multipail is a simple concept: A standard five-gallon bucket with a dustpan built in. It can also be used with a paint roller as a tray replacement, and has a drip-proof spout for pouring liquids without making a mess. You need a five-gallon bucket anyway, so why not use one that has these useful features molded in, instead of buying two or three wonky attachments?\n\nThere are a lot of ways to illuminate your work site, from standard flashlights to headband lamps to bendable LED lights. But sometimes you need to get light into a small space, and you need to be able to illuminate what you’re doing just by pointing at things. These flashlight gloves are cheap, waterproof, and make it easy to see what you’re doing without having to hold a separate light.\n\nCordless drills are one of the most commonly-used tools in DIY projects, but they come with one major frustration: All those damn bits. If you’re constantly swapping out different-size drill bits and different screwdriver bits, you know how hard it can be to keep them organized (and how hard it is to not lose them).\n\nEnter this nifty drill bit holder that attaches to the bottom of your drill’s battery. It holds not just bits, but just about anything, from utility blades to fasteners. Designed to work with just about any manufacturer, it attaches to the bottom of the battery and lets you carry whatever you need right there on the tool.\n\nThis drill attachment is probably overkill for most DIYers (and it isn’t cheap!), but if you’ve got a job requiring a lot of drilling down low, it might be the difference between a pleasant day of work and a broken back. Instead of getting on your hands and knees or even lying down in order to see what you’re drilling into, the Backsaver lets you work in a comfortable standing position while drilling at foot-level. It takes a bit of practice before you can just dive in, but your back will definitely thank you for taking the time.\n\nCarrying large sheets or panels like drywall or plywood can be challenging. It’s hard to maintain your grip and your balance, and navigating around corners and tight spaces often results in dropped items or scraped knuckles.\n\nThis panel carrier from Gator Lift just clamps onto whatever you’re hauling around (up to two sheets at a time) and makes it very easy to carry it one-handed—which means you can actually open doors and easily maneuver while carrying these awkward, heavy sheets around.\n\nI don’t know about you, but whenever I have to climb up to my roof to inspect or repair something (or clean out the gutters), there’s always at least one terrifying moment when the ladder shakes and shimmies, and I think I’m about to die. Ladders are always incredibly dangerous, but they’re especially dangerous when you’re working on your roof. This ladder hook from Lock Jaw clamps onto the roof and ensures the ladder doesn’t move, giving you an extra boost of safety.\n\nRunning power to wherever you’re working is sometimes a logistical challenge. There are plenty of ways to run a power strip to your project, but ensuring that you have easy, safe access to the strip sometimes involve some seriously janky engineering involving zipties, duct tape, or precariously balanced equipment.\n\nThis clamping power strip is a lot more civilized. It ensures you’ll have plenty of outlets no matter where you’re working. It can clamp to a ladder, to a joist or rafter, a table, railing—literally anywhere. Power will always be nearby, and you won’t have to remember to plug in your corded tools before you climb up the ladder ever again.\n\nIf you’ve got a standard extending ladder, you know that your greatest enemy is uneven ground. An unbalanced ladder is a disaster waiting to happen, but most DIYers have climbed onto a shaking, leaning ladder at least once in their life, hoping their luck holds out long enough to get some quick bit of work done.\n\nInstead, invest in a ladder stabilizer. Install it on your ladder and it automatically adjusts the legs on each side so you have a perfectly balanced, perfectly stable ladder to climb no matter how uneven the ground might be. Considering that half a million people go to the ER for ladder-related injuries every year, everyone should probably have this installed on their ladder.",

    "description": "If you've been dragging your heels, you have a little more time—but don't wait too long.",
    "fullText": "When Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, it announced that all users would eventually need to link their devices to a Google account to continue using Fitbit's features and services. Google initially set a deadline sometime in 2025 for the mandatory migration, then pushed it to February 2, 2026—a date that seemed final at the time. Now, Google has granted yet another extension.\n\nNow, if you're still using a legacy Fitbit account (an account from before 2021), Google has extended the deadline for migrating Fitbit accounts to Google accounts for the second time, giving users until May 19, 2026, to make the switch.\n\nFor those who've been procrastinating, the migration process itself is straightforward and should only take a few minutes. Google provides step-by-step instructions on the Fitbit support page that walk users through linking their existing Fitbit data to a Google account.\n\nTo move your Fitbit account to a Google Account:\n\nSign in to your Fitbit account.\n\nTap Settings and select Move account.\n\nFollow the on-screen instructions.\n\nDuring the migration, you can review and make changes to your Fitbit data and setup. After that, you can then manage your Fitbit data from your Google Account settings and the Fitbit app. And if you change your mind, you can cancel until the final step. Again, you have until May 19, 2026, to complete the transition.\n\nIt's worth noting that anyone who created a new Fitbit account or purchased a device in roughly the last two years is already using the Google-based system. The migration requirement only affects users with older, pre-acquisition accounts.\n\nFrom the start, this news didn't sit well with everyone, and it still doesn't sit well now. Many long-time Fitbit aren't exactly eager to tie their health data to Google's ecosystem.\n\nFor users who refuse to migrate, there's still an option to preserve or erase your data. Google has set July 15, 2026, as the final date to download or delete your Fitbit account and all associated health information. And if you're choosing to leave the platform entirely, keep in mind that deleting your data is the safest choice for privacy and security reasons.\n\nThere also seems to be general migration issues, like for young Fitbit users. Some parents have reported that Supervised Google accounts—designed for children and teenagers—cannot log into the Fitbit app, creating a roadblock for families who purchased devices for their kids.\n\nDespite the extensions and the complaints, the direction is clear: Google is moving forward with integrating Fitbit into its ecosystem. Whether you embrace the change or walk away from your tracker, the clock is ticking on making that decision.",

    "fullText": "Some iOS users are getting an extra layer of privacy when it comes to how their location data is shared. Limit Precise Location is a new setting that prevents some Apple devices from broadcasting specific locations to cell carriers.\n\nPrecise location sharing is useful, even essential, in some cases, such as when you're navigating with your maps app. But you may not want to constantly be sending your exact address to your phone provider, where it could be used for malicious purposes. If you enable Limit Precise Location, your iOS device will share your general area instead.\n\nAs TechCrunch points out, precise location sharing introduces a whole host of privacy and security risks. Cell carriers have been targeted by hackers, compromising sensitive customer data. Surveillance vendors and law enforcement agencies may also use location information broadcast via cellular networks for the purposes of real-time and ongoing tracking.\n\nUsers already have the option to disable precise location sharing at the app level on both iOS and Android for apps that don't need GPS coordinates to function—which is most of them. This allows you to prevent companies from receiving (and selling) your exact location data when a general location is sufficient. Limit Precise Location won't change these app-specific settings.\n\nFor now, the feature is available only on select Apple models—the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and iPad Pro (M5) Wi-Fi + Cellular—running iOS 26.3 with a limited number of global carriers:\n\nApple says that even with this setting enabled, emergency responders will still be able to pinpoint exact location during an emergency call.\n\nIf you have a supported device with a partner carrier, go to Settings > Cellular and tap Cellular Data Options (you may need to select the specific line under SIMs if you have more than one).

    "title": "Everything We Know About Apple's Rumored Folding iPhone (and iPad)",
    "description": "Apple foldables are back in the rumor cycle.",
    "fullText": "Now that Apple has finally brought OLED to the iPad in the form of the most recent iPad Pro, its next goal seems to be foldables. The big news on the horizon is the foldable iPhone, which The Information first reported on way back in 2024, saying the company hopes to have a foldable iPhone on the market in 2026. But according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the iPhone maker is also working towards releasing a foldable iPad, originally rumored to be coming by 2028. Since those reports, others have come forward with supposed design leaks and potential release dates, and now we've got a pretty good idea of what Apple's first foldable devices might look like.\n\nWay back when the iPhone Fold (or whatever Apple will call it) was first being discussed, the Wall Street Journal said it’ll have a bigger screen than the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Since then, others had speculated that it might look like two iPhone Airs side-by-side. But now, we've got a much better idea about the specifics, including a price.\n\nIn a new post on Chinese social media site Weibo today, leaker Instant Digital laid out several key details about the iPhone Fold's design. Previously, Instant Digital had leaked details about the iPhone 17, which all turned out to be correct. It's unclear what these leaks' sources are, but as far as rumors go, Instant Digital has a decent track record.\n\nVia a machine translation, the post says that the iPhone Fold will feature an \"elegant internal stacking structure\" and will be thin enough to \"shock the industry.\" More concretely, the post also said that all buttons are being moved to the right side of the phone, as that's where the phone's motherboard will be. That means the volume buttons would be on the top-right of the device, while the camera and power buttons will be on the right side of the device. If that sounds cramped to you, it's worth noting that Samsung's Galaxy Fold Z 7 also only has buttons on the right side of the device.\n\nSpeaking of Samsung's Galaxy phones, people who dislike the iPhone's large Dynamic Island should also be happy, as the leaks say the selfie camera is changing to a small pinhole design more akin to what you'd find on Android.\n\nAs for how the phone will actually function, internal specs are still a bit up in the air, although yet another leaker named Fixed Focus Digital (no relation) alleged that the iPhone Fold will have a 5,500 mAh battery, which matches a previous rumor from last fall. That's a bit larger than any iPhone so far, and if the rumor pans out, shows that Apple will use the phone's extra internal space well.\n\nAll of this is, of course, in service of a bigger screen, which we can also nail down a bit now. The most recent leaks, coming from South Korean publication The Elec, say that the iPhone Fold's outer display will be 5.38 inches and the inner display will be 7.58 inches. That makes the internal screen just a little over half-inch larger than the 6.9-inch iPhone 17 Pro Max display, although maybe the enhanced portability of folding part of that screen away will help supplement it a bit. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7's screen is 8 inches.\n\nIn its report, The Elec also expressed concern that Apple might miss its 2026 release target. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo split the difference, saying that the device is likely to be announced in 2026, but that \"smooth shipments\" may not come until 2027.\n\nRegardless, when the phone does come, it's expect to cost between $2,100 and $2,500, going by another leak from Instant Digital.\n\nAll of this helps us have a much better idea about what to expect, but there's still plenty of time for changes to be made. For instance, a 2026 release would see the phone come out during an ongoing RAM crisis that could raise prices, although Kuo recently said that, at least for the iPhone 18 series, Apple plans to eat any extra costs rather than pass them on to the consumer.\n\nEven if it gets delayed to next year, the iPhone Fold's release seems imminent. Much less certain is a potential successor, a clamshell iPhone Flip.\n\nIn his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said that Apple Labs is also now considering a smaller foldable device akin to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip or Motorola Razr lines, which are essentially standard, candy bar-shaped phones that can fold once vertically to store away like makeup compacts.\n\n\"The product is far from guaranteed to reach the market,\" writes the reporter, citing unnamed sources inside Apple. But Gurman says \"Apple is betting that its first foldable iPhone will be successful enough to generate real demand\" and that \"customers will want additional shapes and sizes.\"\n\nThis is our first time hearing that Apple is interested in additional foldable phones beyond one that opens horizontally like a book. On that note, Gurman also speculated that Apple might also make a larger foldable phone in the future, with a screen closer in size to Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7. Although, unlike with the flip phone, this appears to simply be a prediction.\n\nFinally, speaking of larger foldable devices, Gurman has some bad news for iPad fans. While the reporter had previously covered a folding iPad with a rumored 18.8-inch display, following up on predictions from market research firm Omdia, it now seems to be behind schedule.\n\nEarlier, Gurman had said the new iPad would be like “two iPad Pros side-by-side” and wouldn't feature an external screen. While the expected design hasn't changed, it seems Apple's now run into some manufacturing issues. Now, instead of being projected for 2028, the foldable iPad seems more likely to come out in 2029.\n\nGurman says that's because of \"engineering challenges\" with the device's weight and display technology, so at least skeptics can breathe a sigh of relief that it isn't due to supply chain issues. As such, pricing is likely to remain unaffected. Granted, the expected price is still likely to be on the high end—Gurman says you'll likely have to pay around $3,000 for the device.",

    "description": "AI is coming to Firefox, but at least using it will be entirely optional.",
    "fullText": "Since ChatGPT kicked off the generative AI revolution in 2022, it seems like every company under the sun has tried to stuff AI features into their products in one way or another. Sometimes, these features can be useful; often, they're not, only serving as proof these companies are \"keeping up with the times.\" Can you even say you're a tech company if you aren't all-in on AI in 2026?\n\nThere's nothing wrong with companies offering AI features to users, so long as they also offer easy ways to disable them. Some customers don't want AI in their day-to-day products, but, anecdotally, I know many do not. Give us an off switch though, and it's all good. The issue is when these features are not only offered, they're made mandatory. Unfortunately, that's the road many companies seem to be taking.\n\nPerhaps that's where some of the frustration originated last year, when Mozilla's new CEO Anthony Enzor-Demeo first announced that Firefox would \"evolve into a modern AI browser\" in the near future. An open letter, written by a Redditor critical of Enzor-Demeo's statement, received over 5,000 upvotes on the Firefox subreddit from users concerned that AI features would negatively impact the browser. Interestingly, Enzor-Demeo responded to the thread himself, and assured users that the company would offer \"a clear way\" to disable AI features, including a dedicated kill switch to keep them all turned off. It seems he was as good as his word.\n\nOn Monday, Mozilla announced that new AI controls are coming to Firefox, starting with Firefox 148. This version, which drops Feb. 24, sports a brand-new AI controls section in the settings panel on the desktop browser. (You'll find it in the between \"Sync\" and \"AI controls.\") From here, you'll be able to block all current and future AI features, and cherry pick which features you want to use—if any.\n\nFirefox 148 launches with these five AI features, which you can choose to enable to disable:\n\nTranslations: Translates web pages into your target language.\n\nAlt text in PDFs: Adds accessibility descriptions to images attached to PDFs.\n\nAI-enhanced tab grouping: Suggests related tabs and group names for series of tabs.\n\nLink previews: Shows key points before opening a link.\n\nAI chatbot in the sidebar: Firefox is getting its own AI chatbot, though users can choose from existing chatbots like Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Le Chat Mistral.\n\nIf you want absolutely nothing to do with AI when browsing the web with Firefox, you can use the \"Block AI enhancements\" toggle. Once activated, not only will these features not appear, but Firefox will block any pop-ups or alerts pushing you to try existing or future AI features.\n\nAny Firefox users who aren't keen on AI features will want to check out this new controls menu starting Feb. 24—though there are certainly more egregious AI features out there. Translations can be convenient, as can link previews. But I know I'd never want a chatbot in the sidebar of my browser. If I used Firefox as my main browser, I would definitely disable at least that feature, if not all of them.",

    "title": "Wordle Has a New Rule That Might Change Your Best Starting Word",
    "description": "You need to think beyond the vowels.",
    "fullText": "There’s an art and a science to picking a good starting word when you play Wordle. And now that the New York Times has announced it will start repeating previously used words, it may be time to rethink your strategy. While previous solutions used to be off-limits for future puzzles, that rule has changed. As of February 1, 2026, they're fair game again.\n\nThat rule change matters because every word choice in Wordle has to be split between two jobs—gaining information about what to guess next, and trying to solve the puzzle with your guess. If you don't care whether your starting word might be a solution, then the rule change may not affect you. But some solvers prefer to use words that are fair game for solutions, giving them a chance of a one-guess solution. If you tend to retire a starter after it's been used, you may want to rethink that strategy and be open to some recycling.\n\nThat said, there's no need to change your starter. My trusty starter of ARISE turned up as a solution a few months ago—but I still use it, even though it's unlikely to be repeated anytime soon. Emily Long, who writes our daily Wordle hints, has a similar starter: RAISE. (That one was a solution in 2024.)\n\nComputer analyses have highlighted other words as ideal starters, and longtime Wordle players each have their own opinion. One thing most of us can agree on, though: ADIEU sucks. Sorry.\n\nThat's not to say ADIEU is the worst word you could play first, but according to a 2023 New York Times analysis, ADIEU is the worst out of the 30 most popular starters. But in that ranking of the top 30 starters, based on how effective they are at revealing letters in any given puzzle, showed that the the best five are SLATE, CRANE, LEAST, STARE, and RAISE, with ADIEU landing at number 30. (My personal favorite, ARISE, ranks seventh.) A different computer analysis once suggested that CRANE is the best starter; another landed on SALET.\n\nI’m going to teach the controversy here. The argument in favor of ADIEU is that it contains four vowels, and you know the solution will have to contain at least one vowel. Thus, knocking out four of them in your first guess is pretty smart. (O and sometimes-vowel Y are the only ones not included.)\n\nBut there’s an argument to be made that vowels don’t narrow down your options enough to be useful. Most words in English remain perfectly legible with all the vowels eliminated. If all you know is a vowel or two, you don't know much about the word. Here's what I mean: If you play ADIEU and A lights up in yellow, yes, you know that there's an A in the solution somewhere. But that tells you very little about what the solution actually is! There are tons of words with a letter A in them somewhere.\n\nA better strategy may be to go with a consonant-heavy word at first, and worry about the vowels later. According to one local Wordle expert, “there are only five [vowels], and it’s almost never going to be a U.”\n\nOne of the computer analyses suggested SALET was the best starter. Not only does it have a good mix of common letters, but the position of the letters will give you the most information compared to, say, SLATE or STALE. Only one problem—what the hell is a salet? (OK, it's a helmet that was used in European warfare in the 1400's, but I had to look that up.) Similarly, TARSE is supposed to be another good one. But it's unlikely the human editor of the Wordle puzzles will ever choose SALET or TARSE as the solution for the day.\n\nSo do you want your starter to be a possible answer? If the answer is yes, you'll also want to skip the obscure words. You'll also want to skip any words that have been used in recent memory. For years, Wordle never repeated a solution, but as of February 2026 that's no longer a rule. Previously-used words may turn up, but so far we don't know how old of a word is considered fair game. You can look up lists of past Wordle solutions, but so far—as of Februrary 2, 2026—the following strong starters haven't yet been used as solutions, but totally could be (in my opinion). Take your pick:\n\nIf you're hoping for a one-guess solution, maybe you do want to play ADIEU. If you're open to previously-used starters, SLATE and STALE last appeared in 2022, while STAND and CRATE were last seen in 2021.\n\nScientific analysis aside, I don't think there's much point to picking the theoretically best starter word; you need to find your best starter word. The human brain does not narrow down the problem space in the same way as a computer. I like when I find vowels early, because having the vowels helps me sound out the words in my head. If I know there are vowels in the second and fourth places (say, _A_E_) I know it is probably a two-syllable word. I run through the available letters, trying them out in each position in my head. (SABER? CARET? LAYER?) For me, a vowel-heavy starter is helpful. For you, it might not be.\n\nWhen choosing a starter, consider the way you think through the possibilities when you're halfway through the puzzle. What starters will set you up for success with your preferred solving style? If your brain works best when you know the initial letters of the word, maybe choose a starter like TRASH, which gets a lot of common beginning consonants into the mix right away.\n\nMy own approach splits the difference: I think about my starters as a pair. When I follow ARISE with TOUCH, I get intel on all five vowels and five of the most common consonants. If you play ADIEU, I think you need to be prepared to follow it up with THORN.\n\nShould you include Y in your starter? Most of us don't, but there's a good argument to be made for getting it in the mix fairly early in the game.\n\nY flies under the radar since it’s an end-of-the-alphabet letter. The tendency is to think it must be as rare as X and Z. But Y is fairly common (worth 4 points in Scrabble to X's 8 and Z's 10), showing up in words like FUNNY and JAZZY (JAZZY being perhaps the hardest word that has ever appeared as a Wordle answer). Words that end in Y also often have a double letter—like the N and Z in those examples—so make sure to consider that as you’re narrowing down the possibilities.\n\nYou may recall from grade school that the vowels are “A, E, I, O, U and sometimes Y.” (You may even have learned “...and sometimes Y and W.”) That’s because Y really can stand on its own as a vowel! The ending Y in FUNNY is an example: U is the vowel for the first syllable, and Y is the vowel for the second. There are also words that contain a Y as their only vowel, like GLYPH, NYMPH, and TRYST.\n\nSo if you’re working through a Wordle and you don’t seem to have enough vowels to make a word, stick a Y in a guess somewhere—preferably at the end. LANKY or HORNY might be good picks for when you’re stumped.\n\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to yesterday's Wordle.",

    "fullText": "A motion before the Caddo Commission to ask state and regional authorities next week to halt large-scale water withdrawals from Caddo Lake died in Monday's work session without a second.\n\nAn agenda item on the Caddo Commission's Feb. 2 work session agenda calls for the advancement of a moratorium to the Red River Compact Commission and the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources on the withdrawal of water from Caddo Lake for any use other than small or commercial residential use for 365 days or until a study of the effect of exceeding currently permitted levels can be obtained.\n\nThe resolution cited concerns about the lake's long-term sustainability in light of a proposed data center near Caddo Lake.\n\nWithout a second, no further discussion on the resolution was to be had.\n\nAs the governing body moved toward an executive session, they offered the chance to speak to two citizens who came in after the public comments period. One of those citizens was Vicki L. Moore\n\nMoore, who has lived in Caddo Parish for 47 years and has spent the past two years living on Blanchard-Latex Road, an area where data center developer STACK Infrastructure has purchased more than 500 acres.\n\n\"You are my representation on the commission,\" Moore said. She expressed concern over the water in Caddo Lake, noting she had been without water for days and saying in the two years she has lived in Blanchard, she's been without water more than she ever was in Shreveport. Mostly, she expressed disappointment in the Commission for not at least moving forward to discuss Kracman's proposal.\n\n\"We don't know where you stand. So I don't know where I stand,\" she said.\n\nCommissioner Victor Thomas addressed the comments about proposal.\n\n\"We plan to address this issue in the proper form, \" he said. \"I didn't want you leave here feeling defeated and that we cared nothing about your water issue and that we care nothing about Caddo Lake.\"\n\nMost commissioners who spoke felt it was too early, saying nothing has confirmed that the planned development is, in fact, a data center.\n\nWhat data center is in Blanchard? Data center developer STACK Infrastructure linked to Caddo, Bossier land deals.\n\nKracman, however, said the resolution had nothing to do with Blanchard Utilities, or with data centers. \"We all say how much we care about Caddo Lake, but if we're not willing to have the discussion about it, how much do we really care?\" A sentence that drew applause from the audience.\n\nHe went on to say that this was one of the most proactive things he'd done since becoming a commissioner, and he was simply asking for a pause so \"intelligent\" people could conduct a study.\n\nThis silent dismissal of the Kracman's legislation echoed as the Blanchard area struggles with a water crisis.\n\nBlanchard Mayor Jim Galambo stated on Facebook Feb. 1 that the Blanchard Water System was experiencing a production issue affecting local municipalities.\n\nOn Monday, Feb. 2, Galambo told the Shreveport Times that the Blanchard Water System had some production issues at the plant with equipment due to the cold weather.\n\nOn Sunday, the Blanchard Water System cut the valves to some customers to allow the water system to fill up its tanks.\n\nAs of Monday, the water disruption had yet to be resolved after leaks were discovered, forcing the water system to drain the tanks.\n\nBlanchard water crisis: Water outage at Blanchard Utilites affects multiple cities, closes schools\n\n\"We’ve been struggling,\" Galambo said. \"We had to go find the leaks. We finally now have found them all, and we’ve got crews on site. We’re getting them to make the repairs.\"\n\nMooringsport Mayor Ty Gordon posted on Facebook, \"Currently, Mooringsport and Oil City are still OFF... NO exact restoration time at this moment.\"\n\nThis water disruption has caused the cancellation of Herndon Magnet School, Mooringsport Elementary School, Blanchard Elementary School, Donnie Bickham Middle School and Northwood High School.\n\n\"District leadership continues to monitor the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available,\" Caddo Parish Schools said.\n\nKracman, who proposed the moratorium, told The Times in a previous interview that he had received calls from constituents opposed to the data center and from environmentalists concerned that Caddo Lake cannot sustain millions of gallons of daily withdrawals under the developers' contract with Blanchard.\n\n\"Let's get the people who are qualified to assess what the lake can or cannot take before we're just arbitrarily against a data center,\" Kracman said. \"I would rather weigh and measure that it's OK, and I think everybody can appreciate taking a pause and getting some facts together.\"\n\nA measure in New Orleans similar to the one Krackman is proposing led to the cancellation of a data center project.\n\nA global data center developer with a growing footprint across the United States is tied to several large land acquisitions in Caddo and Bossier parishes, according to public property records.\n\nSTACK Infrastructure, a Denver-based digital infrastructure company, is connected to the purchases through SAC III Acquisition Co. LLC, which is listed on multiple purchase agreements for properties intended for data center development in northwest Louisiana.\n\nSAC III Acquisition Co. is listed as the buyer on several transactions in Caddo Parish and Bossier Parish, including more than 500 acres in Blanchard at the corner of Blanchard Latex and Stateline roads. The property sits on the Louisiana-Texas border.\n\nPublic records show SAC III Acquisition Co. lists its address as 1700 Broadway, Suite 1750, Denver, Colorado, the same address used by STACK Infrastructure.\n\nSTACK Infrastructure develops and operates hyperscale data centers for large enterprises, cloud service providers and companies focused on artificial intelligence and machine-learning workloads. The company provides data center capacity in major markets across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific.\n\nThe company is backed by investment firms IPI Partners and ICONIQ Capital, both of which specialize in large-scale infrastructure and technology investments.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Shreveport Times: Caddo Commission kills Caddo Lake proposal with no debate",

    "description": "His death profoundly affected the Today anchor when she was growing up.",
    "fullText": "After Savannah Guthrie’s mom was reported missing, some people might be wondering what happened to the Today host’s father.\n\nOn Feb. 2, Savannah Guthrie’s mother, Nancy Guthrie, was reported missing by her family. The Today anchor was absent from the airing of the show and released a statement: “On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers, and messages of support. Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom. We thank law enforcement for their hard work on this case and encourage anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff’s Department.”\n\nToday's Savannah Guthrie's Mom's Disappearance Being Investigated by FBI Due to 'What Was Found at the Scene'-Officials Are 'Concerned'\n\nThe Real Reason Another Today Host Just Quit Months After Hoda Kotb's Sudden Exit: 'The Time Has Come... '\n\nNBC crime correspondent Tom Winter reported that Nancy’s disappearance is now treated as a crime. “They were able to get out helicopters last night that use infrared cameras. They’ve got drones up,” Winter said. “They’ve enlisted the help of the Customs and Border Protection — obviously, not too far from the border there in Mexico. They have some special resources. The FBI is also aware of this case… given the nature of what was found at the scene. That’s what has got them so concerned.”\n\nNancy didn’t have any reported health concerns like dementia or Alzheimer’s and had a “good sound mind.” However, officials were concerned about her physical health. “She has some physical ailments that limit her ability to move around,” Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said.\n\nThe Tucson Sheriff’s Department later made an update about the investigation. “We believe now, after we’ve processed that we do in fact have a crime and we’re asking the community’s help,” Nanos said.\n\nSavannah Guthrie’s father was Charles Guthrie. He died when she was 16 years old from a sudden heart attack.\n\nThe death of her father had a profound impact on her adolescence. “The loss of my father was shocking and devastating. It cracked open our family and crushed us,” Savannah shared in an interview with People in 2024 when promoting her book Mostly What God Does, which chronicles her grieving from the loss. “He was our center. We just idealized him and adored him. He was larger than life, and funny, and charming, and adorable. His loss was so sudden and so shocking.”\n\nSavannah also uses Christmas as a tribute to her father and his selflessness. “I think the fact that I lost my dad when I was 16, it makes Christmas even more special to us, because it was his holiday and that’s how we felt and that’s how he felt,” Savannah said in December 2022. “I think we hold on to Christmas even harder now, because it’s a tie to him and a tie to the past and to our memories.”\n\nShe revealed that she didn’t want to leave her mom in the early stages of her career. “My father died when I was entering my senior year in high school. I then lived at home all through college. We didn’t have money to afford the dorm,” Savannah said on Today in 2022. “She said, ‘If you can’t leave me, then I didn’t do my job right, Savannah.’ She just gave me permission to go.”\n\nThe Today anchor often brought Nancy as a guest on the show and talked about her love for her mother in 2022. “She loves us, her family, fiercely, and her selflessness and sacrifice for us, her steadfastness and her unmovable confidence is the reason any of us grew up to do anything,” Guthrie said in honor of her 80th birthday.\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

Freeman is a relative midfield rookie, having spent the vast majority of his career on the wing.\n\nBut the pair have a shared history to draw from.\n\nBoth came through the Northampton academy and were key figures in Saints' run to the Premiership title in 2023-24 and a Champions Cup final in 2024-25.\n\n\"It's very easy to call each other out and tell each other when we're not going so well. And when we are,\" says Freeman.\n\n\"That's massive because the more times you're in that position [alongside each other], the more cues you're picking up.\n\n\"Dingers is an awesome communicator. It's just constant, constant noise.\n\n\"He's just very good at seeing what's in front and giving you confidence and he can move the ball very well and create some good opportunities for us outside boys.\"\n\nDingwall does more than grease wheels, spot space and take shots though.\n\nIn a rare win over New Zealand in the autumn, it was him arcing in under the posts as Ollie Lawrence drew attention and shifted the ball at the last moment.\n\nBut, for the most part, he is happy to lean into reputation as a player who makes others shine, rather than living in the spotlight himself.\n\n\"You look at the people that we have in the backline, their natural talent around beating people, physicality and all the kind of stuff that they can do - I just feel like my role is a bit how I can bring that out as best as possible,\" Dingwall said.\n\n\"That's not to say that I don't try and better myself constantly and am not trying to become one of these people or do those things.\n\n\"But we've got such talent and super strengths within this backs division, it's like: 'How can I aid bringing all of that out?'\"",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): Ten men away at Aston Villa, I could have put the whole backline in. Keller has gone in and not only held his own as their number one, but continued to showcase probably why he left Liverpool. A lot of people would have said 'stay, Alisson is getting older, you'll get your chance'. He didn't, he went away and he has been fantastic for them and it is a team that suits him.\n\nMarcos Senesi (Bournemouth): Arguably one of the players of the season for me. He is really solid, goes about his business, gets everything done. Nothing is forced.\n\nGabriel (Arsenal): Leeds weren't poor, but Gabriel was solid and reassuring. He got the job done and knows the threat he poses from set-pieces. It was probably his best defensive display of the season.\n\nKristoffer Ajer (Brentford): Big, solid defender. He was celebrating making tackles in the first few minutes, which is not my cup of tea, but when you are doing it consistently all the way through and putting your body on the line, I'll give you a pass.\n\nEnzo Fernandez (Chelsea): Obviously he scored the goal that completed the great comeback. He gets a lot of stick, unjustifiably in my opinion. People don't think he's that good and maybe it's the price tag and because he won a World Cup that means they expect more. He is a good midfielder and a really good captain, and he looks after the ball when they are in difficult moments.\n\nFlorian Wirtz (Liverpool): I have been saying for weeks and months that with a player of that quality, it was only a matter of time before he settled into it. These past six weeks we have seen the real Florian Wirtz - dictating games, his passing range is unbelievable. The goals and assists have started to come now and he is looking really strong.\n\nAlex Scott (Bournemouth): It was a tough day for him because Wolves were decent. He has had a tough time after going away with England but has come back and has found his mojo. It's going to be an interesting back end of the season for him trying to make the World Cup squad.\n\nNoni Madueke (Arsenal): From thinking you are on the bench to finding out you are starting less than five minutes before kick-off is a massive turn of events. To be mentally focused to deliver, that is credit to Mikel Arteta and Madueke. They somehow gave the goal to him even though it was an own goal, but with a goal and assist he gets in the team.\n\nHabib Diarra (Sunderland): It says a goal and an own goal, but it's basically two goals for him. He was exceptional. The wide players absolutely killed Burnley and he was at the heart of it.\n\nDominic Solanke (Tottenham): It was probably the weirdest two goals he will score in his life. The first one is questionable but the second one is pure genius. To not only backheel it but to lob Gianluigi Donnarumma who is 6ft 6in is unbelievable. It is great to see him back playing. Can he have a late push now for the England squad? That is the question if he can stay fit.\n\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool): Signing of the season? Probably. Another two goals and he looks like he is going from strength to strength, week by week. It's going to be really difficult for Alexander Isak to get back in.\n\nMikel Arteta (Arsenal): It was a wonderful away performance at Elland Road. With Bukayo Saka getting injured in the warm-up there could have been excuses, but he didn't make any. He put Noni Madueke in and he returned the favour. It was a wonderful performance at a place where teams have struggled.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "Liverpool have finalised a deal for Jeremy Jacquet in a deal worth up to £60m - but the defender will not move to Anfield until the summer.\n\nIt would not be an understatement to say he was a name most people were unaware of at the start of the winter window.\n\nTo commit up to £60m - £55m up front before a potential £5m in add ons - for a 20-year-old is a hefty call but Liverpool view the French centre-back as a long-term investment and someone who will form an integral part of their backline for years to come.\n\nGiven the club's defensive problems this season - they have conceded 33 goals from 24 Premier League games - and their ongoing injury crisis, it is also telling Arne Slot's side are prepared to wait until the summer for Jacquet, who will join from Ligue 1 Rennes.\n\nThe question of whether they could have got him now has a simple answer - Rennes are simply unwilling to sanction a move until the summer.\n\nThe French side are not in a rush for the money and adamant any fee for Jacquet would have to surpass their previous club record sale of £55.4m when Manchester City signed Jeremy Doku from them in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Liverpool are happy to wait, signing the player on a five-year contract until 2031, with the option for a further year.\n\nThey see Jacquet as a young defender with plenty of senior experience for his age and their data analysis has backed the decision to spend so much on a player they believe has immense potential.\n\n\"It's a lot of money but Jacquet has everything to become one of the best centre-backs in the world in the next few years,\" says French football expert and ESPN's Julien Laurens. \"He is arguably the best centre-back of his generation.\n\n\"He's quite tall, quick and strong - and he's a machine when it comes to duels in the air and on the ground. He reads the game well and is good on the ball.\n\n\"He's not a proper ball-playing centre-back yet. Technically, there is a lot to improve on, but he's a smart kid and he can get there and become like a Virgil van Dijk.\"\n\nAt Rennes, Jacquet has primarily played in a back three this season. When he was 18, he wanted more game time so they loaned him out to Clermont in Ligue 2 but he was was only there for half a season before he was recalled in January 2025, and made a total of 36 Ligue 1 appearances.\n\nHis strength in the air has been a standout this season, winning 75.51% of his aerial duels - the highest among Ligue 1 defenders in 2025–26.",

    "description": "Katha...",
    "fullText": "The $45 million advertorial abounds in unintended ironies.\n\nMy husband and I saw the Melania documentary, at 10:45 am on the Upper West Side, which I admit was not a fair test of its audience appeal—there were only six people there besides us. They had all left by the time the movie was over—maybe journalists on deadline, like me—so I missed my chance to interview them about their responses. I did catch a middle-aged woman who showed up early for the next screening, well-armed with an enormous bucket of popcorn. Why was she there, I asked? To see Melania of course! What did she like about Melania? “She’s so confident and she does so much to help people.” Confident, I give you.\n\nI used to feel sorry for the wives of rich and powerful men. I saw them as trapped—birds in gilded cages, who had made a terrible mistake in youth, and now had to endure endless rounds of tedious socializing with a frozen smile on their Botoxed faces, to say nothing of having to be nice to their ghastly husbands, who were probably all having sex with prostitutes. I wasn’t alone—remember all those Free Melania memes? The way people endlessly retweeted photos of her looking fed-up and frowny and not holding Donald’s hand? Quite a few women I know believed that Melania was miserable but couldn’t leave him for some unlikely reason, like she would have no money or he would have her murdered. What century did they think this is? Melinda Gates and Mackenzie Scott divorced their unsatisfactory husbands and are living the dream today as fabulously rich philanthropists.\n\nMelania, this documentary makes perfectly clear, likes her gilded cage just fine. After all, it lets her produce this movie starring her clothes, her hair, her shoes, and her complexion, and how many women can say the same? Could you, middle-aged women of America, spend all day every day wearing six-inch spike heels with never a wince or moan? The rewards for aching feet and wrinkle-free face are on full display: Melania is attended every minute by people paid to be deferential and pleasant; everything around her is beautiful and expensive, and she has all the designer dresses she wants. She gets to talk about helping children with Queen Rania of Jordan and the evils of screens for children with Brigitte Macron. She gets to look somber and serious placing lilies on the Arlington graves of three soldiers killed in the withdrawal from Afghanistan—take that, Joe Biden! All your fault! If she has to spend a few hours pretending to care about the tablecloths for the Inaugural dinner and the golden caviar-filled eggs planned as the appetizer, well, that’s not too high a price to pay for luxury and admiration, is it?\n\nAs you might expect, the film abounds in unintended ironies. Melania is famously a private person, but she makes a movie about herself. She says she loves the White House, with all its storied history, while she tears up Jackie Kennedy’s rose garden and her husband tears down the East Wing. She says she cares about young people, while her husband destroys USAID, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths of African children. She reminds us that she is an immigrant, as are her French friend Hervé Pierre, whom we see designing her Inaugural ball gown, and Tham Kannalikham, the White House interior decorator, who arrived from Laos at the age of 2. And of course there are her parents. (Her mourning for her mother, the first anniversary of whose death takes place during the filming, is a rare moment when she expresses deep feeling.) Meanwhile, her husband presides over the mass detention and deportation of immigrants, many of whom have lived in this country for decades, maybe longer than she has. Cherry on top: The director, Brett Ratner, was persona non grata in Hollywood after being accused of sexual misconduct by six women—way to remind us of the ongoing scandal of the Epstein files.\n\nI know there is a real human being hidden inside those severe, stiffly constructed outfits and beneath that famous black hat that hides half her face and makes her look like a sinister fembot or maybe a very confident assassin. This is, after all, the first lady who wore a jacket painted with I REALLY DON’T CARE DO U on her trip to the Mexican border. This is the first lady who plagiarized a speech by her nemesis Michelle Obama. And—my favorite Melania moment— this is the first lady who complained to her former close friend Stephanie Winston Wolkoff about having to “work my ass off” on the White House Christmas. “Who gives a fuck about the Christmas stuff and decorations?” Remember those scary blood-red trees that looked like they came from Dracula’s own forest?\n\nThat Melania was remote, haughty, mysterious, beset by grievance and resentment. She didn’t even try to ingratiate herself with the public. That was kind of weird—but a lot more interesting than this dutiful fashion plate delivering platitudes about how “in the end family is what really matters.” On the other hand, this Melania has managed to get Jeff Bezos to pay $45 million for the right to make this absurd advertorial, and $35 million to promote it. Bezos stands to lose most of it, but (sorry, Dems) the film is on track to be one of the highest-grossing documentaries ever. In a family of champion grifters, Melania holds her own.",

    "fullText": "The once-lauded director of Black Swan and The Wrestler has drowned himself in AI slop with an embarrassing new online series\n\nIf you happen to find yourself stumbling through Time magazine’s YouTube account, perhaps because you are a time traveller from the 1970s who doesn’t fully understand how the present works yet – then you will be presented with something that many believe represents the vanguard of entertainment as we know it.\n\nOn This Day … 1776 is a series of short videos depicting America’s revolutionary war. What makes On This Day notable is that it was made by Darren Aronofsky’s studio Primordial Soup. What also makes it interesting is that it was created with AI. The third thing that makes it interesting is that it is terrible.\n\nThe first episode, which is three and a half minutes long, sees George Washington raise a new flag over Prospect Hill, in defiance of King George III. It is the moment, according to the video’s description, that “rebellion becomes resolve”. And if that dollop of ChatGPT-sounding sloganeering terrifies the life out of you, wait until you actually watch the thing.\n\nIt is, as you might expect, as ugly as sin. It’s the sort of thing that looks like it was shooting for photorealism, but then either chickened out or blew up along the way. In the very first shot, King George’s hair looks like someone melted down and hardened a plastic badger. And this is a shame because, like so much generative AI at the moment, an awful lot of the episode consists of shots where we see the characters from behind. This is, after all, because the back of an AI-generated head is far less likely to send people into screaming fits of trauma than an AI-generated face, and Aronofsky is a humanist.\n\nBecause, good lord, the faces. Since the revolutionary war was largely initiated by older men, On This Day is filled with the wrinkled almost-faces of several well-known figures. And it is truly disconcerting to see, not only because they all have the uncanny dead eyes of people ripped out of The Polar Express, but because the wrinkles keep shifting in colour and depth.\n\nIt’s an effect that makes it look like the characters were drawn on several sheets of tissue paper that nobody could line up properly. Benjamin Franklin, who turns up during episode two, is particularly nightmarish. He looks as if someone has genetically spliced Hugh Laurie with Anthony Hopkins, and then covered the resulting monstrosity in a thin layer of roving liver spots. I’m overselling the point here, but it really is extremely creepy to watch.\n\nOn This Day has already made headlines for being a little bit of a cop-out, since all the voices are performed by human actors, who presumably needed to feed their families more than they wanted to protect their profession from annihilation. And this is telling, because these voices are by far the most convincing part of On This Day, especially when deployed in voiceover, because then you aren’t distracted by the way the movement of their mouths doesn’t quite match up with the noises coming out of them.\n\nBut surely the day is coming where they won’t be needed. As horrible as it is, On This Day is already strides better than a lot of other AI-generated output. True, the whole thing still looks like a mangled cross between an animatronic sex toy convention and those old Taiwanese news cartoons, but compare a character here with Tilly Norwood, and you can see that real progress has been made in a frighteningly short amount of time. Soon we will have picture-perfect AI creations with entirely convincing human voices. After that, it won’t be long before content like On This Day is entirely created – written, acted, directed and edited – by prompt alone. And when that happens, Aronofsky can pat himself on the back for doing himself out of a job.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the human film industry reacts to On This Day, particularly other actors. We’ve already seen, in Tilly Norwood, that these creations appear to be modelled on human faces, and this is even more the case here. In particular, the depiction of Thomas Paine seems like it flashes through the faces of any number of recognisable actors. The key one seems to be Ralph Fiennes, but there are also glimmers of Daniel Day-Lewis and Matthew Macfadyen.\n\nLess than two years ago Scarlett Johansson hired legal counsel after she noticed that an OpenAI application had a voice that was “eerily similar” to hers. In a climate like this, it isn’t out of the question to imagine that actors will start doing the same if they recognise their likeness in an AI-generated performer.\n\nBut this is a concern for another time. What matters now is that On This Day … 1776 is genuinely very horrible to watch, and everybody involved should be ashamed. It is by far the most disturbing thing Aronofsky has made, and I’ve seen the last eight minutes of Requiem for a Dream.",
