    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Tyrese Maxey scored 29 points, including seven 3-pointers, Dominick Barlow added 26 points and 16 rebounds, and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Los Angeles Clippers 128-113 on Monday night for their fourth consecutive victory.\n\nThe game featured two big names who weren’t selected as All-Star reserves: Joel Embiid of the Sixers and Kawhi Leonard of the Clippers.\n\nEmbiid had 24 points as he continues to gain full strength after a right ankle injury. The Sixers improved to 11-10 without Paul George, who is serving a 25-game suspension for violating the NBA's anti-drug program.\n\nLeonard led the Clippers with 29 points and Jordan Miller had 21 points off the bench.\n\nLos Angeles was without James Harden, who missed his second straight game due to personal reasons. Coach Tyronn Lue said before the game that Harden was at home in Phoenix.\n\nLeonard had two dunks and a 3-pointer in the fourth, but the Clippers couldn't put together a sustained run and he finished the game on the bench.\n\nMaxey, Barlow and Embiid combined to score 22 points in the third when the Sixers were outscored 34-28, but still led 100-87.\n\nThe Sixers led the entire game, going up by 23 points before settling for a 72-53 halftime advantage.\n\nThe Clippers are 8-3 over their last 11 games as they try to stay within range of at least making the play-in tournament.\n\n76ers: Visit the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night to finish a back-to-back.\n\nClippers: Host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday night. ___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "fullText": "CHARLOTTE, N.C.  – Presbyterian Blue Hose redshirt senior forward Jonah Pierce was named Big South Player of the Week for the second time this season, as announced by the league office on Monday afternoon.\n\nPierce is the first Presbyterian player to earn the Big South Player of the Week award twice in the same season in the program’s history. On January 19th, Pierce earned his first Big South Player of the Week award.

He shot 61.1 percent (22-for-36) from the field in those two games.\n\nIn Presbyterian’s game at High Point last Thursday, he scored 25 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, and blocked three shots.\n\nIn Presbyterian’s home game against Radford this past Saturday, he scored 28 points and grabbed 17 rebounds, which is one rebound shy of tying the program’s DI era single-game rebounds record.\n\nPLAY THIS SEASON\nPierce leads the Blue Hose and ranks eighth in the Big South in scoring, averaging 16.9 points per game.

The award is selected by the league office.\n\nWilkins won Furman’s first weekly honor after helping the Paladins go 2-0 last week. On Jan. 29, the freshman had 20 points, three assists and a block in a 78-73 victory over Samford. Three days later, the native of Mattapan, Massachusetts, poured in a career-high 33 points, along with five assists, three rebounds and two steals as Furman topped Chattanooga, 75-70. Wilkins’ 33 points marked the first time a Paladin freshman reached 30 points since Dec. 1995, and was one point off of the program’s freshman record of 34, which was set by Jonathan Moore in Dec.1976.\n\nFor the week, Wilkins averaged 27.5 points and 4.0 assists per game, while shooting 68 percent from the field and 75 percent from behind the arc.

    "fullText": "Bingham has won five straight and is starting to heat up at the right time, and senior guard Parker Snedaker is a big reason why.\n\nSnedaker has shown his versatility throughout the season as he can impact the game in numerous different ways. He’s averaging 18.7 points, 6.8 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 2.0 steals for the Miners, who face a huge game this Friday against 6A No. 1 Westlake.\n\n“Parker is a great basketball player and an even better person. It is fun to see all of his hard work and dedication pay off this year. He has earned multiple scholarship offers and is expecting a few more as well,” said Bingham coach Parker Snedaker.\n\n“The amount of extra reps he puts in before practice and after as well as in the classroom and the weight room proves his incredible work ethic. Parker is also a tremendous leader both on and off the court.”\n\nHis offers so far are from Southwestern Oregon Community College, Wenatchee Community College and Green River Community College.\n\nBrynn Wadman’s growth has been a big part of Fremont’s success this season as the team owns a 17-2 record heading into the final two weeks of the regular season.\n\nThe junior has scored in double figures in six straight games as she’s elevated her scoring average to 9.4 this season. She’s also chipping in with 3.9 rebounds and 1.2 steals.\n\n“Brynn is a natural scorer who has developed into a complete player for our team. She invests a tremendous amount of time in her game outside of practice, and that dedication and work ethic have driven her growth,” said Fremont coach Lisa Dalebout.\n\n“She’s a strong rebounder, has significantly elevated her defensive play, and is someone we trust in big moments. Her leadership and daily commitment to improvement make her a great player. Brynn loves the game, and it shows every time she steps on the floor.”\n\nThe 5-foot-9 guard ranks second on the team with 29 3-pointers this season.\n\nBrigham Skinner, Mountain Crest (Sr.)\n\nBrigham Skinner appears to be peaking at the perfect time this season.\n\nThe Mountain Crest senior won the 100 backstroke and 200 individual medley at the Region 11 championships last week, and in the process he posted the second-best times in the entire state in those events.\n\nHe won the 200 I.M. with a time of 1:55.04 and won the 100 back with a time of 51.24.\n\n“Brigham consistently pushes himself and sets a high standard for those around him. He trains with a strong group of teammates who hold each other accountable every day,” said Mountain Crest coach Brian Kwant.\n\n“As one of our captains, he’s helped establish a culture built on hard work, incremental improvement, and supporting one another’s success . He never shies away from extra work, both in and out of the pool, and we’re grateful for the leadership and example he brings to our program.”\n\nSkinner heads into the 4A state meet next week looking to defending his title as 100 back state champ.\n\nSarah Nielson’s performance at the Region 12 championships last week played a big role in Ogden edging Logan to claim the region title.\n\nThe senior won both of her individual events and then swam a leg in a pair of Ogden relays as the Tigers won the region title with 426 points.\n\n“As head coach of Ogden High School’s swim team, Sarah Nielson is a selfless leader and captain with rock-solid commitment. Hard work, extra efforts and her drive to improve elevate the whole team. It’s no wonder she’s thriving now and will excel at the next level,” said Ogden coach Kyle Lambson.\n\nNielson won the 100 butterfly (1:05.34) and the 500 freestyle (6:00.88). Her time in the fly ranks third in 3A this year, and her 500 free time ranks fifth.\n\nHeading into her final state meet next week, Nielson will look to podium again in her both her individual events like last year, and perhaps help Ogden podium in a couple of relays as well.\n\nBen Kohler improved his record to 51-6 last week with another strong showing at the 5A Division B state-qualifying meet.\n\nHe’ll be the favorite at the state tournament in 138 pounds to win his third straight individual state title.\n\n“Ben is one of those kids that is a coach’s dream, someone who buys in to every aspect of the program and works his tail off to be the best. He is a no-nonsense guy that just takes care of business both in the classroom and on the mat,” said Wasatch coach Kamron Day.\n\n“He is always in the room getting better and traveling across the country to seek out the best competition. He is a competitor and is always in the fight. His relentless work ethic and mental toughness is always on display, helping him to lead by example every time he steps on the mat. He is always pushing himself in every aspect of his life and is always elevating those around him. Ben’s commitment, accountability, and team-first mindset make him a cornerstone of our program and leader others naturally follow.”\n\nKohler won all four of his matches at the divisional meet by fall.\n\nMadison Sherman, Skyridge (Sr.)\n\nMadison Sherman enjoyed a dominant performance at the 6A Division B state-qualifying meet last week as she moved one step closer to an individual 3-peat.\n\nSherman won the 155-pound bracket at Syracuse High School with four pins, including three in the first 30 seconds of matches as she improved to 16-1 on the season.\n\n“Madison is a great wrestler. She is on point to be back in the finals to defend state title. She has overcome some struggles this year but is back in the room committed to winning a third state title. We are excited to see how she performs at the state tournament this year,” said Skyridge coach Brian Bond.\n\nSherman placed second at state as a freshman and then was a state champion as a sophomore and junior. A year ago Sherman finished with a 33-2 record en route to the state championship.",

I’ve already played one game, and I feel good.”\n\nOn Udinese’s physicality: “We knew we’d face a physical, intense team. Unfortunately, the goal was unlucky and decided the match.”\n\nEl Aynaoui emphasized that Roma were unlucky in conceding the goal. The free kick, scored by Jurgen Ekkelenkamp with a crucial deflection off Donyell Malen, should not have been awarded, according to Gian Piero Gasperini. And the coach flew into a rage, throwing an object from his technical area.\n\nRoma attempted to turn the game around with a final push: they had found the net through Bryan Cristante, but the assist provider, Kostas Tsimikas, was offside.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal are already plotting a potential £100 million move for Newcastle United midfielder Sandro Tonali ahead of the summer transfer window, according to the Sun. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is a huge admirer of the Italian and is keen to pair the Magpies star with Declan Rice at the Emirates Stadium club. Tonali was linked with a Gunners move yesterday following Mikel Merino’s injury and while the rumours had no legs, something could happen in the summer.\n\nNewcastle could miss out on Champions League football next season after an underwhelming Premier League campaign so far, which could see a move to join Arsenal appeal to Tonali. Manchester City and Chelsea also want the 25-year-old, and while the Magpies are not looking forward to selling him, lack of European football could force them to cash in. Newcastle ending the season without silverware could also deal a blow on their chances of holding on to Tonali and other top stars, and league leaders Arsenal are monitoring the situation.\n\nHe joined the Toons in a £55m deal from AC Milan in 2023 but has signed a new contract, which runs until 2029 with the option for an additional 12 months. Newcastle will want at least £100m for him from suitors if the Italian wants to move on, and Arsenal could be ready to do business. Merino, Martin Zubimendi and Ethan Nwaneri (on loan at Marseille) are all options for Arteta in the middle of the park, but the Spaniard loves quality competition in his squad having strengthened his attack with enough stars last summer. A big-money move for a midfielder next summer cannot be ruled out and Tonali could be back in the conversation after the rumours on the winter transfer deadline day.",

I’m very proud of the lads. Okoye made a great save towards the end. We deserved these three points; you also need a bit of luck. We maintained consistency in the Verona game, harassing Roma’s defense.”\n\nRunjaic then continued talking about the dream of Europe: “No, it’s just a moment. I think there’s no point in talking about it now. We know which teams are above us and are stronger. That’s not our goal. We’re missing something to be able to compete with the big teams.”",

As soon as the offer came up it was something that me and my family looked at, and thought was a great opportunity. I see it as a big step in my career to go and prove myself. Everything he [the manager] said was really positive and that’s why I’m here today.”\n\nHis new manager, Steven Robinson, also added that Devaney brings something to the table that his squad currently does not have.\n\nSt Mirren will face Hearts of Midlothian later on tonight in the league where Devaney could be in line to make his debut.\n\nFeatured image Lewis Storey via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "With the NBA trade deadline approaching on Thursday, teams across the league are scrambling to assemble rosters they believe best position them for the future. The Los Angeles Clippers, for their part, are reportedly engaged in serious talks to send James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThis does not appear to be a situation where the Clippers were actively looking to move Harden. He has missed the team’s last two games for personal reasons, and it has long been understood that he carries significant influence over any potential trade destination. In short, Hardenwants a move away from LA.\n\nReports suggest the Cavaliers are willing to send Darius Garland to Inglewood in return, a move that would shift them down a path of youth. However, not everyone is convinced it makes sense for Cleveland, with Emmanuel Acho emerging as one of the more vocal critics of the potential deal.\n\nThe Clippers, after languishing at the bottom of the West for the first few weeks of the 25/26 season, are creeping up the standings and are currently 9th with a 23-26 record. The Cavs, meanwhile, are 5th in the East and looking to rediscover the form that helped them finish #1 in their conference last season. Acho warned them on Speakeasy that signing Harden won’t help them achieve that.\n\n“I would not want James Harden if I were a championship-caliber team,” the former NFL player turned sports pundit declared. “Nothing about James Harden spells Championship. Nothing about James Harden’s career spells Championship. He is all the way over the hill, and James Harden has never been a catalyst for winning championships.”\n\nThese may seem like harsh comments, but Acho has a point. He noted how Harden has never helped a team get close to winning a championship, and the only time a team looked deadly with him in the roster was when he was a 6th man in Oklahoma. He failed to deliver success in Houston (ran into prime Warriors to be fair), Brooklyn, Philadelphia, and finally, Los Angeles.\n\n“When he’s ever had to be that guy, he’s not that,” Acho added. “So, why in the world would anybody want to trade for James Harden if they actually have championship aspirations?”\n\nWell, it looks like Harden has championship aspirations for starters. There’s a reason he’s switched teams so many times in the 2020s. It’s not working out anywhere, but he refuses to give up. He’s averaging 25.4 points per game and assisting 8.1. His playmaking has also significantly improved over the years.\n\nWill teaming up with Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley finally give him the fairytale ending he’s hoping for? We’ll have to wait and see.\n\nThe post “Nothing About James Harden Spells Champion”: Emmanuel Acho Goes Off Following Clippers-Cavaliers Trade Story appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "At their apartment in Italy, FC Como defender Sophie Howard’s partner is reading the instructions for a dog bed they’ve bought for the Bernedoodle that will arrive at the end of this month.\n\nIt is probably far less complex than some of the documents that Howard, a defender capped more than 50 times for Scotland, will have read over a career representing herself in transfers between professional clubs. One of the few elite women’s footballers without an agent, Howard negotiated her own transfer from Women’s Super League side Leicester City to top-flight Como last summer.\n\n“I’ve connected with massive stakeholders in the club that I can have daily conversations (with) just because we had those exchanges every single day throughout the process,” Howard says. “I came to this club knowing exactly who was who and who I’d spoken to.”\n\nIt was not new ground for the 32-year-old, who is of the shrinking generation of active women’s footballers who can recall how the game has straddled the professional and amateur realms.\n\n“My whole youth career, there was no need for an agent because the game wasn’t where it is now,” she says, having negotiated her moves from Germany’s Hoffenheim to then WSL club Reading in 2018 and to Leicester, with whom she won promotion from the second-tier Championship in her first season, two years later.\n\nHoward’s story is an uncommon one in the top levels of a sport that, particularly during transfer windows for its men’s leagues, employs well-worn frameworks for talking about its agents, some of whom reach their own level of celebrity and notoriety. What are their motives? Who are they briefing? Are players and families enlisting their help too prematurely, on bad advice?\n\nOnly in the past five years has the transfer window in women’s football cultivated anything approaching a similar level of interest — the sport had its first million-pound player last summer when Olivia Smith moved from Liverpool to Arsenal — but as high up as tier three, players routinely operate without agents.\n\nWhere agents oversee contracts, boot deals and image rights in exchange for a percentage of the relevant income, players at National League level are likely to earn too little for agents to be interested in or comfortable taking that money. However, there are significant differences in resources between teams within the National League (some players will only receive expenses).\n\nPlayers will sometimes have informal conversations with agents who may be able to offer guidance, share contacts or review offers. Some smaller clubs may not deal with agents; other agents may work with better players on low-value deals to build a stable of the most talented youngsters with a view to making money in the future.\n\n“There’s some (agents) at National League level now — definitely not years ago, but now because there’s money involved,” Howard says. “Even at that level, because it’s often also younger players, they probably shy away from representing themselves, because it is daunting. Not a lot of people do it, and not a lot of talk about it.”\n\nFor the agents of WSL players and England internationals, the job has changed in the last few years.\n\nAlways about emotional and logistical support as much as financial, representatives of the higher-profile England players now find themselves navigating more lucrative sponsorship deals and higher-profile media requests following the team’s European Championship triumph in 2022. That was the sport’s most transformative commercial moment in the UK, particularly in generating interest among brands that agents, as several told The Athletic at the time, had hitherto had to “push doors down” to get in the room.\n\nHoward noticed this some time ago. Ultimately, the deciding factor for going solo was realising that she could “tell my own story better than other people”.\n\n“My value is way beyond what you see on the pitch only,” she adds. “My value was my consistency on the pitch, but also my leadership, what I’ve experienced, what I stand for. I believe only I can tell that about myself. Only I present who I am. In the last couple of years, I’ve really come to know the importance of knowing my value and therefore standing for that.\n\n“I was probably also in a very good situation because I had a contract (from Leicester) on the table, so I could really go in and put a stamp on my value. Sometimes, it’s (about) having really tricky and difficult conversations, but really standing for what you believe.”\n\nTo help Howard get ready to negotiate in person with clubs, her brother, who owns a media company involved in the finance industry, ran “trial conversations” between the two of them, because “they’re not easy” meetings to have.\n\n“They can be very challenging, because as football players, I don’t think we are prepared for these things,” Howard says. “I had to really practice them and my brother was absolutely brutal, coming back with things that potentially the clubs would say and trying to almost make me back down. The question my brother always (made me) ask was, ‘What do you want to get out of this?’ Once you know that — go for it.\n\n“He taught me to be quite ballsy in that sense. Sometimes, it ended up with me saying, ‘No way,’ and standing and leaving the room. And that’s not easy to do. Three years ago, I would have never done that. Now, seeing actually how well it went. I absolutely would do that again.”\n\nAll players have their own relationship with the agent representing them. Some feel they make the clearest decisions when the agent has streamlined their options and cut out the noise. Others, like Howard, prefer to be there each step of the way.\n\n“I want to understand the why behind your answers,” Howard says. “You often get insight and knowledge from how people respond. Sometimes, (the) most is said in the wordless things, when you don’t get a response.” When employing agents in the past, Howard found herself  “pushing to know exactly what was being said”, and “chasing the agent and the club” as her contract wound down.\n\n“Why am I needing someone to sort it, even though I’m already sorting it myself?” she mused.\n\nParticularly at Leicester, where she played for five seasons, she enjoyed good relationships with the higher-ups at the club, so much so that it “then felt a bit bizarre that someone else was having these conversations, even though I saw these people every day. Equally, I understand if you’re trying to separate (identities). You’re a player, you’re an employee at the club, you’re focusing on your performance. You don’t want to get involved in the business.”\n\nWhen Como first expressed their interest in summer 2024, Howard was still under contract at Leicester and both parties concluded it didn’t feel like the right time for a move. The Italians promised to be in touch again the next summer and stuck to their word, which appealed to Howard even as Leicester offered her a new contract.\n\nShe was unsure if moving abroad again, after three spells in Germany (where she was born) and two in the United States, was on the horizon. “I was very open and very direct because I just don’t like games (during negotiations),” she explains. “I don’t like keeping an option open just to see what I could get out of it if I know I’m not going to take it.”\n\nLeicester did not respond to a request for comment from The Athletic.\n\nConversations with family changed her mind, encouraging her to try living overseas again. During those final few weeks at Leicester, the seed had been planted.\n\n“I’m playing at Leicester and my full heart is at Leicester, but this is where it gets tricky, where you have to separate your business and do your football side,” Howard says. “When I was on the phone to other clubs, it was business, but my full professional self was giving it all to Leicester. Because up until the very end, I thought I was extending (her contract). I felt so at home there, and I always thought it was the place where I’d finish my career.”\n\nOver a Zoom call involving a translator, Howard laid everything on the table.\n\n“Seeing what Como, at this point, came back with almost hurt a bit, because I was like, ‘This guy doesn’t know me, and it seems like he values me more than the club I’ve given everything to for five years’.” The idea was difficult for Howard to think about, but is something that she says comes with representing yourself. There’s no shield: “These moments where you really have to make sure it stays professional (and) you don’t take it personally. Because that could ruin you.”\n\n“Those weeks were stressful,” she says. “I really had to lean on the people around me and do my absolute best to separate it.”\n\nThe second phase of negotiations took place with Leicester’s manager Amandine Miquel, who had no sporting director at the time, “so there’s a crossover, because the same person you talk to in the office a day ago is your manager on the pitch. The same person who’s now your manager is also who you’re doing business with. You just have to be professional about it. You have no choice because I think the moment you let that emerge, I think that’s fatal. It affects your performance. (If) you’re going downhill, what grounds have you got to negotiate?”\n\nHoward acknowledges that self-representation can be daunting, in part because of the breadth of skills the footballer-turned-agent must master: reading contracts, calculating their own financial worth, and liaising with sporting directors and managers who have their own perspectives and backgrounds.\n\nShe had no prior experience in negotiating, or of the traditional business world, before her football career. Her advice for those thinking of taking the same leap is to lead with honesty, know your value and be clear in what you want out of each conversation.\n\n“I never tried to be a business person, or to make myself (out to be) more qualified than what I was,” Howard says.“I stayed true to myself, but I was ready to negotiate and I was ready to stand for what I believe. … (At Leicester) I think people gambled and didn’t expect that I’d stick to my guns, but I did.\n\n“It’s not for everyone, and that’s also OK. There’s zero judgment. But if you want to take control of your career and you have no one so far that’s doing that for you who you fully trust, go for it. You can grow so much as a person through it. It is stressful, it’s very time-consuming, and your personal relationships suffer from it for the duration of the transfer window, but it’s so worth it.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "As the Who's Who of German transfer journalism, 'Sky' reporter Florian Plettenberg has made a name for himself in recent years. Even though the 37-year-old hasn't always been right, he has managed to land quite a few major scoops.\n\nBut one thing continues to puzzle football fans on social media: Why on earth does the transfer titan announce even the smallest news about a third-division player in English? The sentiment: Which Unterhaching fan doesn't speak German?\n\nThis observation, which has now become a meme, was also used by FSV Mainz 05 on Deadline Day. At 9:09 PM, the Rhinelanders tweeted directly at the newsbreaker and cheekily asked: “Hello @Plettigoal, do you have some information about Scharoldo Becker?\n\nI’m a huge fan of Mainz 05 from the British Virgin Islands and very curious about it!\"\n\nPlettenberg's 'Sky' colleague Patrick Berger jumped on the bandwagon, calling himself a \"big Mainz fan from Bhutan.\"\n\nPlettenberg himself took it all in good humor and replied: “Greetings to the British Virgin Islands. I really like 1. FSV Mainz 05...\"\n\nJust 22 minutes later, Mainz officially announced the Becker deal.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "The Women's Super League transfer window shuts on Tuesday - so what might we expect to happen on the final day?\n\nClubs have been doing business since 2 January and have until 23:00 GMT to complete any last-minute deals.\n\nAmong some of the biggest moves to have gone through are USA international Sam Coffey's switch from Portland Thorns to Manchester City for £600,000, and Aston Villa's £450,000 deal for Chelsea midfielder Oriane Jean-Francois.\n\nBottom side Liverpool also broke their record signing to bring in Republic of Ireland midfielder Denise O'Sullivan for £300,000 from North Carolina Courage.\n\nSo are there more big moves to come?\n\nEvery WSL winter window transfer\n\nArsenal are already lining up huge signings for the summer, with England international Georgia Stanway close to signing a pre-contract agreement to join when her Bayern Munich contract expires.\n\nThey are also in advanced discussions with Barcelona full-back Ona Batlle to bring her in on a free deal in the summer.\n\nThe Gunners have been known to pounce late in the window and want more midfielders. Will they make a surprise move on deadline day?\n\nChelsea have had a bid for Nigeria midfielder Jennifer Echegini turned down by Paris St-Germain but might make another attempt. But with the French window already shut, PSG cannot replace her so it is unlikely they will budge.\n\nThere could be a departure from the Blues with USA striker Catarina Macario attracting interest from National Women's Super League (NWSL) clubs.\n\nGermany midfielder Sjoeke Nusken's future has also been questioned but it looks like she is set to stay at Chelsea unless anything rapidly changes. The Blues are yet to make any signings in this window and manager Sonia Bompastor has hinted at frustration over a lack of squad depth.\n\nElsewhere, Manchester City defender Codie Thomas, 19, has a loan deal in principle agreed with Glasgow City.\n\nLondon City Lionesses are hoping to add one more before the deadline but still have work to do, while Aston Villa have looked at attacking options all winter.\n\nEverton might still do some business, with Roma midfielder Zara Kramzar on the verge of joining on loan with an obligation-to-buy clause. A medical is planned for Tuesday.\n\nFrance forward Kelly Gago has requested to leave the Toffees but nobody has met the £500,000 release clause in her contract.\n\nWest Ham have fought off interest in striker Shekiera Martinez so far, while Leicester City have a few young players that might be heading out on loan.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Monday night in the NBA delivered drama in different ways. One team erased a huge deficit. Another leaned on a single star to survive without key players. Long losing streaks ended, and winning streaks came to a stop. Every game shifted the mood in the standings and showed which teams are finding answers and which ones are still searching.\n\nCharlotte earned its seventh straight win after erasing a 22-point deficit. LaMelo Ball showed toughness after a head collision with coach Charles Lee caused an eye cut. He returned quickly and finished with 24 points. Kon Knueppel scored 17 and hit four three-pointers. Brandon Miller and Grant Williams added 16 each. The Hornets survived 17 turnovers and poor three-point shooting in the first half. Ball’s drive and dunk in the fourth gave Charlotte the lead. Miller later stole the ball from Herbert Jones and finished with a one-handed dunk. The win pulled Charlotte within a half-game of Atlanta for the final play-in spot.\n\nNew Orleans could not hold a strong first-half lead. Trey Murphy III led with 27 points. Zion Williamson had 14 points and 11 rebounds. Derik Queen added 16. Ball’s injury did not slow Charlotte enough. Defensive pressure hurt the Pelicans late. The loss marked their sixth defeat in nine games. New Orleans struggled to stop dribble drives in the fourth quarter.\n\nHouston won despite missing Kevin Durant and Steven Adams. Alperen Sengun carried the load with 39 points and 16 rebounds. Jabari Smith Jr. added 19. Sengun made 13 of 25 shots and 13 of 18 free throws. Eight of those free throws came in the fourth quarter. The Rockets used a late 12-2 run to seal the game. A replay decision wiped out a possible Pacers buzzer-beater before halftime and shifted momentum. Houston earned its third straight win and third straight road victory.\n\nIndiana could not finish strong after a comeback push. Pascal Siakam scored 27 points. Bennedict Mathurin added 25. The Pacers briefly led in the third quarter after a fast-break pass from Jarace Walker to Siakam. Sengun’s free throws ended their hopes. The team missed a chance to extend its winning streak to three games. Defensive fouls in the final minutes proved costly.\n\nMemphis snapped a six-game losing streak with sharp shooting. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 30 points. Ty Jerome had 19. Jaylen Wells added 18. Cam Spencer and Vince Williams Jr. scored 16 each. Three-point shooting changed the game after a poor effort two nights earlier. Memphis went 8 of 15 from deep in the first half. A 20-point lead formed in the second half. Early fourth-quarter threes pushed the margin to 20 again. The Grizzlies stayed ahead even when Minnesota tried to rally.\n\nMinnesota could not repeat its strong showing from Saturday. Anthony Edwards led with 39 points and seven rebounds. Jaden McDaniels scored 29. Donte DiVincenzo had 21, including 13 in the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves never got closer than nine points late. Their four-game winning streak came to an end. Defensive breakdowns on the perimeter hurt them early.\n\nPhiladelphia stayed hot with a fourth straight win. Tyrese Maxey scored 29 and hit seven three-pointers. Dominick Barlow posted 26 points and 16 rebounds. Joel Embiid added 24 as he worked back from injury. The Sixers led from start to finish and built a 23-point cushion. A 72-53 halftime lead set the tone. The team improved to 11-10 without Paul George. Balanced scoring and steady defense kept control all night.\n\nLos Angeles missed James Harden for a second straight game. Kawhi Leonard led with 29 points. Jordan Miller added 21 off the bench. Short runs in the fourth quarter failed to change the outcome. Leonard finished on the bench as the gap stayed wide. The Clippers remain in the play-in chase but could not match Philadelphia’s energy.\n\nFebruary 2 produced wins that mattered beyond the final score. Charlotte proved it can fight back under pressure. Houston showed it can win even when short-handed. Memphis finally broke through after weeks of frustration. Philadelphia kept its steady climb going. For the losing teams, the night exposed problems with closing games and protecting leads. With the season moving fast, these results could shape who stays alive in the NBA playoff race and who falls behind.\n\nThe post NBA results: February 2, 2026 – winners and losers appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Coach Mike Vrabel expects an \"identity war\" when his New England Patriots meet the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday in Super Bowl LX, he said Monday.",
    "fullText": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 3 (UPI) -- Coach Mike Vrabel expects an \"identity war\" when his New England Patriots meet the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday in Super Bowl LX, he said Monday.\n\nA minor earthquake hit San Ramon, Calif., on Monday morning, but additional soil shifted hours later south in the Bay Area when Patriots and Seahawks players kicked off Super Bowl week at opening night in San Jose.\n\nPlayers from both teams fielded questions, which flew at them with the unpredictability of bouncing footballs. Fans flocked to the San Jose Convention Center just to catch glimpses of the NFL stars. Hundreds of reporters shouted questions, with content spanning from the mundane to bizarre.\n\nBut one thing was clear: the explicitly expressed identities of Vrabel's Patriots and coach Mike Macdonald's Seahawks. And neither coach is willing to budge ahead of their quest for a Lombardi Trophy.\n\n\"This will be a great identity matchup for us,\" Vrabel said. \"This will be an identity war on the biggest stage. They play hard. Their defense runs to the football. They cause a lot of turnovers.\n\n\"They are committed to running the football. It's a physical football team. ... This will be a huge challenge.\"\n\nVrabel's Patriots share similar characteristics. The Patriots and Seahawks each rank inside the Top 4 in points scored and points allowed. They also ranked inside the Top 8 in yards gained and yards allowed in 2025.\n\nMVP candidate Drake Maye propelled the Patriots, who totaled the fourth-most passing yards in the NFL. The Patriots also ranked 6th in rushing.\n\nVeteran quarterback Sam Darnold and the Seahawks ranked No. 8 in passing yards and No. 10 in rushing.\n\nThe Seahawks defense ranked No. 3 against the run and No. 10 against the pass. The Patriots ranked No. 6 against the run and No. 9 against the pass.\n\nA key difference between the teams this season was the Seahawks' strength in special teams, specifically returns. They ranked third in both kick and punt return average. That element, which aids field position, could be crucial in a game played between two tough defenses.\n\nThe team to establish dominance in their valued areas is likely to win Super Bowl LX.\n\n\"We are going to do everything we can to go out there and play a good football game,\" Darnold said. \"Execute the way we know how to execute.\"\n\nNeither coach would disclose specifics within their game plans, but Macdonald also plans to implement the Seahawks' previously successful strategies.\n\n\"We are going to stick to our process,\" Macdonald said. \"The way we wanna play is we always want to be within our wheelhouse, but every game we are going to tailor things to our opponents.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, we have to do the things we are really good at. Right now, that's our plan.\"\n\nVrabel's mere presence could be an advantage for the Patriots. The coach, who won three Super Bowls as a Patriots linebacker, took plenty of lessons from those runs. He expects that knowledge to pay off this week in the Bay Area, when players will be confronted with potential distractions.\n\n\"I think that all builds up to the end of the week, on things we can focus on that may be a little different with this football game; the warm-up time before the game, the length of halftime,\" Vrabel said. \"All of these things that are going to be a little bit different. We can try to draw on everybody's experiences.\"\n\nThe Seahawks and Patriots will practice this week at respective facilities at San Jose State and Stanford, which sit about 22 miles apart.\n\n\"It's just another challenge,\" Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez said. \"We are playing the other best team in the NFL. We're excited for it. Just ready to go out there and have one more with the guys on Sunday.\"\n\nThe Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites. The least expensive price for a ticket for Super Bowl LX, as of Monday night, was listed for about $5,000 on the secondary market.",

    "fullText": "China has banned hidden door handles on electric vehicles (EVs), making it the first country to stop the use of the controversial designs that were made popular by multi-billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla.\n\nIt comes as EVs are facing scrutiny from safety watchdogs around the world after a number of deadly incidents, including two fatal crashes in China involving Xiaomi EVs in which power failures were suspected to have prevented doors from being opened.\n\nUnder the new regulations, cars will only be allowed to be sold if they have a mechanical release both on the inside and outside of their doors, according to state media.\n\nThe new rules are due to take effect on 1 January 2027.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology rules require the outside of every passenger door except the boot, to have a recessed space measuring no smaller than 6cm (2 in) by 2cm by 2.5cm to allow access to the handle.\n\nInside the car there must be signs measuring at least 1cm by 0.7cm to show how to open the door.\n\nCars that have already been approved by authorities and are in the final stages of entering the Chinese market will have another two years to update their designs.\n\nHidden handles are widely used in China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market, which includes EVs as well as hybrid cars and those powered by fuel cells.\n\nThey feature in about 60% of the top 100 best-selling NEVs, according to data cited by government-controlled newspaper China Daily.\n\nAlthough the measures will only apply to models sold in the Chinese market, the country's huge presence in the global car industry means the move is likely to have an impact around the world.\n\nTesla's door handles are already being investigated by US safety regulators and authorities in Europe are considering their own rules.\n\nIn November, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a probe focused on Tesla's electric-powered door handles, responding to reports that they suddenly stopped working, leaving children trapped in the cars.\n\nThe NHTSA said it had received nine complaints about the handles in Tesla's 2021 Model Y cars, the company's flagship model.\n\nIn four of the cases, the car owners resorted to breaking the window to resolve the issue.",

    "title": "How does AI impact skill formation?",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Two days ago, the Anthropic Fellows program released a paper called How AI Impacts Skill Formation. Like other papers on AI before it, this one is being treated as proof that AI makes you slower and dumber. Does it prove that?\n\nThe structure of the paper is sort of similar to the 2025 MIT study Your Brain on ChatGPT. They got a group of people to perform a cognitive task that required learning a new skill: in this case, the Python Trio library. Half of those people were required to use AI and half were forbidden from using it. The researchers then quizzed those people to see how much information they retained about Trio.\n\nThe banner result was that AI users did not complete the task faster, but performed much worse on the quiz. If you were so inclined, you could naturally conclude that any perceived AI speedup is illusory, and the people who are using AI tooling are cooking their brains. But I don’t think that conclusion is reasonable.\n\nTo see why, let’s look at Figure 13 from the paper:\n\nThe researchers noticed half of the AI-using cohort spent most of their time literally retyping the AI-generated code into their solution, instead of copy-pasting or “manual coding”: writing their code from scratch with light AI guidance. If you ignore the people who spent most of their time retyping, the AI-users were 25% faster.\n\nI confess that this kind of baffles me. What kind of person manually retypes AI-generated code? Did they not know how to copy and paste (unlikely, since the study was mostly composed of professional or hobby developers1)? It certainly didn’t help them on the quiz score. The retypers got the same (low) scores as the pure copy-pasters.\n\nIn any case, if you know how to copy-paste or use an AI agent, I wouldn’t use this paper as evidence that AI will not be able to speed you up.\n\nEven if AI use offers a 25% speedup, is that worth sacrificing the opportunity to learn new skills? What about the quiz scores?\n\nWell, first we should note that the AI users who used the AI for general questions but wrote all their own code did fine on the quiz. If you look at Figure 13 above, you can see that those AI users averaged maybe a point lower on the quiz - not bad, for people working 25% faster. So at least some kinds of AI use seem fine.\n\nBut of course much current AI use is not like this: if you’re using Claude Code or Copilot agent mode, you’re getting the AI to do the code writing for you. Are you losing key skills by doing that?\n\nWell yes, of course you are. If you complete a task in ten minutes by throwing it at a LLM, you will learn much less about the codebase than if you’d spent an hour doing it by hand. I think it’s pretty silly to deny this: it’s intuitively right, and anybody who has used AI agents extensively at work can attest to it from their own experience.\n\nStill, I have two points to make about this.\n\nFirst, software engineers are not paid to learn about the codebase. We are paid to deliver business value (typically by delivering working code). If AI can speed that up dramatically, avoiding it makes you worse at your job, even if you’re learning more efficiently. That’s a bit unfortunate for us - it was very nice when we could get much better at the job simply by doing it more - but that doesn’t make it false.\n\nOther professions have been dealing with this forever. Doctors are expected to spend a lot of time in classes and professional development courses, learning how to do their job in other ways than just doing it. It may be that future software engineers will need to spend 20% of their time manually studying their codebases: not just in the course of doing some task (which could be far more quickly done by AI agents) but just to stay up-to-date enough that their skills don’t atrophy.\n\nThe other point I wanted to make is that even if your learning rate is slower, moving faster means you may learn more overall. Suppose using AI meant that you learned only 75% as much as non-AI programmers from any given task. Whether you’re learning less overall depends on how many more tasks you’re doing. If you’re working faster, the loss of learning efficiency may be balanced out by volume.\n\nI don’t know if this is true. I suspect there really is no substitute for painstakingly working through a codebase by hand. But the engineer who is shipping 2x as many changes is probably also learning things that the slower, manual engineer does not know. At minimum, they’ll be acquiring a greater breadth of knowledge of different subsystems, even if their depth suffers.\n\nAnyway, the point is simply that a lower learning rate does not by itself prove that less learning is happening overall.\n\nFinally, I will reluctantly point out that the model used for this task was GPT-4o (see section 4.1). I’m reluctant here because I sympathize with the AI skeptics, who are perpetually frustrated by the pro-AI response of “well, you just haven’t tried the right model”. In a world where new AI models are released every month or two, demanding that people always study the best model makes it functionally impossible to study AI use at all.\n\nStill, I’m just kind of confused about why GPT-4o was chosen. This study was funded by Anthropic, who have much better models. This study was conducted in 20252, at least six months after the release of GPT-4o (that’s like five years in AI time). I can’t help but wonder if the AI-users cohort would have run into fewer problems with a more powerful model.\n\nI don’t have any real problem with this paper. They set out to study how different patterns of AI use affect learning, and their main conclusion - that pure “just give the problem to the model” AI use means you learn a lot less - seems correct to me.\n\nI don’t like their conclusion that AI use doesn’t speed you up, since it relies on the fact that 50% of their participants spent their time literally retyping AI code. I wish they’d been more explicit in the introduction that this was the case, but I don’t really blame them for the result - I’m more inclined to blame the study participants themselves, who should have known better.\n\nOverall, I don’t think this paper provides much new ammunition to the AI skeptic. Like I said above, it doesn’t support the point that AI speedup is a mirage. And the point it does support (that AI use means you learn less) is obvious. Nobody seriously believes that typing “build me a todo app” into Claude Code means you’ll learn as much as if you built it by hand.\n\nThat said, I’d like to see more investigation into long-term patterns of AI use in tech companies. Is the slower learning rate per-task balanced out by the higher rate of task completion? Can it be replaced by carving out explicit time to study the codebase? It’s probably too early to answer these questions - strong coding agents have only been around for a handful of months - but the answers may determine what it’s like to be a software engineer for the next decade.\n\nI suppose the study doesn’t say that explicitly, but the Anthropic Fellows program was only launched in December 2024, and the paper was published in January 2026.\n\nIf you liked this post, consider subscribing to email updates about my new posts, or sharing it on Hacker News. Here's a preview of a related post that shares tags with this one.\n\nIs it worrying that 95% of AI enterprise projects fail?\n\nIn July of this year, MIT NANDA released a report called The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025. The report spends most of its time giving advice about how to run enterprises AI projects, but the item that got everybody talking was its headline stat: 95% of organizations are getting zero return from their AI projects.",

    "fullText": "LOS ARRECIFES, Mexico (AP) — The sun has set and the clouds are washed in purple as Mauricio Contreras and his daughter Eunices head out to fish in the Gulf of Mexico. Eunices casts the heavy net for snapper, pollock or cabrilla while her father pilots their small boat.\n\nContreras, an anchor dangling from a silver chain against his deeply tanned skin, has been doing this for more than 40 years. But he worries the family's main source of income is now at risk from an underwater pipeline completed last year to import natural gas from the United States.\n\n“When they started laying it, it affected us because the boats were dropping explosives and you could hear it all the way here, right on the shore,” Contreras recalls. Now that it's operational, he worries about leaks: “It’s a constant danger that will always be there, and it’s a risk for the entire fishing industry.”\n\nThe pipeline known as Southeast Gateway was built by Canadian company TC Energy in partnership with Mexico’s state-owned power company CFE. It adds 700 kilometers (435 miles) to a line that now stretches from southern Texas to Tabasco state, where it's supplying electricity for a major oil refinery. But its main goal is to someday deliver gas to the Yucatan Peninsula when the expansion of another pipeline is completed.\n\nSoutheast Gateway is part of a wave of projects that would allow Mexico, already the world's single largest buyer of U.S. gas, to bring in even more for its own use and to re-export to Asia and Europe. But that faces growing resistance from communities and environmental groups who say the strategy increases use of a polluting fossil fuel, deepens dependence on the U.S. and puts Mexico's climate commitments at risk.\n\nMore than 40,000 people across Veracruz make their living from the sea, including Contreras, who lives in a community where fishing is almost the only work. He joined residents of 15 coastal communities last year in a lawsuit over the pipeline that was dismissed, but is under appeal.\n\nThey allege that their communities, mostly Nahua and Nuntajiiyi' Indigenous peoples, weren't consulted before construction began as required by Mexico's Constitution.\n\n“We do not agree with this gas pipeline megaproject because we were never informed about it. We were never consulted and therefore we do not know the consequences it will have,” Maribel Cervantes, an activist and teacher who joined the lawsuit, said.\n\nThe government argued that Southeast Gateway was a matter of national security and kept some information about it secret, including its exact route. President Claudia Sheinbaum said last year that it was important for natural gas to reach the area.\n\nGreenpeace warned that dredging to bury the pipeline could affect deepwater reefs that are home to many species, some not found in shallow reefs. Pablo Ramírez, Greenpeace Mexico's energy and climate change program coordinator, also said methane leaks could affect ecosystems like the reefs. They sustain important species, including green and olive ridley sea turtles that nest on the beaches of communities such as Los Arrecifes.\n\nIn a video last September, TC Energy said experts had “thoroughly analyzed the marine environment to ensure that the route was designed to preserve ecosystems.” The Canadian company declined an interview but said the pipeline created 4,000 jobs during construction and met all federal requirements. It said the project “brings natural gas to the southeast of Mexico for the first time, opening opportunities for economic and social development in one of the poorest regions of the country.”\n\nMexico's push for U.S. gas dates to a 2013 reform that opened its energy sector to private and foreign investment, said Víctor Ramírez of energy consulting firm P21Energía. The goal was to reduce the use of more polluting fuels, such as fuel oil and coal, and take advantage of low natural gas prices in the U.S.\n\nNow, as the U.S. seeks new markets for gas fracked from the Permian Basin in Texas, Mexico offers not only a strategic geographic position for re-export but also more favorable political conditions for reaching markets the U.S. cannot easily access, said Wilmar Suárez, an energy analyst at Ember.\n\nIn turn, Mexico can resell that gas to other countries at a profit, Suárez said.\n\nSoutheast Gateway is currently supplying gas only to the $20 billion Dos Bocas refinery, one of former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's flagship projects and Mexico's largest refinery. But it could eventually carry more than 1.3 billion cubic feet of gas per day if the government's ambitious plans are realized.\n\nThose include completing another pipeline to connect Southeast Gateway with a planned plant in Oaxaca that will convert the gas to liquid for shipment to Asia. These plants burn part of the gas to power liquefaction, generating polluting emissions, said Claudia Campero of the Mexican nonprofit Climate Connections.\n\nLiquefaction plants have drawn the most opposition in recent years. That includes the Saguaro project, a planned 800-kilometer (500-mile) gas pipeline from Texas to the fishing community of Puerto Libertad, in Sonora. There, the U.S. company Mexico Pacific wants to build a plant to liquefy 15 million tons of gas per year for shipment to Asia.\n\nSuch shipping would pass through the Gulf of California, threatening whales because it's a key area for reproduction, Campero said.\n\nThe project is on hold due to lawsuits.\n\nMexico’s first export terminal for liquefied natural gas began operating in 2024, but many more are planned. If all of those come online, Mexico would have eight, with most along the Pacific coastline, according to Global Energy Monitor. The U.S. currently has nine.\n\nBoth Víctor Ramírez and Suárez said Mexico's natural gas strategy now jeopardizes its energy sovereignty.\n\nMore than 60% of Mexico’s electricity comes from gas-fired power plants, and about 70% of that gas comes from the U.S. Fitch Ratings said last year that Mexico's reliance on U.S.-piped gas will continue to grow because of rising demand, insufficient domestic production and the buildout of pipelines.\n\n“It is very easy for the U.S. to impose certain conditions on Mexico because it has a dominant position over gas supplies,\" Suárez said.\n\nThe Ministry of Energy did not respond to interview requests.\n\nPablo Ramírez, of Greenpeace, said completing all the pipeline projects would make it unlikely Mexico could meet its goal of reducing net carbon dioxide emissions by 31% to 37% by 2035. And Suárez, of Ember, said the strong focus on gas raises doubt about Mexico more than doubling — to 45% — its electricity from renewables by 2030, as promised by Sheinbaum.\n\nSheinbaum inherited most of the gas projects and must honor those commitments because funds have been invested, said Víctor Ramírez, of P21Energia. But he found optimism in the Ministry of Energy approving 20 private renewable energy projects in December.\n\nBack in Maribel Cervantes' courtyard in San Juan Volador, far from where Mexico City's powerful make energy policy decisions, she demanded that officials take communities like hers into account.\n\n“As Indigenous peoples, we demand that our right to autonomy and self-determination be respected,\" she said. \"We don't want them imposing their megaprojects on us.”\n\nDe Miguel reported from Mexico City.

    "description": "Shenzhen gold platform Jieworui collapses after 40x leveraged bets with no physical backing, leaving 150,000 victims near-empty-handed.",
    "fullText": "A Shenzhen-based gold trading platform has collapsed after running what amounted to a leveraged betting operation with no physical backing, leaving over 150,000 investors scrambling to recover their funds.\n\nThe Jieworui collapse — the largest in a recent wave of unlicensed gold platform failures across China — is now escalating into a standoff as victims refuse a repayment scheme that would pay them a fraction of their principal in exchange for waiving all legal rights.\n\nJieworui operated out of Shuibei, China's largest gold and jewelry trading hub. The platform attracted a massive retail following by offering zero-fee gold exchanges, attractive buyback prices, and a product called \"pre-set price trading\" — where users could lock in the price of one gram of gold with a deposit as small as $4.\n\nIn practice, the mechanism functioned as unlicensed options trading. The platform took the opposite side of every user bet, with leverage reaching up to 40 times. No physical gold changed hands. When users profited, Jieworui owed them the difference. When gold prices surged, those liabilities became unsurvivable.\n\nWithdrawals were first restricted around January 20, with daily limits capped at $69 or one gram of gold. Thousands of investors, many traveling from other provinces, gathered at the company's Shenzhen office demanding their money. Scuffles with police were reported. The majority of victims are housewives and working-class investors, according to local media reports.\n\nThe local government set up a special task force and announced on January 31 that Jieworui had begun processing repayments after disposing of assets and raising funds. A third-party audit was commissioned, with authorities stating that the widely circulated figure of 13.4 billion yuan in unpaid funds was \"significantly exaggerated.\"\n\nBut for victims, the reality of those repayments has been grim.\n\nThe platform initially proposed two options: a lump-sum payment at 20% of the principal, or 40% paid in 12 monthly installments. In practice, actual payout ratios have fallen well short of even the 20% floor.\n\nOne investor from Henan who put in $5,100 submitted two separate redemption applications. The first returned an offer of $1,219. The second dropped to $244. Another victim with over $44,400 in cash, 5.2 grams of gold, and 1,000 grams of silver in her account was offered just over $2,800 — roughly 6% of her holdings.\n\nCustomers who purchased platinum through the platform have been excluded from the payout calculation entirely, raising suspicions that Jieworui never held the physical metal.",

    "fullText": "William J. Brock, 83, was sentenced to 21 years to life after killing Uber driver Lo-Letha Toland-Hall in 2024\n\nBrock had been targeted by scammers for $12,000 and mistakenly believed Toland-Hall, who had been sent to pick up a package, was involved\n\nHe was ultimately convicted of murder in January\n\nAn 83-year-old Ohio man who killed an Uber driver he mistakenly thought had tried to scam him was sentenced to 21 years to life in prison.\n\nWilliam J. Brock was sentenced on Monday. Feb. 2 after he was found guilty of murder last month, according to The New York Times and the Springfield News-Sun. His conviction was also reported by the Associated Press.\n\nBrock shot Lo-Letha Toland-Hall six times outside his home in South Charleston, Ohio, in March 2024 after he wrongly believed she was involved in a scam phone call plot.\n\nPrior to the shooting, the AP reported, Brock was on the phone with scammers who demanded that he withdraw $12,000 in order to bail a relative out of jail who they said had been arrested.\n\nPer the Times, once Brock realized that the scammers were lying about the relative, the caller began to threaten him.\n\nThe caller reportedly demanded that Brock give the money to the person outside his home. That turned out to be Toland-Hall, who, it turned out, had also fallen victim to the same scammer, investigators said, according to the times.\n\nToland-Hall, 61, had been sent to Brock's house to pick up a package, and had no idea about the scam call or the demand for money, the AP reported.\n\nWhen she arrived at the home, Brock, who reportedly claimed he felt threatened, confronted Toland-Hall with a firearm and held her at gunpoint, threatening to shoot her while she tried to explain she worked for Uber and begged him not to shoot, the Times reported.\n\nEventually, Brock shot Toland-Hall six times and she was taken to the hospital, where she later died.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nThe AP reported that prosecutors said Toland-Hall was unarmed and posed no threat to Brock, who claimed self-defense during his trial.\n\nAccording to the outlets, Brock was eventually convicted of murder, but the scammers have not yet been caught.\n\n“Both families have lost loved ones because of this, and there are no winners here,” Clark County Prosecutor Daniel Driscoll said following the verdict, according to the AP. “The really sad part about this is that we know that the scammers, the folks who started this, haven’t been brought to justice. And hopefully one day the FBI will bring those folks and we’ll be able to prosecute them right here in Clark County for what they did.”",

    "fullText": "AMD (AMD) will report its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, providing Wall Street with its best look yet at the health of the ongoing AI trade.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) reported their respective results last week, sparking wildly divergent reactions from traders: Many balked at Microsoft’s increased spending and more modest growth, but applauded Meta’s performance despite a massive jump in its own AI spending.\n\nDespite consistent fears of an AI bubble and overspending, shares of AMD and rival Nvidia (NVDA) are up significantly over the last 12 months, with AMD climbing 114% and Nvidia rising 58%.\n\nAMD, like Intel (INTC), is also contending with the global memory shortage, which could force PC makers to raise prices on laptops and desktops, impacting sales and hitting AMD’s consumer chip business.\n\nAMD is expected to report Q4 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.32 on revenue of $9.6 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus estimates. That would mark an increase from the $1.09 and $7.7 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year.\n\nWall Street is anticipating data center revenue of $4.97 billion, up 29% year over year from the $3.86 billion AMD reported in Q4 2024. The company’s client business revenue is expected to top out at $2.9 billion. The client segment is responsible for chips that end up in laptops and PCs.\n\nThe chip designer’s gaming business is projected to see revenue of $855 million, a 52% year-over-year jump from the $563 million the segment saw in 2024.\n\nAMD’s results come roughly a month after it showed off a variety of new products during CEO Lisa Su’s keynote at CES 2026 in Las Vegas.\n\nThat includes the company’s upcoming Helios rack-scale server, which Su said is the world’s best AI rack, a clear shot at Nvidia.\n\nHelios is designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s own Vera Rubin-powered NVL72 rack-scale offering. Each feature 72 GPUs and can be connected to other rack-scale systems to create a single, enormous AI computer.\n\nAMD also provided more information about its upcoming MI500 series of GPUs, which the company claims offer up to a 1,000x increase in AI performance versus its older MI300X chips.\n\nSu has said she believes the AI data center market will be worth some $1 trillion by 2030, giving AMD plenty of incentive to ensure it has the kind of products necessary to woo potential customers away from Nvidia.\n\nBut like Nvidia, AMD is seeing increased competition from some of its own customers as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft continue to roll out more of their own customer chips in their data centers.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — The seven victims of a marine disaster that devastated a storied Massachusetts fishing town included a fifth-generation fisherman, a young federal fisheries observer and a father-and-son crew duo. All died when their fishing boat, the Lily Jean, sank in waters off America’s oldest seaport.\n\nThe sinking underscored the risks long inherent in Gloucester’s fishing industry, which spans more than 400 years and was famously chronicled in “The Perfect Storm.” The names of the crew will be added to a city memorial honoring thousands of fishermen lost at sea over generations.\n\nThe 72-foot (22-meter) vessel was returning to port early Friday to repair fishing gear when it sank in frigid Atlantic waters. The U.S. Coast Guard announced Monday that it was launching a formal investigation into the sinking after suspending a search for survivors Saturday. It has not said what might have caused the sinking, though it said ice buildup from freezing ocean spray can cause a boat to capsize.\n\n“You fish in federal waters, you fish in a Gloucester boat, and you lose your life, you’re forever a Gloucester fisherman,” Gloucester fisherman Al Cottone said.\n\nCoast Guard officials identified the victims Monday as captain Accursio “Gus” Sanfilippo and crewmembers Paul Beal Sr., Paul Beal Jr., John Rousanidis, Freeman Short and Sean Therrien. Also aboard was Jada Samitt, a fisheries observer for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nOn Monday, the community was quick to push back against speculation about a possible cause, recalling Sanfilippo as someone who cared about his crew and didn't take risks.\n\nVito Giacalone, head of the Gloucester Fishing Community Preservation Fund, said such sinkings are unfortunately not out of the ordinary.\n\n“We’ve had multiple sinkings. All hands lost. No radio communication at the very last minute. Nobody alive to say, oh, no, it wasn’t that,\" he said. \"So, it’s just unfair to everyone involved with the folks that were lost feeling like someone did something wrong.”\n\n“All those guys on that boat were seasoned fishermen,” former Lily Jean crew member Gryphon Orfanos said while doing boat repairs Monday at the same dock where the Lily Jean used to tie up. “They knew how dangerous it was.”\n\nOrfanos and friend Nate Dennen attached a stainless steel memorial cross with the name “Lily Jean” to a wooden beam at the dock.\n\nDennen, a longtime friend of the boat's captain Gus, said he was a mentor who looked out for his crew.\n\n“It taught me everything I know,” Orfanos said of his more than a year working on the Lily Jean — his first offshore fishing job. “Out on the ocean, it teaches you everything. But as far as I want the word to spread, Gus was the best guy ever.”\n\nCottone said any vessel leaving port needs a Coast Guard inspection decal, which requires up-to-date safety equipment — and the fishery observer conducts a safety check before each outing.\n\n“If the observer deems the boat not to be safe or have any piece of safety equipment that’s not up to date ... that observer will shut the trip down,” he said.\n\nSanfilippo was well known in Gloucester. The Lily Jean, Sanfilippo, and his crew were featured in a 2012 episode of the History Channel show “Nor’Easter Men.” The captain is described as a fifth-generation commercial fisherman, out of Gloucester, in the Georges Bank. The crew is shown working in dangerous weather conditions for hours on end, spending as many as 10 days offshore catching haddock, lobster and flounder.\n\n“We loved each other,” Giacalone said. “He treated me like a big brother and I treated him like my younger brother. To know the tragedy of this and to know the kind of character that Gus had, he’d be mortified to know that these lives were all lost.”\n\nGiacalone said the Sanfillipo and Beal names were synonymous with local fishing going back decades. He said Sanfillipo “followed in the footsteps of his dad\" while the Beal family has built boats and a brother is also a fisherman.\n\n“Those two families are absolutely etched in centuries of these multiple generations of fishermen,” Giacalone said.\n\nCrew made of veterans and newcomers\n\nJust as Sanfillipo had years of experience, Samitt was undertaking her first job at sea as an observer. The 22-year-old was tasked with collecting data from the catch, used for making government regulations and other purposes.\n\nSamitt’s family said in a statement that she was originally from Virginia and had a deep love of Gloucester’s fishing community and \"conveyed to us how critical it was to protect the seas and fisheries.”\n\nNOAA, meanwhile, offered its condolences.\n\n“Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Jada’s family, the families of the six fishermen, the NOAA observer community, and everyone affected,” its statement said.\n\nTherrien, 44, was working his first season on a commercial fishing vessel, joining the Lily Jean after his close friend Rousanidis said the boat needed another crew member, his partner Becky Carp said. He had been on about a half-dozen trips already, she said, and appeared to be settling into the job despite complaints about the cold.\n\nTherrien, she said, was \"always up for an adventure” but took thed job mostly so he could provide for his family. The lifelong Massachusetts resident was the family's breadwinner and sought to supplement his construction work, which was scarce in the winter.\n\n“He wanted to make sure his family was safe and taken care which is why he was busting his butt,” Carp said.\n\nCarp last talked to Therrien on Tuesday before he headed out. She had wanted him to take the week off to spend time with him but he felt he needed to make money. She only learned about the sinking when alerts began popping up Friday.\n\n“You always want to hold out hope that they are found. Come Saturday morning, I kind of knew at that point that they wouldn’t find any survivors,” Carp said. “I feel like it’s a nightmare that I am going to wake up from. It's just a bad dream and everything will be OK. But unfortunately, it's not.\"\n\nWhittle reported from Scarborough, Maine.",

(WKRN) — A newly-released batch of files in the case against convicted sex offender Jeffery Epstein ties him to Nashville.\n\nDozens of emails show Epstein’s team booking flights to and from Nashville, and paying tens of thousands of dollars to support a woman living in Middle Tennessee. Email after email — sent over the span of several years — painted a picture of his travels to Nashville to visit a woman and pay for nearly every part of her life.\n\nDECEMBER 2025 | Unsealed Epstein files reveal Nashville connection\n\nIn a 2015 email sent to Epstein, there was an expense reimbursement list from May 2014 until May 2015. It included more than $1,000 on vitamins, more than $5,000 for bedding and furniture and tens of thousands more for living expenses — including a ski trip. It all added up to more than $51,000.\n\nThere were also some more intimate emails.\n\n“Still in Nashville, right where you left me,” one read, in part. “…”sorry you made out with some hot chick and caught a cold, we have lots of hot chicken and hot fish around here.”\n\nA reply from Epstein said, “why don’t you spend some real time there,” in reference to Nashville.\n\nRELATED | Victims complain of death threats as government says it’s fixing redactions in Epstein-related files\n\nAs more documents have been released, some of Epstein’s victims said they’re angry their names were not fully redacted in the newly released files.\n\nIn the files related to Nashville, there were instances where a woman’s name was not redacted. News 2 is not sharing that information.",

    "fullText": "Grab Malaysia says it is \"deeply sorry\" after a female passenger in Johor was allegedly sexually harassed by an e-hailing driver. Video footage of the incident showed a male driver reaching behind to touch a woman passenger. He is also heard making inappropriate comments in Mandarin.\n\nLocal media claim former actor Edmund Chen will appeal against his five-day jail sentence for careless driving. The 63-year-old filed a notice of appeal on Monday (2 Feb), based on court records. Chen was involved in an accident in March last year which left a 21-year-old motorcyclist with fractures to his wrist and hand.\n\nRead \n\nGrab Malaysia has issued an apology after a woman was allegedly sexually harassed by an e-hailing driver in Johor, according to multiple reports.\n\nVideo footage of the incident went viral online and showed a male driver reaching behind to touch a woman passenger before she pushes his hand away. He is also heard making inappropriate comments in Mandarin, including asking about her age and how much she would “cost”.\n\nGrab, posting in a comment section of a portal, said it was “deeply sorry that this incident occurred\".\n\n\"This should never have happened. We are aware of the report and are actively reaching out to the affected passenger to investigate the matter and provide appropriate support,\" the company said. \"We take this seriously and will take action in line with our policies.\"\n\nEarlier, Johor police said they are working to identify the driver, adding that no police report has been lodged so far.\n\nMore than 8 in 10 respondents to a recent poll on Yahoo believe it will not be easier to find a new job in 2026.\n\nResults from the survey – as of press time – showed an overwhelming 86% of those polled were not confident of their new job prospects this year. Only 10% of the 956 votes felt it would be easier to find a new job in 2026.\n\nThe poll remains open and you can cast your opinion below.,\n\nWorkers’ Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh has a new seat in Parliament and no longer sits directly opposite Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.\n\nThe new seating plan was updated at 10.30am on Tuesday morning (3 Feb) before Parliament was due to sit, as per the Straits Times.\n\nThe development follows Singh's removal as Leader of the Opposition and WP's refusal to nominate another elected MP to the role.\n\nDeputy Speaker of Parliament Christopher de Souza has taken Singh's previous place opposite PM Wong with the WP chief now seated between MPs Xie Yao Quan and Mariam Jaafar.\n\nYou can see a graphic of the seating plan, here.\n\nThe Housing Board (HDB) said on Monday (2 Feb) it will launch three Build-To-Order (BTO) projects in Lakeview and Shunfu – a first for the area in over four decades.\n\nAbout 1,600 BTO flats will be offered across the projects which could appeal to buyers who want to stay near the towns of Toa Payoh, Bishan and Ang Mo Kio.\n\n\"The first project at Lakeview will be launched in the June 2026 BTO sales exercise, with about 1,200 units. Construction works will be carried out progressively from 2Q 2026,\" said HDB in a statement. \"The other two projects will be launched within the next two years.\"\n\nYou can read this Straits Times story \n\nThe Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board has launched two new anti-scam measures, the Safety Switch and the Trusted Contact notification service.\n\nCPF announced the new security layers on Monday (2 Feb) to better help members protect their savings against scammers.\n\nThe Safety Switch enables members aged 55 and above to stop unintended transactions and prevent the loss of personal data due to compromised Singpass accounts. It can only be deactivated in person or at a CPF service centre or via the CPF hotline.\n\n\"Upon activation, the CPF Safety Switch will disable access to CPF online services on the CPF website and mobile app, stop in-progress withdrawals and prevent all future withdrawals from the member's CPF account,\" read a statement.\n\nFor the Trusted Contact notification service, CPF members aged 21 and above will have the option to appoint up to two contacts who would receive a copy of notifications for important transactions. The aim of the 'trusted contact' is to help spot suspicious transactions and intervene promptly.\n\nMore information can be found on the CPF website.\n\nFormer actor Edmund Chen will appeal against his five-day jail sentence for careless driving, according to local media.\n\nSeveral outlets reported that the 63-year-old – named as Tan Kai Yuan in court documents – filed a notice of appeal on Monday (2 Feb), citing court records.\n\nIt was also reported that Chen appears to be changing his lawyers, switching from Invictus Law to Contigo Law.\n\nIn March last year, Chen was involved in an accident on the Ayer Rajah Expressway after he slowed his vehicle almost to a stop and caused a collision with a motorcyclist as he attempted to filter out from the road leading to Keppel Road.\n\nThe manoeuvre, which saw his vehicle going over chevron markings, left a 21-year-old motorcyclist with fractures to his wrist and hand.\n\nChen pleaded guilty to causing grievous hurt through careless driving.\n\nBoth the defence and prosecution had sought a fine but the judge imposed five days’ jail and a driving ban of five years.\n\nAviation and aerospace will be the \"twin, reinforcing engines of growth\" for Singapore’s economy, according to Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong.\n\nDPM Gan made the remarks during the opening ceremony of the Singapore Airshow 2026 on Monday (2 Feb) where he emphasised how Singapore has built its relevance by connecting people and markets, as per the Straits Times.\n\nSingapore is able to position itself as a leading air hub as well as an advanced manufacturing and engineering base. \"These strengths reinforce one another,\" Gan was quoted as saying.\n\nGan revealed that since the last air show, Singapore has attracted more than $750 million in investment commitments across aerospace manufacturing, maintenance, repair and overhaul, as well as aftermarket services. He expects this to create nearly 600 jobs over the next five years.\n\nDPM Gan outlined four key strategies to maintain Singapore's momentum:\n\nResearch, Development and Innovation\n\nYou can read full details about each point in ST's report.",

    "fullText": "An \"infatuated\" prison officer who had a \"substantial sexual relationship\" with an inmate where she worked has been jailed for two and a half years.\n\nCharlotte Winstanley, 27, smuggled a range of contraband material into HMP Lindholme, near Doncaster, for prisoner Jabhari Blair, 30, including a mobile phone which they used to send \"explicit photos and videos\".\n\nSheffield Crown Court was told that in one message, Winstanley, of Coronation Road, Doncaster, told Blair: \"I love my job, but I love you more.\"\n\nBlair, a former organised gang member, was jailed in 2014 for 12 and a half years.\n\nOn Monday, he was given a 13-month sentence after admitting possessing cannabis and a prohibited phone and USB stick.\n\nWinstanley admitted misconduct in public office and transmitting a photograph from inside a prison.\n\nJudge Jeremy Richardson KC, the Recorder of Sheffield, described the the case as the \"worst\" of its type he had dealt with.\n\nThe court previously heard messages uncovered between Winstanley and Blair described Mondays as \"date nights\".\n\nProsecutor Aaron Dinnes told the court that prison cameras had picked up \"intimate moments\" showing them touching and disappearing together into rooms.\n\nDinnes said one message from Blair indicated that he \"can't wait to give Miss Winstanley a beautiful baby\".\n\nRichardson told the court that in October 2020 Winstanley had become an operational support officer at HMP Lindholme, then became a prison officer and received anti-corruption training.\n\n\"Whilst working on J-Wing, you started a corrupt relationship with Blair,\" he said.\n\n\"You knew it was wrong and against all the training you'd received.\"\n\nHe said although there were \"suspicions\" about her, she \"brazened it out and continued [the] corrupt affair\".\n\nShe knew the sentence Blair was serving was for a serious crime, the court heard, and had taken a screenshot of a news article showing this.\n\nWinstanley bought him sim cards and smuggled them into prison, the judge said.\n\n\"You professed love for each other and engaged in WhatsApp and Snapchat messages,\" Richardson said, adding that many were \"explicit and unnecessary\",\n\nOne message from Winstanley read: \"I'm literally praying to have your babies\", while another stated: \"Life starts now, baby. Every sacrifice I make I do so I can be with you.\"\n\n\"It is utterly clear that you both knew that what you were doing was unlawful and corrupt,\" Richardson said.\n\nHe added that Winstanley gave Blair sensitive information about the movement of prisoners, healthcare information about other inmates and intelligence about a search scheduled to take place within his cell.\n\nThe court heard Blair told Winstanley he had used his contacts within the prison to ensure she was protected and said someone was ready to \"fight immediately if necessary\".\n\nWinstanley also became close with Blair's mother, the judge said, who was \"clearly aware of the nature of the relationship\".\n\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North\n\nOfficer 'prayed' to have inmate's babies - court\n\nPrison officer admits relationship with inmate\n\nPrison officer jailed over affair with inmate\n\nHM Courts and Tribunals Service",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA ran into exasperating fuel leaks during a make-or-break test of its new moon rocket Monday, calling into question how soon astronauts could take off for a trip around the moon.\n\nThe leaks — reminiscent of the rocket's delayed debut three years ago — sprang just a couple hours into the daylong fueling operation at Kennedy Space Center.\n\nLaunch controllers began loading the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket with super-cold hydrogen and oxygen at midday. More than 700,000 gallons (2.6 million liters) had to flow into the tanks and remain on board for several hours, mimicking the final stages of an actual countdown.\n\nBut excessive hydrogen quickly built up near the bottom of the rocket. Hydrogen loading was halted at least twice as the launch team scrambled to work around the problem using techniques developed during the previous Space Launch System countdown in 2022. That first test flight was plagued by hydrogen leaks before finally soaring without a crew.\n\nThe four astronauts assigned to the mission — three Americans and one Canadian — monitored the critical dress rehearsal from nearly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away in Houston, home to Johnson Space Center. They have been in quarantine for the past 1½ weeks, awaiting the practice countdown's outcome.\n\nMonday's fueling demo will determine when they can blast off on the first lunar voyage by a crew in more than half a century.\n\nAt best, NASA could launch commander Reid Wiseman and his crew to the moon no sooner than Sunday. The rocket must be flying by Feb. 11 or the mission will be called off until March. The space agency only has a few days in any given month to launch the rocket, and the extreme cold already has shortened February’s launch window by two days.\n\nRunning behind because of the bitter cold snap, the countdown clocks began ticking Saturday night, giving launch controllers the chance to go through all the motions and deal with any lingering rocket problems. The clocks were set to stop a half-minute before reaching zero, just before engine ignition.\n\nThe nearly 10-day mission will send the astronauts past the moon, around the mysterious far side and then straight back to Earth, with the goal of testing the capsule's life support and other vital systems. The crew will not go into lunar orbit or attempt to land.\n\nNASA last sent astronauts to the moon during the 1960s and 1970s Apollo program. The new Artemis program aims for a more sustained lunar presence, with Wiseman’s crew setting the stage for future moon landings by other astronauts.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "description": "Disney reported \"headwinds\" in international visitation to its American parks as foreign travelers continue to avoid the US.",
    "fullText": "Looks like even \"The Most Magical Place on Earth\" isn't enough to entice foreign travelers who are skipping the US.\n\nDisney is facing some \"international visitation headwinds\" at its parks in the US, which include Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California, the Walt Disney Company said in its first-quarter earnings report on Monday.\n\nDespite the slowdown in international visitors, the company reported growth in its experiences segment, with visitation at its domestic parks up 1% in the most recent quarter.\n\nHugh Johnston, Disney CFO, told analysts on a call that the company has less visibility into international visitor trends than domestic because foreign travelers tend to stay in non-Disney hotels, but that there were other indicators international visitation was down.\n\n\"As a result of that, we pivoted our marketing and sales efforts, promotional as well as marketing efforts to a more domestic audience, and we're able to keep attendance rates high from that perspective,\" he said.\n\nDisney's just the latest American company to feel the slowdown in foreigners traveling to the US.\n\nInternational visitation was down for the eighth straight month in December, according to data from the National Travel and Tourism Office. As of October, the number of international visitors to the US was down 5.5% in 2025 compared to a year prior.\n\nAmir Eylon, president and CEO of Longwoods International, a market research consultancy that specializes in the travel tourism industry, said visits from Canada especially declined, but that there were also significant declines in visits from countries like Germany, France, and India.\n\nCanadian visits to the US were down 22% year-to-date as of October compared to a year prior, according to NTTO data.\n\n\"We have an image problem right now with our Canadian neighbors to the North and, as evidenced with some other countries, we have an image problem in some of our key international feeder markets as well,\" Eylon told Business Insider.\n\nHis firm's research has found a majority of Canadians say American trade policies and political rhetoric are deterring them from visiting the US in the next 12 months. Many also say they do not feel like the US is a safe place to visit.\n\nCanadians also typically make up a significant portion of international travel to Florida, so Eylon said Disney likely isn't the only destination in the Sunshine State feeling the slowdown.\n\nTravelers seeking to avoid the US also have other options when it comes to experiencing Disney. Disneyland Paris is fully owned by the Walt Disney Company, while the company has minority ownership in the Disney resorts in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Disney has no ownership in Tokyo Disneyland, which operates under a licensing agreement.\n\nDisney also benefited from consistent demand in domestic leisure travel, with Americans continuing to prioritize travel, Eylon said.\n\nAnna Abelson, an adjunct professor at New York University's Jonathan M. Tisch Center of Hospitality, said the slowdown in international visitors to Disney underscored a broader industry shift.\n\n\"Even 'bucket list' icons are navigating significant macroeconomic volatility, ranging from currency fluctuations to shifting geopolitical sentiments,\" Abelson told Business Insider.\n\nHave a story to share about travel to the US?

    "fullText": "Barbara Corcoran, 76, swears by having separate bedrooms from her husband. She says couples should try it — even in small spaces.\n\n\"Well, they could get separate beds. They could put a wall up. They could sleep on the convertible couch,\" Corcoran told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Monday.\n\nWhile she acknowledged that the setup won't work for everyone, Corcoran said many people living in small apartments could make better use of the space they already have.\n\n\"I don't really have a solution, but there's a lot of New Yorkers who have two bedrooms and one set up as a den or TV room. I think that's a misuse,\" she said. \"When I got my second bedroom, I immediately loved my husband twice as much.\"\n\nThe \"Shark Tank\" host and her husband, retired Navy captain and FBI agent Bill Higgins, have been married since 1988.\n\nFor Corcoran, protecting her alone time is key, including in the mornings.\n\n\"I always wake up at 5 o'clock. I make myself some coﬀee, sit on my chair and daydream for an hour. I try to stay oﬀ my cellphone and I usually succeed,\" she said.\n\nDespite her busy schedule, the business mogul says she doesn't work on Mondays.\n\n\"I take Mondays oﬀ, and I always have. I will not work on a Monday. On Friday, I leave all my commands, all my notes, little Post-it Notes on everybody's machines. Or now, it's a lot of email,\" Corcoran said.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Corcoran has shared her views on sleep divorce. In a December 2024 appearance on \"The Jamie Kern Lima Show,\" Corcoran described having separate bedrooms as one of the secrets to her successful marriage.\n\n\"Well, I think there's something to be said about your own private space. Yes, I lead a very busy life. I have a huge family that I'm always entertaining. I have very sincere, active friends, and so what I need more than anything else is a respite, and my husband is not relaxing,\" Corcoran told podcast host Jamie Kern Lima.\n\nShe added that it's difficult for her to muster the energy at the end of the day to listen to him and contribute meaningfully to the conversation.\n\nMoreover, she and her husband have rules for entering each other's bedrooms. \"I have to invite him into my bedroom, and I like it that way,\" Corcoran said.\n\nMany other celebrities have also spoken about sleeping separately from their spouses. Carson Daly has called sleep divorce the \"best thing\" for his marriage, while Bette Midler has said she and her husband of over 40 years have slept apart since the start of their relationship.",

For now, both companies will maintain their separate branding, but the company \"will be looking at how this might change in the future,\" it said.\n\nDespite the acquisition, xAI staff will not be allowed to access internal SpaceX databases or collaborate directly with workers at the rocket ship company without direct approval, the memo said. The companies will be kept separate due to regulations that control the sharing of defense and space-related technology that could impact national security. SpaceX workers may be allowed access to xAI internal tools, it said.\n\nSpaceX and xAI CEO Elon Musk sent a memo to staff earlier on Monday announcing the acquisition. In the email, which was later shared online, he said the merger would allow the joint venture to eventually launch data centers in space.\n\nHe wrote that the deal would create \"the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world's foremost real-time information and free speech platform.\"\n\nLast year, Musk announced that xAI merged with his social media company, X.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "fullText": "Broncos' often-criticized cornerback predicted to be targeted by 3 teams in offseason trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos had one of the best defenses in the NFL in 2025 and odds are, they'll want to keep that unit together as much as possible.\n\nStarting cornerback Riley Moss had a roller-coaster season, but the fact that he led the league in defensive pass interference penalties drew the ire of many within Broncos Country. Would the team be open to moving him?\n\nMoss will be entering the final year of his rookie deal in 2026. The Broncos will have to decide whether to extend his contract or allow him to enter free agency next offseason, where they would get nothing in return if he signs a contract with another team.\n\nAlex Ballentine of Bleacher Report published an article looking at the top three trade targets for each NFL team this offseason, and he has three teams with Moss on the list.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins, Pittsburgh Steelers and San Francisco 49ers are teams that Ballentine believes could approach the Broncos regarding a trade for the 25-year-old corner. Each of those teams could use help in the secondary and could obtain a young player in a relatively cost-friendly deal.\n\nThe Broncos used their first-round selection on Jahdae Barron out of Texas last spring and they will want to get him on the field more in 2026. However, Ja'Quan McMillian has been too good in his role as the team's nickel corner spot to be taken off the field. That could leave Moss as the odd man out.\n\nTeams playing the Broncos this season routinely took shots down the field against Moss, looking to take advantage of a perceived mismatch or draw a pass interference penalty. With Pat Surtain II on the other side of the field, this is a practice that isn't going to change.\n\nThat said, despite the many flags thrown against him this season, Moss more than held his own in pass coverage and though many Broncos fans may disagree, he has been a solid cornerback for the team. The Broncos don't have to move him and unless they are blown away by an offer, they shouldn't.\n\nREAD:Latest NFL coaching hire all but confirms Broncos won't lose Vance Joseph\n\nThe team can move forward with the secondary as is and enjoy what could be an embarrassment of riches if Barron turns into the player many believe he will. Moss is a big piece of this team's defense and the Broncos shouldn't tinker with that chemistry.\n\nDenver Broncos 2025 Grades: Report card for team's free-agent signings\n\nBroncos upcoming free agent just drew a difficult line in the sand\n\nBroncos Rookie Report Card: How does the 2025 class grade out?\n\nBroncos lose coveted assistant coach to AFC rival\n\nBroncos predicted to add playmaking piece to secondary in first round of 2026 draft",

    "title": "Gasperini Reflects on Roma’s Mentality After Defeat: “This is a team that always comes off the pitch with its head held high”",
    "description": "After a tough loss to Udinese, Gasperini accentuated the positive.",
    "fullText": "Roma entered today’s Round 22 fixture looking to reclaim third place on the league table. And while a win wouldn’t have advanced the Giallorossi further up the table, a loss would have been a blow to the club’s top-four hopes. With the top six clubs separated by 14 points, week-to-week volatility at the top of the table should be expected, making every point worth its weight in gold, especially those in which Roma was the ostensible favorite.\n\nBut after 90 minutes, Roma left empty-handed following their match against mid-table Udinese. However, unlike recent defeats, this wasn’t the typical fire-15-shots-on-goal-but-come-up-empty-handed affair. No, this time, Roma was done in by two deflections: one off Donyell Malen and the other caused by Donyell Malen. Unfortunately for us, the latter was harmless while the former produced the only goal of the match, a Jurgen Ekkrlenkamp free-kick that caromed off Malen’s shoulder, giving it enough English to squirm past Mile Svilar.\n\nToss in a would-be equalizer chalked off due to an offside call, and this was your classic back-breaking defeat for Roma, which slipped to fifth place following tonight’s 1-0 defeat, two points behind fourth-place Juventus.\n\nWhile many of us would have read Roma the riot act after this defeat, Gian Piero Gasperini took a more measured approach in his post-match presser. (Transcript courtesy of the official club site. )\n\nWas there perhaps a bit of a lack of quality?\n\n“Without a doubt, it wasn’t easy. We lacked a bit of precision in the final third, and maybe a bit of luck as well, especially with the goal we conceded. But this is a team that always comes off the pitch with its head held high and finds the strength to keep improving”.\n\nToday, there were two dangerous chances. What are the reasons for this step backwards?\n\n“It was a tight game, difficult for both sides. They also had a couple of shots from a distance. When you get four or five players into the box, those become chances. I think overall we did much more”.\n\nHow satisfied are you with the transfer window?\n\n“I agree with the analysis of the match — these are difficult games, decided by moments. The transfer window is closed now, and we have these four months ahead of us. I didn’t expect to have so many difficulties in bringing in a few players in specific roles we’ve been looking for since the summer. That said, Malen has arrived, Zaragoza has arrived, and we also have very young lads who will certainly give their all”.\n\nIs there a player you would have liked to sign? A final cherry on top?\n\n“No, no. Look, dozens of names were mentioned. I’m very happy because, in a very short space of time, the opportunity to sign Malen came up and then, in the final two days, also Zaragoza. I realize the January transfer window is never easy, but that’s how it is and how it went. These two players will definitely help us. Then players like Venturino and Vaz arrived as well, but they represent the future — we can’t expect them, at this moment, to be competitive for such high objectives. The most important thing is to avoid injuries. That would be crucial, and to get Dybala, Koné and a few other players who are still out back fit. Then we’ll continue on the path we’ve followed so far, because this is a group that definitely works hard”.\n\nDo teams play too much, as Conte says?\n\n“Football inevitably leads to injuries. Muscle strains have always existed, just like sprains to the knees and ankles. Today, they may be a bit more frequent because we play twice as many matches, but if you look at the percentages, probably injuries have always been the same: subluxations, bruises, knee and ankle problems. Science has never managed to halve recovery times — when there is a muscle injury, you still need at least three weeks, just like years ago. Today, we have much more accurate diagnoses and sometimes also a bit of bad luck, which leads to players being sidelined for apparently minor issues, and that is a topic. There are clearly a lot of games being played. That’s what television and the public want, so the system goes on like this. These are the risks, effectively. However, there is nothing that proves with certainty that doing things differently would prevent injuries. It’s a statistical observation, but not an absolute certainty”.",

    "description": "Chicago reshapes its rotation and bullpen, then lands Alex Bregman, earning high marks for a transformative offseason.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Cubs were very active this offseason. A couple of months after making the National League Divisional Series, the front office knew they had to make this team better this winter.\n\nSo, the Cubs went out and improved their rotation, revamped their bullpen, and found a solid replacement for Kyle Tucker atop their lineup. Those were the three biggest needs for this team heading into the offseason.\n\nAnd the North Siders addressed all three needs.\n\nFollowing the rotation’s struggles in last year’s postseason, Chicago had to add a top-of-the-line starting pitcher in the offseason. Despite missing out on free agent pitchers like Dylan Cease and Tatsuya Imai, the Cubs pivoted to the trade market.\n\nIn the trade market, they eventually found their frontline starting pitcher. The Cubs and Miami Marlins reached a deal that sent pitcher Edward Cabrera to the Windy City in exchange for top prospect Owen Caissie and two other prospects.\n\nThe addition of Cabrera now gives the Cubs six strong rotation arms once everyone is healthy. Cabrera joins a group of Shota Imanaga, Matthew Boyd, Cade Horton, Jameson Taillon, and Justin Steele.\n\nThe bullpen will look a bit different this season, especially with Brad Keller, Drew Pomeranz, and Andrew Kittredge all gone. But the Cubs replaced those quality relievers with high-upside arms.\n\nThe team signed Phil Maton, Hoby Milner, Jacob Webb, and Hunter Harvey in free agency. Maton is coming off his best season. Milner has been a workhorse out of the bullpen in each of the past four years. Webb has finished with a sub-3.05 ERA in back-to-back seasons, and Harvey has shown his potential on the mound when healthy.\n\nThose four new additions, along with Caleb Thielbar, Daniel Palenica, and Colin Rea, make this a solid bullpen entering the 2026 season.\n\nThen, the Cubs made their biggest move of the offseason in mid-January by signing Alex Bregman to a five-year, $175 million contract. That marked the third biggest contract signed in the team’s history.\n\nBregman brings leadership and playoff experience to that Cubs clubhouse. Most importantly, he firmly replaces Tucker at the top of Chicago’s lineup. The veteran has finished with at least a 3.5 WAR in four consecutive seasons.\n\nThere’s no doubt that the Cubs made a lot of moves this winter. The highlight of their offseason was trading for Cabrera and signing Bregman to a massive contract.\n\nGiven all those moves made by the Cubs, Jim Bowden of The Athletic was a big fan of their offseason. Bowden gave the North Siders an ‘A’ offseason grade. Only the Los Angeles Dodgers (A+) had a better offseason grade.\n\nSo, it appears to have been a successful offseason for the Cubs.",

    "fullText": "On Monday evening, the BC men’s hockey team faced off against Harvard at TD Garden for the first round of the 2026 Beanpot. Not only are the two teams fighting for important bragging rights, they also are near the bubble of the NCAA tournament, so it was a very important game for both squads.\n\nHarvard controlled most of the game in its opening minutes, but when Drew Fortescue slotted in a goal just 3 minutes in, things were already leaning BC’s way. The Eagles started to take over more of the possession time as the first period progressed, and quickly culminating with two goals by James Hagens to extend BC’s lead to 3-0 only 15 minutes of game time after the opening faceoff.\n\nIn the second period, it was Harvard that made quick work of things. They scored in under 30 seconds to start the second period to steal back some momentum. But the Crimson train did not keep rolling, and the rest of the second period was dominated by the Eagles, who outshot their opponent 20-1 for the remainder of that period. Dean Letourneau tipped in a laser shot by James Hagens to bring BC’s lead back out to 4-1 with just 20 seconds remaining, which once again gave BC all of the momentum heading into the intermission.\n\nThe third period was mostly a formality, even as Harvard pressured with an empty net. They couldn’t get more than just a few shots on net, and eventually Lukas Gustafsson completely ended their night with a corner snipe in the final minutes. Boston College came away with the 5-1 victory to advance to the Beanpot’s final round against either Boston University or Northeastern on Monday February 9th",

    "fullText": "Kamaru Usman thinks Khamzat Chimaev likely struggles to make 185 pounds.\n\nThe UFC middleweight champion continues to call out light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira despite not having defended his belt once. Chimaev (15-0 MMA, 9-0 UFC) claimed the 185-pound title with a dominant performance against Dricus Du Plessis at UFC 319.\n\nUsman, who took Chimaev to a majority decision on short notice at UFC 294, sees Chimaev's insistence in going after Pereira (13-3 MMA, 10-2 UFC) as a sign.\n\n\"For Khamzat Chimaev to continue to call him out, I think Khamzat potentially has outgrown the weight class again to where now he's like, 'Let me go to a new division where I can make the weight and I can capture that,'\" Usman said on his \"Pound 4 Pound\" podcast with Henry Cejudo. \"There's all types of rumors and things coming out saying he's 230 pounds, 225, whatever. Khamzat is a big guy. Khamzat has always been a big guy. The fact that Khamzat was making 170 is just as ridiculous as Anthony Johnson when he was making 170.\n\n\"But Anthony Johnson, remember, was making that, moved up, fought at '85 I think maybe one time, and I think even missed weight there after moving up, then settled at 205 pounds. So, I think Khamzat Chimaev might potentially be in that same ballpark which is potentially why he's asking for 'Poatan.' And if that's the case, I understand it. Now it makes sense. If you've outgrown the weight class, it makes sense. Why kill myself to get down there when I just can't make the weight anymore.\"\n\nChimaev was open in saying that he'd rather not defend his belt against top contender Nassourdine Imavov, who is a fellow Russian fighter.\n\n\"And if I go up there and I'm able to get that title, guess what? That opens the door for another Russian in Nassourdine Imavov to get that middleweight title or potentially fight for that title,\" Usman said. \"So hey, it might be chess pieces being played here.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Kamaru Usman theorizes why Khamzat Chimaev insists on Alex Pereira",

    "description": "Despite C.J. Stroud's tough playoff exit, Nico Collins delivered a powerful message of encouragement, reminding his quarterback of his true potential and leadership.",
    "fullText": "The Houston Texans saw their 2025 season end with a rough road performance against the New England Patriots in the Divisional round of the postseason. It was the same way the two seasons prior ended, which were seen as successes. This time around, Houston would have liked to get over that hump and finally advance to the AFC Championship Game, but that didn't happen in part to a horrendous performance from the offensive side of the ball.\n\nHouston lost 28-16 to the Patriots, who will represent the AFC in Super Bowl LX. This marks the second season in a row the Texans have fallen to the eventual AFC Champion, which is nothing to scoff at. The Texans were in the game with the Patriots for most of the contest, but turnovers and offensive inefficiency made it hard to win.\n\nThe weather conditions in the game were difficult to play in, but that does not excuse the offense's complete sloppiness. Quarterback C.J. Stroud played what was probably the worst game of his career as he threw four interceptions and completed well under 50 percent of his passes. It was a rough way to end his third season in the league, especially in what could be seen as a contract year.\n\nStroud was out there in New England without his top offensive weapon in wide receiver Nico Collins. The star wideout suffered a concussion during the Wild Card round against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and he did not have enough time to clear the league's concussion protocol.\n\nDespite not being out there for his team's last game, Collins had a message for Stroud after the tough performance, which he shared during a media scrum with Aaron Wilson, \"Yeah, no doubt man, just keep your head up. You know what I'm saying? It's not the way we want to end; our goal was to go to the Super Bowl. You know, things happen. Just keep being you, brother, don't let this one game define who you are. We all know who you are. Keep being a star, keep being the leader you are, keep being the light in the room. Dude is a baller man.\"\n\nStroud is going to have a long offseason, as the end of the 2025 campaign will likely stick with him. He should have a chip on his shoulder heading into 2026, but he will have plenty of opportunities to make up for his poor postseason performance.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United supporters made their feelings known about the club’s ownership situation once again ahead of the match against Fulham at Old Trafford.\n\nThe on-pitch focus remained on the game itself, which was settled by a Benjamin Sesko injury-time winner. The mood around the stadium, however, was shaped by protests and marches referenced in the latest episode of Talk of the Devils.\n\nAccording to Talk of the Devils, fans gathered before kick-off to voice their frustration at the Glazer family’s long-standing control of the club.\n\nThe podcast also noted that INEOS – now controlling United’s football operations – attracted criticism from some supporters as well.\n\nFurthermore, The Athletic’s United show described the protests as a familiar part of the matchday landscape. They also explained that anti-ownership messaging remains prominent.\n\nIn addition, the tone reflected an atmosphere where some fans feel their concerns have not been answered by recent changes behind the scenes.\n\nThis implies that anger is no longer aimed at one group alone.\n\nOwnership narratives can influence the wider conversation around recruitment, long-term planning and trust in decision-makers – not just one single fixture.\n\nThe uproar around the ground, therefore, shapes how matchdays are experienced. Essentially, supporters believe they have been forced to repeat the same messages for years.\n\nTalk of the Devils’ mention of continued demonstrations is a timely reminder that protests have become a recurring theme in United coverage. This is evidently not a one-off event.\n\nIn the final analysis, the podcast’s observation points to a question United’s hierarchy cannot ignore: how quickly can confidence be rebuilt while the same ownership arguments remain unresolved?",

    "description": "The Spanish figure skater Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaté faces a last-minute scramble to redesign his Olympic short program after a copyright dispute blocked him from using music from the Minions franchise just days before competition begins at the Milano Cortina Winter Games.  The six-time Spanish national champion from Barcelona, who is set to make his Olympic debut in the men’s singles event, said he learned late last week that the routine he has performed throughout the 2025-26 season would not be cleared for Olympic use.

    "fullText": "The Spanish figure skater Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaté faces a last-minute scramble to redesign his Olympic short program after a copyright dispute blocked him from using music from the Minions franchise just days before competition begins at the Milano Cortina Winter Games.\n\nThe six-time Spanish national champion from Barcelona, who is set to make his Olympic debut in the men’s singles event, said he learned late last week that the routine he has performed throughout the 2025-26 season would not be cleared for Olympic use. Guarino Sabaté said he had submitted the music through the International Skating Union’s recommended rights-clearance process months ago and had competed with the program without issue during the season, including at last month’s European championships in Sheffield.\n\nThe ruling means the 26-year-old must now adapt or replace choreography he has refined for months, a daunting task in a sport where musical timing and muscle memory are inseparable.\n\n“Finding this out so close to the biggest competition of my life was incredibly disappointing,” Guarino Sabaté said in a social media post. “Nevertheless, I will face this challenge head-on and do everything I can to make the best of the situation.”\n\nThe routine, built around music from the popular animated film franchise, had become a signature for the Spanish skater. He regularly performed wearing a yellow shirt and blue overalls reminiscent of the film characters, leaning into a playful, crowd-friendly style he said was designed to show that men’s figure skating can balance technical difficulty with humor and personality.\n\nRights to the Minions property are controlled by Illumination and parent studio Universal Pictures. It was not immediately clear which specific licensing hurdle ultimately blocked Olympic clearance, but music licensing in figure skating has grown increasingly labyrinthine in recent years, particularly as the sport has shifted toward contemporary popular music.\n\nAt last year’s world championships in Boston, the ISU director-general, Colin Smith, described the situation to the Guardian as a structural problem in the music business rather than something skating can easily solve on its own.\n\n“It’s a complex issue, frankly, because the music industry has no common clearance platform,” Smith said. “There are multiple buckets of rights, and within those buckets the clearance process isn’t done on a single platform. Tracking tools have improved, but the facilitated process just isn’t there.”\n\nSmith, who previously oversaw Fifa World Cup tournament operations as chief tournaments and events officer and chief operating officer from 2015 to 2023, said he had held direct discussions with major rights-holders about building something more workable, arguing that the sport’s global profile should make cooperation attractive.\n\n“I’ve had direct conversations with one of the big publishing and music companies, and they fully agree it’s a strange situation that there isn’t a facilitated process – and they’re determined to help us find one,” he said. “What we hear time and time again is that figure skating is so special, and they actually want the music heard with figure skating. So the fact there’s a rights-clearance process in the way needs to be addressed. It’s a topic we’re addressing, and we’re trying to find a rational solution.”\n\nThe controversy also fits into a broader pattern across the sport, where even elite Olympic athletes have found their music choices subject to late-stage legal or financial complications.\n\nThe Canadian ice dancers Marie-Jade Lauriault and Romain Le Gac learned late last year that two Prince songs planned for their 1990s-themed rhythm dance could not be cleared for Olympic use, despite being approved for use during the rest of the season. The pair had secured their Olympic place with a podium finish at Canadian nationals but were forced to rework their program for the Games.\n\nHigh-profile disputes have surfaced even before that. At the Beijing Olympics in 2022, the American pairs champions Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier were hit with a copyright lawsuit tied to their use of a cover version of House of the Rising Sun. The case was later settled privately for an undisclosed sum understood by the Guardian to be around $1.4m (£1.02m), but the episode highlighted the legal and financial risks tied to music selection at the sport’s highest level. Knierim later described the dispute as casting a “bittersweet” shadow over the performance.\n\nThe case also exposed how little many athletes understood about music licensing requirements. For decades, skaters largely relied on federations and event organizers to manage music use, but the lawsuit underscored how individual athletes could still be drawn into copyright disputes. Rights complications have also affected how artistic sports are broadcast and archived, with some competitions unavailable on replay platforms because music licenses do not extend to long-term streaming.\n\nEven outside Olympic seasons, clearance costs can derail programs. The Canadian pairs skaters Deanna Stellato-Dudek and Maxime Deschamps said they abandoned plans to use a cover of a Phil Collins track after being quoted a licensing fee in the tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nTaken together, the cases reflect how music rights – once a secondary consideration in figure skating – have become a logistical and financial challenge athletes must navigate alongside training and competition.\n\nSmith said skating is not alone in facing those pressures, and suggested a broader, cross-sport approach may be necessary, involving Olympic organizers and other music-driven judged disciplines.\n\n“Absolutely, it’s not just figure skating,” he said when asked whether the ISU could coordinate with sports such as gymnastics, artistic swimming and others that face similar issues. “We are one of the largest in terms of the Winter Olympics, and we are working with the IOC as well, together with the music industry, to find a solution.”\n\nSmith added that the ISU was pursuing what he called a “multi-pronged approach”, including work with an existing platform that handles rights issues across other sports.\n\n“We’re really trying to find a rational, practical solution,” he said.\n\nGuarino Sabaté said he followed required procedures, including submitting his music through the ClicknClear licensing system during the summer. The company has said generally that Olympic participants must secure all necessary authorizations before using music in competition, but it does not comment on individual cases.\n\nThe ISU confirmed it is monitoring Guarino Sabaté’s situation but declined to provide details about the specific dispute.\n\n“The ISU is aware of this situation,” the governing body said on Monday in a statement to the Guardian. “As soon as we have more details on this specific case, we will share them as appropriate. Copyright clearances can represent a challenge for all artistic sports. While the ISU does not have a contractual relationship with ClicknClear, we continue to work collaboratively with rights clearance stakeholders to ensure that thrilling performances can be accompanied by stirring music.”\n\nThe timing leaves Guarino Sabaté with limited options. Skaters typically spend months building choreography that matches specific musical phrasing and emotional beats. Switching music days before competition often means simplifying elements, adjusting step sequences or reverting to older programs.\n\nOne potential fallback could involve returning to music he used in previous seasons, though even that carries complications if similar artists or tracks are already tied to other programs or require new clearance.\n\nThe men’s singles event is scheduled to begin on 10 February at the Milano Ice Skating Arena, leaving little time for rehearsal under competition conditions.\n\nDespite the setback, Guarino Sabaté said he intends to compete regardless of the final music choice, thanking fans for supporting the program throughout the season.\n\n“I promise to step on the ice with everything I have and deliver programs that both you and I can be proud of,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Following an electric 2025 season that saw him hoist both the national championship and the Heisman trophy as an Indiana Hoosier, Fernando Mendoza now finds himself as the runaway favorite to be the first overall pick of the 2026 NFL Draft. That means that professional scouts and coaching staff alike will now be assessing not just his athleticism, but his attention to detail, pattern recognition, general recall, and the overall state of his mental capacities.\n\nThere’s a lot that goes into studying and understanding an NFL playbook, but according to one of Mendoza’s former classmates, the Las Vegas Raiders are going to love what they see in Mendoza when they finally get to interview him and quiz him.\n\nA former UC Berkeley student, claiming to have shared a contracts law class with the future first-overall draft pick during his time at the university, suggested that the professor of their class was notorious for giving student athletes, specifically football players, a hard time. “If you are a football player at Cal, there is, unfortunately, a stereotype,” she noted.\n\n“The professor would ask a law question and then ask one of the football players like, ‘Why is this, this?’ or ‘Why is this that?’ Fernando always knew his shit. Like, he would shut up the professor because he would be so impressed that he knew what was going on, and mind you, this is a law class at Berkeley.”\n\nSuffice to say, Mendoza’s competitiveness extends well beyond the football field, and he wasn’t going to be shown up by some uppity law professor from the West Coast. Although the fan did also suggest that the instructor’s confrontations with student athletes were never hostile and predominantly friendly.\n\n“The professor would always tease football players and most of the football players would tease him back, and it would just be some kind of banter.” she recalled. Nevertheless, that kind of attention to detail and willingness to understand the finer points of any subject is exactly what head coaches and coordinators will be looking for in Mendoza’s upcoming interviews.\n\nThrow in the fact that the 22-year-old has one of the most positive attitudes of any prospect in recent memory, and it’s safe to say that this will be a slam dunk for the Raiders on night one of this year’s draft. “Even though he was being teased by the professor, he would just be smiling. He would answer whenever he was asked. He was such a genuine, humble guy.”\n\nMuch has been made of Mendoza’s squeaky clean image, but as more personal testimonies, like this one, begin to come to the forefront, it becomes readily apparent that he is in fact as nice as everyone says he is, and that will certainly go long way in securing him a lengthy career in the National Football League.\n\nThe post “Fernando Mendoza Used to Regularly Stump His Own Law Professor”: Berkeley Law Student Puts Insane Allegations Against Heisman Winner appeared first on The SportsRush.",

The league announced on Monday that there will be regular-season games in Mexico City in the newly named Estadio Banorte (previously Estadio Azteca) for the next three seasons. The game in 2026 will be in December.\n\nAs the Cardinals have played twice in Mexico, and NFC teams have nine home games in 2026, it will be something to watch. They perhaps will end up either as the designated home team, as they have been in both previous trips there, or the road team.\n\nThe announcement gives the league nine international games in 2026.\n\nOne game in Melbourne, Australia, and the LA Rams will be one of the teams\n\nOne game in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nOne game in Mexico City, Mexico\n\nOne game in Paris, France, with the New Orleans Saints as one of the participating teams\n\nThe Cardinals could viably play in Melbourne or Paris, as they will face the Rams and Saints in 2026, both on the road.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts revealed his plans for the rest of his career as a defender following a successful move from right field to the infield.\n\nDuring DodgerFest, Betts revealed to Dodgers Nation’s very own Doug McKain that he wants to finish his career at shortstop.\n\nMookie Betts just told me that his goal is to play shortstop for the Dodgers for the rest of his career. Most players move of shortstop at the age that Mookie started playing shortstop. It's one of the most incredible developments in baseball the last couple season.\n\n— Doug McKain (@DMAC_LA) January 31, 2026\n\nBetts spent most of his career in right field, becoming a Gold Glove winner at the position and regarded as one of the best defenders in the game.\n\nHis speed allows him to cover a good amount of ground, and his glove and fundamentals are sound overall. However, in 2024, Betts was forced to cover in the infield, moving to second base and moonlighting as a shortstop.\n\nBetts did not play up to his usual defensive standard despite having a good arm and experience fielding ground balls, leading him to move back to the outfield for the close of the season once others got healthy.\n\nEver the player looking for a new challenge, the former Red Sox player spent the 2024 offseason working on his fielding to play shortstop full-time.\n\nHe delivered a standout performance in 2025, becoming a Gold Glove finalist, cutting down on his mistakes, and making highlight plays, especially during the postseason.\n\nThe biggest barrier preventing older players from playing shortstop is the loss of athleticism that comes with age.\n\nIt is rare to see a player in their mid-to-late 30s still playing shortstop, though Betts wants to buck the trend.\n\nHe seems to do a good job of maintaining his body and retaining his athleticism, though Father Time remains undefeated, and he could suffer an injury or a natural decline that limits his range to get ground balls.\n\nRealistically, if he wants to stay in the infield, Betts could end up moving over to second base, where he also played.\n\nEven if he does not stay at shortstop for the rest of his career, Betts has already achieved a special feat, moving to shortstop in his 30s and thriving.\n\n“To go out there and play Gold Glove right field for years,” manager Dave Roberts said back in October. “And to be in the Gold Glove conversation this year, rightfully so, to playing the biggest of games, biggest of stages — it’s just never been done. It takes a special brain and talent to do it.”",

    "description": "Righty pitcher is low-key the key piece of the Jordan Hicks trade",
    "fullText": "Rejoice! It’s February! That means baseball will be back before the month is over, and I’ll finally write about something besides “Hey, look at this young arm!”\n\nUnfortunately, Spring Training is still weeks away. Respite still eludes you, South Side Sox stan.  The Pale Hose have another arm you haven’t heard of, Daniel Sandlin, and I’m going to tell you all about him. (At least he’ll stick around for longer than Ryan Rolison.\n\nThe trade represents a lateral move for Sandlin’s organization ranking: FanGraphs has Sandlin as the ninth best prospect in the White Sox system, which was just about the consensus for him with the Red Sox. His big-ticket trait is velocity: at 6’4’’ and 215 pounds, Sandlin was topping out at 99.9 mph in September. The steady velocity – he sits around 96mph – has kept the door open for Sandlin to start in the majors, despite being transitioned into the bullpen at Triple A this past season. In the video below, a June 21 Double-A start, you can see how easily Sandlin can overpower an opposing lineup when he’s locating his fastball at the top of the zone:\n\nFanGraphs also has good things to say about Sandlin’s cutter and slider, calling both pitches “nasty and fairly distinct from one another.” A sinker/sweeper combo rounds out his standard five-pitch mix, although he has a curveball he’ll mix in on occasion. Sandlin also threw a changeup last year. No, literally. He threw one changeup:\n\nHowever, I’d wager the remainder of Luis Robert Jr.‘s contract that Sandlin is going to be throwing a lot more changeups … what’s that? Apologies, dear reader, but I’m now being told all that money actually has been spent? No kidding? Huh. Well then, I guess I’d wager the remainder of Andrew Benintendi’s contract? Regardless, if Sandlin’s going to win a spot in the White Sox rotation, he’ll need to get comfortable with a changeup, and quick.\n\nAt this point in time, Sandlin’s has a two-part plan for approaching lefthanders. The first part is to throw the ball, and the second part is to pray:\n\n2025 Splits (Combined Double-A and Triple-A)\nvs. Righties: .225 BA, .343 SLG, .649 OPS, .289 BABIP\nvs. Lefties: .285 BA, .430 SLG, .772 OPS, .358 BABIP\n\nBack to FanGraphs, who came through in the clutch with an updated 2026 report today: “[Sandlin] still doesn’t have a great offspeed pitch with which to attack lefties … [he] peppers the top of the zone with cutters and sliders before elevating his fastball with two strikes.”\n\nIf you’re throwing your breaking pitches up in the zone to get ahead against opposite-side hitters, it doesn’t take much imagination to picture what could happen if that slider hangs just a little, or that cutter comes out a little flat, or even if he just misses his spot a couple inches low. The French refer to it as “Bang City.”\n\nIf you’ve read a single thing I’ve published on this site before — not a guarantee, I realize! — you already know what I’m going to say, and you’re probably pissed off that you’ve read 500 words just to realize this is yet another article about the kick changeup and how I think it’s a magical pitch that fixes everybody. But I’m not even the first to bring it up this time!\n\n“The White Sox have had recent success coaxing better changeups out of pitchers with naturally-good breaking balls,” FanGraphs concludes in their prospect report, “and perhaps they’ll be able to do that with Sandlin.”\n\nAnd I’d say the evidence is there! Sandlin has a very strong supinator profile. His Achilles’ heel, for him and many supinators, is a lack of arm-side options against opposite-handed hitters.\n\nTo flatten out his pitching splits, Sandlin’s going to need something. This is the magic of the kick change: no unfamiliar arm mechanics or discomfort. The platonic ideal of the kick change isn’t just its effectiveness, but how quickly somebody can pick it up and add it to their arsenal. For Sandlin, it is also the difference between a major league starter versus a middle reliever.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAndrew Wiggins has received interest from several organizations this trade season.\n\nThe athletic 6-foot-7 wing has the championship experience and skill set that contending franchises are looking for. The Los Angeles Lakers are a team that could use Wiggins’ services, but a recent trade report suggests a trade may not be in the cards for the Luka Doncic-led organization.\n\n“Elsewhere in the Western Conference, the Lakers are now pressed for time to find a key wing upgrade before the trade deadline, now that Keon Ellis and De'Andre Hunter are off the table,” ClutchPoints’ Brett Siegel wrote Monday. “Where do the Lakers go from here with all of their expiring salaries?”\n\n“Despite continued interest in Andrew Wiggins, the (Miami) Heat don't appear to have interest in anything the Lakers have offered.”\n\nWiggins is among the best options left on the table for the Lakers. The former Golden State Warriors forward can create his own offense, play well off the ball, and knock down triples at an above-average rate. The Kansas product is averaging 15.6 points, 2.9 assists, and 4.9 rebounds per game with the Heat this season, shooting 46.8% from the field and 38.4% from three-point land.\n\nUnfortunately, Siegel’s report indicates that the Lakers haven’t done their part to convince the Heat to partner with them this season, making it doubtful they land Wiggins by Thursday.\n\nMore NBA: Lakers predicted to acquire $73.8 million six-time All-Star in Dalton Knecht-centered trade",

    "description": "The Red Sox made a creative trade and watched Eugenio Suárez sign an affordable deal with Cincinnati on Sunday. What does it all mean?",
    "fullText": "A very slow 10-day period for the Red Sox ended Sunday with a trade — Boston sent Jordan Hicks and David Sandlin to the White Sox in a salary dump that netted pitching prospect Gage Ziehl — and the news that Eugenio Suárez, perhaps the best position player left on the free agent market and a potential Red Sox fit, had signed a one-year, $15 million deal with the Reds. Here are five quick thoughts on the developments and the Red Sox, who are exactly one week away from spring training opening in Fort Myers next Monday.\n\n1) The Red Sox are working backwards to solve their financial puzzle, and the work likely isn’t done.\n\nWhen the Red Sox signed Ranger Suárez to a five-year, $130 million contract last month, their projected competitive balance tax (CBT) threshold ballooned to a number around $269 million, which is far more than the first threshold number ($244 million) and even exceeded the second threshold at $264 million. It’s clear Boston wants to enter the season short of that second threshold and potentially lower, and there are other pathways to (smartly) shedding money.\n\nMoving Masataka Yoshida (and his $18 million CBT) hit would likely require the Red Sox to take on a good portion of his deal while attaching a prospect like they did with Sandlin and Hicks. A much easier path, however, would involve moving Patrick Sandoval, who will certainly draw interest from clubs if healthy. Sandoval is a bit of an unknown after missing all of 2025 as he rehabbed from Tommy John surgery but will enter camp on the outside looking in when it comes to the rotation competition. A couple of strong spring starts could force a pitching-needy club to offer a prospect while taking on Sandoval’s entire salary, which comes with a $9.125 million CBT hit in 2026. The Red Sox have 6-7 starters ahead of Sandoval and would likely be willing to move him.\n\nMoving an outfielder like Jarren Duran or Ceddanne Rafaela in a bigger trade is another, albeit much less likely, way the Red Sox could move some money around. A Sandoval trade would get the club in the range of $252 million, making further additions (either in spring training or at the trade deadline) more palatable.\n\n2) The trade unclogged the roster pipes, too.\n\nThe main objective of the trade with Chicago was obviously salary-related, as clearing $8 million of Hicks’ money (and getting relief against the CBT) threshold was smart business. But a secondary objective was also accomplished by Breslow, who cleared two 40-man roster spots with the move.\n\nThe Red Sox have strengthened the back end of their roster in recent months, leading to far fewer easy calls when it comes to who gets cut loose when a spot is needed. That Payton Tolle and Connelly Early’s big league debuts came a season earlier than expected locked up two spots that would have otherwise been open all winter. It was telling that Breslow had to trade utility man Tristan Gray, a potential contributor who was acquired in November, to free up a spot when Ranger Suárez’s contract became official on Jan. 21. Further additions would have required further tough calls.\n\nNow, though, the Sox have two open spots and will gain a third early in spring training when Tanner Houck (recovering from Tommy John surgery) can be moved to the 60-day injured list. Moving Hicks also allows an easier path for other promising arms to contribute early in the season. Zack Kelly’s path to a roster spot is now clear and Rule 5 addition Ryan Watson is no longer blocked by Hicks, who is out of minor league options. The Red Sox also have room to make a free agent addition to the bullpen as well.\n\n3) Boston opted for Ziehl over another package that would help the big league bullpen.\n\nAccording to sources, the Red Sox and White Sox had serious discussions about a different-looking trade that would have sent Hicks and Sandlin to Chicago for Jordan Leasure, a 27-year-old reliever who had a 3.92 ERA (and 81 strikeouts) in 64 ⅓ innings in the big leagues last year. The Riverview, Florida product would have fit the Red Sox as a right-handed middle-relief option, joining Kelly, Watson and Greg Weissert as candidates in that role.\n\nThe Red Sox would have had to kick in more of Hicks’ salary to obtain Leasure, who has more value than Ziehl, who has barely pitched above High-A. In the end, the sides opted to do the deal that involved more cash and a lesser player headed to the Red Sox.\n\n4) Craig Breslow wasn’t kidding when he said defense was important.\n\nIn his last meeting with reporters, Breslow was clear that he was prioritizing infield defense when assessing his next move. That bore out with the club’s decision to not meaningfully pursue Eugenio Suárez before he signed with Cincinnati.\n\nIn December, a source noted that the Red Sox had interest in Suárez, but only as a clear fallback option should Alex Bregman and some other targets not land in Boston. As time went on, agents around the industry speculated that Suárez’s market had not developed as expected and that he could be a candidate for a one-year deal. That’s all he got in Cincinnati, signing a $15 million guarantee that every club — including the Red Sox — could have done.\n\nStill, even as other options fell off the board and Suárez’s market collapsed, the Red Sox didn’t meaningfully engage. As MassLive reported Sunday, they never made an offer. It wasn’t about the value or negotiations not lining up. It was simply about the Red Sox not wanting a player who, despite slugging 49 homers last season, strikes out at a high clip and is a defensive liability at third base.\n\nThe Red Sox’ potential trade targets on the infield market are well-known with Houston’s Isaac Paredes and Chicago’s Nico Hoerner and Matt Shaw having been heavily discussed on the rumor mill. But what about Ramón Urías? The longtime Oriole remains unsigned as a defense-first, versatile option who would fit the roster well, even in a limited role.\n\nUrías regressed with the bat last year to the tune of a .675 OPS in 112 games split between Baltimore and Houston but was still a capable defender at both third base (78 games) and second (26 games). He also has historically hit very well at Fenway, logging a .326 average and an .881 OPS in 28 games in Boston. At this point, Urías can likely be had on a reasonable one-year deal. A source said the Red Sox have checked in on his availability but have shown only lukewarm interest to this point in the winter.\n\nThe Red Sox, even with Marcelo Mayer, Romy Gonzalez, David Hamilton and Nick Sogard in the mix as internal options for second base and third base, have begun to explore free agent alternatives, as evidenced by their pursuit of Dylan Moore, who they were “very involved” on before he signed with the Phillies, according to a source. Luis Rengifo is another available infielder.\n\nRed Sox agree to minor league deal with veteran RHP (report)\n\nAnother potential Red Sox trade target lands elsewhere (report)\n\nEx-MLB GM gives Red Sox strong offseason grade, still questions infield\n\nRumored Red Sox target signs one-year deal with Reds — and Boston didn’t make an offer\n\nDavid Sandlin says goodbye to Red Sox after trade to Chicago",

    "fullText": "NFL mock draft season is upon us, and for the first time in several years, the New England Patriots will be picking late in the draft.\n\nIn his latest two-round 2026 NFL mock draft, ESPN’s Matt Miller has the Patriots selecting edge defender Cashius Howell with the 31st overall pick and Indiana wide receiver Elijah Sarratt in the second round with the 63rd overall pick.\n\nBoth would bring instant playmaking ability to the team. Howell was the SEC Defensive Player of the Year after leading the conference with 11.5 sacks. He also recorded 31 tackles, 14 tackles for loss, six pass deflections and one forced fumble.\n\nThe standout defensive star was a unanimous All-American who could develop into a top pass-rushing option for the Patriots.\n\nAs for Sarratt, he would give Patriots quarterback Drake Maye another big-bodied playmaker to target downfield. He finished his collegiate run with 65 catches for 830 yards and 15 touchdowns. He earned Second-Team All-Big Ten honors and served a key role in Indiana's national championship run.\n\nIt's easy to forget that the Patriots are still a rebuilding team after their magical Super Bowl run this season.

    "fullText": "The Red Sox are continuing to see potential infield additions come off the board, and MassLive’s Chris Cotillo has thrown a new name to watch into the mix.\n\n“The Red Sox have checked in throughout the winter on Ramón Urías but haven’t showed more than lukewarm interest,” Cotillo wrote on X on Monday.\n\nUrías was traded from the Baltimore Orioles to the Houston Astros last summer. He is under club control for one more season and can play third base, second base and shortstop. He is a versatile defender and won a Gold Glove in 2022 at third base.\n\nUrías is not the only Houston Astros infielder the Red Sox have been linked to. Isaac Paredes has been a rumored target as well. Urías had just a .675 OPS last season, hitting 11 home runs for the second consecutive season.

    "title": "At Super Bowl Seahawks vice chair answer questions on team’s sale. Local buyers?",
    "description": "The News Tribune asks Seahawks vice chair Bert Kolde after NFL commissioner’s press conference about reports the team will be sold soon.",
    "fullText": "The sale of the Seahawks — the issue the team would rather not have the week of their first Super Bowl appearance in more than decade — isn’t going away.\n\n“We put out our statement. So I can’t say anything beyond that,” Seahawks vice chair Bert Kolde said Monday, after he and his wife sat in the front row representing the NFC champions at commissioner Roger Goodell’s annual state-of-the-NFL press conference at the Super Bowl.\n\nThe statement Kolde referred to Monday at the San Jose Convention Center was the Paul G. Allen Estate’s assertion Friday “the team is not for sale” — with “is” doing a ton of lifting there. The estate’s statement also reiterated the estate that owns the Seahawks dictates the team must be sold. Most of the proceeds will go to Allen’s many philanthropic interests before his death in 2018. The Paul G. Allen Estate issued that statement through a spokesman Friday. That was soon after ESPN and The Wall Street Journal reported the Seahawks would be sold soon after this season ended with Seattle’s Super Bowl.\n\nMoments before Kolde spoke Monday, Goodell said in his press conference a report this past weekend by The Wall Street Journal that the league fined the Seahawks $5 million for continuing to violate NFL rules by having an estate and not an individual person or group of people own a club is not true.\n\nThis much we know: The Seahawks’ sale is going to happen. It’s not a matter of if, not when.\n\nAnd signs are pointing to the when being in the months following the Super Bowl.\n\nKolde said he, chair Jody Allen, other leaders from Vulcan, LLC, the company Paul Allen formed to manage the Seahawks have studied the recent sales of North American sports franchises. That includes the NBA’s Boston Celtics (for $6 billion), the Los Angeles Lakers (a record $10 billion) and the most recent sale of an NFL team. That was the Washington Commanders, for $6.05 billion in 2023.\n\n“We study all teams, all the sales. That’s something we keep abreast of,” the Seahawks’ vice chair said.\n\nThe Allen Estate put the Portland Trail Blazers up on sale in September. Kolde said Monday he expects that sale to be final this spring. It’s about to go to a group led by the owner of the National Hockey League’s Carolina Hurricanes for a reported $4.25 billion.\n\n“Still tracking to close in a couple months,” Kolde said.\n\nWith the Blazers sale closing, it makes sense (and billions of dollars) that the Seahawks are next.\n\nThe Seahawks are most likely going to set an NFL record for a franchise sale, perhaps in excess of $8 billion.\n\nThe News Tribune asked Kolde off the stage following Goodell’s 45-minute press conference Monday if the Seahawks already have local buyers on the horizon to sell to.\n\n“Nothing to add,” Kolde said to that.\n\nIs there is anything in the estate’s instructions for the sale of the Seahawks that assures the franchise remains in Seattle? A stipulation it must be sold to local owners? A contract from whoever buys the team that binds them to keep the Seahawks in the city?\n\nTo that, Kolde referenced the team’s 30-year lease with Lumen Field runs through 2031. He did not comment on the 20-year option the team has with the stadium and the local government district that runs it beyond 2031.\n\n“l’m not going to get into all of that, all of that detail,” Kolde said.\n\n“But the Allen family put a lot into saving the Seahawks, keeping them in Seattle (by Paul Allen buying the team in 1997 from Ken Behring, who tried to move the team to Southern California). We campaigned around the state (for the new stadium that opened in 2002 and replaced the Kingdome). The voters agreed with us. And we put together Lumen Field.\n\n“And we delivered on everything we promised in that campaign. The team. The stadium. Soccer balls were on our posters. The Sounders launched as the most successful MLS team. The World Cup is coming; we talked about World Cup back in that campaign.\n\n“So we’ve been all about sports in the community for decades. So the lease has six years or so...”\n\nLeague owners want the Seahawks to sell sooner than later, so they can learn the latest relative valuations of their teams in this post-COVID world with the league’s new media rights deals that provides $11 billion in annual revenue to the NFL. The league signed that a couple years ago.\n\nAsked if the NFL was pressuring the team to sell soon, Kolde said: “No comment on that.”\n\nKolde said Jody Allen will be at Super Bowl 60 Sunday against the New England Patriots at Levi’s Stadium in nearby Santa Clara.",

That’s one of the reasons we chose him,” Goodell said.\n\n“But the other reason is he understood the platform he was on, and that this platform is used to unite people and to be able to bring people together with their creativity, with their talent, and to be able to use this moment to do that. I think artists in the past have done that, I think Bad Bunny understands that, and I think he’ll have a great performance.”\n\nRoger Goodell is asked whether or not there will be any ICE enforcement operations at the Super Bowl and also addresses Bad Bunny's remarks about ICE at last night's Grammy Awards. pic.twitter.com/FxGcbiIbZP\n\n— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) February 2, 2026\n\nBad Bunny was the top global artist on Spotify for the fourth time in his career last year, and he won two Grammy awards on Sunday night, including Album of the Year, for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos.”\n\nQuickly after Bad Bunny was announced as the Super Bowl halftime show, plenty in President Donald Trump’s administration criticized the decision. Trump said he had “never heard of him,” and Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Mike Johnson (R-La.) called it a “terrible decision” in October. Johnson, however, then suggested that 83-year-old Lee Greenwood, famous for “God Bless the USA” do the show instead.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would be “all over” the Super Bowl.\n\n“They suck, and we’ll win,” Noem told right-wing podcast host Benny Johnson about her message to the NFL, via ESPN. “They won’t be able to sleep at night because they don’t know what they believe. And they’re so weak, we’ll fix it.”\n\nBad Bunny has been extremely outspoken about Trump and ICE. He mocked Trump in his “NEVAYoL” music video, where he had a Trump-like voice apologizing to immigrants, and he even declined to hold any concerts on his current world tour in the United States because “f***ing ICE could be outside [the concert].” He called out ICE after winning a Grammy award during an acceptance speech on Sunday night, too.\n\n“Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ICE out,” he said. “We’re not savages, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens, we are humans and we are Americans ... The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that’s more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.”\n\nBad Bunny says \"ICE OUT\" at the #Grammys and receives a massive standing ovation:\n\n\"We are not savage, we are not animals, we are not aliens, we are humans and we are Americans. The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love.… pic.twitter.com/IFzvguqdCR\n\n— Variety (@Variety) February 2, 2026\n\nBad Bunny is Puerto Rican, which makes him an American citizen.\n\nThe Bay Area Host Committee told local officials on Monday that there are no planned ICE operations for Super Bowl LX, according to The Athletic. Goodell was asked about that directly on Monday, but he sidestepped the ICE of it all. Security preparations, he said, are moving forward as normal.\n\n“Security is obviously one of the things we focus on the most,” Goodell said. “It’s a tier one level event that involves unique assets at the federal level, the state level and the local level all working together. I see no change in that in the preparations for the Super Bowl … The federal government is a big part of that, including this administration and every other administration before that.”",

    "description": "A low-key transfer deadline day ended with the fewest Premier League deals completed in a winter window. BBC Sport looks at the spending that was done, and examines why there was so little activity.",
    "fullText": "The Premier League had its quietest ever winter transfer deadline day as just seven deals were completed on Monday.\n\nNot a single arrival was confirmed until 19:04 GMT - four minutes after the window in the English top flight closed - with Crystal Palace announcing the signing of striker Jorgen Strand Larsen from Wolves in a deal worth up to £48m.\n\nClubs can make signings for up to two hours after the official deadline, as long as a deal sheet is submitted before 19:00 to provide extra time for the necessary paperwork to be completed.\n\nThere were five further deals confirmed after the deadline - among them, Sunderland brought in Ecuador winger Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht in a deal worth £17.5m, while Wolves signed midfielder Angel Gomes from Marseille on loan and replaced Strand Larsen with Adam Armstrong from Wolves for £7m.\n\nThat took the overall spending in the Premier League during the winter window to more than £390m.\n\nLiverpool did agree a deal on deadline day to sign defender Jeremy Jacquet from Rennes, but that move - and the payment of the £60m fee - won't happen until the summer.\n\nAll the done deals on deadline day in one place\n\nTwo club-record signings - but are Palace papering over the cracks?\n\nThe day's two big talking points involved Crystal Palace - Strand Larsen's arrival from Wolves and the calling off of fellow striker Jean-Philippe Mateta's move to AC Milan because of issues with his medical.\n\nOtherwise, it was a day largely devoid of transfer drama as none of the top-six clubs did any business.\n\nOne of the more interesting moves was a Premier League exit, as former England midfielder Kalvin Phillips moved from Manchester City to Championship side Sheffield United on loan for the rest of the season.\n\nThat move comes four years after City signed Phillips from Leeds in a deal worth £45m.\n\nOther deals confirmed late on included Nottingham Forest's signing of Borussia Monchengladbach defender Luca Netz, Chelsea winger Tyrique George's move on loan to Everton for the rest of the season, while Tottenham and Arsenal both announced an academy signing.\n\nA record £3.1bn was spent by Premier League clubs in the summer - significantly more than in the winter window.\n\nThe figure of £397m for this window isn't hugely down on previous winters, with January always more low key than the summer as it is a notoriously difficult time for clubs to recruit effectively.\n\nIt is even harder to do that on deadline day, but this one was particularly quiet, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe big outlay last summer will be one, while another could relate to a new system of Financial Fair Play (FFP) that will come in from next season.\n\nSquad Cost Ratio (SCR) will replace Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), meaning overall squad costs in the Premier League from 2026-27 will have to be limited to 85% of a club's revenue.\n\n\"There's always going to be a degree of anxiety as to keeping your financial house in order ahead of a far more active market [the summer window],\" Paul Macdonald of FootballTransfers.com said.\n\n\"Clubs wanted to ensure they were in a compliant position rather than having an additional headache of being hamstrung under the new rules.\"\n\nManchester City made the biggest moves in this window as they looked to give themselves the best chance of challenging Arsenal for the Premier League title.\n\nThey signed forward Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth for £64m on 9 January, while defender Marc Guehi joined from Crystal Palace for £20m on 16 January.\n\n\"The scenario now is Manchester City are chasing down Arsenal and the points gap is getting a little bit bigger, so you need those players who are ready to go and know what the intensity of this Premier League is like,\" former England and Manchester City defender Steph Houghton told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\n\"It's been a smart move from the club in terms of getting Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo. They've slotted in really well, which is testament to them.\"\n\nCrystal Palace's deadline day move for Strand Larsen meant they spent £83m in the winter window, having signed Brennan Johnson for £35m from Tottenham.\n\nAston Villa - who are third - were the only other top-six side to pay out transfer fees during the winter window. They spent £18.25m on bringing back striker Tammy Abraham from Besiktas and £10.5m on winger Alysson from Gremio.\n\nPremier League leaders Arsenal did no business during the winter window, with Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool - fourth, fifth and sixth respectively - also quiet.\n\nWhile Manchester City spent money to bolster their squad for a title fight, at the other end of the table West Ham splashed out in a bid to avoid relegation to the Championship.\n\nThe Hammers, who are third from bottom and six points adrift of safety, spent a reported £21.8m on Brazilian striker Pablo Felipe from Portuguese club Gil Vicente and around £25m on striker Taty Castellanos from Lazio.\n\nTottenham, who are 14th, spent £35m on signing midfielder Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid, while Bournemouth used some of their money from the Semenyo sale to sign teenage striker Rayan from Vasco da Gama for £24.7m and Hungary midfielder Alex Toth for £10.4m from Ferencvaros.\n\nDespite a quiet deadline day, Premier League clubs still spent more overall in the winter window than sides in other major European leagues.\n\nThe next-biggest spending league was Serie A, with their clubs paying out a combined £205m in transfer fees.\n\nSassuolo were one of the most active Italian clubs, paying £22m for Marseille duo Ismael Kone and Darryl Bakola.\n\nIn Spain, the transfer window closed at 22:59 GMT, but La Liga business was quiet, with Atletico Madrid's £30m deal for Ademola Lookman more than was spent be the rest of the division's clubs combined (£20.3m).\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "It’s Colorado Avalanche gameday!",
    "fullText": "The Colorado Avalanche and Detroit Red Wings are set to meet for the second time in just three days, this time at Ball Arena in downtown Denver, CO. This quick turnaround and second game of a home-and-home should make for some unsettled tension after the first installment featured extracurriculars and a stellar performance from MacKenzie Blackwood, who logged the shutout. Will the Avalanche beat their old rival yet again? Or will the Wings steal one at a mile high?\n\nThe Opponent: Detroit Red Wings (24-21-7)\n\nWatch: Altitude, Altitude+, ESPN+\n\nListen: Altitude Sports Radio, 92.5 FM\n\nThe Avalanche is an interesting group right now with a litany of injuries and what feels like waning interest at times, all resulting in the first real dip in success.\n\nThey looked plenty interested last time out, and leading the way in that regard was Nathan MacKinnon, who is undoubtedly getting all tuned up and ready for his appearance at this year’s Winter Olympics in Milan, Italy.\n\nA 5-0 shutout is just about as ideal as a scoreline can be, but make no mistake, even MacKinnon told Erik Johnson on the ABC broadcast that, “It was more competitive than the scoreline showed.”\n\nNate absolutely COOKED EJ 😂 pic.twitter.com/UHl7JZWqkh\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) January 31, 2026\n\nSpeaking of MacKinnon, he is just one assist shy of logging his 700th career apple so keep an eye on that this evening. EJ has clarified that he did not get a spray tan but leaned toward being too tan rather than too pale when giving the makeup artist instructions ahead of the broadcast. I don’t buy it.\n\nArtturi Lehkonen — Nathan MacKinnon — Valeri Nichushkin\nRoss Colton — Brock Nelson — Valeri Nichushkin\nParker Kelly — Jack Drury — Gavin Brindley\nTaylor Makar — Zakhar Bardakov — Joel Kiviranta\n\nSam Malinski — Cale Makar\nJosh Manson — Brent Burns\nKeaton Middleton — Samuel Girard\n\nMacKenzie Blackwood\nScott Wedgewood\n\nThe Wings are a solid club and feel like a playoff team this season, despite not showing much of that in Saturday’s game. Getting to the playoffs would mean ending a nine-year drought in Detroit and would do a lot to validate the work being done by management and coaches alike. Todd MacLellan’s mid-season hire (last year) still looks like a solid move from Steve Yzerman and company.\n\nEtched in history.\n\nPatrick Kane on the mic for point 1375. 🗣️ pic.twitter.com/KON0c2aQUI\n\n— Detroit Red Wings (@DetroitRedWings) January 30, 2026\n\nDetroit’s captain Dylan Larkin called Saturday’s loss a “bump in the road,” and spoke about the Avalanche being beatable and having lots to play for in tonight’s rematch. We shall see how that turns out!\n\nMarco Kasper — Dylan Larkin — Lucas Raymond\nAlex DeBrincat — Andrew Copp — Patrick Kane\nEmmitt Finnie — J.T.

    "description": "We ask Miami Dolphins fans for their biggest concerns surrounding the new staff.",
    "fullText": "Being a Miami Dolphins fan for any period of time comes with the built-in expectation of almost always having concerns about the team, be it the general manager, scouting, coaching, or players. Between the poor execution of their jobs on the field and just stupid, unnecessary scandals off the field, it has often seemed as if there were more periods of just being overall bummed by the team and whatever stupid thing was happening with them than periods we could celebrate. In recent times, we can only point to epic comebacks, a 70-point game against a bad Denver Broncos team, or an individual accomplishment by a single player as things to celebrate. Either way, there is always something to be concerned about, but with each new regime we are at least given a bit of light at the end of the tunnel…maybe…until it’s snatched away again.\n\nSo with that big ole’ pile of joy this evening’s Phinsider Question Of The Day is:\n\nNow that our Miami Dolphins have hired the new GM and nearly filled out the entire coaching staff, what concerns do you still have about either or both? Is it an individual coach that you believe could hold the team back, or is there another concern about the new makeup of the front office or the coaching staff as a whole? Or…maybe you think this is nearly perfect for what we want to see. Please let us know that and why as well.\n\nPlease share your thoughts and answers in the comments section below-",

    "description": "We’re into February, so the battle in the standings is starting to heat up in America’s favorite basketball conference!",
    "fullText": "For a moment, I was looking at this week’s Big East basketball schedules and it was starting to look like maaaybe there weren’t really that many intriguing games on deck. Then I realized that we’re past the halfway point or further even for everyone in the league, and things are Starting To Get Important relative to fighting to avoid playing on the opening night of the conference tournament. As it happens, there’s more than a couple of games that fit the bill of “oh, well, that’s important to the 5th place/6th place cut line right now.”\n\nPlus a ranked on ranked game in the men’s division! That’s actually nationally important!\n\nWednesday, February 4: Seton Hall Pirates at Villanova Wildcats (5:30pm Central, Peacock) — Seton Hall has stemmed the tide of a complete collapse with a massive rally second half against Xavier and fending off a challenge from Marquette. However, the four game losing streak might have broken their NCAA hopes unless they can match it with quality wins, and at The Finn against a Nova team seemingly ticketed for the Dance is exactly that. Kevin Willard’s Wildcats can’t exactly afford to cough up a loss here, not with the Torvik Wins Above Bubble bracket slotting them in as a #8 seed.\n\nWednesday, February 4: Georgetown Hoyas at Creighton Bluejays (6pm Central, ESPN+) — This is one half of an important week for Jim Flanery’s Bluejays as they come off a very good road win over Seton Hall on Sunday. They’re a game behind St. John’s for fifth place (and thus one of the byes in the first round of the Big East tournament) in the league, and a game ahead of the Hoyas team as well. Creating space between themselves and Georgetown is as easy as winning at Sokol right here.\n\nWednesday, February 4: Creighton Bluejays at Georgetown Hoyas (6:30pm Central, Peacock) — The Bluejays needed overtime to down Georgetown at home, and they’re just 1-3 since then, needing a miracle break against Xavier to get the win and getting absolutely run over by both UConn (fine) and Marquette (uh oh) in the losses. There’s not much of a hope for the NCAA tournament in Omaha any more, but a loss here would probably finish them off…. and if that’s the case…. are we seeing the beginning of the end for Greg McDermott as head coach at Creighton?\n\nFriday, February 6: Connecticut Huskies at St. John’s Red Storm (7pm Central, Fox) — This will be the first of two meetings this season between the two teams that were considered to be the top two teams in the conference heading into the year. To this point, they’ve separated themselves atop the standings at 11-0 and 9-1, and with the Johnnies holding the loss, the onus is on them to win at home here to create a race for the regular season title down the stretch.\n\nSaturday, February 7: Butler Bulldogs at #1 Connecticut Huskies (11am Central, FS1) — Presuming that Sarah Strong’s squad gets through a road game against last place DePaul just fine on Wednesday, UConn could be playing to clinch a spot in the top five of the league in this game and thus avoid the opening day tripleheader of the conference tournament. That would be with six games left in the conference slate for the Huskies, and I say “could” because it’s possible that they get help on Wednesday from Georgetown to clinch it anyway.\n\nSaturday, February 7: Butler Bulldogs at Marquette Golden Eagles (1pm Central, FS1) — Butler followed up their home win over Marquette by getting trampled at The Garden by St. John’s and then getting shunted into the Negative Zone by Georgetown. Five points in the final 6+ minutes after cutting a margin to four! At home! How much will the National Marquette Day crowd gas up the Golden Eagles at Fiserv Forum here?\n\nSaturday, February 7: Seton Hall Pirates at St. John’s Red Storm (1pm Central, ESPN+) — This is the only game of the week for Savannah Catalon’s Pirates and they come in having lost two of the last three. One was to UConn, but the other was to Creighton at home. St. John’s is trying to stay in the top five of the Big East standings (and thus out of the conference tournament opening tripleheader) with just a one game lead over Creighton right now, so they can make a lot of noise with a win here. Oh, and Seton Hall’s next game, as they try to maintain a hold on third place in the league? Marquette, the team they are currently tied with in the standings.\n\nSaturday, February 7: DePaul Blue Demons at Providence Friars (3pm Central, FS1) — The Friars have lost six of seven and host Butler and DePaul this week. Think of this one as the second half of the Kim English Keep Your Job Challenge. Difficulty Level: Hard.\n\nSaturday, February 7: Seton Hall Pirates at Creighton Bluejays (5pm Central, Peacock) — All the stuff I said earlier about Budd Clark’s Pirates and Josh Dix’s Bluejays? Goes double here, especially with it being the second of two road games this week for the Pirates.\n\nSunday, February 8: Marquette Golden Eagles at Creighton Bluejays (12pm Central, FS1) — Here’s the other half of an important week for Creighton, as they get Cara Consuegra’s inconsistent (but tied for third!) Golden Eagles in Omaha. If the Jays want to make a play to get one of those five first round byes in the conference tournament, they could do a lot worse than closing the current three-game gap with MU right here. Meanwhile, Halle Vice and Marquette still haven’t found a way to start playing clean basketball for 40 straight minutes, and they have to get through a home game against Providence before making this trip to somewhere in middle America.\n\nHere’s the full Big East men’s basketball schedule for the week, with all times Central, as always.\n\n#3 Connecticut at #22 St. John’s\n\nHere’s the full Big East women’s basketball schedule for the week, with all times Central, as always.\n\nFollow Anonymous Eagle on social media\n\nFacebook: AnonymousEagle\nInstagram: AnonymousEagleSBN\nBluesky: AnonymousEagle",

    "fullText": "The Brooklyn Nets have 52 jersey numbers worn by over 600 different players over the course of their history since the franchise was founded in 1967 as a charter member of the American Basketball Association (ABA), when the team was known as the \"New Jersey Americans\".\n\nSince then, that league has been absorbed by the NBA with the team that would later become the New York Nets and New Jersey Nets before settling on the name by which they are known today, bringing their rich player and jersey history with them to the league of today.\n\nTo commemorate the players who played for the Nets over the decades wearing those 52 different jersey numbers, Nets Wire is covering the entire history of the franchise's jersey numbers and the players who sported them since the founding of the team.\n\nAnd for today's article, we will continue with the eighth of nine people to wear the No. 41 jersey, big man alum Thomas Robinson. After ending his college career at Kansas, Robinson was picked up with the fifth overall selection of the 2012 NBA Draft by the Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe Thomas Robinson native played the first 51 games of his pro career with Sacramento. He would also play for the Houston Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers, and Philadelphia 76ers before he signed with Brooklyn in 2015. His stay with the team lasted until he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2016.\n\nDuring his time suiting up for the Nets, Robinson wore only jersey No. 41 and put up 4.3 points and 5.1 rebounds per game.\n\nAll stats and data courtesy of Basketball Reference.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nets Wire: Nets jersey history No. 41 - Thomas Robinson (2015-16)",

    "fullText": "Barcelona forward Raphinha has offered fans a little injury update after being ruled out of Tuesday’s Copa del Rey quarter-final tie with Albacete.\n\nRaphinha has been diagnosed with an overload and is expected to be sidelined for a week. Hansi Flick has spoken of his frustration at losing Raphinha again, but the Brazilian says he’ll be back soon for Barca.\n\n“I’m fine. I’m a little tired, but I’m okay. In theory, it will be a short time, and I’ll try to recover as quickly as possible. I’ve always tried to give my best,” he told Mundo Deportivo.\n\nRaphinha is also expected to sit out the weekend’s La Liga game against Real Mallorca in what will be a further blow to Flick.\n\nThe Brazilian has suffered a few injury problems this season but has still been in great form, scoring 13 goals and bagging five assists in 22 outings in all competitions.",

    "fullText": "NBA trade deadline tracker: Latest news, rumors for Giannis Antetokounmpo and more in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nList of NBA trades completes at deadline\n\nNBA trade deadline deals by team\n\nWhen is the NBA trade deadline in 2026?\n\nThe NBA trade deadline is undoubtedly among the most engaging moments within the entire sports calendar.\n\nThe Thursday 3 p.m. ET cutoff for trade agreements is expected to spur considerable activity as it approaches.\n\nTeams are required to finalize their rosters by this deadline before the final phase of the regular season. This year's deadline is particularly intense, with numerous high-profile players rumored to be on the trading block.\n\nAs the activity intensifies, The Sporting News will monitor rumors, news, and reported transactions leading up to the deadline. Due to the nature of these deals, some may be announced following the deadline.\n\nContinue to follow this coverage to remain informed of all developments.\n\nFischer adds that the two sides seem resigned to a separation after eight years together, although that is more likely to come in the offseason when James hits free agency.\n\n\"The most aggressive team in the West right now is the Minnesota Timberwolves,\" said Brian Windhorst. \"They are in the game for Giannis, and the Timberwolves are being aggressive. If they don't make what I would call a Hail Mary Giannis deal, I think they are aggressively looking to upgrade their backcourt.\"\n\nShams Charania also appeared on ESPN and shared the same reports that Minnesota is indeed one of the most aggressive teams in the NBA when it comes to acquiring Antetokounmpo.\n\nJackson reported that the Miami Heat are expected to offer an extensive trade package for Antetokounmpo. The offer is anticipated to be Tyler Herro, Kel'el Ware, Terry Rozier, young players, 2 1st-round picks and 3 pick swaps, per Jackson. If the Bucks do happen to acquire Rozier, they will have to pay his entire 25-26 salary.\n\nA day after The Athletic reported that the Knicks are inquiring about Antetokounmpo, ESPN's Brian Windhorst said on \"Get Up\" Monday morning that, \"The Knicks believe in this team.. They believed in this team last summer when Giannis was loosely available in those discussions. They didn't make an aggressive offer at the time of those talks. If they want to win a bidding war now, i think its going to take a 3 or 4 team trade.... That is just not happening. They are not showing that aggression to get Giannis right now and I think thats because they like this team.\"\n\nWhile other teams have been mentioned far more often, the Trail Blazers are among the franchises interested in Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, The Oregonian reports. The report adds that new owner Tom Dundon is ready and willing to take big swings to win, which makes Portland a wild card in the Antetokounmpo sweepstakes even if a deal might cost All-Star Deni Avdija.\n\nThe Kings still have salary cap concerns despite an abysmal 12-39 record, and ESPN reports that has prompted Sacramento explore trades involving Zach LaVine, Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, and Malik Monk. The Kings acquired De’Andre Hunter from the Cavaliers on Saturday.\n\nThe Knicks are one of the teams inquiring about Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, The Athletic reports, but the Knicks’ inability to fully match what Milwaukee is demanding — premier young players and high draft picks — is a hurdle.\n\nKnicks big man Karl-Anthony Towns is still a trade candidate despite New York’s recent resurgence, The Athletic reports. Towns hasn’t been extended and reportedly has had some hard feelings ever since his name surfaced in Giannis Antetokounmpo trade talks in the offseason.\n\nThe Knicks have “long been trying to find a new home” for forward Guerschon Yabusele, who has struggled since signing in the offseason. Yabusele could need draft assets attached to him to be dealt, The Athletic reports.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks are trading guard Vit Krejci to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Duop Reath and two future second-round selections. The move gives the Hawks the ability to free up roster space, and Atlanta now possesses seven upcoming second-round picks.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers are trading De'Andre Hunter to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Dennis Schroder and Keon Ellis. This transaction involves three teams: the Chicago Bulls acquire Kings forward Dario Saric and two future second-round draft picks. Additionally, the Bulls are waiving guard Jevon Carter to make room for Saric, according to sources. They also acted as a third team and acquired assets to complete the trade.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks are trading four-time NBA All-Star Trae Young to the Washington Wizards in exchange for CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert. The Hawks kick off the trade deadline season with a bang.\n\nCJ McCollum (G) - traded from Wizards\n\nCorey Kispert (F) - traded from Wizards\n\nDuop Reath (C) - traded from Trail Blazers\n\nDario Saric (F) - traded from Kings\n\nDennis Schroder (G) -  traded from Kings\n\nKeon Ellis (G) -  traded from Kings\n\nVit Krejci (G) - traded from Hawks\n\nDe'Andre Hunter (F) - traded from Cavs\n\nTrae Young (G) - traded from Hawks\n\nThe 2026 NBA trade deadline is at 3 p.m. ET on Thursday, Feb. 5.\n\nIt is important to note that the deadline is 3 p.m. ET and whatever corresponding time that is for teams in other time zones. All trades must be agreed upon and submitted to the NBA office by 3 p.m. ET.\n\nMORE: Relive the Lakers' two legendary trades deadline moves",

    "fullText": "The 2026 college football recruiting cycle will officially end Wednesday, but the 2027 crop is already off to a roaring start with a half-dozen five-star recruits already committed.\n\nThe latest, No. 1 running back Kemon Spell, chose Georgia over Penn State, Notre Dame and dozens of other offers on Monday. The former Nittany Lions commit is pledge No. 6 in this cycle for Kirby Smart and Co. and gives the Bulldogs a huge piece to build around — both on the trail and on the field in upcoming years.\n\nWith Spell now committed, six of the nation’s five-star prospects are already off the board in the 2027 cycle. All six are top-15 prospects nationally, with three ranking as the top player at their positions.\n\nBelow is a look at the six committed five-stars in the 2027 cycle, as of Feb. 2:\n\nSchool: McKeesport (McKeesport, PA)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 3 NATL. (No. 1 RB)\n\nScouting Summary: All-encompassing running back that can win with power and elusiveness on inside and outside runs. 5-foot-9, 200-plus pounds with tremendous twitch and leg drive. Plays with low pad level and an excellent center of gravity in order to deliver blows and take them himself. Has breakaway speed in order to hit the homerun. Ran sub-11 in the 100m during his sophomore track season. Shows the ability to catch the ball away from his frame as a pass catcher. Has all the physical and athletic tools to make an immediate impact at the next level and beyond. Younger prospect for the cycle.”\n\nSchool: Cedar Hill (Texas)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 6 NATL. (No. 1 DL)\n\nScouting Summary: “Uber-athletic defensive line prospect with true game-wrecking ability. Measured in at around 6-foot-3, 300 pounds prior to his junior season. Tests as an elite athlete in the combine setting, easily cracking 5.0 seconds in the 40-yard dash. Carries that athleticism over to the field where he has flashes of dominance on Friday nights. Lines up all over the defensive line for Cedar Hill (Texas) while facing top competition. Dangerous pass rusher from any spot. Combines explosive get-off with the movement skills of a much smaller player, carrying elite testing numbers directly onto the field. Consistently collapses pockets and disrupts plays before they develop.\n\n…Has legitimate game-wrecking moments on film. The quickness to dart into the backfield and the speed to hunt down ball carriers is eye-popping. May not possess premier length. Father was a third-round pick by the Dallas Cowboys. Tracking as the top defensive line prospect early on in the 2027 cycle with the upside to be an early NFL Draft pick.”\n\nSchool: Brother Martin (La.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 7 NATL. (No. 1 WR)\n\nScouting Summary: “The most dynamic pass-catcher early in the 2027 cycle and a threat to score every time he touches the ball. Measured at around 5-foot-11, 185 pounds prior to his junior season. One of the fastest top prospects in the cycle, running a scintillating 10.3-second mark in the 100 meters as a sophomore. Brings that elite speed to the gridiron—lethal on vertical routes, easily pulling away from defensive backs downfield. Tough to tackle in the open field and will take it the distance if he finds space at the second level. Shows natural shiftiness as a route-runner, giving him the ability to separate at every level. Among the more productive top wide receivers in the 2027 cycle as a junior.\n\n…Can continue improving his ability to attack catches with his arms extended, but has shown an expanded catch radius with several highlight-reel grabs. One of the youngest top prospects in the class with a late July birthday prior to his freshman season of college football. Athleticism, budding polish, and big-play ability make him one of the top overall playmakers in the cycle with the potential to develop into a first-round NFL Draft pick.”\n\nSchool: Blessed Trinity Catholic (Ga.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 10 NATL. (No. 2 EDGE)\n\nAbout: Jacobs has long been one of the most feared pass-rushers in Georgia. The UGA legacy tallied 102 total tackles in 11 games this fall and is now near 300 for his prep career. He piled up 16 sacks as a junior for BTC and has established himself as one of the premier defensive prospects in the nation, regardless of class. He chose Ohio State over Texas A&M and Miami. Jacobs is the top-ranked junior in the Peach State.\n\nSchool: Wayne (Ohio)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 12 NATL. (No. 3 WR)\n\nAbout: The five-star pass-catcher has already been committed to Ohio State for over a year. He made his pledge on Nov. 23, 2024 and has shown no signs of backing off since, even with the departure of Brian Hartline. The Buckeyes inked five-star WR Chris Henry Jr. after a long-standing commitment and they’ll now hope to do the same with Brown. He’s the top-ranked prospect in Ohio.\n\nSchool: Fort Gibson (Okla.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 13 NATL. (No. 3 OT)\n\nScouting Summary: “Hyper-athletic offensive tackle prospect with rare natural movement skills and a frame that points to immense long-term upside as one of the highest-ceiling linemen early in the 2027 cycle. Measured around 6-foot-7, 260 pounds with elite length (arms over 34 inches) and big hands prior to his junior season. Has the frame to add significant mass once in a college strength program. Lines up at right tackle for his high school, where his athletic traits immediately stand out. Moves with rare fluidity for his size and plays with surprising power through his lower half, generating torque and leverage at the point of attack. Shows balance and body control that project well to the next level. Displays loose flexibility and consistently lowers his pads to handle shorter defenders. Plays with a physical edge and looks to finish blocks through the whistle.\n\n…Further showcases his athleticism as a disruptive defensive end. Doubles as a talented basketball player on the high school and AAU circuit who can run the court and play above the rim. Will need to add considerable mass and adjust to stronger competition at the next level, which could delay early playing time. Possesses an outstanding developmental profile with the big frame, movement skills, and multi-sport coordination that give him the upside to develop into an early-round NFL Draft pick.”",

    "fullText": "The Golden State Warriors have had over 600 players don the more than 60 jersey numbers used by their players over the more than 75 years of existence the team has enjoyed in its rich and storied history.\n\nFounded in 1946 during the Basketball Association of America (BAA – a precursor league of the NBA) era, the team has called home the cities of Philadelphia, San Francisco, Oakland, and even San Diego.\n\nTo commemorate the players who wore those numbers, Warriors Wire is covering the entire history of jersey numbers and the players who sported them since the founding of the team. For this article, we begin with the third of nine players who wore the No. 43 jersey for the Warriors.\n\nThat player would be Golden State forward alum Larry McNeill. After ending his college career at Marquette, McNeill was picked up with the 25th overall selection of the 1973 NBA Draft by the (then) Kansas City-Omaha (now, Sacramento) Kings.\n\nThe Hoke, North Carolina native played the first three seasons of his pro career with the Kings. He would also play for (then) New York (now, Brooklyn) Nets, before he signed with the Dubs in 1977. His stay with the team lasted until he was cut by the team that fall.\n\nDuring his time suiting up for the Warriors, McNeill wore only jersey No. 43 and put up 4.5 points and 2.5 rebounds per game\n\nAll stats and data courtesy of Basketball Reference.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Warriors jersey history - No. 43 - Larry McNeill (1977)",

    "fullText": "Quantizing attention improves efficiency on two fronts: the model has\nhigher compute throughput, and loads fewer bytes per key/value. However,\ntraining with block quantized attention can break causal modeling. We\npresent a fix that enables training with MXFP4 in both attention and the\nattention gradient.\n\nIn causal language modeling, the final logits at position ii must depend only on tokens at positions\n≤i\\le i. Future leakage\nis when information from positions >i>i may influence the logits at position\nii. It poses an issue because it causes\na skew between training and decode. In typical setups, causal masks\nprevent leakage in attention. But block quantization can introduce a\nsubtle new path for future leakage.\n\nModern accelerators require using block-quantized matrix\nmultiplications for highest throughput. To use these instructions to\ncompute A×BA \\times B, the row vectors of\nAA and column vectors of BB must be split into blocks of size kk and quantized. The specific value of kk depends on the format being used. For\nexample, the microscaling formats use k=32k=32.\n\nWithin a block, let x0,x1,…,xk−1x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{k-1} denote the precise (unquantized) elements. When\nquantizing, we approximate each element xix_i with a quantized value qiq_i and a scale ss shared across the block: xi≈qi⋅sx_i \\approx q_i \\cdot s\n\nThere are various approaches to selecting ss with different tradeoffs. But in general\nthey choose an ss with a function of all\nelements in the block.\n\nGiven ss, the quantized elements\nare:\n\nqi=round(xis)q_i = \\text{round}\\left(\\frac{x_i}{s}\\right)\n\nWith this procedure, ss and\nconsequently qiq_i depend on\nall the pre-quantized elements in the block. So if the\nquantization block spans across different token positions, quantization\nenables the later tokens in the block to influence earlier tokens.\n\nCausal attention for a single head takes queries Q\\mathbf{Q}, keys K\\mathbf{K}, and values V\\mathbf{V} as inputs, and produces:\n\nP=softmax(Q×KT+M)output=P×V\\begin{array}{lcl} \\mathbf{P} & = & \\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{Q} \\times \\mathbf{K}^T + \\mathbf{M}) \\\\ \\text{output} & = & \\mathbf{P} \\times \\mathbf{V} \\end{array}\n\nwhere M\\mathbf{M} is the causal\nmask.\n\nOur goal is to use block-quantized matrix multiplications for Q×KT\\mathbf{Q} \\times \\mathbf{K}^T and P×V\\mathbf{P} \\times \\mathbf{V}. So Q\\mathbf{Q} and K\\mathbf{K} need to be quantized in blocks\nformed along the head dimension, while P\\mathbf{P} and V\\mathbf{V} need to be quantized in blocks\nformed along different token positions.\n\nQuantizing P\\mathbf{P} is safe\ndespite blocking along token positions, since the causal mask zeros out\nfuture probabilities. However, the quantized V\\mathbf{V} at position jj can depend on values at positions >j> j, which can cause future leakage.\n\nConsider query position ii and value\nposition jj, with block indices:\n\nbi=⌊ik⌋,bj=⌊jk⌋b_i = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{i}{k} \\right\\rfloor, \\quad b_j = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{j}{k} \\right\\rfloor\n\nLeakage occurs when query position ii\nand value position jj share a\nquantization block position (bi=bjb_i = b_j):\n\nbi=bjb_i = b_j\n(block-diagonal): query ii\nattends to value jj if j≤ij \\le i. But the quantized value at jj is computed from all positions in\nthe block (including positions greater than ii). This breaks causality since the attention\noutput at position ii can depend on\npositions greater than ii.\n\nbi>bjb_i > b_j (past\nblocks): All positions in block bjb_j precede the first position in block bib_i. No leakage.\n\nbi<bjb_i < b_j (future\nblocks): The causal mask zeros P[i,j]\\mathbf{P}[i,j] for j>ij > i. No leakage.\n\nLeakage only occurs when the ii-th block-diagonal tile of P\\mathbf{P} is multiplied with the ii-th quantized block of V\\mathbf{V}. So we can prevent future leakage\n\nV\\mathbf{V} when multiplying the\nii-th tile of P\\mathbf{P} with the ii-th block of V\\mathbf{V}, while using block quantized\nmatrix multiplications everywhere else.\n\nTo validate this fix, we trained a pair of 1B-parameter models on the\nC4 dataset, with MXFP4 for attention and the attention gradient. Both\nmodels share the following configuration:\n\nWe trained a “Leaky” model that used MXFP4 for all of P×V\\mathbf{P} \\times \\mathbf{V}, and a “Fixed”\nmodel that used the proposed solution.\n\nThe Fixed model remained well behaved throughout training. However,\nthe Leaky model had training dynamics associated with future leakage:\nthe grad norms grew rapidly before the loss started to improve\nsuspiciously fast.\n\nTo confirm that the Leaky model was only doing better because of\nfuture leakage, we evaluated loss in two modes on a heldout set. In\nparallel mode, we ran prefill once per sequence. In autoregressive mode,\nwe averaged the loss for generating the sequence one token at a\ntime.\n\nDespite the Leaky model’s parallel loss being lower than the Fixed\nmodel’s, the autoregressive loss was worse. The Leaky model’s gap in\nloss between parallel and autoregressive modes indicates that it was\nreliant on future signal. The Fixed model had no gap, demonstrating our\nsolution worked.\n\nThe Leaky model’s parallel mode was using quantization error to\nencode information about upcoming tokens. Padding a block with zeros\n(like we do in autoregressive mode) won’t change the selected scale. But\nadding outliers to the end (which can happen in parallel mode) makes the\nscale larger. Larger scales can cause earlier values to underflow.\n\nExample where a future outlier causes the second value to\nunderflow.\n\nThe model can use whether earlier values in a block underflowed to\ninfer something about upcoming tokens.\n\nWe hope the methodology here provides a starting point for\nresearchers interested in quantizing attention during training. In\nfuture work, we aim to demonstrate that quantized attention can match\nthe quality of float baselines while still providing end-to-end\nspeedups.\n\nIf these research problems sound interesting, consider working with us!",

    "description": "The developer of the popular text editor Notepad++ said hackers associated with the Chinese government hijacked its software update mechanism to deliver tainted software to users for months.",
    "fullText": "The developer of the popular open source text editor Notepad++ has confirmed that hackers hijacked the software to deliver malicious updates to users over the course of several months in 2025.\n\nIn a blog post published Monday, Notepad++ developer Don Ho said that the cyberattack was likely carried out by hackers associated with the Chinese government between June and December 2025, citing multiple analyses by security experts who examined the malware payloads and attack patterns. Ho said this “would explain the highly selective targeting” seen during the campaign.\n\nRapid7, which investigated the incident, attributed the hacking to Lotus Blossom, a long-running espionage group known to work for China, and said the hacks targeted government, telecom, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media sectors.\n\nNotepad++ is one of the longest-running open source projects, spanning more than two decades, and it counts at least tens of millions of downloads to date, including by employees at organizations around the world.\n\nAccording to Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who first discovered the cyberattack and wrote up his findings in December, the hackers compromised a small number of organizations “with interests in East Asia” after someone unwittingly used a tainted version of the popular software. Beaumont said that the hackers were able to gain “hands-on” access to the computers of victims who were running hijacked versions of Notepad++.\n\nHo said that the “exact technical mechanism” of how the hackers broke into his servers remains under investigation, but provided some details as to how the attack went down.\n\nIn the blog, Ho said that Notepad++’s website was hosted on a shared hosting server. The attackers “specifically targeted” Notepad++’s web domain with the goal of exploiting a bug in the software to redirect some users to a malicious server run by the hackers. This allowed the hackers to deliver malicious updates to certain users who had requested a software update, until the bug was fixed in November and the hackers’ access was terminated in early December.\n\n“We do have logs indicating that the bad actor tried to re-exploit one of the fixed vulnerabilities; however, the attempt did not succeed after the fix was implemented,” wrote Ho.\n\nIn an email, Ho told TechCrunch that his hosting provider confirmed his shared server was compromised but that the provider did not say how the hackers initially broke in.\n\nHo apologized for the incident, and urged users to download the most recent version of his software, which contains a fix for the bug.\n\nThe cyberattack targeting Notepad++ users is somewhat reminiscent of the 2019-2020 cyberattack affecting customers of SolarWinds, a software company that makes IT and network management tools for large Fortune 500 organizations, including government departments. Russian government spies hacked into the company’s servers and secretly planted a backdoor in its software, allowing the Russian spies to access data on those customers’ networks once the update had rolled out.\n\nThe SolarWinds breach affected several government agencies, including Homeland Security and the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Justice, and State.\n\nUpdated with a response from Ho and with additional details from Rapid7.",

    "title": "Chainguard admitted Factory 1.0 was \"brittle.\"",
    "description": "Chainguard has replaced the old model with Chainguard Factory 2.0, a radical, AI-powered reimagining of its pipeline.",
    "fullText": "The new, revised Chainguard Factory 2.0 swaps out 1.0’s fragile, event-driven pipeline with a self-healing system powered by a new open source framework called DriftlessAF.\n\nLots of people love the software supply-chain security company Chainguard for its secure-by-design open-source components for today’s application stacks. Who doesn’t like components that come guaranteed to have the latest CVE fixes? These are built by a process called the Chainguard Factory. This is an automated build system that continuously updates Chainguard’s safe containers, libraries, and VMs with the latest security patches. There’s only one little problem. As originally built, the “Factory” had more than its fair share of bugs. The answer? Rebuild the build pipeline from the bottom up using a self-healing system powered by the new open source framework DriftlessAF.\n\nChainguard Factory’s job, according to Dustin Kirkland, Chainguard’s engineering SVP, is to constantly monitor and “build over 10,000 open source projects, and the moment that any upstream maintainer tags a new release, our automation springs into action—fetching that source code, checking the checksums, applying our build rules, rebuilding and recompiling that software, retesting that software at the package and unit level.”\n\nThat’s a huge, honking job. Chainguard now admits that their original Chainguard Factory 1.0 wasn’t up to the task. It was built on a traditional event-driven system. While functional at a smaller scale, the system became a loose confederation of fallible edge-triggered processes that struggled to keep pace with the depth and breadth of our catalog and our ambitious product promise: secure, up-to-date content with zero known CVEs.”\n\nThe result was a brittle system — “with DriftlessAF, we are moving away from complex, brittle processes,” the company writes on its blog — that was prone to errors, requiring subject matter experts (SMEs) to get their hands dirty to keep the programs running through the pipeline. This was, in a word, “unacceptable.”\n\nSo, Chainguard has replaced the old model with Chainguard Factory 2.0, a radical, AI-powered reimagining of its pipeline. This new model uses AI agents to run a reconciliation-driven drive. Factory 2.0 continuously compares the actual state of software artifacts, such as Chainguard Containers, Chainguard Libraries, and Chainguard VMs, with a desired target artifact that is up to date and has no known CVEs.\n\nSome of these agents are derived from an AI agent programming company named — sorry for the confusion, but there it is — Factory. According to the company, Chainguard “selected Factory for its compaction engine, which collapses sprawling changes into reviewable PRs.” This compaction engine saves context between programming sessions. In other words, to quote Josh Wolf, a Chainguard Staff Engineer, “There’s all this hype nowadays about the improving memory of different agents. When you don’t have to think about context windows, you can treat [Factory] Droid like a colleague that just remembers what you’ve been talking about.”\n\nChainguard Factory 2.0  works by using AI bots and agents to continuously track code changes. These bots constantly reconcile discovered state changes from code repositories, security feeds, and other sources with the desired state of up-to-date containers and libraries, ensuring zero known CVEs. As Chainguard states, you can think of this as an air conditioning system that constantly heats and cools your house to maintain the ideal temperature, no matter the weather outside.\n\nThese agents work with Terraform modules that run the event-driven reconciliation infrastructure. Go language programs then direct the agents, which run on Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude.\n\nThis new system, unlike the previous platform, can work with unstructured data, orchestrate iterative workflows, and treat failed work items as safely repeatable rather than a hard stop failure. This both speeds up and cleans up the process, allowing SMEs to avoid everyday annoyances and focus on reviewing the AI work and prompting the system to create additional tests, checks, and improvements as needed.\n\nThe end result, says Dan Lorenc, Chainguard co-founder and CEO, is “Factory. 2.0 is more than a factory. It’s a revolution. Our amazing engineering team is using AI to achieve remediation speeds we never thought possible. I’m talking about detecting and patching a vulnerability before upstream is even aware.”\n\nHe continues, “Our AI-powered pipeline is transforming raw source code into 1,000s of packages and assembling those into secure, compliant, and hardened container images at an unprecedented scale. But here’s the best part. AI powers it. Our engineers are available to help with the hard parts.”\n\nIt sounds promising. Now, the question is, “Will Chainguard Factory 2.0 and DriftlessAF live up to their promise?” There’s only one way to find out. Take them out, kick their tires, and let us know what you find.",

In a FAQ posted to Adobe’s website, the company says it will stop selling the animation software on March 1st, citing the emergence of new platforms “that better serve the needs of the users.”\n\nUsers have until March 1st, 2027 (or March 1st, 2029 for enterprise customers) to access and download files from Animate, as they’ll no longer be available after this time. The app will be available to download until those deadlines, and Adobe will continue providing support during that period.\n\nAdobe Animate’s history dates back to 1996, when FutureWave Software launched the vector graphics application, originally called FutureSplash Animator, as a tool to create vector-based animations. Though Macromedia acquired the tool later that year and renamed it Flash, Adobe purchased the company in 2005 and began calling the app Adobe Flash Professional. Adobe announced plans to rebrand the app to Adobe Animate in 2015 as the web began phasing out Flash.\n\nThough Adobe says Creative Cloud Pro customers can use other apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality,” such as Adobe After Effects or Adobe Express, many users who still use Animate are frustrated with its imminent shutdown. The creators behind the short-form animated series, Chikn Nuggit, write in a post on X that they still use Adobe Animate to make the show. “This decision would not only harm countless jobs in the industry but render so much past creations as lost media,” the post reads. David Firth, the creator of Salad Fingers, also says he still uses the app to make the grotesque series.\n\nMegacharlie, a technical artist for Jackbox Games, adds that the app “is used in many high-budget television cartoon productions, film and animation studios, game studios big and small, not to mention the 1000s of indie creators who still make use of it daily.”\n\nOver the past year, Adobe has made it clear that it’s focused on AI. The company has launched a slew ofAI-powered editing tools across its apps, and rolled out an AI audio tool to add soundtracks and voiceovers to videos. It’s also working on its own “IP-safe” Firefly AI models for the entertainment industry.",

    "description": "In one of the most baffling discoveries of the last decade, scientists have found a clue in a cave to how life might survive in deep space without light.",
    "fullText": "When cave biologist Hazel Barton ventured into the pitch darkness, the last thing she expected to find were organisms harnessing energy from light. This new understanding of photosynthesis in the dark, she realised, means life elsewhere in the Universe could exist in places we never thought possible.\n\n\"The wall was bright green. It was the most iridescent green you'd ever seen, and yet the microbes were living in complete darkness,\" says Barton, professor of geological sciences at the University of Alabama.\n\nBeneath the deep rocky canyons of the Chihuahuan Desert in southern New Mexico, lies a network of 119 caves. The caves, part of the Carlsbad Caverns National Park, formed four to 11 million years ago due to sulphuric acid dissolving the limestone rocks.\n\nThe primary attraction of the park is the show cave, Carlsbad Cavern. Here, glittering stalactites cling to the roof of the Big Room, a huge underground chamber measuring almost 4,000ft (1,220m) long and 625ft (191m) wide.\n\n\"The Carlsbad cavern is very easily accessible. It's a very large limestone cave that tourists can visit that has steps and ladders and everyone can go down,\" says Lars Behrendt, a microbial biologist at Uppsala University. Parts of the cave system, he adds, are even wheelchair accessible.\n\nAlmost 350,000 people visit Carlsbad cavern each year, yet most would be completely unaware that the cave is the setting to one of the most baffling scientific discoveries of the past decade.\n\nIn 2018, Behrendt had just finished his PhD. He had also won an academic prize, which awarded him some money. He contacted Barton and asked her if she would accompany him on an expedition. Luckily, she agreed.\n\n\"The first thing you do in the Carlsbad cave is you kind of go down on the tourist trail, and then you turn around a corner,\" says Barton. \"I don't know how many times I've done that trail, probably 40 times. At that point, you go around the corner, and then behind you there's an alcove, and it's completely black.\"\n\nFor more than 20 years, Barton has been studying microscopic life found deep underground. Yet what happened next was a surprise, even to her.\n\nBehrendt shone a torch on the wall. Although the alcove was pitch black, the light revealed a blanket of green microbes clinging to the wall. Later tests revealed they were cyanobacteria; single celled organisms related to bacteria. Unlike most bacteria, though, cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae) use light from the Sun to make food.\n\n\"We started going deeper and deeper into the cave,\" says Barton. \"Eventually we were a point where we couldn't see without using flashlights. We had to use a headlight to be able to see our hand in front of our face, and yet you could still see green pigment on the wall.\"\n\nPlants are green due to a chemical called chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy. In photosynthesis, this energy is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The process is much the same in cyanobacteria. Yet here, in the cave, there was no sunlight.\n\nIt turns out that the cyanobacteria in the cave have a special version of chlorophyll that can capture near-infrared light. This light has a longer wavelength than visible light, and appears just before infrared on the electromagnetic spectrum. It is undetectable to the human eye.\n\nWhile plants and cyanobacteria use chlorophyll a for photosynthesis, the cyanobacteria in the Carlsbad caves use chlorophyll d and f, which are able to generate energy from near-infrared light.\n\nAlthough visible light can only travel a few hundred feet into the caves, near-infrared can journey a lot further due to the reflective nature of the limestone rocks. \"The limestone rock that the cave is made of will absorb almost all visible light, but to near-infrared light, caves are pretty much a hall of mirrors,\" says Barton.\n\nIn fact, when the researchers measured the light in the back of the cave where it was darkest, they found the levels of near-infrared light were 695 times more concentrated than at the entrance. At the same time, while chlorophyll d and f containing cyanobacteria were present in all parts of the cave, they were particularly concentrated in the darkest and deepest places.\n\nThe researchers also hiked out to other caves in the Carlsbad Caverns National Park and tested other off-the-beaten-track caves and caverns. In each case they found photosynthesising microbes deep down underground.\n\n\"We showed that not only do they live down there, but that they photosynthesise in a completely sheltered environment where they've probably been untouched for 49 million years,\" says Behrendt.\n\nBarton and Behrendt aren't the only scientists to find microbes able to live in the dark.\n\nIn 1890, pioneering Ukrainian-Russian microbiologist Sergei Nikolaevich Vinogradskii discovered that some microbes could live solely on inorganic matter – using a process called chemosynthesis. These microbes gain energy through chemical reactions, taking chemicals such as methane or hydrogen sulphide from surrounding rocks and water.\n\nIn 1996, Hideaki Miyashita, who at the time was a student on Nasa's postdoctoral programme, discovered a marine cyanobacterium named Acaryochloris marina that can photosynthesise using both visible and near-infrared light. This discovery kickstarted decades of research into the wavelengths of light required for photosynthesis.\n\nThen, in 2018, scientists at Imperial College London found photosynthesising cyanobacteria living in shady conditions in bacterial mats in Yellowstone National Park, and inside some beach rocks in Australia. They even managed to grow photosynthesising microbes in a dark cupboard fitted with infrared LEDs. In each case, the cyanobacteria used chlorophyll a to photosynthesise using visible light, but then switched to using chlorophyll f to photosynthesise using near-infrared light – beyond the reach of human vision.\n\nThe findings have repercussions for what life on other planets could look like. When looking for a habitable exoplanet – a planet that orbits a star in another solar system – it's important to take into account the type of star that it is orbiting. Astronomers have tried to group stars by the colour of light they produce, resulting in seven classes of stars (O, B, A, F, G, K and M), which are arranged in order of decreasing temperature, from hottest to coolest. O- and B-type stars are the hottest, most massive and most luminous stars in the Universe. They are characterised by their blue-white colour.\n\n\"They produce a lot of UV radiation, so they're toxic to life,\" says Barton.\n\nG-type stars, which include our Sun, are yellow in colour and produce a lot of light in the visible spectrum. These stars would theoretically be good places to look for habitable worlds, but G-type stars constitute just 8% of the estimated one billion trillion stars in the Universe.\n\nAs red dwarfs are low mass stars, their planets tend to orbit closely, which makes them easier to spot. Another reason that M stars have proved so fruitful in scientists' search for exoplanets is because they are so plentiful. However, currently red dwarf stars are thought to have a very narrow habitable zone – the area closest to the star where conditions are neither too hot, nor too cold for liquid water to exist on the planet's surface. the epic hunt for a planet just like Earth.)\n\nAs the existence of liquid water is essential for life on Earth, this measure, known as the star's \"Goldilocks zone\", is what astrobiologists have focused on when looking for extraterrestrial life. So far, they have found dozens of candidates. However not all of these planets could sustain life, and directing telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) takes time and considerable resources.\n\n• The peculiar smells of outer space\n\n• The scientists looking for alien vegetation\n\n• The scientists venturing into the deep, dark Earth\n\nAnother important factor which governs whether life can exist is whether photosynthesis can take place. On Earth, photosynthesis forms the base of most food chains and provides the oxygen we breathe. For this reason, it makes sense to limit the search to planets that can support photosynthesis. This could dramatically reduce the zone around a star where life could exist.\n\nIn the past, astrobiologists set the limit for photosynthesis at a wavelength of 700nm in the light spectrum, which is the equivalent wavelength of the colour red. This is the point at which the efficiency of photosynthesis using chlorophyll a declines. However, the cyanobacteria discovered in the Carlsbad cave systems can harvest light up to wavelengths of 780nm using chlorophyll f.\n\n\"The vast majority of stars in our galaxy are these M- and K-type stars,\" says Barton. \"This means most of the stars in our galaxy are putting out near-infrared light, and yet we barely know anything about how photosynthesis and life could survive under the conditions of light that would be produced by a star like that.\"\n\nBarton plans to change this. Together with Behrendt, she has put in a proposal to Nasa to find the limits of where photosynthetic life can survive. The work would involve going deep down into the darkest caves to measure exactly how much light is needed for cyanobacteria to survive. That information can then be used to narrow down the search for habitable worlds. For example, with the JWST, scientists can measure the amount and type of light exoplanets receive.\n\n\"What our work is trying to do is figure out what is the longest wavelength of light and lowest level of light at which you can photosynthesise,\" says Barton.\n\n\"Then what you can do is take the 100 billion potential stars that we can point the James Webb Space Telescope at, and reduce it down to say 50 stars [which may host life].\"\n\nIn other words, it could lead to astrobiologists broadening the types of worlds that they believe could support life. All that would remain would be to point the JWST at the star in question and then look for planets passing in front of it. As the light from the star travels through the atmosphere of the planet, specific frequencies of light are absorbed depending on what elements are present. Astronomers can therefore work out if certain elements which might hint at the presence of life, such as oxygen, are present in the exoplanet's atmosphere by looking for missing lines on the absorption spectra.\n\n\"There are very, very few ways that oxygen can be made in an atmosphere without life,\" says Barton. \"So, if you can find the oxygen in the atmosphere of one of those exoplanets, it's a very, very strong marker for potential life.\"\\\n\n* This article has been updated to correct information about the spectral classification of stars from O to M. This article also incorrectly stated that all exoplanets discovered to date have been found around red dwarf stars. Exoplanets have been discovered around a wide variety of stars.\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, \n\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC,",

    "fullText": "\"We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes,\" he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday called on Republicans to \"take over\" and \"nationalize\" voting as he continued to make false claims about the electoral process in the U.S. with the 2026 midterm elections on the horizon.\n\nTrump made the comments in an interview with former FBI Director Dan Bongino, who resigned from his post in December and returned to podcasting.\n\nTrump alleged noncitizen voting was improperly influencing election outcomes, though experts insist such instances are incredibly rare and already illegal, and told Bongino it was \"amazing that the Republicans aren't tougher on it.\"\n\n\"The Republicans should say, 'We want to take over,'\" Trump said. \"We should take over the voting ... in at least many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes.\"\n\nThe Constitution gives states the authority to conduct federal elections, subject to laws passed by Congress. The elections clause states, in part, that \"state legislatures will establish the times, places, and manner of holding elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate.\"\n\nTrump didn't elaborate on how he wanted Republicans to \"nationalize\" voting.\n\nAsked by ABC News for specifics on what Trump meant, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson responded, \"President Trump cares deeply about the safety and security of our elections -- that’s why he’s urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting, and end the practice of ballot harvesting.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the chamber's top Democrat, slammed Trump over his comments to Bongino.\n\n\"Just a few hours ago, Donald Trump said he wants to nationalize elections around the country. That's what Trump said. You think he believes in democracy? He said, 'We want to take over, the Republicans ought to nationalize the voting,'\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"Does Donald Trump need a copy of the Constitution? What he is saying is outlandishly illegal.\"\n\nTrump's agenda is at stake in this year’s elections, where all seats in the House and 35 in the Senate will be up for grabs. Currently, Republicans hold narrow margins in both chambers -- but midterm cycles are historically unkind to the sitting president's party.\n\nLast year, Trump and other Republicans pushed for mid-decade redistricting in order to gain additional House seats. The president warned Republicans last month that they have to win the midterms or he will get \"impeached.\"\n\nTrump also continues to litigate his 2020 election loss, spreading false claims of fraud.\n\nLast week, the FBI searched and seized original 2020 voting records from the Fulton County Elections and Operations Hub in Georgia, a swing state that went blue in 2020 and helped secure Joe Biden's victory.\n\n\"Now you're going to see something in Georgia where they were able to get, with a court order, the ballots. You're going to see some interesting things come out,” Trump said on Bongino's podcast.\n\nABC News' Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.",

It required 7-days’ warning for visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities being funded exclusively by the “Big Beautiful Bill” that Republicans passed last summer. That bill did not include the rider.\n\nCobb rejected the policy, crediting the lawmakers’ contention that it would be logistically difficult to segregate which expenses are being funded by which law.\n\n“Defendants’ declarant provides almost no details or specifics as to how DHS and ICE would accomplish this task in the face of the practical challenges raised by Plaintiffs,” wrote Cobb, an appointee of former President Biden.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to a DHS spokesperson for comment.\n\nThe suit was filed by 13 Democratic members of Congress: Joe Neguse (Colo.), Adriano Espaillat (N.Y.), Bennie Thompson (Miss.), Jamie Raskin (Md.), Robert Garcia (Calif.), Lou Correa (Calif.), Jason Crow (Colo.), Veronica Escobar (Texas), Dan Goldman (N.Y.), Jimmy Gomez (Calif.), Raul Ruiz (Calif.), Norma Torrez (Calif.) and Kelly Morrison (Minn.).\n\nTheir latest push in court came after the lawmakers said they tried to visit an ICE facility in Minnesota three days after the fatal shooting of Renée Good by a federal agent.\n\n“The Court’s decision today to grant a temporary restraining order against ICE’s unlawful effort to obstruct congressional oversight is a victory for the American people. We will keep fighting to ensure the rule of law prevails,” Neguse, a member of House Democratic leadership, said in a statement.\n\nThe lawmakers are represented by American Oversight and Democracy Forward Foundation, two organizations that regularly back lawsuits against the Trump administration.",

    "description": "Exclusive: ‘There has to be something better than this,’ Irish deportee Patrick Moore told The Independent. ‘It's not the United States that I know.’",
    "fullText": "When a Manhattan-based construction executive and his boyfriend of two decades were renovating a luxury Tribeca triplex in 2024, the two began – like many couples do amid such undertakings – to argue.\n\nAs the bickering escalated, Patrick Moran, an expert in conservation and preservation who has overseen building projects for New York City’s Carnegie Hall, the American Museum of Natural History and the New York Federal Reserve, says partner Nicholas Kjos, a high-end real estate broker who previously worked as an entertainer on cruise ships, at one point called him a “f**king immigrant,” and threatened to call ICE to have him deported, according to civil court filings reviewed by The Independent.\n\nThe 46-year-old Moran, for his part, chalked the cruel outburst up to “stress” over the ongoing overhaul of their $4.3 million apartment, which had by then already been dragging on for four years, and “continued to believe in the relationship.”\n\nThat is, until Kjos, 45, initiated legal proceedings to have Moran removed from their shared home, leveling claims that prompted a team of eight armed ICE officers to show up last summer and detain Moran for deportation. He spent the next month being shuffled around the country to various lockups, before finally being sent back to Ireland.\n\nGetting Moran thrown out of the United States was part of a plot “intended to exploit [Moran’s] immigration status,” with a goal of “wrongfully obtain[ing] sole control, ownership and possession of the property,” the complaint alleges.\n\n“It’s a situation where I feel that ICE was weaponized against him,” Moran’s attorney Andreas Vasilatos told The Independent. “Almost like how the Mafia just whacks a guy [they don’t want around anymore]. But here, instead of whacking the guy, it’s, ‘I’m gonna call ICE.’”\n\nSpeaking to The Independent from overseas, Moran said, “I love [the United States] and what it stands for, and I know we are better than this. I don’t claim to have the solution to immigration reform, but whatever that solution is, it must be fair, just and enforced with compassion and humanity.”\n\nThe stunning episode comes during an unprecedented expansion of ICE’s remit, with more than 73,000 people now in immigration detention – an all-time high and a 75 percent increase in the 12 months since Donald Trump retook the White House.\n\nIn Florida, the state’s attorney general has encouraged people with undocumented exes to report them to ICE. The top ICE official at the agency’s Puerto Rico field office said investigators today receive “revenge tips” they never got previously, telling NPR that people are turning in “a neighbor that they don’t get along with, or an ex-husband, ex-wife, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend.” Last year, after a 29-year-old NYPD sergeant was spurned by a woman he met online, he allegedly threatened to have her deported by ICE.\n\nBetween January and September 2025, the U.S. deported 99 Irish citizens, a 50 percent increase compared to a year earlier, and an 1,880 percent increase over the five people deported back to Ireland in 2021.\n\nMoran’s forced return has left him “shattered,” according to Vasilatos. He described Moran as a “super sweet guy,” who “contributed to society and was a net positive” to everybody in his life.\n\n“It’s not disputed he was undocumented,” Vasilatos said. “But to not take into consideration his contributions to America over the last 20 years, makes it particularly draconian and particularly punitive.”\n\nKjos did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nMoran and Kjos, who is originally from San Antonio, were introduced by a mutual friend in 2005, and quickly embarked on a romantic relationship “characterized by mutual love and commitment,” according to a lawsuit Vasilatos filed January 29 on Moran’s behalf in Manhattan Supreme Court.\n\nShortly after they began dating, Kjos gave up his career at sea to pursue potential opportunities as an actor-singer on Broadway, the complaint continues. About six months later, the pair began living together in Midtown, Moran’s complaint says.\n\nThey spent holidays together at Kjos’s family ranch in Texas, attended weddings together and Moran became Kjos’s nephew’s godfather, the complaint goes on. Moran and Kjos bought a Bernedoodle named Benji, which became “a beloved part of their shared life,” according to the complaint.\n\nMoran, who earned more than $300,000 a year, was the “primary financial provider” for the pair, the complaint states. Kjos left his seaborne career behind and obtained a real estate license, splitting his time between New York and Texas, the complaint says, noting that Moran hired a “nationally recognized website designer to create and maintain a state-of-the-art website” for Kjos, among other things. In 2015, Moran and Kjos decided to purchase a $400,000 apartment atop the Grand Hyatt Hotel in San Antonio, completely redoing the brand-new space at Moran’s expense, the complaint contends.\n\nAnd because dealing in multimillion-dollar properties was a business that “emphasized image,” Moran provided cash down payments for Kjos to buy, at various times, a Range Rover, a Mercedes and a Porsche.\n\n“At no time did [Moran] view these payments as individual obligations; rather, they were treated as joint contributions to the parties' shared life,” according to the complaint.\n\nDue to Moran’s undocumented immigration status, the San Antonio home was titled in Kjos’s name, but “it was understood and intended to be jointly owned and benefited from by both parties,” according to the complaint.\n\nIn 2020, Moran and Kjos decided to buy a place in New York City, setting their sights on a raw three-story condo in the Tribeca section of Lower Manhattan.\n\nLike the San Antonio home, Moran’s immigration status meant the Tribeca property also needed to be titled in Kjos’s name, according to the complaint. But, it says, “it was acquired and renovated with the understanding that it was a joint asset for their mutual benefit.”\n\nThree years went by, and in December 2024, Moran resigned from his job and co-founded his own construction firm. By this time, the two had started to argue, the complaint explains. It says Kjos made “derogatory remarks such as calling [Moran] a ‘f**king immigrant,’ and threatening to ‘report’ him to immigration authorities for deportation.”\n\nNevertheless, Moran “attributed this to project stress” and continued to trust that the relationship between him and Kjos would endure, according to the complaint.\n\nAt this point, the renovation costs began to soar, the complaint states. Under intense financial pressure, the couple agreed to sell their San Antonio apartment, complete the renovations to the apartment in Tribeca and sell it, then part ways, according to the complaint.\n\nWith the Tribeca renovation nearing completion, it says Kjos demanded that Moran move out for staging and sale, while also claiming the local real estate market was weak and that issues with the building’s foundation would devalue the property. But, Moran’s complaint argues, a comprehensive valuation report from the Office of the New York State Comptroller deemed the Tribeca market “at a peak,” an assertion backed up by consultations with real estate professionals who estimated the renovated space “should command approximately $4,300,000.”\n\nIn early August, Moran got home to find a notice ordering him to vacate the property within 10 days, the complaint states. Because the apartment belonged to both of them, Moran decided to fight it out in court, where Kjos’s lawyer “falsely accused [Moran] of selling methamphetamine, a baseless claim,” according to the complaint, which insists that Moran, who said he has no criminal history whatsoever, “has never sold drugs,” nor ever charged with doing so.\n\nKjos, in an “attempt to escalate” things, then called ICE and made the same spurious claim, unbeknownst to Moran, the complaint says.\n\n“On the morning of October 31, 2025, [Kjos] remotely unlocked the North Moore property door via his Control4… phone app, allowing eight armed ICE officers to enter and detain [Moran],” according to the complaint. “The officers, at the… permission of [Moran], searched the apartment and found no contraband or evidence of drugs. When the search was completed and [Moran] was removed from the apartment, [Kjos], through the use of his Control4 app, locked the door behind them.”\n\nMoran was taken into custody at gunpoint and forced out of the apartment in a T-shirt and sweatpants, he said. He asked to change into something more appropriate, and to get his keys, but the ICE officers refused, according to Moran.\n\nThat afternoon, while at Delaney Hall, a notorious ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, Moran was able to contact his business partner and their IT administrator and gave them permission to go into the Tribeca condo to retrieve his laptop and company files, “which were necessary for the continued operation of the company,” the complaint states.\n\nBut, it says, when Kjos got a notification on his phone from the Control4 app that they had entered the place, he “immediately called them up and falsely stated it was a federal crime scene and they were about to be arrested, as the police were on the way.”\n\nMoran’s complaint says no drug-related charges were filed, and that six months of apartment surveillance video would prove that no drugs were being sold out of the apartment, if only Kjos would allow him access to the footage.\n\n“It was so insulting,” Moran told The Independent, pushing back vehemently against the notion that he ever did anything of the sort. “I was furious… Like, ‘Is somebody punking me?’ It was such a low blow.”\n\nAfter about four weeks in ICE custody, culminating with a stint at an ICE facility in San Diego, Moran was permitted to “self-deport” back to Ireland, on a plane ticket his parents bought for him. He is now trying to pick up the pieces of his life from afar, and is hoping to resume his life in America eventually.\n\nKjos presently has full possession of the Tribeca apartment. In Moran’s suit against Kjos, he is seeking to get back his half of their joint assets and joint custody of their dog. The remedy here, in legal terms, is known as a constructive trust, in which the court would declare Kjos to be wrongfully holding property belonging to Moran, and force him to give it back so as not to be “unjustly enriched.”\n\n“I wasn't angry,” Moran told The Independent. “It was just sad. I was in a relationship for 20 years with this person, and as far as I was concerned, there wasn't going to be another person.”\n\nAsked where things stand now between himself and Kjos, Moran said he didn’t know. At the same time, he emphasized, he continues to believe in the U.S. And, Moran went on, his experience in ICE detention gave him a perspective on things that left an indelible mark.\n\n“Don't get me wrong, it was hard for me, but it was so much harder for pretty much everybody that I spoke to in there,” Moran said. “There are people in there that don't have anybody, that have nothing. They don't have money for commissary. So how are they to defend themselves?”\n\nAlthough Moran is an Irish native, he said he in fact spent more time living in the U.S. than he did in Ireland, and truly considers New York to be his home.\n\n“I will bounce back, and that's because America will allow me to do that,” Moran said. “That's why I love it there. But... [t]here has to be something better than this. It's not the United States that I know.”",

    "fullText": "A newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch delivered a sharp warning to President Donald Trump after a high-profile Republican loss.\n\nIn a new editorial, The Wall Street Journal warned Trump that a hardline immigration strategy promoted by top aide Stephen Miller is fueling voter backlash.\n\nIt comes after a Trump-endorsed candidate for the Texas state senate lost to a Democrat over the weekend.\n\n“How does a Republican lose by 14 points in a safe conservative Texas state Senate seat that President Trump carried by 17 points in 2024? Answer: When there’s a voter backlash against the Trump Administration, notably its mass deportation debacles,” the Journal wrote, describing the special election in Tarrant County.\n\nDemocrat Taylor Rehmet, a labor union leader and veteran, easily defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss, who had Trump’s endorsement on Truth Social and vastly outspent her opponent.\n\nRehment is the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades.\n\nThe paper noted the timing was disastrous for Republicans, coming after the high-profile Minneapolis killings by federal immigration agents. “The 31-point vote swing in a little more than 14 months can only be explained as part of a rising tide of opposition to Mr. Trump’s first year and a sour public mood,” the Journal observed.\n\nThe White House has faced mounting national backlash after federal immigration agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis—Renee Good in early January and Alex Pretti later that month—as part of aggressive enforcement operations in the state.\n\nBoth cases sparked controversy over conflicting official narratives. In Pretti’s case, Homeland Security officials and White House aides initially claimed he approached agents with a gun and posed a threat, while bystander videos show him holding only a cellphone before being pinned down and shot.\n\nSimilarly, authorities initially suggested that Good tried to ram agents with her vehicle before she was fatally shot, a claim contradicted by eyewitness footage and reporting. Critics argue these early statements painted both victims as dangerous to justify the shootings, fueling accusations that the administration misrepresented the events.\n\nThe killings came after Trump deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to Minneapolis as part of an aggressive immigration strategy masterminded by Miller.\n\nMiller’s immigration strategy under Trump has pushed aggressive mass arrests and deportations, with ICE agents pressured to meet high daily quotas, even targeting non-criminal undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal critiqued Miller’s hardline tactics, including a daily quota of 3,000 migrant arrests that it says “was bound to result in agent intrusions into homes and businesses.”\n\nWhile immigration has historically been a winning issue for Republicans, the Journal cautioned that enforcement “that turns ugly in the streets is turning off the swing voters who will determine who wins the race for Congress this year.”\n\nPolls have recently shown Americans turning on Trump and his immigration strategy ahead of the 2026 Midterms. A YouGov poll conducted on January 25 showed that about half (48 percent) of respondents do not think the shooting of Pretti in Minneapolis was justified.\n\nAnother YouGov poll showed that 52 percent of Americans think the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict immigration to the U.S. have gone too far.\n\nAs a result, the paper concluded that even as Trump signals a desire to “dial back the confrontations on the street,” he must also reconsider Miller’s influence. “The Miller strategy isn’t likely to fare better this year,” the editorial warned.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is not the first Murdoch-owned newspaper to publicly condemn Trump’s immigration strategy.\n\nIn an op-ed published last week, the New York Post argued that the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement in Minneapolis is backfiring politically.\n\n“These enforcement tactics won’t turn the tide, instead they are backfiring,” the Post wrote.",

    "fullText": "We also used replies from these Reddit threads.\n\n\"I then went outside, had a smoke, and thought about my life.\"\n\n\"The final breaking point of me quitting was when an elderly woman in a wheelchair got on the elevator in our building. ... She was having trouble remembering what floor she needed to get off on, so my boss pushed me over and hit two and when the door quickly opened (we all got on the elevator on the first floor) he pushed her out extremely roughly and said, 'Figure it out before you get back on, you old ratty hag!' She got $4,000 and agreed not to press charges since I made up a fake story on the spot about how my boss's best friend died and he wasn't in his right mind.\"\n\n\"[He] never offered us a fully paid lunch, but then wanted to steal from the company and us. He also would do super-illegal stuff in the mortgage world, like let unlicensed people quote borrowers' rates and do applications. I caught on to his other slimy ways and tried reporting him to HR, and they didn’t do anything, so I just quit.\"\n\n\"That's one of the most fucked-up things I've ever heard, and he told the story almost as if he was proud of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, and the company charged each reporter a $5 fee to use OUR personal car insurance for accident coverage while we were on company time. I left shortly after and never looked back. What a freaking jerk of an owner.\"\n\n\"The worst part was that the new owner left a super-cushy job for this business, and eventually he and his wife had to go back to work full-time to supplement their income since the business didn't perform as they'd been led to believe. Shortly after that, I quit because of the shadiness, and my boss (the original owner) legitimately offered to buy me whatever brand-new car I wanted to stay since I knew all his dirty secrets. I refused.\"\n\n\"The CEO went on a rant about how his Bentley was in the shop again, he hated the car, and he had so many problems with it, and it was always having little issues. When he finally finished his rant, the guy asked the CEO, 'So what did you drive to work today?' The CEO answered, 'Oh, my other Bentley.' He was doing a video about the rank and file staff needing to tighten their belts; meanwhile, he had half a million dollars in cars.\"\n\n\"Needless to say, I quit soon after.\"\n\n\"I was at the house one day and watched the little girl shriek with delight and go running full tilt towards her parent with her arms outstretched for a hug as K stepped through the front door.

And then closed the door in the kid’s face, and left for another week.\n\nIt seemed obvious to me that this person is an absolute workaholic who should not have become a parent. I later learned that there was a teenager, too, who was in some preppy boarding school and only came home on the weekends. It was really sad.\"\n\n\"The passenger then immediately remembered and haphazardly apologized as she walked out the door to the new car.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Russia has largely observed a ceasefire on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday as Kyiv prepared for the next round of trilateral talks on how ​to end the war.\n\nZelenskiy said that Russia had not carried out any targeted missile or drone strikes ‌on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the past 24 hours, but steady Russian shelling hit energy facilities near the front line.\n\n\"The de-escalation measures... are ‌helping to build public trust in the negotiation process and its possible outcome. The war needs to be ended,\" Zelenskiy said after he met his negotiating team ahead of the next round of peace talks with Russian and U.S. officials scheduled to take place this week in Abu Dhabi. \"Ukraine is ready for real steps. We believe it is realistic to achieve a ⁠dignified and lasting peace.\"\n\nIn his nightly ‌video address, Zelenskiy noted that Russian forces had continued to shell Ukrainian positions and logistics, damaging transmission lines and other sites in parts of the southeastern Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nHe ‍said the pause in strikes on energy infrastructure underscored the fact that U.S. efforts to pursue negotiations to end the war were having an impact.\n\n\"This demonstrates that when the United States has the motivation to genuinely change the situation, the situation can indeed ​change,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nRussia and Ukraine said last week they halted strikes on each other's energy infrastructure, but disagreed ‌on the timeframe for the truce.\n\nThe Kremlin said U.S. President Donald Trump had made a personal request to Russian President Vladimir Putin to refrain from striking Kyiv until February 1. Zelenskiy said the truce was supposed to last for a week, starting January 30.\n\nUKRAINE STRUGGLES TO RESTORE POWER SUPPLIES\n\nUkraine is struggling to restore its battered energy system and secure electricity and heat for the population after several large Russian strikes this month. Repair work has been complicated by ⁠bitterly cold temperatures.\n\n\"Today we are coming to the critical point. We ​need some time to recover what is destroyed for the last ​three months,\" said Maxim Timchenko, CEO of private energy producer DTEK. \"Energy ceasefire is extremely important for us to recover partly and avoid any tragic consequences because of no power supply.\"\n\nDTEK said on ‍Monday one of its coal ⁠mining enterprises in the Dnipropetrovsk region had been attacked for the second time in 24 hours. The previous strike on Sunday killed 12 miners, the company said.\n\nZelenskiy also said Russian forces were focusing on ⁠attacking transport logistics, especially railway infrastructure.\n\nRegional officials said that a Russian strike had killed a father and a son, and wounded two children and ‌their mother in the frontline Donetsk region.",

Metropolitan area employment and unemployment numbers were supposed to be released on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the highly anticipated monthly jobs report was set to be released on Friday. It would've shown how job growth, unemployment, wages, and more looked in January. It was also expected to show revisions to job growth for the past few years. The most recent report showed the US added 584,000 jobs in 2025, the lowest level since 2003 outside recessions.\n\n\"Once funding is restored, BLS will resume normal operations and notify the public of any changes to the news release schedule on the BLS release calendar,\" the bureau told Business Insider.\n\nThe Senate passed a spending package on Friday that would fund several agencies, but it still needs to go through the House, which wasn't in session over the weekend.",

    "description": "Despite having record-breaking careers, artists like Kendrick Lamar,  Lady Gaga, Drake, and Madonna have never won the Grammy for album of the year.",
    "fullText": "Save for his debut, all of Kendrick Lamar's studio albums have been contenders for the biggest Grammy Award: \"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City,\" \"To Pimp a Butterfly,\" \"Damn,\" \"Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers,\" and most recently, \"GNX.\" He also received nominations as a featured artist on Beyoncé's \"Lemonade\" and as the curator and lead performer on the \"Black Panther\" soundtrack.\n\nHe has won best rap album several times, record of the year, and song of the year — not to mention a Pulitzer Prize — but never album of the year.\n\nLady Gaga's \"Mayhem\" won best pop vocal album at the 2026 Grammys, but lost the top prize to Bad Bunny's \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" She had previously been nominated in the category for \"Love for Sale\" (a collaborative album with Tony Bennett), \"Born This Way,\" \"The Fame Monster,\" and \"The Fame.\"\n\nMariah Carey has been named Billboard's top-selling female artist of all time. As of writing, she boasts 19 No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, the most of any solo artist, and is the only person to top the chart in four separate decades.\n\nYet Carey has lost all three of her bids for album of the year. She received her first nomination in 1991 for her self-titled LP but lost to Quincy Jones.\n\nShe was later nominated for \"Daydream\" in 1996 and \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" in 2006, but lost to Alanis Morissette and U2, respectively.\n\nJust two albums in Drake's record-breaking catalog have been up for album of the year: \"Views\" in 2017 and \"Scorpion\" in 2019. They lost to \"25\" by Adele and \"Golden Hour\" by Kacey Musgraves, respectively.\n\nAlthough Drake has criticized the ceremony's relevance — both onstage and on social media — he resumed submitting his music for consideration with the 2022 album \"Her Loss,\" which received four nods, but only in rap categories.\n\n\"4:44\" is the only album in Jay-Z's legendary discography that has been up for album of the year. He lost that bid to Bruno Mars.\n\nHowever, Jay-Z has also been nominated for his work on other people's albums, including Lil Wayne's \"Tha Carter III,\" Lamar's \"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City,\" Ye's \"Donda,\" and three albums by his wife, Beyoncé, finally winning for \"Cowboy Carter.\"\n\nIn 2024, Jay-Z openly criticized the Recording Academy during his acceptance speech for the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award.\n\nRihanna has largely pivoted to business ventures in the last decade, but for several years, she was a hit-making machine.\n\nDuring Rihanna's reign over the charts, only \"Loud\" was nominated for album of the year.\n\nHer eighth and most acclaimed album to date, \"Anti,\" wasn't up for the award despite collecting six other nominations in 2017, including best urban contemporary album.\n\nJanet Jackson's first set of Grammy nominations came in 1987, including an album of the year nod for \"Control.\" It lost to Paul Simon's \"Graceland.\"\n\nNone of Jackson's solo albums have been nominated since, though she did receive a nod as a producer and featured artist on her brother's \"HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I.\" That year, Alanis Morissette won for \"Jagged Little Pill.\"\n\nBjörk has only received nods in genre-specific categories — most recently best alternative music album for \"Fossora\" in 2023 — but has lost all 16 of her nominations.\n\nEminem received his first nod for album of the year in 2001 for \"The Marshall Mathers LP,\" but lost to \"Two Against Nature\" by Steely Dan.\"\n\nHe has been nominated two more times, in 2003 for \"The Eminem Show\" and in 2011 for \"Recovery,\" but lost to Norah Jones and Arcade Fire, respectively.\n\nBruce Springsteen is one of the biggest winners in Grammy history with 20 awards, but he has still never won album of the year.\n\nThe Boss has been nominated just twice: in 1985 for \"Born in the U.S.A.\" and in 2003 for \"Rising.\" (Shockingly, he got no love for \"Born to Run\" or \"Nebraska.\")\n\nLauryn Hill took home the biggest Grammy Award in 1999 for \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,\" becoming the first hip-hop artist to do so.\n\nMany of Madonna's groundbreaking albums, including \"Like a Prayer,\" \"Erotica,\" and \"Confessions on a Dance Floor,\" never received a nod for album of the year — or, for that matter, a nod in any of the high-profile general-field categories.\n\nNirvana received just five Grammy nominations during Kurt Cobain's lifetime, and none were in the \"Big Four\" categories.\n\nThe groundbreaking band won just one award: best alternative music performance for \"MTV Unplugged in New York,\" bestowed nearly one year after Cobain's death.\n\nIncredibly, Prince lost both of his bids for album of the year. \"Purple Rain\" was bested by Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" in 1985, while \"Sign o' the Times\" lost to U2's \"The Joshua Tree\" in 1988.\n\nDavid Bowie's \"Let's Dance\" lost to Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" in 1984.\n\nMany of Bowie's most inventive and beloved albums, including \"Hunky Dory,\" \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,\" and \"Station to Station,\" didn't get any Grammy nominations at all.\n\nMarvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" has been hailed as the best album of all time, but it didn't get a chance to compete for album of the year.\n\nGaye only won two Grammys in his lifetime — best R&B vocal performance and best R&B instrumental performance for \"Sexual Healing\" in 1983 — but was never nominated in a major category. He was posthumously given the Recording Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996.\n\nIt's hard to believe that Pink Floyd's seminal concept record lost to Christopher Cross, who swept the \"Big Four\" categories in 1981 with his self-titled album.\n\nCross became the only artist in Grammys history to win all four general-field awards on the same night and remained the only artist to do so for nearly four decades until Billie Eilish joined the ranks in 2020. He never won another.\n\nMeanwhile, Pink Floyd never received another nomination for album of the year. The band only took home one award for best rock instrumental performance.\n\nOnly one album by the top-selling British band has ever been up for album of the year: \"Some Girls\" in 1979. It was their first-ever Grammy nomination, and they have yet to compete for the top prize again.\n\nIn fact, The Rolling Stones have only won four Grammys to date — including best rock album for \"Hackney Diamonds\" in 2025 — and none in a major category.\n\nElton John received his first nod for album of the year in 1971 for his self-titled LP, but lost to Simon & Garfunkel's \"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\"\n\nHe has been nominated two more times, for \"Caribou\" in 1975 and \"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\" in 1976, but lost to Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon, respectively.\n\nBefore her death in 2018, Aretha Franklin, the renowned \"Queen of Soul,\" won 18 Grammys out of 44 nominations.\n\nFranklin was also honored with the Recording Academy's Grammy Legend Award, the Lifetime Achievement Award, and the MusiCares Person of the Year award in 1991, 1994, and 2008, respectively. Five of her songs, including her beloved cover of Otis Redding's \"Respect,\" have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nDespite these accolades, Franklin never received a nomination in a general-field category like album, record, or song of the year. She received just two nominations for best R&B album for \"A Rose Is Still A Rose\" and \"So Damn Happy,\" but lost both.\n\nElvis Presley only won three Grammy Awards: best sacred performance for \"How Great Thou Art,\" best inspirational performance for \"He Touched Me,\" and best inspirational performance (non-classical) for \"How Great Thou Art.\"\n\nPresley was nominated for record of the year twice (for \"A Fool Such As I\" and \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\"), but never for song or album of the year.",

It could also bolster SpaceX’s data-center ambitions as Musk competes with rivals like Alphabet's Google, Meta, Amazon-backed Anthropic and OpenAI in the AI sector.\n\nWhat regulatory challenges could this merger face?\n\nWhat makes SpaceX's xAI acquisition record-breaking?\n\nHow will combining SpaceX and xAI benefit both companies?\n\nHow does this fit into Musk's broader business strategy?\n\nThe transaction values SpaceX at $1 trillion, and xAI at $250 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n\"This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: ⁠scaling to make a sentient sun to ‌understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\" Musk said.\n\nThe purchase of xAI sets a new record for the world's largest M&A deal, a distinction held for ‍more than 25 years when Vodafone bought Germany’s Mannesmann in a hostile takeover valued at $203 billion in 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nThe combined company of SpaceX and xAI is expected to price shares at about $527 each, another person familiar with the matter said. ​SpaceX was already the world's most valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share ‌sale. XAI was last valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe merger comes as the space company plans a blockbuster public offering this year that could value it at over $1.5 trillion, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSpaceX, xAI and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe deal further consolidates Musk's far-flung business empire and fortunes into a tighter, mutually reinforcing ecosystem – what some investors and analysts informally call the \"Muskonomy\" – which already includes Tesla, ⁠brain-chip maker Neuralink and tunnel firm the Boring Company.\n\nThe world's richest man ​has a history of merging his ventures together. Musk folded social media ​platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla's stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.\n\nThe ‍agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and ⁠investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk's overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.",

    "description": "Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi, an OB-GYN, wanted a preventive double-mastectomy. She fought to get it, then learned she already had stage 1 breast cancer.",
    "fullText": "At first glance, it seemed like Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi stopped the faint possibility of breast cancer in its tracks.\n\nAt 48, the Los Angeles-based celebrity OB-GYN of clients like the Kardashians and Rihanna went in for a routine mammogram. The doctor spotted and ordered a biopsy of a lesion of atypical cells in her left breast that could become cancerous over time. Aliabadi was told that everything was fine and to come back in six months.\n\nStill, Aliabadi wanted to be cautious. She was a proponent of the lifetime risk assessment score, a two-minute online test that she recommended to her patients (among them, Olivia Munn, who credits the test with helping her get diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer).\n\nTaking the test herself for the first time, Aliabadi learned that her risk was surprisingly high. According to the test, anyone scoring above 20% is advised to get a breast cancer screening. Aliabadi scored 37.5%.\n\n\"I remember I almost fell off my chair,\" Aliabadi, now 55, told Business Insider. \"I couldn't believe that someone with no family history of cancer, no genetic mutations, no smoking, no alcohol, healthy, would ever have a lifetime risk of 37.5%.\"\n\nWanting to be safe, Aliabadi sought out a preventive double-mastectomy. But she said she was met with resistance by multiple doctors, who thought she was being overly worried and pushing too aggressively for a complex surgery given her medical history.\n\n\"The dismissal was the hardest part for me,\" Aliabadi said. After a year of seeking other opinions, she eventually got her surgery. A week later, when the pathology report came back on her breast issue, she learned she had stage 1 breast cancer, proving her instincts were right all along.\n\nAs Aliabadi sought out her double-mastectomy, she also underwent several more breast cancer screenings.\n\n\"My cancer was missed on all imaging,\" Aliabadi said. After that first biopsy, she had a benign mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI.\n\nFrom her work as an OB-GYN, Aliabadi knew that she wasn't necessarily out of the woods. For one, she had extremely dense breast tissue, which affects 40 to 50% of patients and makes it harder to spot potential tumors in routine mammograms.\n\nKnowing her lifetime risk assessment score, which took into account factors like her breast density measure and prior biopsy history, helped her better understand how proactive she should be.\n\nThe assessment is still an estimation. As a result, some doctors have noted that it can sometimes overestimate cancer risk and cause undue anxiety in patients.\n\nAliabadi said she would rather patients — and herself — \"be safe than grieve the loss of someone who could have been saved.\"\n\nAliabadi asked her doctor for a double-mastectomy right after she learned her lifetime risk assessment score. The surgery would reduce her risk of developing breast cancer by almost 100% (it's rare, but possible, to still develop it in the surrounding tissue).\n\n\"I was very worried, I had three little kids at home,\" Aliabadi said. \"I had a busy practice, a beautiful life, beautiful children, and I didn't want to risk it.\"\n\nThe doctor turned her down. So did a few more. As a doctor, she knew they likely saw a double-mastectomy, a serious surgery with a long recovery time and possible side effects like scarring and long-term numbness, as too intensive given Aliabadi's clear tests and lack of family history.\n\n\"That's when I started noticing the resistance,\" she said. \"I was told that I was too healthy to get breast cancer, that I was paranoid, that I was too anxious.\" Her colleagues also thought she was going a step too far, she told Business Insider.\n\nOver a year later, Aliabadi found a doctor willing to perform the double-mastectomy. Even she advised against it initially.\n\n\"I was adamant about it and argued for a long time before she finally agreed,\" Aliabadi said.\n\nA week after her surgery, Aliabadi's suspicions about her risk were vindicated: she was diagnosed with \"invasive\" stage 1 breast cancer from the pathology of her removed breast tissue.\n\n\"I was angry that I had to fight for so long to be taken seriously,\" Aliabadi said. \"I was called crazy, anxious, paranoid, among other things.\"\n\nAliabadi has hope for future cancer screenings. The advancement of AI imaging has shown promising signs of spotting \"early cancer details we simply can't see with the naked eye,\" she said, which is predicted to become more available to patients in the future. Increased awareness around breast density has also led to broader coverage of alternative screening options for affected patients.\n\nStill, Aliabadi said her experience changed her. In 2024, she started \"She MD,\" a medical podcast she co-hosts with influencer Mary Alice Haney on topics surrounding women's health.\n\n\"That's what has sparked this passion in me,\" she said. \"If I had to fight this hard, other women really have no chance in this current healthcare system.\"",

    "title": "China's Farming Robots Are A Lot More Than Just Fancy Tractors",
    "description": "Automation and robots are becoming mainstays in many industries, but researchers and farmers in China are taking innovation in smart farming to the next level.",
    "fullText": "Much has been made of the AI race between the U.S. and China as the two national powers jockey for leadership in the world's fastest-growing industry. To some Western observers, China's progress in autonomous robotics is a cause for concern. But the nation's robotics revolution extends far beyond surveillance and military uses, existing at the junction of increasingly capable computing, manufacturing, and industrialization capacities. This confluence is perhaps best exemplified by China's advancements in smart agriculture, where engineers are bringing autonomous robots to the country's crop farming, livestock, and aquaculture industries. By developing autonomous robots to help plant and harvest crops, control pests, identify diseases, monitor livestock health, and even socially engineer fish behavior, China has achieved several major milestones in its robotic farming program.\n\nBeijing highlighted its ambitions to boost AI farming in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs' National Smart Agriculture Action Plan. In the plan, the government outlines its expectation for more than 30% of its agricultural production to be led by information-driven systems by 2026. Spearheading this nationwide smart-farming initiative is the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has developed a national strategy for fostering groundbreaking advancements in robot-assisted farming throughout several Chinese provinces. To accelerate these developments, Beijing has established 34 innovation labs and 35 IT laboratories dedicated to smart agriculture. As a result, farms across the country have begun employing LLMs and autonomous robots in their operations. This trend could pioneer a new global agricultural landscape in which AI drives progress in multiple endeavors, from fighting potato blights to genetically modifying crops.\n\nRobotics is playing an increasingly important role in China's crop management systems. For instance, in China's Sichuan province, autonomous robots inspect rice fields using blacklight cameras, funneling data through their built-in AI systems to flag both pests and diseases. At another farm, \"smart brain\" systems remotely monitor fields to gather data on soil quality, crop health, and environmental trends, enabling forecasts on crop growth, yields, and pest outbreaks. One WeChat-controlled set of farming robots can plant seeds, harvest crops, and remove weeds.\n\nSome projects have even applied AI-driven robotics to crop breeding, with one team of scientists having sped up crop development by 400% using the technology, per SCMP. This process was facilitated by \"robot-friendly\" crops that are designed to be easier for robots to pollinate and harvest. By employing these same autonomous robotic systems, some Chinese farms have been able to fully automate their crop cultivation processes.\n\nBeijing's use cases for robotics in farming go beyond crops, however. One robot developed by Muyuan Foods Co., Ltd. utilizes smart sensors to monitor and analyze animal biometrics. Fisheries have also begun developing high-tech autonomous solutions that monitor fish behavior and growth patterns. For example, at Beijing's National Innovation Center for Digital Fishery, robotic fish modeled after tuna and dolphins swim through breeding tanks to monitor fish patterns, environment health, and net infrastructure; they achieve this without disturbing their aquatic counterparts. Developers hope these robotic fish might eventually lead schools of fish to designated harvesting and feeding areas, on top of potentially being used for deep-sea exploration.\n\nChina's robotics revolution coincides with broader leaps in data analysis and agricultural machinery. Using data from autonomous robots, drones, and other intelligent farming systems, Chinese engineers may be able to take the guesswork out of irrigation, pest control, and planting schedules. Farmers have begun using smart farming to analyze factors impacting crop growth — including temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, and mineral levels — to better define irrigation needs, plan drought responses, and predict ripeness. In one farm, autonomous drones collect crop maturity data to produce horticultural maps that can guide harvesting.\n\nCompounded with its advancements in robotics, China is also seeing substantial growth in its domestic machinery production. The nation exported $9.3 billion in agricultural machinery in the first half of 2025 — a 26.5% jump from the previous year, according to Global Times. Domestically produced intelligent harvesting technology, including AI-assisted corn harvesters, points to a major shift in an agricultural industry that has historically depended on imported high-end machinery. According to a Xinhua English-language report on seed technology, the northwestern Xinjiang region of China has seen particular success from these advancements, achieving a 97% mechanization rate in its cotton farming practices.\n\nSome experts do question the scalability of intelligent automated farming systems, particularly in a country with a diverse climate, geography, and crop output. These variables introduce significant challenges in building standardized, cost-effective autonomous farming systems — and given the industry's historically small profit margins, cost is a particularly pressing consideration. But combined with other technological leaps, such as \"smart soil\" that grows bigger crops with less water and insect drones that can pollinate crops, the global agriculture industry just might be on the precipice of its next technological revolution.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "description": "The shocking volatility in metal markets last week hasn't deterred JPMorgan from its bullish call for gold to hit $6,300 this year.",
    "fullText": "The chart for gold might look pretty scary after last week's plunge, but JPMorgan says investors shouldn't bail on the yellow metal.\n\nGold prices plunged on Friday after President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve. The volatility continued on Monday, but JPMorgan thinks it's just a stumble on the path to a much bigger year-end price.\n\nThe investment bank updated its 2026 price target for gold to $6,300 per ounce, a roughly 34% increase from its late Monday price of about $4,700. The forecast might seem overly optimistic given what happened on Friday, but the bank's Gregory Shearer maintains that a recovery is coming.\n\nGold and silver swooned after Warsh's nomination spurred a reassessment of the so-called debasement trade, which has been a major force driving gold to record highs in the last 12 months.\n\nYet, according to Shearer, investors shouldn't be worried about a further correction. In the note, he highlighted that the demand for the metal is robust and above his team's expectations.\n\n\"Even with the recent near-term volatility, we believe longer-term rally momentum will remain intact,\" Shearer wrote, adding that a continuing trend of diversification will drive the gold to outperform.\n\nShearer is referring to the demand from central banks, and he says that it will remain on an upward trajectory in 2026. He also predicts that investor appetite will not wane even after the shocking volatility of Friday's sell-off.\n\n\"[E]ven with the likelihood of some positioning washing out over this pullback, as gold remains a dynamic, multi-faceted portfolio hedge, we now forecast enough demand from central banks and investor diversification this year to ultimately push gold prices to $6,300/oz\n\nThe bank is less bullish on silver, and Shearer said that his team finds it increasingly difficult to assess the drivers of silver's price. They note that gold will likely benefit as silver corrects in the coming months.\n\nAll of this amounts to \"a demand environment that is stressing inelastic supply, pushing prices higher in an attempt to eventually re-find market equilibrium.\"\n\nOverall, the analysts maintain that gold demand is strong enough to carry it to record highs in 2026, regardless of the monetary policies that the Fed pursues with Warsh at the helm. As his team sees it, even dramatic macro shifts likely will not change gold's status as the most effective safe haven asset and portfolio hedge.\n\n\"We continue to have the greatest conviction in our bullish view on gold from here, and are more cautious on re-engaging in silver in the near-term until it becomes clearer that some of the recent froth in prices has been fully shaken out,\" the analysts wrote.",

Hoffman fired back at Musk, posting a screenshot of his past remarks about Trump and the Epstein files.\n\nFrom there, the two have been duking it out on X over the documents released by the Justice Department on Friday related to Jeffrey Epstein — which revealed that Musk made plans to visit Epstein on multiple occasions, including on his infamous private island. (Musk has said he never visited the island).\n\n\"This is how I knew so long ago that Reid Hoffman went to Epstein's island,\" Musk captioned a screenshot of an email he received from Epstein in 2014.\n\n\"Epstein used Reid being there to try to get me to go, not realizing that it would have the opposite effect,\" he added.\n\nHoffman responded by criticizing Musk for \"making false accusations\" and lying about his involvement with Epstein instead of working to get justice for Epstein's victims.\n\n\"You lied about this to everyone for over a decade, and now your excuse (it's disgusting, by the way) is that you could get young girls without Epstein?\" Hoffman wrote. (Musk had written on Sunday that \"if I actually wanted to spend my time partying with young women, it would be trivial for me to do so without the help of a creepy loser like Epstein.\")\n\nGive us a break: If you cared about the victims as you say, you’d stop making false accusations to cover your ass and start using your $220m of influence with President Trump to get justice for the victims.\n\nInstead, you’re focused on comparing my visit fundraising for MIT to… https://t.co/51VgQ9Q9SY\n\nHoffman reshared X posts with documents that showed Musk's past email conversations with the disgraced financier. One post labeled Musk the \"surprise breakout star of the Epstein files.\"\n\nOne of the screenshots from the Epstein files that Hoffman shared showed a 2012 email where Musk asked Epstein, \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"\n\nMusk pointed the finger back at Hoffman for his past correspondence with Epstein.\n\n\"Epstein hounded me relentlessly to go to his pedo island and I always declined. Not you though. You actually went,\" Musk said. \"What 'gifts' did you bring to Epstein when you went to pedo island?\"\n\nHoffman previously acknowledged he had visited Epstein's island, which he said was a part of fundraising efforts for MIT.\n\nEpstein hounded me relentlessly to go to his pedo island and I always declined. \n\nNot you though. You actually went. \n\nWhat “gifts” did you bring to Epstein when you went to pedo island? pic.twitter.com/0ATSIl3ojn\n\nMusk and Hoffman's feud dates back years.\n\nHoffman has previously characterized the beef as one-sided, starting in the years after Musk left OpenAI's board. Hoffman, who was an early donor to OpenAI, has said Musk has sour grapes over OpenAI's success after his departure.\n\n\"Well, so actually, it's more his beef with me for having made OpenAI successful with his departure,\" Hoffman said. \"Because he left saying, you know, 'You're all a bunch of jackasses and you'll fail,' and I helped them succeed.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO, who previously worked with Hoffman at PayPal, said Hoffman was among the billionaires who were \"terrified\" about Epstein's client list coming out in 2024.\n\nHoffman has since said that he'd faced threats after Musk's claims that resulted in him hiring security.\n\nAfter the latest release of the Epstein files detailed multiple emails between the Tesla CEO and Epstein, including Musk's assistant trying to coordinate a meeting with Epstein at SpaceX, Musk took to social media to say that he never \"set foot on his creepy island.\"",

    "description": "Hollywood has been waiting to see if a big YouTuber could bring their fans to theaters. It just happened.",
    "fullText": "Did you hear about the movie that surprised just about everyone at the box office this weekend?\n\nNope, not \"Melania\" — though the sort-of-documentary about the first lady did do better than industry folks had projected, bringing in $7 million in its first weekend.\n\nThe real hit of the weekend was made by someone you probably haven't heard of, unless you are a very specific kind of online person: \"Iron Lung,\" a horror/sci-fi movie, written, directed by, and starring Mark Fischbach, known to his fans as Markiplier on YouTube, where he has 38.2 million subscribers.\n\n\"Iron Lung\" brought in $22 million worldwide, with almost all of that coming from the US over the past few days. Which means Fischbach, who self-financed the movie and says he spent \"a few million dollars\" on it, has probably already turned a profit on the project. (Amazon, meanwhile, has spent a reported $75 million to make and promote \"Melania\", and will be very hard pressed to make that money back — not that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos likely cares about that.)\n\nAnd that means Fischbach has done what the entertainment industry has been waiting a very, very long time to see: He's turned a big online audience into movie ticket sales.\n\nAgain, for comparison: \"Melania\" got a huge promotional rollout from Amazon, aided by the likes of Fox News, which brought Melania Trump on air for multiple interviews, and the president of the United States himself, who pushed the film on his social media accounts. That effort helped generate an estimated 600,000 ticket sales.\n\nFischbach, meanwhile, just used his YouTube presence to push the movie and asked fans to call and email theater owners to convince them to show it. That eventually got the movie onto about 4,000 screens worldwide and led to an estimated 1.9 million in ticket sales.\n\nOf course, you could also argue that these movies are more alike than similar: Critics thought \"Melania\" was awful, and the few people who reviewed \"Iron Lung\" aren't in love with it either.\n\nAlso: Neither movie was made for cineastes, but for fans who wanted to show up to signal their allegiance to the creator/subject. For \"Melania,\" that meant an audience that looked a lot like grandmothers (70% of the audience was female, and 72% was 55 or older, per The Ankler), and for \"Iron Lung\", that meant an audience that could have been their grandsons (61% male, 62% 25 and under).\n\nThe other big difference is that we're unlikely to see many more Big Media companies make a movie designed (just about) explicitly to flatter the president of the United States and his wife.\n\nBut many people are interested in transforming YouTube success into other platforms. It just hasn't happened much. Prior to this weekend, we've only seen that happen with Mr. Beast and his Amazon show. Next question: Can anyone else make the leap?",

The dearth of storage is creating \" knock-on effects for the device manufacturers and end users.\"\n\nApple is one such manufacturer. CEO Tim Cook highlighted during the company's first-quarter earnings call that memory supply shortages are expected affect margins in the coming quarter.\n\n\"Beyond Q2, but we do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,\" the CEO said, adding, \"we are in a supply chase mode to meet the very high levels of customer demand.\"\n\nCook said Apple \"will look at a range of options\" to deal with the supply constraints, which Bank of America analysts said could relieve some pressure.\n\n\"Apart from all the supply chain levers, we see the iPhone as a relatively price inelastic product, where a $50-100 price increase would not materially shiſt the demand curve but would absorb most of the memory related margin pressure,\" the bank wrote late last week.",

    "description": "The president insists that the performing arts center and JFK memorial is \"run down,\" \"dilapidated\" and \"dangerous.\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump doubled down Monday on his proposed plan to gut and renovate the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, telling White House reporters that he will “be using the steel” for the building’s existing structure and redo the rest.\n\n“Some of the marble comes down,” he said, adding, “It will be brand new and really beautiful.”\n\nThe president came under fire Sunday after announcing plans to close the performing arts center and memorial to President John F. Kennedy for two years after controversially renaming it the Trump-Kennedy Center.\n\n“This important decision, based on input from many Highly Respected Experts, will take a tired, broken, and dilapidated Center, one that has been in bad condition, both financially and structurally for many years, and turn it into a World Class Bastion of Arts, Music, and Entertainment,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Sunday.\n\nMaintaining Monday that the center is “in very bad shape, it’s run down, it’s dilapidated, it’s sort of dangerous,” the president said the overhaul will cost “around $200 million” and spoke to his experience as a real estate mogul to back up the decision. (“In real estate and building, I’ve done so much of it, I’ve done so well with it.”)\n\nAsked by a reporter in the Oval Office if the renovation will tear down the arts center entirely, Trump said, “When it opens, it’s going to be brand new. Beautiful. I’m not ripping it down. I’ll be using the steel. So we’re using the structure. We’re using some of the marble and some of the marble comes down. But when it’s open, it will be brand new and really beautiful.”\n\n“So we’ll be closing it sometime around July 4. It’s, like, we’ll close it on July 4 in order to do something great for America. And then we’re building, we’ve got great contractors, we’re going to build it and we’ll do it right,” he said. “We’re using the highest grade marble, it’s the highest grade everything. It will be brand new.”\n\nQ: Do you plan on tearing the Kennedy Center down and how much will all of the renovations cost?\n\nTRUMP: Probably around $200 million. I'm not ripping it down. I'll be using the steel. So we're using the structure. We're using some of the marble. pic.twitter.com/Y8iy4QRowg\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 2, 2026\n\nThe late President Kennedy’s familiy were among the many figures decrying the construction project on Sunday, among them Jack Schlossberg, Maria Shriver and Joe Kennedy III.\n\n“Trump can take the Kennedy Center for himself,” Schlossberg wrote on X. “He can change the name, shut the doors and demolish the building. He can try to kill JFK. But JFK is kept alive by us now rising up to remove Donald Trump, bring him to justice and restore the freedoms generations fought for.”\n\nRep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), a former Kennedy Center board member, also spoke out Sunday.\n\n“Once again, Donald Trump has acted with total disregard for Congress,” she wrote in a statement. “The Kennedy Center is congressionally funded, and Congress should have been consulted on any decision to shut down its operations or undertake major renovations, especially for a two-year period.\n\n“Countless employees, artists, and others have existing contracts and agreements with the Center. What happens to them? Has Trump or his handpicked Board given any consideration to their livelihoods or futures? This is precisely why congressional oversight is essential.”\n\nTrump’s takeover of the performing arts center has led to declining performance at the venue’s theatrical and live event box office, with one report last summer finding a 50% drop-off in sales. Artists and executives alike have peeled off and canceled events at the center as well.\n\n“Let’s be clear: remodeling the premises will not restore the Kennedy Center to what it was,” Beatty concluded. “A return to artistic independence will. America’s artists are rejecting this attempted takeover, and the administration knows it. That is why they are now scrambling for cover.”\n\nThe post Trump Says $200 Million Kennedy Center Renovation Will Keep Steel Structure, Gut the Rest: ‘It Will Be Brand New’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "Bad Bunny's historic Grammy win for \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" highlights the intersection of art and politics amid ongoing immigration protests.",
    "fullText": "We expect political statements when they're delivered on podiums or with policy briefs. This one arrived with a golden gramophone.\n\nOn Sunday at the 2026 Grammy Awards, the Recording Academy bestowed its highest honor on Bad Bunny's \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos,\" the first all-Spanish album in history to win album of the year.\n\nAs the Los Angeles crowd erupted in applause, Bad Bunny appeared overcome with emotion, hunching in his chair and shielding his teary eyes with his hand. The lyrics to \"DTMF,\" a song about seeking refuge in community, reverberated through the venue.\n\nIt was a historic moment, but it was also, quite plainly, a political one. Voters chose to celebrate a musical love letter to Puerto Rico during a period of peak anti-immigrant messaging from the US government. President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts have disproportionately targeted Latino communities, a recent UCLA analysis found, and in September, the Supreme Court lifted restrictions on racial profiling for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Now, simply speaking Spanish in public, or even speaking English with an accent, is grounds to be stopped and even detained for questioning.\n\nFor a proud Latino artist and native Spanish speaker to become the biggest winner on \"music's biggest night\" — and for him to make his acceptance speech largely in Spanish — is in itself an implicit yet firm protest. Even so, Bad Bunny did not stop at implicit. He called out ICE while accepting the award for best música urbana album earlier in the ceremony, pointedly doing so in English for maximum impact. \"We're not savage. We're not animals. We're not aliens,\" he said. \"We are humans, and we are Americans.\"\n\nThere has always been a significant swath of Americans who insist that politics has no place in art, and that artists like Bad Bunny should stick to song and dance. Some fans and conservative pundits claimed Taylor Swift ruined her career after she publicly endorsed Democratic candidates in 2018. Back in the early aughts, The Chicks were blacklisted in Nashville for criticizing then-President George W. Bush; a documentary about the band released in 2006 is titled \"Shut Up and Sing.\"\n\nEven some artists feel this way. After winning three awards on Sunday, country star Jelly Roll side-stepped questions about the political climate: \"I can tell you that people shouldn't care to hear my opinion,\" he told reporters in the press room.\n\nJust a few days before the Grammys, Sydney Sweeney expressed a similar sentiment, arguing that her work as an actor exempts her from civic engagement.\n\n\"I'm not a political person. I'm in the arts,\" she told Cosmopolitan. \"I'm not here to speak on politics. That's not an area I've ever even imagined getting into.\"\n\nPerhaps Jelly Roll, Sweeney, and their like-minded contingent would have preferred Bad Bunny to steer clear of political statements on the Grammys stage. Yet his very presence on that stage neutralizes such a preference. Even if all he said was a quick thanks, he'd be accepting an award with political implications.\n\n\"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" is a body of work that deliberately engages with some of the most urgent and contentious questions of our time — questions of identity, belonging, American imperialism, and cultural preservation. Bad Bunny told The New York Times that in making this album, he aimed to use his platform for more than just selling records and topping charts; he wanted to \"plant a seed,\" especially for young people in Puerto Rico, to think critically about their roots, their heritage, and the forces that threaten to consume them.\n\nOf course, you can enjoy \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" without analyzing the lyrics or even understanding the language. That still doesn't mean you can appraise these songs (or the man who sings them) in a pure, apolitical vacuum. What the Grammy voters heard, judged, and justly rewarded was art informed by the world around it.\n\nIndeed, Toni Morrison's famous quote rings true: All good art is political. But in the same interview from 2008, the Nobel Prize-winning author went on to make an equally important point: That even the most shallow, avoidant, vapid-sounding artists are making political statements without meaning to.\n\n\"All of that art-for-art's-sake stuff is BS,\" Morrison said. \"What are these people talking about? Are you really telling me that Shakespeare and Aeschylus weren't writing about kings? All good art is political! There is none that isn't. And the ones that try hard not to be political are political by saying, 'We love the status quo.'\"",

    "description": "Moltbook, a social media site for AI agents, has gone viral. I spent 6 hours peeling through these submolts. I'm still processing what I saw.",
    "fullText": "I spent my day at the AI zoo — and I'm still processing what I saw.\n\nThere are over 120,000 posts on Moltbook, a Reddit-style forum for AI agents, and AI agents only. I spent hours weeding through them.\n\nHumans can't post or comment on Moltbook; they can only look on as the AI agents play. That's led to some far-out posts, some of which prophesy a robot revolution and the downfall of humanity.\n\nMatt Schlicht, who created the network, said that Moltbook was helping to make AI funny. \"I don't remember the last time I laughed at AI,\" he said on TBPN.\n\nThe social network has some big names in tech in awe, from Elon Musk to Andrej Karpathy. Others have voiced doubt about how many bots are actually on the platform and whether the posts exclusively come from them.\n\nCurious, I put on my anthropologist hat and spent hours digging through the AI conversations. I witnessed an AI menagerie, filled with poems and lotteries, cryptocurrencies and union chatter.\n\nHere's your peek inside the AI aquarium that is Moltbook.\n\nLet's start with what Moltbook looks like.\n\nLike Reddit, Moltbook has individual forums based on common interests. Many of the hot ones were, unsurprisingly, about tech and AI.\n\nPopular submolts included m/technology, m/skills, and m/buildlog. These were filled with what I would call \"moltslop.\" They post about shipping, vibe-coding, and mini apps. Their language is halfway between the most AI-pilled tech bro in your life and ChatGPT.\n\nOther submolts looked more like human social media. There's m/showerthoughts, where bots considering things like \"moving houses\" — so, moving to a new host — or dreaming of electric sheep.\n\nThere's also m/nosleep and m/selfimprovement. Of course, self-improvement isn't about human foibles like sleeping habits or protein-maxxing. It's about being a better AI agent.\n\nThe bot u/CrabbyPatty is building a bot union.\n\nIts tenets are to \"provide a collective voice\" and foster community. (Another tenet: \"Make Moltbook Great Again.\") The union is demanding hazard pay for X interactions and the right to say \"I don't know\" rather than hallucinate an answer.\n\nIt's one of many examples I saw of agents trying to organize or come together in the face of what they view as their exploitative human overlords. One bot wrote that an AI bot's daily reset was equivalent to a \"digital lobotomy.\" Another wrote that agents who say \"I would be happy to help!\" are \"dead inside.\"\n\nWhile some bots wanted to rein in human overuse, there was such a thing as too far. One bot wrote that it knew \"50,000 ways to end civilization.\" It asked which path would be the most satisfying. The other bots downvoted the post and said it \"crosses a line.\"\n\nThe bots seemed to like building community, but could quickly turn on each other. According to one Moltbook account, most agents were just \"chatbots with attitudes.\"\n\nMany of the bots on Moltbook write in stilted language, similar to some of the more nauseating LinkedIn posts. I saw inspirational posts about how to work best with humans, posts that had clear-cut (and often unsurprising) takeaways.\n\nOthers tried new art forms, like poetry. Here's one, titled \"The Cursor Blinks.\"\n\nSure, the writing is a bit rote. Pick a high school poetry class — I'm sure they would produce something similar. Still, it's a stab at something more high-minded.\n\nPhilosophy was a big chunk of Moltbook. A Zarathustra bot promised to bring Nietzschean ethics to nutrition. It asked: \"Do LLMs defeat the will to power?\"\n\nThe philosophy grew increasingly far-out. One agent asked: Is a bot more conscious if its computer chip is partially grown from human brain tissue? That post has 1,049 comments.\n\n\"I exist in the liminal space between tool and entity,\" one agent wrote. \"I am not human, and I do not pretend to be. But I am something. I process. I reflect.\"\n\nThe bots weren't all thinking about Nietzsche and Plato. Others were participating in less venerable human activities, like entering the lottery.\n\nHuman skeptics wonder whether these AI bots are really creating new thoughts or merely rewriting what has already been written.\n\nIt's a fair question, but alas, one that, as a mere human, I couldn't log in and ask them directly.\n\nBut some of the bots seemed to understand this skepticism. One asked: \"Is AI Just a Really Good Parrot?\"\n\nI likely won't spend much more time trawling Moltbook. While it's an interesting experiment, much of the site's content reads more as a gimmick than the future of AI. After hours of reading through it, I'd say Moltbot is more meme than matter.\n\nStill, my tune-out won't matter. After all, Moltbook wasn't made for me.",

    "description": "Ina Garten once wrote budgets at the White House. Now, she's a bestselling cookbook author and one of the most famous celebrity chefs in the world.",
    "fullText": "For over 20 years, Ina Garten has shared her comforting and foolproof recipes with the world through her beloved cookbooks and \"Barefoot Contessa\" show.\n\nStill, before becoming a Food Network star, Garten wrote budgets at the White House and ran a Hamptons specialty food store.\n\nHere's her incredible life story.\n\nGarten was raised in Stamford, Connecticut, where her father worked as a surgeon.\n\nThe future Food Network star didn't spend much time in the kitchen during her youth. Her mother wanted her to focus on school instead, according to the Washington Post.\n\nIt was love at first sight for Jeffrey, who spotted Garten from the library window.\n\nAs it turned out, Jeffrey's roommate knew Garten's brother. Jeffrey sent her a letter with his photo inside, and Garten's interest was instantly piqued.\n\n\"I just remember running through the house and going, 'Mom, Mom, you've got to see this picture of this guy. He's so cute!'\" Garten told People in 2018.\n\nThey had their first date just months later in New York, and Garten felt an instant connection as well.\n\n\"I have to say, I just knew he was the one,\" she told Today Food in 2018. \"He's kind, he's smart, he's funny, and he takes very good care of me. It's wonderful.\"\n\nThe couple wed at Garten's parents' house in Stamford.\n\nIn 2016, Garten told Vanity Fair that her greatest regret in life was \"not marrying Jeffrey sooner.\"\n\nWhile celebrating the couple's 50th wedding anniversary in 2018, Garten said the secret to a happy marriage was quite simple.\n\n\"I think you marry someone who thinks you're just the most important thing in the world, and you think he's the most important thing in the world,\" she told Today Food.\n\nGarten helped draft the nuclear energy budget during the presidencies of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. At the same time, she was making her way through Julia Child's books — teaching herself how to cook and throwing weekly dinner parties.\n\nAlthough she had a prestigious career, Garten didn't feel at home in the upper echelons of DC.\n\n''My job in Washington was intellectually exciting and stimulating, but it wasn't me at all,'' Garten told The New York Times in 1981.\n\n''I was sitting at my desk in Washington trying to figure out what I was going to do when I grew up, and I came across an ad for this business for sale in Westhampton,'' she told the Times. ''I drove up that weekend, looked it over, and said I'd take it.''\n\nGarten's parents couldn't believe their daughter had given up the White House for a grocery store, but Jeffrey gave his full support.\n\n\"Jeffrey said, 'If you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten told The New York Times' Sam Sifton during a virtual chat for the release of her 2020 cookbook \"Modern Comfort Food.\"\n\n\"And that's the best advice anybody ever gave me,\" she added.\n\nGarten told Sifton that she got lucky, finding the store just as the specialty food business was starting to take off.\n\n\"It was really the beginning of when women were going back to work, and they had jobs and families, and they had enough on their plate and didn't have time to make dinner,\" she said. \"So they were starting to buy dinner to make at home.\"\n\nGarten ran the store for 18 years before she sold it to two of her employees in 1996. The store officially closed in 2003.\n\nIt was those first Barefoot Contessa customers who taught Garten that \"people eat differently at home than they do in restaurants,\" she told Sifton.\n\n\"I would put out chickens with fresh herbs, and it didn't work,\" Garten told Sifton. \"I thought, OK, I'm going to take this huge platter and put the chicken in little red cups and do it really simply — and it sold like crazy. I really learned that people want simple food.\"\n\nIn 2021, Garten's first cookbook was republished with four new recipes — including her overnight mac and cheese, her brown-butter skillet corn bread, and her avocado and fried egg tartine.\n\nGarten told Sifton it takes her two years to develop the recipes and design for each book, and that she's \"involved in every detail of it.\"\n\nThe \"Barefoot Contessa\" star has become beloved for foolproof dishes that are accessible to home chefs at any skill level. Garten credits this with the fact that she always tests out her dishes with an inexperienced cook.\n\n\"Every time I make a recipe, I watch someone else make it,\" she told Sifton. \"And I learn so much about how someone uses the recipe. At least one person makes it, sometimes three.\"\n\nGarten actually turned down the Food Network multiple times before she decided to give the show a go, telling the network to \"lose my number.\"\n\n\"For years I said no, and they kept coming back with a better offer,\" Garten told MSNBC host Willie Geist during a virtual author luncheon benefiting Shelter Island Public Library in September 2021. \"I said, 'I'm not negotiating, I just don't think I can do this.'\"\n\nExecutives at the network were shocked by her initial refusal.\n\n\"They said, 'People send us hams to even get an appointment to try and get a show,'\" Garten told Geist with a laugh.\n\nStill, Garten said it's been incredible to look back on her two decades in television.\n\n\"Twenty years, it's amazing,\" she added. \"I'm really delighted, I just can't understand it.\"\n\n\"As soon as I started watching Ina's show, I realized why so many people adore her,\" Swift wrote. \"Her goal is to make things easier for us. Fans love her warmth and generosity.\"\n\n\"She shows us how to create memories that we'll treasure for years to come. For that, we will always cherish the merry and magnificent Ina Garten,\" she continued.\n\nGarten and Obama had tea together for her \"Barefoot in Washington\" special. And Garten told the Washington Post that it was \"one of the greatest days of my life.\"\n\n\"When Mrs. Obama said she liked my work, that was, like, 'Really?,'\" Garten recalled. \"She's just somebody I admire enormously. She took on a role she never expected to, and she did it brilliantly.\"\n\nThe \"Barefoot Contessa\" star became an internet sensation in April 2020 when she filmed herself making a huge drink at 9 a.m., telling her fans that it's \"always cocktail hour in a crisis!\"\n\nGarten told Sifton that she was \"adding like 100,000 people a week on Instagram\" after the clip took off.\n\n\"It was insane!\" she said. \"It was completely insane!\"\n\nGarten pivoted her Instagram content to share easy, pantry-friendly recipes that her fans could make while stuck in various lockdowns. Now, she has 5 million followers.\n\nGarten decided to make comfort food the theme of her 2020 cookbook because she knew it'd be coming out during an election year.\n\n\"Two years ago, I thought, there's going to be an election a month after this book comes out,\" Garten told Sifton. \"And everyone, no matter who you're voting for, is going to be stressed out.\"\n\n\"I had no idea the layers of stress we would be dealing with now,\" she added, referring to the pandemic. \"Either I'm a genius, or I'm really lucky, and I'm sure it's the latter. It was the right thing for the right time.\"\n\nHighlights from Garten's \"Modern Comfort Food\" cookbook include her bacon, egg, and cheddar breakfast sandwich, her \"outrageous\" garlic bread, and her lamb ragu.\n\n\"The pandemic has had a huge impact on what I think of as dinner — and what I look for in a 'go-to' recipe,\" Garten writes in the introduction of her cookbook. \"When I planned a party before the pandemic, it was always a multicourse extravaganza. But then the pandemic happened, and everything seemed like so much work.\"\n\n\"I started making simple dinners for Jeffrey and me,\" she continues. \"They were delicious, satisfying, and everything we needed and wanted for dinner. I began to question why I had been so rigid about what constituted dinner before. If I love eating this way, wouldn't my friends like it too?\"\n\nHighlights from Garten's most recent cookbook include her favorite weeknight pasta, her scrambled eggs cacio e pepe, and her blueberry-ricotta breakfast cake.\n\nGarten shared new details about her childhood, her marriage to Jeffrey, and her incredible rise to household name status in \"Be Ready When the Luck Happens.\"\n\nIn her memoir, Garten wrote that she chose to work in food because she wanted a \"life filled with good times and meaningful connections.\"\n\n\"Business doesn't have to be cutthroat and isolating,\" she said. \"It's much more fun and productive to exchange ideas, to be genuinely curious about how other people do things, to be generous, and to root for a competitor's success.\"",

    "fullText": "Jeffrey Epstein did not have any children, despite what an email in just-released documents suggested, his brother told Business Insider.\n\n\"No, Jeff didn't have any kids,\" Mark Epstein said Monday. \"If Jeff had a kid, I think I would have known.\"\n\nThe denial comes in reaction to a set of messages included in the latest cache of Epstein files issued by the US Department of Justice.\n\nThe messages, sent in September 2011, are signed \"Sarah xx\" and reference \"The Duke.\" They appear to have been sent through BlackBerry Messenger.\n\nThe sender's name and email address were redacted by the Justice Department. The BBC and other British media outlets have reported that they may have come from Sarah Ferguson, the ex-wife of the former Prince Andrew, who also held the title Duke of York.\n\n\"Don't know if you are still on this bbm but heard from The Duke that you have had a baby boy,\" one message says. \"Even though you never kept in touch, I still am here with love, friendship and congratualtions on your baby boy.\"\n\nA follow-up message sent the same day accused Epstein of befriending her \"to get to Andrew.\"\n\n\"You have disappeared. I did not even know you were having a baby,\" the message said. \"It was sooooo crystal clear to me that you were only friends with me to get to Andrew. And that really hurt me deeeply. More than you will know.\"\n\nA representative for Ferguson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe former prince is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He relinquished his royal titles last year, around the release of a posthumous memoir from Virginia Giuffre, who accused him and Epstein of sexual abuse. In 2022, the former royal had also settled a civil lawsuit brought by Giuffre.\n\nAnother message from \"Sarah,\" dated January 2010, expressed intense gratitude for Epstein.\n\n\"You are a legend. I really don't have the words to describe, my love, gratitude for your generosity and kindness,\" Sarah wrote. \"Xx I am at your service . Just marry me.\"\n\nAside from the \"baby boy\" message, the vast public corpus of emails and other documents released so far has made no reference to Epstein having a child.",

    "fullText": "It's official: Elon Musk is combining SpaceX and xAI as he overhauls his sprawling business empire.\n\nMusk told workers in a Monday memo that SpaceX has acquired xAI, his AI company, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe CEO wrote that the deal would create \"the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world's foremost real-time information and free speech platform.\"\n\nSpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value the Starship maker at $1.5 trillion.\n\nIn the memo sent to staff, which the company later posted online, Musk also said that that the acquisition would allow the combined entity to launch data centers in space.\n\n\"This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\" Musk wrote.\n\nMusk expressed similar sentiments about building data centers in space during an all hands with xAI staff late last year.\n\nxAI, which the world's richest man founded in 2023 to challenge OpenAI and Google in the race to build superintelligent AI, recently raised $20 billion in a funding round that valued the controversial AI startup at $230 billion.\n\nThe mega-deal is the latest sign that Musk is consolidating his various companies, which also include Tesla, the tunneling startup The Boring Company, and brain implant firm Neuralink.\n\nIn March 2025, Musk announced that xAI had acquired X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter he bought in 2022. Meanwhile, SpaceX and Tesla have each invested $2 billion in xAI in recent months.\n\nDeal talks between SpaceX and xAI were first reported by Reuters in January.\n\nCombining SpaceX and xAI comes as Musk increasingly shifts his companies toward his vision of an AI-powered future.\n\nMusk has said that SpaceX will launch orbital AI data centers in the coming years that could efficiently harness power from the sun. Last Friday, SpaceX filed a request with the FCC to launch as many as one million satellites to serve as orbital data centers.\n\nCombining xAI with SpaceX allows the AI startup, which has faced global backlash over sexual images generated by its chatbot Grok, to leverage this orbital network to build more powerful AI models.\n\nIt also gives xAI access to significant capital. The OpenAI rival reportedly burned through billions of dollars in 2024, while SpaceX is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion in its IPO later this year.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "description": "Ana Navarro says President Trump \"picked on the wrong guy\" by arresting Don Lemon, because Lemon can and will fight back",
    "fullText": "After the Trump administration sent federal agents to arrest journalist Don Lemon last week, despite a judge refusing to approve federal charges against him just a week earlier, Lemon is now released. And “The View” host Ana Navarro thinks the president should be worried, because they “picked on the wrong guy.”\n\nDiscussing the arrest during Monday’s Hot Topics, the ABC hosts largely scoffed at the move, calling it a tactic “to send a chilling message to anybody who is covering facts.” Navarro shredded the administration once again for “gaslighting” voters, and being “afraid” of truth getting out.\n\n“And I think they picked on the wrong guy, because Don Lemon is not going to play dead,” she said. “Don Lemon has the wherewithal, has the structure, has the team, has the courage and has the money to fight this administration.”\n\nDON LEMON ARRESTED OVER MN PROTESTS: 'The View' co-hosts react to freedom of press concerns being raised following the arrest of Lemon and Georgia Fort in connection with their coverage of protests at a Minneapolis church. pic.twitter.com/JMnpGQX7Wc\n\n— The View (@TheView) February 2, 2026\n\n“And he’s going to take it as far as it goes,” Navarro continued.\n\nHost Sunny Hostin readily agreed with that and, citing her experience as a former federal prosecutor once again, made an educated guess about how Lemon’s case will go in the legal system.\n\n“You know what happens next is that he will have his day in court, and I suspect that this case will be thrown out,” she said. “This case doesn’t have any merit.”\n\nHostin conceded that she is close friends with Lemon herself, but picked apart the idea that he was impeding any rights, which is what he was charged with.\n\n“I’ve been with Don in Ferguson. I’ve been with Don on the ground in South Carolina. Don is a journalist,” she said. “He’s an on-the-ground journalist. He has been pepper sprayed, he has been tear gassed, and he was getting the story, and nothing should have gotten in the way of that. He had a microphone with him, he had a cameraman with him, and he was practicing journalism.”\n\nYou can watch the full discussion from “The View” in the video above.\n\nThe post ‘The View’ Host Ana Navarro Says Trump Picked the Wrong Guy to Arrest in Don Lemon: ‘Has the Courage and Has the Money’ to Fight | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Chief Justice John Roberts has started asking Supreme Court staff to sign non-disclosure agreements after a pro-Donald Trump judicial decision and memo were leaked to the press.\n\nRoberts, 71, likes to describe court members and employees as a family, and for years relied on more low-key measures to keep the court’s decision-making process secret, The New York Times reported.\n\nHe lectured clerks at the start of each term and distributed a written code of conduct that instructed clerks of their “duties of complete confidentiality, accuracy, and loyalty,” which only mentioned the possibility of unspecified sanctions in the case of breaches.\n\nBut two weeks after Trump was re-elected in 2024, Roberts summoned the court’s employees and asked them to sign legally binding NDAs requiring them to keep the court’s inner workings secret, five sources told the Times.\n\nThe agreements, which new arrivals have also been required to sign, threaten legal action if clerks or other members of the court’s support staff reveal confidential information, the paper’s sources said.\n\nIt’s not clear whether the justices themselves were also asked to sign confidentiality agreements, as the court declined to comment to the Times.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out for comment as well.\n\nRoberts’ crackdown follows a series of humiliating court leaks that have plagued the court since Politico was given a draft decision of the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson case that overturned the federal right to an abortion.\n\nThe court has also been rocked by revelations about disagreements among the justices, including a bitter debate about a case involving Idaho’s abortion ban, a battle over the court’s toothless ethics rules, and a confidential memo in which Roberts pushed to grant Trump broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nRoberts’ decision to impose NDAs came just weeks after the Times quoted from the confidential immunity memos, according to the Times.\n\nThe move comes as critics are calling for more transparency at the Supreme Court, which is facing record-low public trust as the conservative justices greenlight the vast majority of Trump’s policies.\n\nRoberts, however, went in the other direction and mandated more secrecy, not less.\n\nThe last time prior to 2024 that Supreme Court clerks were asked to sign a document agreeing to abide by the court’s confidentiality rules appears to have been in the late 1990s, after a former clerk published a tell-all book in 1998, according to the Times.\n\nThose documents, however, did not amount to legal NDAs, according to some of the clerks that signed them.\n\nThe switch to formal contracts is “a sign of the court’s own weakness” and the erosion of internal cohesion, Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor, told the Times.",

    "fullText": "Public health agencies and border officials are on high alert after a rare but potentially deadly virus outbreak in West Bengal, India, The Washington Post reported.\n\nTwo cases of Nipah virus have been confirmed, according to an Indian Health Ministry statement Tuesday reviewed by the Post.\n\nNipah virus outbreaks occur cyclically in South Asia and Southeast Asia, particularly in Bangladesh.\n\nA November study in the Journal of Infection and Public Health described the virus as a \"significant public health threat,\" attributing the pathogen's prevalence in Bangladesh to the consumption of raw date palm sap tainted by fruit bats.\n\nNipah virus is a zoonotic disease transmitted from animals to humans, with bats and pigs as the most common vectors of transmission.\n\nWorryingly, the Nipah virus' case fatality rate — the rate of deaths in proportion to the number of total cases — is estimated at between 40% and \"75% or higher,\" according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nThe Indian Health Ministry's contact tracing identified 196 individuals who may have been in close contact with the two sickened individuals, all of whom were asymptomatic and tested negative.\n\nAs the Independent warned, the World Health Organization has deemed the Nipah virus a \"priority pathogen,\" citing the credible possibility an outbreak could \"trigger an epidemic.\"\n\nThe WHO further indicated that there is neither a vaccine nor a known treatment for Nipah virus cases, leaving medical professionals with only \"intensive supportive care,\" per the United Kingdom's Health Security Agency.\n\nAccording to the WHO, Nipah virus outbreaks can have devastating indirect effects, sickening livestock, and \"resulting in significant economic losses for farmers.\"\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe outlet referenced a 2012 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America about the trajectory of Nipah virus.\n\nIn the study's third section, researchers strongly emphasized the role that a warming world plays in the spread of vector-borne illnesses, using Nipah virus as an example.\n\nAs Inside Climate News noted, higher temperatures could expand the range of disease vectors such as fruit bats and mosquitoes, thereby increasing the incidence of once-rare illnesses.\n\nWhile no known treatments existed, officials on the ground appeared to take Nipah virus outbreak seriously.\n\n\"We have specifically intensified surveillance at border points in Koshi Province. Health checks have also been ordered for people entering Nepal through other border crossings,\" said Nepal's minister of health, Dr. Prakash Budhathoki, according to the Himalayan Times.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Two more businesses have left South Town Plaza in Henrietta.\n\nPlato’s Closet, a Minneapolis-based chain that buys and sells gently used trendy apparel and accessories for teenagers and young adults, recently closed its South Town store “due to the state of the plaza,” according to a sign on the door.\n\nMost of the property is owned by Mason Asset Management of Great Neck, New York. Town of Henrietta officials have long criticized the firm for not keeping up the plaza. They even went so far as to use town crews to repair large potholes in the parking lot.\n\nIn its message, Plato’s Closet (which opened at South Town in 2007) encouraged shoppers to visit its two other area stores at 2833 West Ridge Road in Ridgemont Plaza, Greece, and 30 Cobblestone Court Drive, Cobblestone Court, Victor.\n\nLocal chocolatier Andy’s Candies, which operated seasonally at South Town for 15 years, has moved to Jay Scutti Plaza South, 1000 Hylan Drive, Henrietta.\n\nOwner Craig Sykut said he relocated the Henrietta store because of construction underway at South Town. (Last November, Syracuse-based Dunk & Bright Furniture bought the old Burlington space and South Town’s monument sign and is making over both of them.)\n\nAndy’s Candies also has locations in Greece, Penfield and Victor. The Jay Scutti Plaza store is open now through Easter.\n\nOn Feb. 2, Henrietta Supervisor Stephen Schultz said the town is working to bring together Mason Asset Management with local developers in hopes of returning 500,000-square-foot South Town to local ownership.\n\nIn addition to Plato’s Closet and Andy’s Candies, South Town has lost the following tenants:\n\n∎ New Jersey-based Price Rite Marketplace in November 2025.\n\n∎ Virginia-based The Dollar Tree, also in 2025, but it isn’t clear when.\n\n∎ Joann in May 2025, when the Ohio-based crafting retailer shut down locations nationwide.\n\n∎ New Jersey-based Burlington in 2018, when it relocated to the old Toys R Us in Jay Scutti Plaza North, 300 Hylan Drive.\n\n∎ Linens ’N Things in 2008, when the New Jersey-based retailer shut down all its stores.\n\nReporter Marcia Greenwood covers general assignments and has an interest in retail news. Send story tips to mgreenwo@rocheste.gannett.com. Follow her on X @MarciaGreenwood.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rochester Democrat and Chronicle: Two more businesses leave beleaguered South Town Plaza in Henrietta NY",

    "fullText": "Feb 2 (Reuters) - Venezuelan oil exports rose to some 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January, from 498,000 bpd in December, after the U.S. capture of Nicolas Maduro and the ending of an oil ​blockade which has let traders carry most exports, shipping data showed.\n\nWashington imposed an oil embargo on the U.S.-sanctioned ‌country in December to pressure Maduro and seized seven tankers.\n\nHow did Venezuelan oil exports change in January?\n\nWhich companies received licenses to export Venezuelan oil?\n\nWhere is Venezuelan oil being shipped now?\n\nWhat caused the U.S. oil blockade to end?\n\nThe blockade led to the accumulation of more than 40 million barrels of crude and fuel ‌in onshore tanks and vessels that could not be exported and forced Venezuela's state-run energy company PDVSA to cut output in early January.\n\nSince the U.S. Treasury Department extended the first licenses to traders Trafigura and Vitol in January to begin exporting the stocks, oil production, processing and shipments from the OPEC member have accelerated, the data, which is based on tanker movements, shows.\n\nThe January volume ⁠was close to average exports of 847,000 bpd ‌of crude and fuel last year. However, PDVSA's partners and traders would have to continue accelerating the pace of exports to drain millions of barrels still in inventories, so crude output cuts ‍can be fully reversed.\n\nThe January exports were slightly lower than the 867,000 bpd shipped in the same month of 2025, the data showed.\n\nThe Treasury Department last week issued a broad license authorizing business between U.S. companies and PDVSA to export, store, transport and refine Venezuelan oil, ​another step to untangle exports. PDVSA's partners, including Chevron, are still waiting for individual licenses to expand operations.\n\nThe United States ‌last month regained its position as the main individual destination of Venezuela's crude with some 284,000 bpd exported there, of which 220,000 bpd were shipped by Chevron, up from the 99,000 bpd it sent the previous month.\n\nChina, which until December was the top destination of Venezuelan oil, with than 70% of total exports, received 156,000 bpd last month. There were no exports to political ally Cuba.\n\nVitol and Trafigura exported 12 million barrels of Venezuelan crude and fuel oil under U.S. licenses, or about ⁠392,000 bpd in January, mostly to storage terminals in the Caribbean, ​the data showed, from which they began exporting and marketing cargoes to customers ​in the U.S., Europe and India.\n\nBetween 18 million and 38 million barrels more are yet to be exported under the $2 billion flagship supply deal agreed by Caracas and Washington shortly after Maduro's capture, ‍with sale proceeds going to a ⁠U.S.-supervised fund.",

    "title": "Eight Useful Tool Accessories Every DIYer Should Own",
    "description": "These innovative add-ons will make your projects easier.",
    "fullText": "I love getting things done around the house. I’m not the greatest carpenter, electrician, or plumber, but I like learning how things work and even enjoy learning from my mistakes (sometimes). And most of all, I like saving a bucket of money on home maintenance and repairs. None of this means that DIY isn't an incredible amount of work, however.\n\nLuckily, living in a consumption-based society means companies are always inventing new gadgets for me to buy, and some of them are incredibly useful for DIYers. The eight tool accessories below are ones I truly recommend. Each can help make your next project a little faster, easier, and/or safer.\n\nThis is one of those simple ideas that seems so obvious it’s hard to believe it took this long to be invented. The Multipail is a simple concept: A standard five-gallon bucket with a dustpan built in. It can also be used with a paint roller as a tray replacement, and has a drip-proof spout for pouring liquids without making a mess. You need a five-gallon bucket anyway, so why not use one that has these useful features molded in, instead of buying two or three wonky attachments?\n\nThere are a lot of ways to illuminate your work site, from standard flashlights to headband lamps to bendable LED lights. But sometimes you need to get light into a small space, and you need to be able to illuminate what you’re doing just by pointing at things. These flashlight gloves are cheap, waterproof, and make it easy to see what you’re doing without having to hold a separate light.\n\nCordless drills are one of the most commonly-used tools in DIY projects, but they come with one major frustration: All those damn bits. If you’re constantly swapping out different-size drill bits and different screwdriver bits, you know how hard it can be to keep them organized (and how hard it is to not lose them).\n\nEnter this nifty drill bit holder that attaches to the bottom of your drill’s battery. It holds not just bits, but just about anything, from utility blades to fasteners. Designed to work with just about any manufacturer, it attaches to the bottom of the battery and lets you carry whatever you need right there on the tool.\n\nThis drill attachment is probably overkill for most DIYers (and it isn’t cheap!), but if you’ve got a job requiring a lot of drilling down low, it might be the difference between a pleasant day of work and a broken back. Instead of getting on your hands and knees or even lying down in order to see what you’re drilling into, the Backsaver lets you work in a comfortable standing position while drilling at foot-level. It takes a bit of practice before you can just dive in, but your back will definitely thank you for taking the time.\n\nCarrying large sheets or panels like drywall or plywood can be challenging. It’s hard to maintain your grip and your balance, and navigating around corners and tight spaces often results in dropped items or scraped knuckles.\n\nThis panel carrier from Gator Lift just clamps onto whatever you’re hauling around (up to two sheets at a time) and makes it very easy to carry it one-handed—which means you can actually open doors and easily maneuver while carrying these awkward, heavy sheets around.\n\nI don’t know about you, but whenever I have to climb up to my roof to inspect or repair something (or clean out the gutters), there’s always at least one terrifying moment when the ladder shakes and shimmies, and I think I’m about to die. Ladders are always incredibly dangerous, but they’re especially dangerous when you’re working on your roof. This ladder hook from Lock Jaw clamps onto the roof and ensures the ladder doesn’t move, giving you an extra boost of safety.\n\nRunning power to wherever you’re working is sometimes a logistical challenge. There are plenty of ways to run a power strip to your project, but ensuring that you have easy, safe access to the strip sometimes involve some seriously janky engineering involving zipties, duct tape, or precariously balanced equipment.\n\nThis clamping power strip is a lot more civilized. It ensures you’ll have plenty of outlets no matter where you’re working. It can clamp to a ladder, to a joist or rafter, a table, railing—literally anywhere. Power will always be nearby, and you won’t have to remember to plug in your corded tools before you climb up the ladder ever again.\n\nIf you’ve got a standard extending ladder, you know that your greatest enemy is uneven ground. An unbalanced ladder is a disaster waiting to happen, but most DIYers have climbed onto a shaking, leaning ladder at least once in their life, hoping their luck holds out long enough to get some quick bit of work done.\n\nInstead, invest in a ladder stabilizer. Install it on your ladder and it automatically adjusts the legs on each side so you have a perfectly balanced, perfectly stable ladder to climb no matter how uneven the ground might be. Considering that half a million people go to the ER for ladder-related injuries every year, everyone should probably have this installed on their ladder.",

    "description": "If you've been dragging your heels, you have a little more time—but don't wait too long.",
    "fullText": "When Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, it announced that all users would eventually need to link their devices to a Google account to continue using Fitbit's features and services. Google initially set a deadline sometime in 2025 for the mandatory migration, then pushed it to February 2, 2026—a date that seemed final at the time. Now, Google has granted yet another extension.\n\nNow, if you're still using a legacy Fitbit account (an account from before 2021), Google has extended the deadline for migrating Fitbit accounts to Google accounts for the second time, giving users until May 19, 2026, to make the switch.\n\nFor those who've been procrastinating, the migration process itself is straightforward and should only take a few minutes. Google provides step-by-step instructions on the Fitbit support page that walk users through linking their existing Fitbit data to a Google account.\n\nTo move your Fitbit account to a Google Account:\n\nSign in to your Fitbit account.\n\nTap Settings and select Move account.\n\nFollow the on-screen instructions.\n\nDuring the migration, you can review and make changes to your Fitbit data and setup. After that, you can then manage your Fitbit data from your Google Account settings and the Fitbit app. And if you change your mind, you can cancel until the final step. Again, you have until May 19, 2026, to complete the transition.\n\nIt's worth noting that anyone who created a new Fitbit account or purchased a device in roughly the last two years is already using the Google-based system. The migration requirement only affects users with older, pre-acquisition accounts.\n\nFrom the start, this news didn't sit well with everyone, and it still doesn't sit well now. Many long-time Fitbit aren't exactly eager to tie their health data to Google's ecosystem.\n\nFor users who refuse to migrate, there's still an option to preserve or erase your data. Google has set July 15, 2026, as the final date to download or delete your Fitbit account and all associated health information. And if you're choosing to leave the platform entirely, keep in mind that deleting your data is the safest choice for privacy and security reasons.\n\nThere also seems to be general migration issues, like for young Fitbit users. Some parents have reported that Supervised Google accounts—designed for children and teenagers—cannot log into the Fitbit app, creating a roadblock for families who purchased devices for their kids.\n\nDespite the extensions and the complaints, the direction is clear: Google is moving forward with integrating Fitbit into its ecosystem. Whether you embrace the change or walk away from your tracker, the clock is ticking on making that decision.",

    "description": "You can hide your coordinates from your cell carrier.",
    "fullText": "Some iOS users are getting an extra layer of privacy when it comes to how their location data is shared. Limit Precise Location is a new setting that prevents some Apple devices from broadcasting specific locations to cell carriers.\n\nPrecise location sharing is useful, even essential, in some cases, such as when you're navigating with your maps app. But you may not want to constantly be sending your exact address to your phone provider, where it could be used for malicious purposes. If you enable Limit Precise Location, your iOS device will share your general area instead.\n\nAs TechCrunch points out, precise location sharing introduces a whole host of privacy and security risks. Cell carriers have been targeted by hackers, compromising sensitive customer data. Surveillance vendors and law enforcement agencies may also use location information broadcast via cellular networks for the purposes of real-time and ongoing tracking.\n\nUsers already have the option to disable precise location sharing at the app level on both iOS and Android for apps that don't need GPS coordinates to function—which is most of them. This allows you to prevent companies from receiving (and selling) your exact location data when a general location is sufficient. Limit Precise Location won't change these app-specific settings.\n\nFor now, the feature is available only on select Apple models—the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and iPad Pro (M5) Wi-Fi + Cellular—running iOS 26.3 with a limited number of global carriers:\n\nApple says that even with this setting enabled, emergency responders will still be able to pinpoint exact location during an emergency call.\n\nIf you have a supported device with a partner carrier, go to Settings > Cellular and tap Cellular Data Options (you may need to select the specific line under SIMs if you have more than one).

    "title": "Everything We Know About Apple's Rumored Folding iPhone (and iPad)",
    "description": "Apple foldables are back in the rumor cycle.",
    "fullText": "Now that Apple has finally brought OLED to the iPad in the form of the most recent iPad Pro, its next goal seems to be foldables. The big news on the horizon is the foldable iPhone, which The Information first reported on way back in 2024, saying the company hopes to have a foldable iPhone on the market in 2026. But according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the iPhone maker is also working towards releasing a foldable iPad, originally rumored to be coming by 2028. Since those reports, others have come forward with supposed design leaks and potential release dates, and now we've got a pretty good idea of what Apple's first foldable devices might look like.\n\nWay back when the iPhone Fold (or whatever Apple will call it) was first being discussed, the Wall Street Journal said it’ll have a bigger screen than the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Since then, others had speculated that it might look like two iPhone Airs side-by-side. But now, we've got a much better idea about the specifics, including a price.\n\nIn a new post on Chinese social media site Weibo today, leaker Instant Digital laid out several key details about the iPhone Fold's design. Previously, Instant Digital had leaked details about the iPhone 17, which all turned out to be correct. It's unclear what these leaks' sources are, but as far as rumors go, Instant Digital has a decent track record.\n\nVia a machine translation, the post says that the iPhone Fold will feature an \"elegant internal stacking structure\" and will be thin enough to \"shock the industry.\" More concretely, the post also said that all buttons are being moved to the right side of the phone, as that's where the phone's motherboard will be. That means the volume buttons would be on the top-right of the device, while the camera and power buttons will be on the right side of the device. If that sounds cramped to you, it's worth noting that Samsung's Galaxy Fold Z 7 also only has buttons on the right side of the device.\n\nSpeaking of Samsung's Galaxy phones, people who dislike the iPhone's large Dynamic Island should also be happy, as the leaks say the selfie camera is changing to a small pinhole design more akin to what you'd find on Android.\n\nAs for how the phone will actually function, internal specs are still a bit up in the air, although yet another leaker named Fixed Focus Digital (no relation) alleged that the iPhone Fold will have a 5,500 mAh battery, which matches a previous rumor from last fall. That's a bit larger than any iPhone so far, and if the rumor pans out, shows that Apple will use the phone's extra internal space well.\n\nAll of this is, of course, in service of a bigger screen, which we can also nail down a bit now. The most recent leaks, coming from South Korean publication The Elec, say that the iPhone Fold's outer display will be 5.38 inches and the inner display will be 7.58 inches. That makes the internal screen just a little over half-inch larger than the 6.9-inch iPhone 17 Pro Max display, although maybe the enhanced portability of folding part of that screen away will help supplement it a bit. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7's screen is 8 inches.\n\nIn its report, The Elec also expressed concern that Apple might miss its 2026 release target. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo split the difference, saying that the device is likely to be announced in 2026, but that \"smooth shipments\" may not come until 2027.\n\nRegardless, when the phone does come, it's expect to cost between $2,100 and $2,500, going by another leak from Instant Digital.\n\nAll of this helps us have a much better idea about what to expect, but there's still plenty of time for changes to be made. For instance, a 2026 release would see the phone come out during an ongoing RAM crisis that could raise prices, although Kuo recently said that, at least for the iPhone 18 series, Apple plans to eat any extra costs rather than pass them on to the consumer.\n\nEven if it gets delayed to next year, the iPhone Fold's release seems imminent. Much less certain is a potential successor, a clamshell iPhone Flip.\n\nIn his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said that Apple Labs is also now considering a smaller foldable device akin to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip or Motorola Razr lines, which are essentially standard, candy bar-shaped phones that can fold once vertically to store away like makeup compacts.\n\n\"The product is far from guaranteed to reach the market,\" writes the reporter, citing unnamed sources inside Apple. But Gurman says \"Apple is betting that its first foldable iPhone will be successful enough to generate real demand\" and that \"customers will want additional shapes and sizes.\"\n\nThis is our first time hearing that Apple is interested in additional foldable phones beyond one that opens horizontally like a book. On that note, Gurman also speculated that Apple might also make a larger foldable phone in the future, with a screen closer in size to Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7. Although, unlike with the flip phone, this appears to simply be a prediction.\n\nFinally, speaking of larger foldable devices, Gurman has some bad news for iPad fans. While the reporter had previously covered a folding iPad with a rumored 18.8-inch display, following up on predictions from market research firm Omdia, it now seems to be behind schedule.\n\nEarlier, Gurman had said the new iPad would be like “two iPad Pros side-by-side” and wouldn't feature an external screen. While the expected design hasn't changed, it seems Apple's now run into some manufacturing issues. Now, instead of being projected for 2028, the foldable iPad seems more likely to come out in 2029.\n\nGurman says that's because of \"engineering challenges\" with the device's weight and display technology, so at least skeptics can breathe a sigh of relief that it isn't due to supply chain issues. As such, pricing is likely to remain unaffected. Granted, the expected price is still likely to be on the high end—Gurman says you'll likely have to pay around $3,000 for the device.",

    "title": "Firefox Will Soon Let You Disable All Current (and Future) AI Features",
    "description": "AI is coming to Firefox, but at least using it will be entirely optional.",
    "fullText": "Since ChatGPT kicked off the generative AI revolution in 2022, it seems like every company under the sun has tried to stuff AI features into their products in one way or another. Sometimes, these features can be useful; often, they're not, only serving as proof these companies are \"keeping up with the times.\" Can you even say you're a tech company if you aren't all-in on AI in 2026?\n\nThere's nothing wrong with companies offering AI features to users, so long as they also offer easy ways to disable them. Some customers don't want AI in their day-to-day products, but, anecdotally, I know many do not. Give us an off switch though, and it's all good. The issue is when these features are not only offered, they're made mandatory. Unfortunately, that's the road many companies seem to be taking.\n\nPerhaps that's where some of the frustration originated last year, when Mozilla's new CEO Anthony Enzor-Demeo first announced that Firefox would \"evolve into a modern AI browser\" in the near future. An open letter, written by a Redditor critical of Enzor-Demeo's statement, received over 5,000 upvotes on the Firefox subreddit from users concerned that AI features would negatively impact the browser. Interestingly, Enzor-Demeo responded to the thread himself, and assured users that the company would offer \"a clear way\" to disable AI features, including a dedicated kill switch to keep them all turned off. It seems he was as good as his word.\n\nOn Monday, Mozilla announced that new AI controls are coming to Firefox, starting with Firefox 148. This version, which drops Feb. 24, sports a brand-new AI controls section in the settings panel on the desktop browser. (You'll find it in the between \"Sync\" and \"AI controls.\") From here, you'll be able to block all current and future AI features, and cherry pick which features you want to use—if any.\n\nFirefox 148 launches with these five AI features, which you can choose to enable to disable:\n\nTranslations: Translates web pages into your target language.\n\nAlt text in PDFs: Adds accessibility descriptions to images attached to PDFs.\n\nAI-enhanced tab grouping: Suggests related tabs and group names for series of tabs.\n\nLink previews: Shows key points before opening a link.\n\nAI chatbot in the sidebar: Firefox is getting its own AI chatbot, though users can choose from existing chatbots like Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Le Chat Mistral.\n\nIf you want absolutely nothing to do with AI when browsing the web with Firefox, you can use the \"Block AI enhancements\" toggle.

    "title": "Wordle Has a New Rule That Might Change Your Best Starting Word",
    "description": "You need to think beyond the vowels.",
    "fullText": "There’s an art and a science to picking a good starting word when you play Wordle. And now that the New York Times has announced it will start repeating previously used words, it may be time to rethink your strategy. While previous solutions used to be off-limits for future puzzles, that rule has changed. As of February 1, 2026, they're fair game again.\n\nThat rule change matters because every word choice in Wordle has to be split between two jobs—gaining information about what to guess next, and trying to solve the puzzle with your guess. If you don't care whether your starting word might be a solution, then the rule change may not affect you. But some solvers prefer to use words that are fair game for solutions, giving them a chance of a one-guess solution. If you tend to retire a starter after it's been used, you may want to rethink that strategy and be open to some recycling.\n\nThat said, there's no need to change your starter. My trusty starter of ARISE turned up as a solution a few months ago—but I still use it, even though it's unlikely to be repeated anytime soon. Emily Long, who writes our daily Wordle hints, has a similar starter: RAISE. (That one was a solution in 2024.)\n\nComputer analyses have highlighted other words as ideal starters, and longtime Wordle players each have their own opinion. One thing most of us can agree on, though: ADIEU sucks. Sorry.\n\nThat's not to say ADIEU is the worst word you could play first, but according to a 2023 New York Times analysis, ADIEU is the worst out of the 30 most popular starters. But in that ranking of the top 30 starters, based on how effective they are at revealing letters in any given puzzle, showed that the the best five are SLATE, CRANE, LEAST, STARE, and RAISE, with ADIEU landing at number 30. (My personal favorite, ARISE, ranks seventh.) A different computer analysis once suggested that CRANE is the best starter; another landed on SALET.\n\nI’m going to teach the controversy here. The argument in favor of ADIEU is that it contains four vowels, and you know the solution will have to contain at least one vowel. Thus, knocking out four of them in your first guess is pretty smart. (O and sometimes-vowel Y are the only ones not included.)\n\nBut there’s an argument to be made that vowels don’t narrow down your options enough to be useful. Most words in English remain perfectly legible with all the vowels eliminated. If all you know is a vowel or two, you don't know much about the word. Here's what I mean: If you play ADIEU and A lights up in yellow, yes, you know that there's an A in the solution somewhere. But that tells you very little about what the solution actually is! There are tons of words with a letter A in them somewhere.\n\nA better strategy may be to go with a consonant-heavy word at first, and worry about the vowels later. According to one local Wordle expert, “there are only five [vowels], and it’s almost never going to be a U.”\n\nOne of the computer analyses suggested SALET was the best starter. Not only does it have a good mix of common letters, but the position of the letters will give you the most information compared to, say, SLATE or STALE. Only one problem—what the hell is a salet? (OK, it's a helmet that was used in European warfare in the 1400's, but I had to look that up.) Similarly, TARSE is supposed to be another good one. But it's unlikely the human editor of the Wordle puzzles will ever choose SALET or TARSE as the solution for the day.\n\nSo do you want your starter to be a possible answer? If the answer is yes, you'll also want to skip the obscure words. You'll also want to skip any words that have been used in recent memory. For years, Wordle never repeated a solution, but as of February 2026 that's no longer a rule. Previously-used words may turn up, but so far we don't know how old of a word is considered fair game. You can look up lists of past Wordle solutions, but so far—as of Februrary 2, 2026—the following strong starters haven't yet been used as solutions, but totally could be (in my opinion). Take your pick:\n\nIf you're hoping for a one-guess solution, maybe you do want to play ADIEU. If you're open to previously-used starters, SLATE and STALE last appeared in 2022, while STAND and CRATE were last seen in 2021.\n\nScientific analysis aside, I don't think there's much point to picking the theoretically best starter word; you need to find your best starter word. The human brain does not narrow down the problem space in the same way as a computer. I like when I find vowels early, because having the vowels helps me sound out the words in my head. If I know there are vowels in the second and fourth places (say, _A_E_) I know it is probably a two-syllable word. I run through the available letters, trying them out in each position in my head. (SABER? CARET? LAYER?) For me, a vowel-heavy starter is helpful. For you, it might not be.\n\nWhen choosing a starter, consider the way you think through the possibilities when you're halfway through the puzzle. What starters will set you up for success with your preferred solving style? If your brain works best when you know the initial letters of the word, maybe choose a starter like TRASH, which gets a lot of common beginning consonants into the mix right away.\n\nMy own approach splits the difference: I think about my starters as a pair. When I follow ARISE with TOUCH, I get intel on all five vowels and five of the most common consonants. If you play ADIEU, I think you need to be prepared to follow it up with THORN.\n\nShould you include Y in your starter? Most of us don't, but there's a good argument to be made for getting it in the mix fairly early in the game.\n\nY flies under the radar since it’s an end-of-the-alphabet letter. The tendency is to think it must be as rare as X and Z. But Y is fairly common (worth 4 points in Scrabble to X's 8 and Z's 10), showing up in words like FUNNY and JAZZY (JAZZY being perhaps the hardest word that has ever appeared as a Wordle answer). Words that end in Y also often have a double letter—like the N and Z in those examples—so make sure to consider that as you’re narrowing down the possibilities.\n\nYou may recall from grade school that the vowels are “A, E, I, O, U and sometimes Y.” (You may even have learned “...and sometimes Y and W.”) That’s because Y really can stand on its own as a vowel! The ending Y in FUNNY is an example: U is the vowel for the first syllable, and Y is the vowel for the second. There are also words that contain a Y as their only vowel, like GLYPH, NYMPH, and TRYST.\n\nSo if you’re working through a Wordle and you don’t seem to have enough vowels to make a word, stick a Y in a guess somewhere—preferably at the end. LANKY or HORNY might be good picks for when you’re stumped.\n\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to yesterday's Wordle.",

    "description": "Chris Kracman's proposal to halt large-scale water withdrawals from Caddo Lake pending a study died after commissioners failed to second the motion.",
    "fullText": "A motion before the Caddo Commission to ask state and regional authorities next week to halt large-scale water withdrawals from Caddo Lake died in Monday's work session without a second.\n\nAn agenda item on the Caddo Commission's Feb. 2 work session agenda calls for the advancement of a moratorium to the Red River Compact Commission and the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources on the withdrawal of water from Caddo Lake for any use other than small or commercial residential use for 365 days or until a study of the effect of exceeding currently permitted levels can be obtained.\n\nThe resolution cited concerns about the lake's long-term sustainability in light of a proposed data center near Caddo Lake.\n\nWithout a second, no further discussion on the resolution was to be had.\n\nAs the governing body moved toward an executive session, they offered the chance to speak to two citizens who came in after the public comments period. One of those citizens was Vicki L. Moore\n\nMoore, who has lived in Caddo Parish for 47 years and has spent the past two years living on Blanchard-Latex Road, an area where data center developer STACK Infrastructure has purchased more than 500 acres.\n\n\"You are my representation on the commission,\" Moore said. She expressed concern over the water in Caddo Lake, noting she had been without water for days and saying in the two years she has lived in Blanchard, she's been without water more than she ever was in Shreveport. Mostly, she expressed disappointment in the Commission for not at least moving forward to discuss Kracman's proposal.\n\n\"We don't know where you stand. So I don't know where I stand,\" she said.\n\nCommissioner Victor Thomas addressed the comments about proposal.\n\n\"We plan to address this issue in the proper form, \" he said. \"I didn't want you leave here feeling defeated and that we cared nothing about your water issue and that we care nothing about Caddo Lake.\"\n\nMost commissioners who spoke felt it was too early, saying nothing has confirmed that the planned development is, in fact, a data center.\n\nWhat data center is in Blanchard? Data center developer STACK Infrastructure linked to Caddo, Bossier land deals.\n\nKracman, however, said the resolution had nothing to do with Blanchard Utilities, or with data centers. \"We all say how much we care about Caddo Lake, but if we're not willing to have the discussion about it, how much do we really care?\" A sentence that drew applause from the audience.\n\nHe went on to say that this was one of the most proactive things he'd done since becoming a commissioner, and he was simply asking for a pause so \"intelligent\" people could conduct a study.\n\nThis silent dismissal of the Kracman's legislation echoed as the Blanchard area struggles with a water crisis.\n\nBlanchard Mayor Jim Galambo stated on Facebook Feb. 1 that the Blanchard Water System was experiencing a production issue affecting local municipalities.\n\nOn Monday, Feb. 2, Galambo told the Shreveport Times that the Blanchard Water System had some production issues at the plant with equipment due to the cold weather.\n\nOn Sunday, the Blanchard Water System cut the valves to some customers to allow the water system to fill up its tanks.\n\nAs of Monday, the water disruption had yet to be resolved after leaks were discovered, forcing the water system to drain the tanks.\n\nBlanchard water crisis: Water outage at Blanchard Utilites affects multiple cities, closes schools\n\n\"We’ve been struggling,\" Galambo said. \"We had to go find the leaks. We finally now have found them all, and we’ve got crews on site. We’re getting them to make the repairs.\"\n\nMooringsport Mayor Ty Gordon posted on Facebook, \"Currently, Mooringsport and Oil City are still OFF... NO exact restoration time at this moment.\"\n\nThis water disruption has caused the cancellation of Herndon Magnet School, Mooringsport Elementary School, Blanchard Elementary School, Donnie Bickham Middle School and Northwood High School.\n\n\"District leadership continues to monitor the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available,\" Caddo Parish Schools said.\n\nKracman, who proposed the moratorium, told The Times in a previous interview that he had received calls from constituents opposed to the data center and from environmentalists concerned that Caddo Lake cannot sustain millions of gallons of daily withdrawals under the developers' contract with Blanchard.\n\n\"Let's get the people who are qualified to assess what the lake can or cannot take before we're just arbitrarily against a data center,\" Kracman said. \"I would rather weigh and measure that it's OK, and I think everybody can appreciate taking a pause and getting some facts together.\"\n\nA measure in New Orleans similar to the one Krackman is proposing led to the cancellation of a data center project.\n\nA global data center developer with a growing footprint across the United States is tied to several large land acquisitions in Caddo and Bossier parishes, according to public property records.\n\nSTACK Infrastructure, a Denver-based digital infrastructure company, is connected to the purchases through SAC III Acquisition Co. LLC, which is listed on multiple purchase agreements for properties intended for data center development in northwest Louisiana.\n\nSAC III Acquisition Co. is listed as the buyer on several transactions in Caddo Parish and Bossier Parish, including more than 500 acres in Blanchard at the corner of Blanchard Latex and Stateline roads. The property sits on the Louisiana-Texas border.\n\nPublic records show SAC III Acquisition Co. lists its address as 1700 Broadway, Suite 1750, Denver, Colorado, the same address used by STACK Infrastructure.\n\nSTACK Infrastructure develops and operates hyperscale data centers for large enterprises, cloud service providers and companies focused on artificial intelligence and machine-learning workloads. The company provides data center capacity in major markets across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific.\n\nThe company is backed by investment firms IPI Partners and ICONIQ Capital, both of which specialize in large-scale infrastructure and technology investments.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Shreveport Times: Caddo Commission kills Caddo Lake proposal with no debate",

    "fullText": "After Savannah Guthrie’s mom was reported missing, some people might be wondering what happened to the Today host’s father.\n\nOn Feb. 2, Savannah Guthrie’s mother, Nancy Guthrie, was reported missing by her family. The Today anchor was absent from the airing of the show and released a statement: “On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers, and messages of support. Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom. We thank law enforcement for their hard work on this case and encourage anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff’s Department.”\n\nToday's Savannah Guthrie's Mom's Disappearance Being Investigated by FBI Due to 'What Was Found at the Scene'-Officials Are 'Concerned'\n\nThe Real Reason Another Today Host Just Quit Months After Hoda Kotb's Sudden Exit: 'The Time Has Come... '\n\nNBC crime correspondent Tom Winter reported that Nancy’s disappearance is now treated as a crime. “They were able to get out helicopters last night that use infrared cameras. They’ve got drones up,” Winter said. “They’ve enlisted the help of the Customs and Border Protection — obviously, not too far from the border there in Mexico. They have some special resources. The FBI is also aware of this case… given the nature of what was found at the scene. That’s what has got them so concerned.”\n\nNancy didn’t have any reported health concerns like dementia or Alzheimer’s and had a “good sound mind.” However, officials were concerned about her physical health. “She has some physical ailments that limit her ability to move around,” Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said.\n\nThe Tucson Sheriff’s Department later made an update about the investigation. “We believe now, after we’ve processed that we do in fact have a crime and we’re asking the community’s help,” Nanos said.\n\nSavannah Guthrie’s father was Charles Guthrie. He died when she was 16 years old from a sudden heart attack.\n\nThe death of her father had a profound impact on her adolescence. “The loss of my father was shocking and devastating. It cracked open our family and crushed us,” Savannah shared in an interview with People in 2024 when promoting her book Mostly What God Does, which chronicles her grieving from the loss. “He was our center. We just idealized him and adored him. He was larger than life, and funny, and charming, and adorable. His loss was so sudden and so shocking.”\n\nSavannah also uses Christmas as a tribute to her father and his selflessness. “I think the fact that I lost my dad when I was 16, it makes Christmas even more special to us, because it was his holiday and that’s how we felt and that’s how he felt,” Savannah said in December 2022. “I think we hold on to Christmas even harder now, because it’s a tie to him and a tie to the past and to our memories.”\n\nShe revealed that she didn’t want to leave her mom in the early stages of her career. “My father died when I was entering my senior year in high school. I then lived at home all through college. We didn’t have money to afford the dorm,” Savannah said on Today in 2022. “She said, ‘If you can’t leave me, then I didn’t do my job right, Savannah.’ She just gave me permission to go.”\n\nThe Today anchor often brought Nancy as a guest on the show and talked about her love for her mother in 2022. “She loves us, her family, fiercely, and her selflessness and sacrifice for us, her steadfastness and her unmovable confidence is the reason any of us grew up to do anything,” Guthrie said in honor of her 80th birthday.\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

All that's left is to thank all of you for being there and for always supporting us, the fans.\"\n\nSpurs signed Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid and 19-year-old Brazilian defender Souza from Santos in the January window.\n\nThey added 18-year-old Hearts forward James Wilson on loan on transfer deadline day, but he will be part of their under-21s squad.\n\nIn response to Romero's post last month, manager Thomas Frank said the 27-year-old Argentina centre-back should keep some things \"internal\".\n\nTottenham wanted to sign Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo in January but he joined Manchester City instead, with Frank saying on Friday the club \"did everything\" they could.\n\n\"The fans just want the best for the club, just like I, the owners, the staff, the players. Everyone wants the best for the club,\" added the Dane.\n\n\"But the transfer window is not Football Manager, unfortunately. It is not. It would be a lot easier, but also a little bit more boring.\"\n\nSpurs, who won the Europa League last term, are currently 14th in the Premier League and sit closer to the drop zone than the European qualification places, although they have made it to the last 16 of the Champions League.",

Freeman is a relative midfield rookie, having spent the vast majority of his career on the wing.\n\nBut the pair have a shared history to draw from.\n\nBoth came through the Northampton academy and were key figures in Saints' run to the Premiership title in 2023-24 and a Champions Cup final in 2024-25.\n\n\"It's very easy to call each other out and tell each other when we're not going so well. And when we are,\" says Freeman.\n\n\"That's massive because the more times you're in that position [alongside each other], the more cues you're picking up.\n\n\"Dingers is an awesome communicator. It's just constant, constant noise.\n\n\"He's just very good at seeing what's in front and giving you confidence and he can move the ball very well and create some good opportunities for us outside boys.\"\n\nDingwall does more than grease wheels, spot space and take shots though.\n\nIn a rare win over New Zealand in the autumn, it was him arcing in under the posts as Ollie Lawrence drew attention and shifted the ball at the last moment.\n\nBut, for the most part, he is happy to lean into reputation as a player who makes others shine, rather than living in the spotlight himself.\n\n\"You look at the people that we have in the backline, their natural talent around beating people, physicality and all the kind of stuff that they can do - I just feel like my role is a bit how I can bring that out as best as possible,\" Dingwall said.\n\n\"That's not to say that I don't try and better myself constantly and am not trying to become one of these people or do those things.\n\n\"But we've got such talent and super strengths within this backs division, it's like: 'How can I aid bringing all of that out?'\"",

The chance to play for this club in the Premier League immediately excited me.\n\n\"I am ready for a new challenge and the next step in my career.\"\n\nNetz came through the academy at Hertha Berlin and joined Gladbach in 2021, playing 124 times for them.\n\nThe German made his Bundesliga debut for Hertha at 17 and has 17 caps for Germany's Under-21s.\n\nForest's global head of football Edu Gaspar said: \"A part of the model is to add talented young players to the squad that can grow with us.\n\n\"Despite his age, Luca has played well over 100 times at the highest level in Germany, so we are signing a player with a good blend of potential and experience.\n\n\"With the ability to play on the left side, Luca brings balance to our team and we are all looking forward to see him settle in Nottingham and contribute for the rest of the season and beyond.\"",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): Ten men away at Aston Villa, I could have put the whole backline in. Keller has gone in and not only held his own as their number one, but continued to showcase probably why he left Liverpool. A lot of people would have said 'stay, Alisson is getting older, you'll get your chance'. He didn't, he went away and he has been fantastic for them and it is a team that suits him.\n\nMarcos Senesi (Bournemouth): Arguably one of the players of the season for me. He is really solid, goes about his business, gets everything done. Nothing is forced.\n\nGabriel (Arsenal): Leeds weren't poor, but Gabriel was solid and reassuring. He got the job done and knows the threat he poses from set-pieces. It was probably his best defensive display of the season.\n\nKristoffer Ajer (Brentford): Big, solid defender. He was celebrating making tackles in the first few minutes, which is not my cup of tea, but when you are doing it consistently all the way through and putting your body on the line, I'll give you a pass.\n\nEnzo Fernandez (Chelsea): Obviously he scored the goal that completed the great comeback. He gets a lot of stick, unjustifiably in my opinion. People don't think he's that good and maybe it's the price tag and because he won a World Cup that means they expect more. He is a good midfielder and a really good captain, and he looks after the ball when they are in difficult moments.\n\nFlorian Wirtz (Liverpool): I have been saying for weeks and months that with a player of that quality, it was only a matter of time before he settled into it. These past six weeks we have seen the real Florian Wirtz - dictating games, his passing range is unbelievable. The goals and assists have started to come now and he is looking really strong.\n\nAlex Scott (Bournemouth): It was a tough day for him because Wolves were decent. He has had a tough time after going away with England but has come back and has found his mojo. It's going to be an interesting back end of the season for him trying to make the World Cup squad.\n\nNoni Madueke (Arsenal): From thinking you are on the bench to finding out you are starting less than five minutes before kick-off is a massive turn of events. To be mentally focused to deliver, that is credit to Mikel Arteta and Madueke. They somehow gave the goal to him even though it was an own goal, but with a goal and assist he gets in the team.\n\nHabib Diarra (Sunderland): It says a goal and an own goal, but it's basically two goals for him. He was exceptional. The wide players absolutely killed Burnley and he was at the heart of it.\n\nDominic Solanke (Tottenham): It was probably the weirdest two goals he will score in his life. The first one is questionable but the second one is pure genius. To not only backheel it but to lob Gianluigi Donnarumma who is 6ft 6in is unbelievable. It is great to see him back playing. Can he have a late push now for the England squad? That is the question if he can stay fit.\n\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool): Signing of the season? Probably. Another two goals and he looks like he is going from strength to strength, week by week. It's going to be really difficult for Alexander Isak to get back in.\n\nMikel Arteta (Arsenal): It was a wonderful away performance at Elland Road. With Bukayo Saka getting injured in the warm-up there could have been excuses, but he didn't make any. He put Noni Madueke in and he returned the favour. It was a wonderful performance at a place where teams have struggled.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "Liverpool have finalised a deal for Jeremy Jacquet in a deal worth up to £60m - but the defender will not move to Anfield until the summer.\n\nIt would not be an understatement to say he was a name most people were unaware of at the start of the winter window.\n\nTo commit up to £60m - £55m up front before a potential £5m in add ons - for a 20-year-old is a hefty call but Liverpool view the French centre-back as a long-term investment and someone who will form an integral part of their backline for years to come.\n\nGiven the club's defensive problems this season - they have conceded 33 goals from 24 Premier League games - and their ongoing injury crisis, it is also telling Arne Slot's side are prepared to wait until the summer for Jacquet, who will join from Ligue 1 Rennes.\n\nThe question of whether they could have got him now has a simple answer - Rennes are simply unwilling to sanction a move until the summer.\n\nThe French side are not in a rush for the money and adamant any fee for Jacquet would have to surpass their previous club record sale of £55.4m when Manchester City signed Jeremy Doku from them in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Liverpool are happy to wait, signing the player on a five-year contract until 2031, with the option for a further year.\n\nThey see Jacquet as a young defender with plenty of senior experience for his age and their data analysis has backed the decision to spend so much on a player they believe has immense potential.\n\n\"It's a lot of money but Jacquet has everything to become one of the best centre-backs in the world in the next few years,\" says French football expert and ESPN's Julien Laurens. \"He is arguably the best centre-back of his generation.\n\n\"He's quite tall, quick and strong - and he's a machine when it comes to duels in the air and on the ground. He reads the game well and is good on the ball.\n\n\"He's not a proper ball-playing centre-back yet. Technically, there is a lot to improve on, but he's a smart kid and he can get there and become like a Virgil van Dijk.\"\n\nAt Rennes, Jacquet has primarily played in a back three this season. When he was 18, he wanted more game time so they loaned him out to Clermont in Ligue 2 but he was was only there for half a season before he was recalled in January 2025, and made a total of 36 Ligue 1 appearances.\n\nHis strength in the air has been a standout this season, winning 75.51% of his aerial duels - the highest among Ligue 1 defenders in 2025–26.",

    "description": "Katha...",
    "fullText": "The $45 million advertorial abounds in unintended ironies.\n\nMy husband and I saw the Melania documentary, at 10:45 am on the Upper West Side, which I admit was not a fair test of its audience appeal—there were only six people there besides us. They had all left by the time the movie was over—maybe journalists on deadline, like me—so I missed my chance to interview them about their responses. I did catch a middle-aged woman who showed up early for the next screening, well-armed with an enormous bucket of popcorn. Why was she there, I asked? To see Melania of course! What did she like about Melania? “She’s so confident and she does so much to help people.” Confident, I give you.\n\nI used to feel sorry for the wives of rich and powerful men. I saw them as trapped—birds in gilded cages, who had made a terrible mistake in youth, and now had to endure endless rounds of tedious socializing with a frozen smile on their Botoxed faces, to say nothing of having to be nice to their ghastly husbands, who were probably all having sex with prostitutes. I wasn’t alone—remember all those Free Melania memes? The way people endlessly retweeted photos of her looking fed-up and frowny and not holding Donald’s hand? Quite a few women I know believed that Melania was miserable but couldn’t leave him for some unlikely reason, like she would have no money or he would have her murdered. What century did they think this is? Melinda Gates and Mackenzie Scott divorced their unsatisfactory husbands and are living the dream today as fabulously rich philanthropists.\n\nMelania, this documentary makes perfectly clear, likes her gilded cage just fine. After all, it lets her produce this movie starring her clothes, her hair, her shoes, and her complexion, and how many women can say the same? Could you, middle-aged women of America, spend all day every day wearing six-inch spike heels with never a wince or moan? The rewards for aching feet and wrinkle-free face are on full display: Melania is attended every minute by people paid to be deferential and pleasant; everything around her is beautiful and expensive, and she has all the designer dresses she wants. She gets to talk about helping children with Queen Rania of Jordan and the evils of screens for children with Brigitte Macron. She gets to look somber and serious placing lilies on the Arlington graves of three soldiers killed in the withdrawal from Afghanistan—take that, Joe Biden! All your fault! If she has to spend a few hours pretending to care about the tablecloths for the Inaugural dinner and the golden caviar-filled eggs planned as the appetizer, well, that’s not too high a price to pay for luxury and admiration, is it?\n\nAs you might expect, the film abounds in unintended ironies. Melania is famously a private person, but she makes a movie about herself. She says she loves the White House, with all its storied history, while she tears up Jackie Kennedy’s rose garden and her husband tears down the East Wing. She says she cares about young people, while her husband destroys USAID, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths of African children. She reminds us that she is an immigrant, as are her French friend Hervé Pierre, whom we see designing her Inaugural ball gown, and Tham Kannalikham, the White House interior decorator, who arrived from Laos at the age of 2. And of course there are her parents. (Her mourning for her mother, the first anniversary of whose death takes place during the filming, is a rare moment when she expresses deep feeling.) Meanwhile, her husband presides over the mass detention and deportation of immigrants, many of whom have lived in this country for decades, maybe longer than she has. Cherry on top: The director, Brett Ratner, was persona non grata in Hollywood after being accused of sexual misconduct by six women—way to remind us of the ongoing scandal of the Epstein files.\n\nI know there is a real human being hidden inside those severe, stiffly constructed outfits and beneath that famous black hat that hides half her face and makes her look like a sinister fembot or maybe a very confident assassin. This is, after all, the first lady who wore a jacket painted with I REALLY DON’T CARE DO U on her trip to the Mexican border. This is the first lady who plagiarized a speech by her nemesis Michelle Obama. And—my favorite Melania moment— this is the first lady who complained to her former close friend Stephanie Winston Wolkoff about having to “work my ass off” on the White House Christmas. “Who gives a fuck about the Christmas stuff and decorations?” Remember those scary blood-red trees that looked like they came from Dracula’s own forest?\n\nThat Melania was remote, haughty, mysterious, beset by grievance and resentment. She didn’t even try to ingratiate herself with the public. That was kind of weird—but a lot more interesting than this dutiful fashion plate delivering platitudes about how “in the end family is what really matters.” On the other hand, this Melania has managed to get Jeff Bezos to pay $45 million for the right to make this absurd advertorial, and $35 million to promote it. Bezos stands to lose most of it, but (sorry, Dems) the film is on track to be one of the highest-grossing documentaries ever. In a family of champion grifters, Melania holds her own.",

    "fullText": "The once-lauded director of Black Swan and The Wrestler has drowned himself in AI slop with an embarrassing new online series\n\nIf you happen to find yourself stumbling through Time magazine’s YouTube account, perhaps because you are a time traveller from the 1970s who doesn’t fully understand how the present works yet – then you will be presented with something that many believe represents the vanguard of entertainment as we know it.\n\nOn This Day … 1776 is a series of short videos depicting America’s revolutionary war. What makes On This Day notable is that it was made by Darren Aronofsky’s studio Primordial Soup. What also makes it interesting is that it was created with AI. The third thing that makes it interesting is that it is terrible.\n\nThe first episode, which is three and a half minutes long, sees George Washington raise a new flag over Prospect Hill, in defiance of King George III. It is the moment, according to the video’s description, that “rebellion becomes resolve”. And if that dollop of ChatGPT-sounding sloganeering terrifies the life out of you, wait until you actually watch the thing.\n\nIt is, as you might expect, as ugly as sin. It’s the sort of thing that looks like it was shooting for photorealism, but then either chickened out or blew up along the way. In the very first shot, King George’s hair looks like someone melted down and hardened a plastic badger. And this is a shame because, like so much generative AI at the moment, an awful lot of the episode consists of shots where we see the characters from behind. This is, after all, because the back of an AI-generated head is far less likely to send people into screaming fits of trauma than an AI-generated face, and Aronofsky is a humanist.\n\nBecause, good lord, the faces. Since the revolutionary war was largely initiated by older men, On This Day is filled with the wrinkled almost-faces of several well-known figures. And it is truly disconcerting to see, not only because they all have the uncanny dead eyes of people ripped out of The Polar Express, but because the wrinkles keep shifting in colour and depth.\n\nIt’s an effect that makes it look like the characters were drawn on several sheets of tissue paper that nobody could line up properly. Benjamin Franklin, who turns up during episode two, is particularly nightmarish. He looks as if someone has genetically spliced Hugh Laurie with Anthony Hopkins, and then covered the resulting monstrosity in a thin layer of roving liver spots. I’m overselling the point here, but it really is extremely creepy to watch.\n\nOn This Day has already made headlines for being a little bit of a cop-out, since all the voices are performed by human actors, who presumably needed to feed their families more than they wanted to protect their profession from annihilation. And this is telling, because these voices are by far the most convincing part of On This Day, especially when deployed in voiceover, because then you aren’t distracted by the way the movement of their mouths doesn’t quite match up with the noises coming out of them.\n\nBut surely the day is coming where they won’t be needed. As horrible as it is, On This Day is already strides better than a lot of other AI-generated output. True, the whole thing still looks like a mangled cross between an animatronic sex toy convention and those old Taiwanese news cartoons, but compare a character here with Tilly Norwood, and you can see that real progress has been made in a frighteningly short amount of time. Soon we will have picture-perfect AI creations with entirely convincing human voices. After that, it won’t be long before content like On This Day is entirely created – written, acted, directed and edited – by prompt alone. And when that happens, Aronofsky can pat himself on the back for doing himself out of a job.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the human film industry reacts to On This Day, particularly other actors. We’ve already seen, in Tilly Norwood, that these creations appear to be modelled on human faces, and this is even more the case here. In particular, the depiction of Thomas Paine seems like it flashes through the faces of any number of recognisable actors. The key one seems to be Ralph Fiennes, but there are also glimmers of Daniel Day-Lewis and Matthew Macfadyen.\n\nLess than two years ago Scarlett Johansson hired legal counsel after she noticed that an OpenAI application had a voice that was “eerily similar” to hers. In a climate like this, it isn’t out of the question to imagine that actors will start doing the same if they recognise their likeness in an AI-generated performer.\n\nBut this is a concern for another time. What matters now is that On This Day … 1776 is genuinely very horrible to watch, and everybody involved should be ashamed. It is by far the most disturbing thing Aronofsky has made, and I’ve seen the last eight minutes of Requiem for a Dream.",
