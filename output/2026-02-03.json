    "description": "The Patriots’ defensive coordinator made his first public appearance since his cancer diagnosis at Super Bowl Opening Night.",
    "fullText": "Drake Maye commanded the biggest crowd during the New England Patriots’ appearance at Super Bowl Opening Night on Monday. Mike Vrabel and Stefon Diggs also drew plenty of attention at their respective spots on the risers, as did other big-name players.\n\nTerrell Williams, meanwhile, was not as prominently featured. He did not have a riser, nor any fixed cameras watching his every action over the 60-minute period. And yet, interest in him was still substantial.\n\nFor good reason, too: the 51-year-old made his first public appearance since leaving the team with a cancer diagnosis in late September. Having recently been found cancer-free, he joined the Patriots on their trip to Super Bowl LX against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nWilliams will not resume his full duties as defensive coordinator yet. However, he will continue keeping a close eye on a unit that has delivered some uplifting moments for him amid personal challenge.\n\n“It’s been joyous for me just to watch them, and watch them develop and watch them buy into the message that [Mike Vrabel] is preaching,” Williams said. “Trust me, I’ve been in this game a long time and it’s not easy to get people these days to buy in. Vrabes has that unique ability to get them to do that. That’s the fun thing to watch. I know exactly what he’s telling them.”\n\nHead coach Mike Vrabel has been vital in guiding the Patriots in 2025, but assistant Zak Kuhr also filled a critical role with Williams sidelined. The inside linebackers coach took over as defensive play-caller and de facto coordinator.\n\nTheir ability to adapt on the fly has allowed the Patriots to not skip a beat defensively. For Williams, it all comes back to the staff chasing a common goal — and to Kuhr being up to the task as well.\n\n“We all believe in the same things. The message has been the same throughout, from the time we got there to the time we met today,” Williams said.\n\n“So, whether it’s Zak, or whether it’s Scott Booker, or whoever it is, we’re all preaching the same message. Sometimes, when you coach in this league, you’ve got coaches who are pulling in different directions. Everybody has a motive. The only motive for us was to improve. Not to win, but to improve. We figured that the improvement would come, but Zak has done an unbelievable job.”\n\nFor Kuhr, moving into an elevated role early in the regular season was not entirely unfamiliar. He had also filled in for Williams during the offseason, when the nominal DC spent three months away from the team due to an unrelated medical condition.\n\nNonetheless, the Patriots defense and its coaches kept chugging along. In the postseason, the group has played its best football to date.\n\nLeading the way is Zak Kuhr, and the Patriots offensive coordinator is happy to see it.\n\n“I’m proud of him,” said Williams. “I’m looking forward to him calling this game on Sunday.”",

    "description": "Four years ago, the \"Commanders\" were born. It's an anniversary that most Washington fans would like to forget.",
    "fullText": "\"We are the Commanders,\" announced former Redskins quarterback Doug Williams.\n\nThat was on February 2, 2022, on NBC's Today Show, with then-team president Jason Wright overseeing how the name would be announced. Wright was there along with Williams and defensive tackle Jonathan Allen. When it came time for the big unveiling, Wright boringly turned to Williams and said, \"Doug, what is it?\" Williams then spoke those unfortunate words, \"We are the Commanders.\"\n\nWright had been hired and was immediately trying to demonstrate a great vocabulary, assuring his listeners of his past success and business acumen. It was all presentation. \"Image is everything\" to the impressionable. Wright, who was in charge of the franchise's business side, then displayed, for three years, an abundance of oversight failures as one thing after another on the business side became increasingly disappointing.\n\nOwner Daniel Snyder and Wright originally came up with something really \"creative\" after dumping \"Redskins,\" which had been the team name since 1933. The two geniuses came up with the \"Washington Football Team.\"\n\nImagine that an NFL football team named itself the \"Football Team.\" Of course, it was mocked and ridiculed by many across the nation. The two guys who thought they were smarter than everyone else they employed had managed to make Washington the only NFL team without an official mascot. Think about it. Isn't it still hard to believe they never saw that as a major red flag?\n\n— Mauro Rmz (@ArconsaRmz) February 2, 2022\n\nHow did we get to \"Commanders\"? Early, Wright announced the team would never return to \"Redskins.\" Then he announced that \"Warriors\" would never be considered. This was ironic because \"Warriors\" was the first name that many in the fan base had expressed excitement about on social media. Then Wright said \"Wolves\" was also ruled out as was \"Redwolves\" though, that too had generated fan interest.\n\nWright had some hired hands (now gone) who somehow saw \"Commanders\" as the suitable replacement for \"Redskins.\" They, like Wright, showed little to no appreciation for the franchise's history. Wright got rid of the franchise's historic throwbacks and introduced alternate uniforms that had absolutely nothing to do with Redskins' history. It was all clearly intentional.\n\nBut then Wright even went a step further, when he claimed, \"Commanders was \"something that broadly resonated with our fans.\" He smoothly slipped that claim into his presentation. Did it? To this day, how many in the fan base have you met who suggested and supported \"Commanders\" before the announcement?\n\nAh yes, February 2, 2022 (2-2-22) four years ago Monday... is the name any better today?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Four years ago, new name was revealed",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants have suffered another setback in their search for an offensive coordinator, as Davis Webb has opted to remain with the Denver Broncos in a promotion rather than join the team in East Rutherford.\n\nWebb, a former Giants third-round draft pick in 2017 who started one game for Big Blue in the 2022 season finale, interviewed for the vacant OC position under new head coach John Harbaugh.\n\nThe Giants requested the interview in late January, viewing Webb's rising reputation -- bolstered by his work developing quarterbacks like Russell Wilson and Bo Nix in Denver -- as a strong fit for guiding young signal-caller Jaxson Dart.\n\nHowever, on Monday, the Broncos promoted Webb from passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach to offensive coordinator, filling the vacancy created by the recent firing of Joe Lombardi following Denver's deep playoff run.\n\nSources: Denver’s passing game coordinator Davis Webb has reached agreement to become the Broncos’ offensive coordinator. Webb interviewed for three head coaching jobs during this hiring cycle, had other offensive coordinator opportunities, but opted to remain with the Broncos. pic.twitter.com/pYVZTJPNWD\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) February 2, 2026\n\nThis decision allows Webb to stay under head coach Sean Payton, another ex-Giant, where he has thrived since joining the staff in 2023 after retiring from playing.\n\nThe Giants had hoped to pair Harbaugh with Todd Monken, his former OC in Baltimore, but Monken took the Cleveland Browns head coaching job. The team has conducted virtual interviews with other candidates, including Jim Bob Cooter, Kliff Kingsbury, Brian Callahan, and Alex Tanney, with in-person meetings expected soon for finalists.\n\nWhile Webb's familiarity with the organization and his offensive acumen made him an intriguing option, his choice to accept the Broncos' promotion leaves the Giants continuing their pursuit of a proven play-caller to elevate the offense.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Davis Webb won't become New York Giants' OC, opts to remain in Denver",

    "fullText": "New Roma signing Bryan Zaragoza says the opportunity to join the Giallorossi came ‘from one day to another’ and can’t wait to debut at the Stadio Olimpico: ‘Lazio games don’t even come close.’\n\nRoma signed Zaragoza from Bayern Munich on loan with an option to buy on deadline day.\n\nThe Spanish winger, 24, had spent the first part of the campaign on loan at Celta Vigo.\n\nBryan Zaragoza with Roma director Frederic Massara (asroma.com)\n\n“It happened from one day to another. I was told Roma was an option, and I never had any doubt and said I wanted to come,” the Spaniard said in his first interview with Roma.\n\n“I want to thank the club, the owners, and everyone for giving me this opportunity.\n\n“I have high expectations; I want to be important in this club and win titles. I hope we can return to the Champions League.”\n\nScorer of two goals in 26 appearances across all competitions in the first half of 2025-26, Zaragoza can’t wait to play under Gian Piero Gasperini.\n\n“I know Gasperini because I really liked how his team played last season. It seemed very attractive to me. They played the ball really well, and I can’t wait to start this journey and see what it can give me to learn with him,” he said.\n\n“I’ve always liked to dribble, like street football. It’s one of my qualities.\n\n“I don’t know much about Rome; I’ve never been there before, but people say great things about the city. I come with a great desire to know everything and stay a long time here.”\n\nZaragoza has already met Roma star Paulo Dybala at Trigoria.\n\n“I met him as soon as I arrived at the training centre and spoke to him. He’s a great player, and I like the idea of sharing the dressing room with him,” he said.\n\n“In Spain and Germany, I couldn’t pick numbers higher than 25,” he explained.\n\n“Here, I was attracted by the idea of getting a higher number. I liked the 97, and my family and I decided it was what we wanted to pick.\n\nVIGO, SPAIN – OCTOBER 23: Bryan Zaragoza of RC Celta de Vigo warms up prior to the UEFA Europa League 2025/26 League Phase MD3 match between Real Club Celta and OGC Nice at Estadio Abanca Balaidos on October 23, 2025 in Vigo, Spain. (Photo by Jose Manuel Alvarez Rey/Getty Images)\n\n“I’ve played in the Liga and Bundesliga. I had not thought about coming to Serie A; it happened suddenly. I can’t wait to start and learn this league with great players and clubs. It’s a difficult league, but I’ll try to be successful.”\n\nZaragoza made his senior Spain debut in 2023 and has one goal in three appearances under his belt. Naturally, he hopes that his time in Roma will help him get a spot in the squad for the 2026 World Cup.\n\n“Yes, last season I was quite involved, regardless of my injury,” he said.\n\n“This season it hasn’t happened yet, but I hope the chance will come soon. To be at the World Cup is one of my targets.”\n\nZaragoza has already seen the Olimpico when he was at Bayern Munich, as he was an unused substitute in a Champions League match in 2024.\n\n“It doesn’t even come close because that day I played against Lazio, but I think playing against Roma or Lazio doesn’t feel the same,” he admitted.\n\n“I want to see the Olimpico full of Roma fans and feel their passion. I can’t wait to make my debut in this stadium, and my biggest desire is to debut with a win. If I even score, I’d be perfect.”",

    "fullText": "Laces came out roaring and ready to reassert sole (or Solemates’?) claim to first place in the Unrivaled standings on Monday night. Yet, their eventual 67-62 win over Mist would not be as easy as it might have looked early on.\n\nUp 15-8 after a defensively-tilted first quarter, Laces maintained a comfortable margin as the offenses came alive in the second, up by nine points, 36-27, at the half. Alyssa Thomas already had tallied a double-double for the Solemates, with 10 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nwe got a BATTLE in on TNT rn 👀 pic.twitter.com/0fiFIXWj3l\n\n— Unrivaled Basketball (@Unrivaledwbb) February 3, 2026\n\nThe third quarter, however, belonged to Mist. And more specifically, it belonged to Arike Ogunbowale.\n\nOgunbowale ignited for one of her signature scoring eruptions, responsible for 12 of Mist’s 27 points in the period. Supported by a couple of 3s from Breanna Stewart and Veronica Burton, Mist was down by just a single point entering the fourth, 55-54. A late Thomas free throw gave Laces the lead after seven-straight points from Ogunbowale and Allisha Gray had pushed Mist ahead.\n\nWhen the fourth began, Laces would expand on that slight edge.\n\nNaz Hillmon, who had just three points through three quarters, scored the first six points for Laces, which were balanced by a single bucket from Mist. Naz’s efforts put Laces just five points away from the 66-point target score.\n\nA triple from Gray brought Mist within striking distance before two scores from Thomas set up Jackie Young to finish the job for Laces.\n\nAT earned Player of the Game honors, finishing with a season-high 20 points, 11 rebounds, four assists and three steals. It was an all-round, stat-stuffing effort exemplary of The Engine. Ogunbowale’s 17 points led Mist, with Stewart finishing with 16 points and nine boards.\n\nAt 7-2, Laces exit Week 4 atop the standings, with 6-3 Mist falling into third place, as Phantom, also at 6-3, has the head-to-head advantage over the Misties.\n\nIt’s been a rough Unrivaled rookie season for Sonia Citron.\n\nAfter her seemingly seamless transition to the WNBA, Citron’s 3-point stroke has been off in Unrivaled, with her shooting struggles exacerbating the overall challenges Hive has faced in their inaugural Unrivaled season.\n\nOn Monday night, Soni had her long-awaited Unrivaled breakout. She scored 32 points, going 12-for-18 from the field and 4-for-7 from 3. She also contributed five assists, two blocks and a steal.\n\nUnfortunately, Citron’s stellar night was not enough for Hive, as Vinyl prevailed 74-71 in the back-and-forth affair.\n\nThis one was tight from the jump, and would feature 11 lead changes and 13 ties. Vinyl’s balance, however, overcame not only Citron’s big game, but also a huge double-double from Monique Billings, who finished with 23 points and 15 rebounds for Hive.\n\nFive members of Vinyl scored in double figures, led by Rae Burrell’s 18 points. Burrell, who made two 3s and added three assists, three assists and a block, showed that her Saturday star turn was not an outlier, earning her second-straight Player of the Game honor. Dearica Hamby contributed 14 points and eight boards, while Rhyne Howard dished seven assists, her Unrivaled career-high, to go with her 10 points.\n\nVinyl entered the fourth up 63-59, as a Brittney Griner bucket as the third quarter expired seemed to set the club up to take control and cruise to the 74-point target score. Citron had other ideas, striving to singularly drag Hive to victory with 10 points in period, including a 3-pointer that pulled her club within one point of Hive, 72-71, and within three points of the target. With a stop, Hive would have the chance to steal the win.\n\nHoward turned on her aggression on Vinyl’s next possession, driving at Citron. Rhyne missed, but a somewhat questionable foul called on Citron sent Howard to the line. Rhyne sunk the free throw to secure the game for Vinyl, keeping the now 4-5 club in position for a playoff berth.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona are moving closer to securing one of the most promising midfielders in their youth system, with 16-year-old Hugo Garces on the verge of renewing his commitment to the club.\n\nAccording to SPORT, talks between both parties are progressing smoothly, and confidence is growing that an agreement will be finalised soon.\n\nGarces has been part of Barcelona’s academy setup since the summer of 2021, when he arrived from Zaragoza to join the Under-12s.\n\nSince then, his development has followed a steady upward curve, earning him recognition as one of the standout midfield profiles in La Masia.\n\nIn his early years at the club, Garces was often compared to Thiago Alcantara due to his technical quality, close control, and ability to dictate play in tight spaces.\n\nHowever, as his game has evolved, his style has taken on a more dynamic edge. Today, his profile is seen as closer to that of Gavi, particularly in terms of intensity, physical bravery, and his willingness to attack the box.\n\nRight-footed and similar in height to the Barcelona midfielder, Garces combines creativity with aggression.\n\nHugo Garces is close to signing a new contract with Barcelona. (Picture courtesy: Instagram/@h.garcees.10)\n\nAs of today, Barcelona are keen for Garces to sign his first professional contract as soon as possible.\n\nHaving turned 16 last month, he is now legally eligible to do so, and the club see this as a priority.\n\nInternally, there is full alignment between Barça and the player. Garces is said to be completely committed to the club, where he has grown both as a footballer and as a person.\n\nWhile the midfield pathway to the first team is highly competitive, those who follow his progress closely highlight one trait above all else: confidence.\n\nGarces plays with personality, belief, and a winning mindset, qualities that often separate good youth players from those capable of making the final step.\n\nNegotiations are not yet formally closed, but only minor details remain. If everything goes according to plan, Barcelona will soon have another key academy talent tied down as part of their long-term sporting vision.",

    "fullText": "Estevao has been an increasingly important player for Chelsea this season, and he’s already started two games against Arsenal in 2025/26. If ready and available, the expectation would be that he’d be in the lineup at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night too.\n\nBut the 18-year-old missed Chelsea’s match against West Ham United on Saturday due to a personal matter, and Liam Rosenior admitted on Monday that he doesn’t know whether the player will be back for Arsenal.\n\n“I don’t know yet,” Rosenior confirmed. “He is a young kid who has come and been magnificent. He is going through a really difficult time for personal reasons and is on compassionate leave.”\n\n“I won’t put any pressure on him,” Rosenior added. “It has to be right for him and he has to feel in the right place to perform for this team.”\n\nChelsea will also be without Jamie Gittens, who will miss out on the chance to play against Arsenal for the third time in a row.\n\nGittens was benched in the Premier League game at Stamford Bridge, he was ill for the semi-final first leg, and he’s now picked up a hamstring injury. It’s likely Pedro Neto and Alejandro Garnacho will start if Estevao is also unavailable.\n\nChelsea’s gigantic squad will also be without some other players through injury, with Levi Colwill, Dario Essugo, Tosin Adarabioyo, Romeo Lavia, and Mykhailo Mudryk ruled out, and goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen 50/50 to return.\n\nBut none of those are new absentees, and most of Chelsea’s first-choice team should be available.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid could head into their upcoming league trip to Valencia with a significantly reinforced squad, as several key defenders edge closer to a return.\n\nAccording to a positive update from MARCA, the likes of Antonio Rudiger, Trent Alexander-Arnold, and Ferland Mendy are all expected to be available if everything progresses as planned.\n\nThe timing could hardly be better for Alvaro Arbeloa, who has been dealing with defensive instability in recent weeks.\n\nReal Madrid will travel to Mestalla knowing that solidity at the back will be crucial against a Valencia side that traditionally raises its level at home.\n\nAmong the potential returnees, Rudiger’s comeback stands out as particularly important.\n\nThis is because with Eder Militao ruled out until at least March, the German international is viewed as the most reliable option to anchor the defence.\n\nBeyond his physical presence, Rudiger offers leadership and authority, qualities Arbeloa values highly both on the pitch and in the dressing room.\n\nMendy is likely to return this weekend. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nMendy’s possible return also provides a welcome balance.\n\nWhile the Frenchman is not known for his attacking output, his defensive discipline has long been one of his strongest attributes.\n\nIn matches where control and positional awareness are vital, Mendy’s presence gives Real Madrid a level of security that few alternatives can match.\n\nThe situation surrounding Alexander-Arnold, who has returned to training for a while now, is slightly more complex.\n\nThe England international’s start to life in Madrid was promising, with regular appearances early in the campaign, but injuries soon disrupted his rhythm.\n\nAs the season progressed, those physical setbacks prevented Alexander-Arnold from fully establishing himself. Now, his return comes with added pressure.\n\nHe is eager to accumulate minutes, aware that his place in Real Madrid’s plans, as well as in the England squad for the World Cup, depends heavily on staying fit and contributing consistently.\n\nIf all three players are included in the squad against Valencia, Arbeloa will finally have more experienced options at his disposal.",

    "description": "The Trojan women's guards played well once again and got two wins, while Ezra Ausar dominated the paint against Rutgers and helped the men win",
    "fullText": "Women's basketball took care of business at USC. The Women of Troy secured two wins due to great guard play. For the men, transfer guard Kam Woods had an elite performance get spoiled, but Ezra Ausar led the Trojans to a victory to bounce back from a devastating loss to Iowa. In the NBA, two Trojans shined and represented USC to the best of their abilities.\n\nHere are my top performers across hoops this past week for USC, both in college and the NBA:\n\nJazzy Davidson was her usual elite self, as she posted 21 points, 8 assists, and 2 steals in the victory over Iowa earlier in the week. Versus Rutgers in the blowout win yesterday, Davidson stuffed the stat sheet, leading the Trojans with 16 points, 9 rebounds, 5 assists, and 3 steals. Davidson has been a model of consistency, and this week the wins followed her stellar performances.\n\nKara Dunn had yet another impressive week. Dunn vs the Hawkeyes on Thursday had a team-leading 25 points, 12 rebounds, and 5 assists. Against Rutgers in the win Sunday night, Dunn led the team once again with 18 points and 6 rebounds. She continues to be the star of this season alongside Jazzy Davidson.\n\nOn Wednesday, transfer Kam Woods tried to take matters into his own hands vs Iowa. Woods put up 33 points, 4 steals, and only missed 5 of his 17 shots. It was a great showing for Woods, who made the most of his opportunity that night. He single-handedly beat the Trojans in a tight distance and gave USC a chance to pull off another big upset in conference. Unfortunately, Woods' stellar night was outshone by a devastating loss.\n\nEzra Ausar had himself a modest performance on Wednesday in a loss to Iowa. In the Trojans game following their loss, Ausar showed up big time. Ausar led the Trojans to victory with 21 points, 7 rebounds, and 1 steal. He was the consistent star the Trojans needed, and he dominated the paint all night long. When he is effective, and he is having a confident night, the Trojans, like on Saturday, come out on top.\n\nNo Keyonte George, no problem. In his first start of the season, Collier stepped up big with 19 points, 7 assists, and 2 steals. Collier was consistent in scoring this past week, reaching double figures each game. It was not just his scoring either, he was an elite facilitator posting at least 6 assists in each of the 4 games this past week. He had success defensively, having a 4-steal game on Wednesday. The Jazz should have the utmost confidence in Isaiah Collier as he continues to make an impact on both ends of the court.\n\nDeMar DeRozan turned back the clock this past week. Derozan had two 30-point games this past week, one of which came yesterday as he dropped 32 on 10-16 shooting. He also had a 25-point performance with 8 assists in the battle vs the 76ers that resulted in a game-winning basket by Tyrese Maxey. Any good performance Derozan has does not correlate to his team winning games, it just correlates to his trade value growing. With a week like this past week, DeRozan can be on his way to playing for a contending team.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Top USC basketball performers in college hoops and NBA, February 3",

    "fullText": "Benjamin Sesko came up with the biggest goal of his Manchester United career so far in the 3-2 win against Fulham.\n\nThe Slovenian forward joined United in August, having made no secret of his desire to one day play for the club. He was thrilled to make it happen.\n\nThe six-year interest the Red Devils showed in Sesko appears to be yielding positive results, demonstrating the commitment of both the club and the player.\n\nThe 22-year-old has already scored six goals for the club, with four coming in 2026 alone. Despite not yet starting a game under Michael Carrick, he has managed to find form and consistency.\n\nAnd his powerful finish against Fulham not only gave United a lead but also brought out a huge reaction from the crowd and his teammates.\n\nSesko’s goal kept Manchester United’s run going under Carrick and underlined the kind of presence he can have in front of goal.\n\nThe Slovenian striker looks to be playing with more belief lately, and any early concerns from fans seem to have faded away.\n\nFormer United defender Rio Ferdinand expressed his delight for Sesko on his YouTube channel, noting that he had received encouraging updates from Carrington about the No. 30.\n\nThe former centre-back said: “What I would say about him from people on the training ground is his attitude is first class.\n\n“He’s in every day, early, ready to prepare for training, ready to do the extras before training, getting his body right, to make sure that he’s ready to go out there and give his best every day in training, no stone is left unturned.\n\n“And they say especially for a young kid, his mindset and his attitude has been first class.”\n\nThe celebrations following Sesko’s stoppage time winner were no surprise according to Ferdinand. The squad was clearly happy for him.\n\n“That’s why you see the guys in the changing room raring about on the pitch reacting to his goal in the way that they were all so happy for him.\n\n“You only get that type of reaction when they go, ‘you know what? He’s likable, and you must be a good kid, and you must show traits of someone who works really hard’.\n\n“So good luck to him, man. I want him to do well.”\n\nSesko is pushing for more minutes at Manchester United but faces a tough challenge in Bryan Mbeumo, who has been in good form.\n\nWith limited opportunities, he has had to be patient and make the most of his chances. His last two goals have both come off the bench.\n\nFerdinand truly believes Sesko can be the long-term answer for Man United’s striker position, as he said: “He’s got all the attributes you’d want in your number nine, by the way, modern day player.\n\n“He’s big, he’s strong, he’s athletic, he’s agile, he’s got a clean strike.”",

    "description": "Caleb Williams' top offensive lineman, Joe Thuney, is a finalist for protector of the year. Thuney helped Caleb and Ben Johnson revive the Bears",
    "fullText": "Caleb Williams was sacked 68 times last season, the highest in the NFL. Caleb Williams was unable to show what he showed this season due to coaching and the offensive line being downright atrocious. Ryan Poles ensured to fix both last offseason.\n\nThat, in fact, he did complete both. The Bears' offensive line gained 4 new starters, and the Bears hired the most sought-after coach in the coaching cycle. Ben Johnson and Caleb Williams will get a lot of credit for turning this team into a winner early, but trading for Joe Thuney, a proven winner, made a huge impact as well. The rest of the league recognized that, as he was named a finalist for protector of the year.\n\nIn a recent Bears Wire article, Alyssa Barbieri breaks down the impact of Joe Thuney on the Bears this season and Caleb's initial reaction to his best offensive lineman getting recognized:\n\n\"Thuney helped anchor one of the best offensive lines in the NFL and played a huge role in the Bears going 11-6, winning the NFC North and beating the Green Bay Packers in the wild-card playoffs. Thuney was named First-Team All-Pro and earned a Pro Bowl nod for his impressive outing in 2025. In 17 games, Thuney allowed zero sacks, one hit and 15 pressures and was only penalized twice. He played 1,149 offensive snaps, the second-most of any guard in the league, per Pro Football Focus.\"\n\n\"As a result, Thuney was nominated for the NFL's first ever Protector of the Year award, alongside Denver Broncos tackle Garrett Bolles and guard Quinn Meinerz, Miami Dolphins center Aaron Brewer, Kansas City Chiefs center Creed Humphrey, and Detroit Lions tackle Penei Sewell. Thuney's quarterback Caleb Williams took to Instagram to celebrate Thuney's nomination and gave him the ultimate praise.\n\n\"Best in the world!\" Williams wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"Williams was the main beneficiary of the overhaul of the offensive line with the additions of Thuney, Jonah Jackson, Drew Dalman and rookie Ozzy Trapilo. But Thuney continues to show, even after 10 years, that he's still one of the best in the game, and Williams will still have him blocking for him for the next few years.\"\n\nIn his rookie season, it was a season full of \"his o-line is not giving him any help\" and many other excuses as to why his play did not match the player many thought would be coming out of USC. This season, the Caleb Williams that lit it up at USC was seen a whole lot on the field, terrorizing defenses because of how good Joe Thuney and the rest of the offensive line were.\n\nCaleb avoided his fair share of sacks, but he was confident and able to be that superstar quarterback because he was confident in Joe Thuney and company. Other than drafting Caleb Williams, trading for Joe Thuney has to be the best move Ryan Poles has made in his tenure as Bears GM. Caleb Williams recognized Thuney's impact, as well as the rest of the NFL does too.\n\nJoe Thuney blocked for championship-winning quarterbacks and all-time greats Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes. Caleb Williams, if he keeps up with where he is headed, he can join that tier of guys and be the next winning quarterback Joe Thuney blocks for.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Caleb Williams, Bears took big step forward because of Joe Thuney",

    "fullText": "The transfers of Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz were two of the biggest in Liverpool's history.\n\nThe duo were seen as the best way for Liverpool to take their next step and to even replace Mohamed Salah in the future.\n\nAnd, while Wirtz is finally getting back to his best, it's clear that some new signings still need to be made at Liverpool.\n\nThis has caused plenty of confusion among the football world, with Paul Merson now slamming the recruitment process undertaken by Hughes.\n\n\"With all the money Liverpool have spent, the squad looks wafer-thin,\" Merson told Sky Sports in quotes relayed by The Mirror.\n\n\"Looking at it now, they got it horribly wrong in the summer.\n\n\"By going bang, bang with a load of attackers and thinking they were going to dominate English football for the next four or five years, it's backfired.\"\n\nEven though attackers were needed to replace Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz at Liverpool, they still spent far too much money.\n\nIsak and Wirtz alone cost the Anfield outfit around £240 million, which, for any team is a massive chunk of change.\n\nThe Reds have often spent their money wisely and have chosen to upgrade multiple areas of their squad, rather than splashing the cash in one place.\n\nAlthough the chances of a new player arriving before January's deadline day look slim, that doesn't mean that they can't eye up potential targets for the 2026-27 summer window.\n\nHowever, if Hughes, Slot and Edwards do end up drafting up a shortlist of potential targets, they must ensure that their entire squad is benefitting, rather than just one area of it.\n\nOtherwise, they could end up in the same situation all over again next year.",

    "description": "Former LSU cornerback Mansoor Delane is expected to be selected early in the 2026 NFL Draft. Here are three ideal fits for the former Tiger.",
    "fullText": "Former LSU football cornerback Mansoor Delane made his mark during his lone season at LSU, earning first-team All-American honors and finishing as a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, which is given to the nation’s top defensive back.\n\nHis impressive 2025 campaign has firmly put him in the conversation for an early first-round pick in the NFL Draft in April. Where he might come off the board is up for debate, with some mock drafts having him go in the early to mid-teens, while one recent mock draft had him taken in the top five.\n\nThe goal of this piece is to take a look at some teams that fit the former Tiger best, but his notoriety limits the options to some extent. It’s highly unlikely Delane makes it past the middle of the first round, so we’re going to limit the available options to teams who are projected to be within range to select him.\n\nThis isn’t only a great fit because Delane would be joining two former Tigers in Cincinnati, though that certainly heightens the intrigue for LSU fans. The Bengals had one of the NFL’s worst passing defenses in 2025, ranking in the bottom quartile of the league in passing EPA/Play, passing success rate allowed, and explosive pass percentage allowed, according to ESPN’s Sam Hoppen.\n\nGiving them a corner with Delane’s talent has proven to be a major factor in turning around defenses in the past, and there are few in the league who need that sort of talent injection more than Cincinnati.\n\nThe Rams were one of the NFL’s best teams this season, and a draft-day trade with the Falcons last offseason landed them what has become the 13th overall pick. Although their defense certainly wasn’t a terrible unit by league standards, their passing defense certainly wasn’t a strength, allowing 7.6 yards per pass attempt this season.\n\nMany mock drafts have the Rams selecting Tennessee cornerback Jermod McCoy over Delane, but Delane feels like the more likely — and smart — pick. This Rams team wants to maximize its Super Bowl window while Matthew Stafford is still playing, and McCoy didn’t play a snap in 2025 due to an injury during the 2024 college football playoff. Despite concerns about Delane’s size and athleticism, he offers the Rams elite coverage play that they don’t have to draft based on year-old tape.\n\nThe Jets are a distinctly different situation from the Rams. This isn’t a team trying to max out a Super Bowl window; it’s a team that’s trying to reload a defensive roster that’s devoid of talent. The draft strategy that works best for a team like this is taking the best player available, and if Delane is still on the board at 16, he certainly qualifies.\n\nAdditionally, Delane would be a great fit for Aaron Glenn’s man-coverage-heavy defense. According to Pro Football Focus, Delane posted the second-best man-coverage grade among Power Four cornerbacks in 2025, meshing perfectly with a Jets defense that ran man coverage fourth-most in the league this season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Three likely draft destinations for LSU football corner Mansoor Delane",

    "fullText": "It’s finally official: top featherweight contenders Movsar Evloev and Lerone Murphy will fight each other in the main event of UFC London, going down on March 21st, 2026.\n\nEvloev and Murphy are ranked No. 1 and No. 3 respectively on the 145 pound rankings, and champion Alexander Volkanovski has been calling for a fight against one or another since he beat No. 2 ranked Diego Lopes the first time in April 2025. But as of now there’s no guarantee the winner of Evloev vs. Murphy will get the next shot at Volk.\n\nLerone Murphy discussed the situation with Ariel Helwani, revealing there was no title shot guarantee that came with the main event booking.\n\n“Eeeeh, at this point, words are wind, innit?” Murphy said. “The division is forever changing. It’s a performance-based company, someone’s got to go out there and put on a good fight and then? Nothing’s concrete. But I hope so.”\n\nThe UFC has been hyper-focused on excitement as a metric for earning title shots, and Murphy suggested it would be hard to earn an exciting win off an opponent like Movsar Evloev.\n\n“I believe the matchmakers know what kind of match this is,” he said. “I think it would be unfair to say you’ve got to go out there and get a crazy knockout to get a title shot. Everybody knows what kind of fight this is going to be and what type of fighter I’m fighting against. So I think the winner should be undeniably next in line for the title. Simple.”\n\nIf there’s one person out there banging the drum for Movsar or Lerone to get a shot, it’s Alexander Volkanovski himself. If excitement and popularity is the metric, then it would be easy for UFC to slot No. 6 ranked Jean Silva into a title fight. But “The Great” is clearly unenthused about that fight.\n\n“You’ve got Silva obviously probably trying to get his name out there,” Volkanovski said in a new interview. “Now he’s saying some stuff and thinking he really deserves next. If the UFC obviously were to push that for me, everyone knows me. I’ll fight anyone. But I don’t think that’s very likely to happen.”\n\n“I don’t think he’s in a position to fight for the title, especially when you’ve got Lerone Murphy and Movsar Evloev fighting very, very soon. I think that’s very clear.”\n\nOnly if you’re looking at things in terms of win streaks and rankings and not social media popularity and action. The winner of Murphy vs. Evloev may leave London with a ten fight win streak compared to Silva’s one. But Silva surfed on his opponent’s back at the end of his last fight, which we must admit was pretty cool.\n\nCool enough to earn a title shot? In today’s UFC, maybe.",

    "fullText": "Dana White’s latest venture into boxing might be about to shake up the sport in a big way, with reports suggesting Zuffa Boxing is closing in on a fight fans have wanted for years.\n\nSo far, Zuffa Boxing has only put on two shows. But given White’s long track record of promoting major events in combat sports, there’s already plenty of buzz around what he could bring to boxing. That reputation now faces a real test, as talks are swirling around what could be one of the sport’s most anticipated matchups.\n\nAccording to BoxingScene, the matchup between Nate Diaz and Paulie Malignaggi has been verbally agreed, marking one of the more unexpected turns this year. The two have a history going back several years over comments Malignaggi made about Nate and Nick Diaz.\n\nTyson Fury and Anthony Joshua have been linked to a fight for years without ever sharing the ring. The closest they came was an early sparring session during their youth, long before their professional careers took off. That may be about to change, though.\n\nIt is being reported by BoxingScene that Dana White is planning to stage the fight on Zuffa Boxing, with Netflix likely to broadcast it. Reports suggest that Netflix will also be involved in Fury’s upcoming April fight against Arslanbek Makhmudov, adding to their growing presence in live sports.\n\nA car accident last year left Joshua injured and cost him two close friends. However, he has since returned to training and recently released a video addressing the loss of his friends and his journey back.\n\nFury hasn’t fought since back-to-back defeats against Oleksandr Usyk in Saudi Arabia. Joshua’s last appearance was a knockout win over Jake Paul on another Netflix card just days before his accident.\n\nDana White didn’t hold back his excitement after Zuffa Boxing 2, hinting that the promotion is ready to make some noise in the industry. Speaking at the post-fight press conference, he suggested big news is on the way.\n\n“We have some pretty crazy announcements coming over the next few weeks,” he said, without naming any specific dates or fighters. “I’m way further in this thing than I anticipated being two shows in.”\n\nWhite added: “There’s a lot going on to rock the industry – new signings, more deals, new territories. I’m telling you guys by the end of 2026, it’s going to be impressive.”\n\nWhite has plenty of experience in boxing promotion already. He was involved with Tom Loeffler’s work for Callum Walsh, including a Dublin event in 2024 and also promoted last year’s Canelo Alvarez vs Terence Crawford bout.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are keeping close tabs on RB Leipzig teenager Yan Diomande, who is considered one of the best prospects in Europe at the moment.\n\nThe 19-year-old was born and raised in the Ivory Coast, but started his career in the United States at the academies of Yulee Hornets and DME. In January 2025, he entered the European scene through the gates of Leganes and swiftly managed to grab the limelight, especially following a particularly delightful performance against Real Madrid.\n\nLast summer, RB Leipzig splashed €20 million to secure his services after receiving the nod of approval from Jurgen Klopp.\n\nSince then, he has established himself as one of the most exciting players in the Bundesliga and has also been labelled as the best product for the Red Bull system since Man City striker Erling Haaland. This season, has contributed with eight goals and six assists in 21 appearances for the German club.\n\nAs reported earlier today, David Ornstein confirmed that Man Utd’s plans for next summer include signing a new left winger, especially after missing out on Antoine Semenyo last month.\n\nLast summer, United shelled out £62.5 million on Matheus Cunha, who has been justifying this figure with his impressive displays. Nonetheless, the club still needs an additional option down the left flank, having parted ways with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.\n\n(Photo by Maja Hitij/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Manchester World reporter Rich Fay, Diomande is an early favourite for this role.\n\nIt should also be noted that Fabrizio Romano had revealed that Man Utd and Tottenham are among several European clubs that scouted Diomande this season.\n\nWith his blistering pace and effortless ability to skip past his marker, the young Ivorian has been an absolute menace for opposition players.\n\nIn a past interview, Diomande revealed that, despite his academy training, he remains a street player at heart.\n\n“I played in the streets. I still play when I go home – sometimes with friends. I like to say: I left the streets, but the streets did not leave me. It is still part of me,” said the Abidjan native.\n\nMoreover, Diomande is a good friend of Amad Diallo, who would help him adjust to life at Carrington. The two wingers play on opposite flanks for the Ivorian national team, causing havoc for their opponents.\n\nWhile we can expect several twists and turns between now and the summer, the Leipzig wonderkid is certainly one to keep a close eye on in the coming months.",

    "fullText": "Ireland hooker Dan Sheehan says there is \"confidence\" in the players still available for Thursday's opening Six Nations match against France in Paris (20:10 GMT).\n\nHead coach Andy Farrell named his team for the game on Tuesday morning and is without several usual starters through injury.\n\nTadhg Furlong, Hugo Keenan, Ryan Baird and Mack Hansen are all out through injury, while Bundee Aki is suspended.\n\nPerhaps most problematic is the absence of not just usual loose-head Andrew Porter but also his two primary back-ups in Paddy McCarthy and Jack Boyle.\n\nIn their place, Jeremy Loughman will win a first cap since the 2024 Six Nations, with his Munster colleague Michael Milne providing cover from the bench.\n\n\"We have confidence in the people we have,\" said Sheehan.\n\n\"We have done a good job of building some good depth over the years and we have got some loose-heads that have caps.\n\n\"Some teams would struggle [with the injuries] but I think we have good depth and people to come in. I don't think much has changed and there has been no sense of panic.\"\n\nDespite concerns over front row depth with Ireland down their three first-choice loose-heads, and starting tight-head Tadhg Furlong missing at least the opener, Sheehan's own position of hooker is one where Farrell has an enviable set of options.\n\nSheehan will start ahead of his Leinster team-mate Ronan Kelleher in Paris with Ulster's Tom Stewart also having impressed for Ulster this year.\n\n\"We have some top-quality young hookers across the provinces now,\" Sheehan continued.\n\n\"If you look at a few years ago, maybe people said there was a shortage, but I think all the provinces are producing quality hookers and that drives everyone on.\"\n\nThe past four editions of the Six Nations have been won by either Ireland or Les Bleus. Farrell's side haven't won against Thursday's hosts at the Stade de France since 2018, although did beat Scotland and South Africa at the ground during the 2023 World Cup.\n\n\"When people ask \"where is your favourite away stadium?\", it is the Stade de France, it is a great atmosphere,\" Sheehan added.\n\n\"The Six Nations is always so special, it is always the best two months of the year.\n\n\"[The start of the year can be] some boring months, but it always gives people a lift and us a lift.

    "fullText": "Growing discussion around Manchester City and life after Pep Guardiola has moved firmly into the open, with The Telegraph reporting that Xabi Alonso is expected to feature on a three man shortlist to succeed the Catalan. Despite public denials from City sources, there is an unmistakable sense across Premier League circles that contingency planning has begun.\n\nCity’s recent wobble has sharpened the focus. A damaging draw at Tottenham, having led by two goals, left them six points adrift of Arsenal and fuelled questions about whether Guardiola’s era is reaching its natural conclusion. Rivals sense vulnerability, while internally there is acknowledgement that even dynasties require succession.\n\nGuardiola’s position remains officially secure. City announced in November 2024 that he had signed a two year extension through to 2027, a statement designed to quell speculation. Yet football operates as much on mood as on paperwork. Guardiola’s absence from media duties following a return to Barcelona for a speech supporting Palestinian children added to the sense of distance during a pivotal week.\n\nCity have dismissed talk of his departure as “pure speculation”, but speculation has rarely travelled this far without oxygen. One source quoted by Telegraph Sport offered a telling observation: “Tottenham were there for the taking, but City weren’t ruthless. They let them off the hook. Some of the players look like they think Pep is leaving at the end of the season and, as a result, they are going through the motions.”\n\nAlonso, recently dismissed by Real Madrid, is viewed as a coach of stature and composure, capable of handling elite environments. His association with Liverpool adds edge to the narrative, particularly with Arne Slot under pressure to deliver Champions League qualification. City already moved ahead of Liverpool for Marc Guéhi and Antoine Semenyo, and repeating that trick for Alonso would sting.\n\nEnzo Maresca, once Guardiola’s assistant, is also expected to be considered. Recently dismissed by Chelsea, Maresca had informed Chelsea of talks with City and Juventus. His candidacy is complicated by timing and competition, but familiarity counts.\n\nAnother name gaining traction is Cesc Fabregas, admired for his work at Como, who sit sixth in Serie A. Fabregas is expected to leave only for an elite role, and City would qualify.\n\nFormer City captain Vincent Kompany is not expected to leave Bayern Munich, having extended his deal to 2029 and embedded himself in transfer planning. Roberto De Zerbi, previously admired, faces uncertainty at Marseille after Champions League disappointment.\n\nResponsibility for shaping the shortlist will fall to Hugo Viana, City’s director of football, whose relationship with super agent Jorge Mendes brings additional intrigue. Guardiola himself may yet be consulted, an echo of the club’s preference for continuity and control.\n\nFor now, nothing is decided. But elite clubs plan before they are forced to act. City are doing precisely that.\n\nThere is pride in what Guardiola has built and anxiety at the thought of losing the defining figure of the modern club. Six league titles, relentless standards and a global identity do not vanish cleanly.\n\nAt the same time, succession planning feels sensible rather than disloyal. Fans understand that even Guardiola will not stay forever, and the idea that City are calmly mapping the future is reassuring. Alonso appeals as a thinker and a leader, someone who respects structure and intelligence, values City supporters recognise. Maresca offers continuity, Fabregas imagination.\n\nWhat would concern fans more is drift. The quote about players “going through the motions” resonates because City have always thrived on intensity and clarity. If Guardiola is staying, supporters want renewed conviction. If he is going, then decisive planning matters.\n\nUltimately, City fans trust the hierarchy. The club has earned belief that transitions will be managed with foresight rather than panic, and that whoever follows Guardiola will inherit a platform built to keep winning.",

    "fullText": "To this point in the season, we haven’t had a ton of major upsets among the top teams in the country. In fact, the top 10 teams in the AP poll have a combined 16 losses, an average of 1.6 per team. That means one of two things – either the teams at the top of the sport have really separated themselves from the rest of the nation, or they’re due for some regression! Let’s see what happens over the next month and a half!\n\nThe Wolfpack have really hit their stride as of late, running their offense behind a pick-and-roll and pick-and-pop scheme with Quadir Copeland handling the ball, Derrion Williams setting the screen, and Paul McNeil and Tre Hollomon spacing the floor. It’s fun to watch, and I don’t think that SMU is going to have any answers for it, lacking the personnel to switch on the screen.\n\nMORE: ESPN, NFL finalize billion-dollar media deal after government approval\n\nThe year is 2026, and the Blue Demons finally have a home-court advantage. In Big East play, DePaul has only lost once at home, and it was to the top-of-the-conference UConn Huskies. CJ Gunn is the type of scorer who can catch fire and ignite an entire arena, and I think Tuesday is the night when DePaul is officially back on the map.\n\nCross-country road trips have meant doom in the Big Ten this season. Here we have Iowa traveling to the Pacific Northwest to take on a healthy and rejuvenated Washington team with Wesley Yates and Jacob Ognacevic back. Plus, the stylings of Ben McCollum generally lead to low-possession games where upsets are more likely.\n\nThe Redhawks are still unbeaten heading into February, but they are starting to show some cracks. On Saturday, they trailed Northern Illinois by double-digits before coming back to win. In the first meeting between these two teams, Miami needed overtime and then a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to come out victorious on their home floor. Now the game is in Buffalo, and the Bulls are hungry for revenge.\n\nWinning in the Fertitta Center is never easy, but if Johnny Dawkins’ squad is good enough to beat Texas Tech, they can take down Houston, too. Stylistically, I think this is a good matchup for UCF. Houston loves to blitz and trap ball screens, and UCF has smart ball-handlers who should be able to handle the pressure and make good decisions. I think it’s quite likely that UCF’s forwards can get Houston into foul trouble.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo’s mom hints at next NBA team\n\nMLB: Mets sign former Dodgers World Series champion\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: Mattress Mack reveals massive $2 million Super Bowl 60 wager\n\nENTERTAINMENT: WWE star calls Pat McAfee to reveal shocking 2026 Royal Rumble return\n\nVIRAL: Kendall Jenner halts interview for Tom Brady Super Bowl 60 prediction on FaceTime\n\nThe post Predicting upsets in College Basketball this week  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots will play for Super Bowl 60 on Sunday, Feb. 8, in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nAnd these teams have a lot in common.\n\nYes, as Bear Bryant once famously said, \"defensive wins championships.\"\n\nThe Seahawks are coached by Mike Macdonald, former NFL defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Patriots are coaches by Mike Vrabel, former NFL defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Seahawks are 6th in the NFL in total defense.\n\nThe Patriots are 8th in the NFL in total defense.\n\nThe Seahawks are 3rd in the NFL in run defense.\n\nThe Patriots are 7th in the NFL in run defense.\n\nWhat's my point? The Miami Dolphins must build up their defense to have a chance to compete at this level.\n\nThe Dolphins have made one step in the right direction, hiring strong Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley as their leader.\n\nHafley has already been preaching all the right things about toughness, physicality and relentlessness.\n\nHafley has said the notion of the Dolphins as a \"soft\" team basically makes him sick.\n\nNow general manager Jon-Eric Sullivan must invest more into Miami's defense than offense.\n\nSpecifically, Sullivan must look to build Miami's defensive trenches.\n\nThe Seahawks and Patriots have invested on the interior defensive front, and it's paid dividends.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, the Seahawks are 12th in the NFL in average value of contract for defensive tackles.\n\nAnd the Patriots are 4th in the NFL in average value of contract for defensive tackles.\n\nIn so many words, pay up for the big boys. Pay up for the monsters who can penetrate up the middle and dominate against the run.\n\n\"You have to, to make sure that your line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball is big, tough, resilient and that there's depth,\" the Dolphins' GM Sullivan said, on the day he was introduced.\n\nIn their roster-building, the Seahawks and Patriots both leaned toward investments on defense.\n\nWhat if I told you Seattle was last in percentage of NFL cap devoted to offense in 2025?\n\nWhat if I told you New England was 24th in NFL cap spending on offense in 2025?\n\nThe pendulum is swinging in this league and it's swinging toward defense.\n\nThe Patriots are paying big bucks for interior linemen Milton Williams and Christian Barmore.\n\nThe Seahawks are paying big bucks for interior lineman Leonard Williams and used a recent first-rounder on Byron Murphy.\n\nThe Dolphins need to invest in big people, and especially big people on defense.\n\nSuper Bowl 60: 5 people with Miami connections to cheer for\n\nTop 5 positions: NFL draft, free agency needs for Miami Dolphins\n\nMiami Dolphins free agency: Top 5 players to prioritize; the salaries\n\nJoe Schad is a journalist covering the Miami Dolphins and the NFL at The Palm Beach Post.

    "fullText": "Former Milan and Juventus defender Mattia De Sciglio said he snubbed a move to Liverpool to move to Turin in 2017, but he felt ‘used’ by Vincenzo Montella at San Siro.\n\nFormer Italy international De Sciglio spoke about his career in an interview with Corriere della Sera.\n\nA product of the Milan academy, De Sciglio has also played for Juventus and Empoli in Serie A and Lyon in the French Ligue 1.\n\nThe 33-year-old has collected 208 appearances in Serie A and 28 in the Champions League.\n\n“I could have played for Inter as a kid,” De Sciglio said via Calciomercato.com.\n\n“They had called me for a trial, but I was dropped because I was too short. Milan arrived shortly afterwards, and I went through the youth sector until my Champions League debut at 18.”\n\nDe Sciglio was a Milan first-team player in one of the darkest moments in recent history, but feels the way he was treated at San Siro was unfair.\n\n“Some of the fans and the media identified me as the guilty one in that situation, and they were all waiting for a minimum error to criticise me,” he said.\n\n“My social media accounts were filled with insults and nasty comments, but I had always behaved well, so I didn’t understand.”\n\nDuring a Milan home game against Empoli in April 2017, he realised he had to leave the Rossoneri.\n\nDORTMUND, GERMANY – JUNE 18: Vincenzo Montella, Head Coach of Turkiye, gestures during the UEFA EURO 2024 group stage match between Turkiye and Georgia at Football Stadium Dortmund on June 18, 2024 in Dortmund, Germany.

It seemed just a way to use me to hide a difficult moment for the whole team,” De Sciglio said.\n\n“As I was leaving, a boos erupted all around me. That day, I realised I could no longer go on like that; my story with Milan was over.”\n\nTURIN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 02: Kenan Yildiz of Juventus battles for possession with Mattia De Sciglio of Empoli during the Serie A match between Juventus and Empoli at Allianz Stadium on February 02, 2025 in Turin, Italy.

    "description": "Murphy and Evloev will clash in the main event, but will the winner be next for featherweight king Alexander Volkanovski?",
    "fullText": "Lerone Murphy has admitted that his UFC London main event against Movsar Evloev may not be a No 1 contender’s fight, despite theories from many figures in MMA.\n\nOn 21 March, Manchester’s Murphy will face the Russian in a battle of unbeaten featherweights, with champion Alexander Volkanovski keen to face the winner.\n\nNaturally, then, many fans and pundits have been quick to dub the UFC London main event a No 1 contender’s bout, given Murphy and Evloev’s impressive records and Volkanovski’s desire to face either man.\n\nYet it isn’t always that simple in the UFC, as Murphy noted on Monday, shortly after his fight was announced. “Nothing’s concrete,” he said on The Ariel Helwani Show.\n\nStill, Murphy added: “But I hope so. The matchmakers know what type of match-up this is. Everyone knows what type of fight this is going to be, and what type of fighter I’m fighting against.\n\n“So, I think the winner should be undeniably next in line for the title. Simple.”\n\nMurphy, who will carry a 17-0-1 record into the O2 Arena, said of the 19-0 Evloev: “Movsar is elite. He’s a very good fighter, good everywhere, but I just believe I’m going to take him into deep waters.\n\n“It’s going to be defensive wrestling, an ambitious offence, and pressure him to make a mistake. I’ll be hunting for the knockout from bell to bell.”\n\nNews of the match-up came just two days after Volkanovski extended his second reign as featherweight champion with a win over Diego Lopes. Volkanovski outpointed Lopes to retain the title in the main event of UFC 325, nine months after beating the Brazilian in the same manner to win the vacant belt.\n\nAnd the Australian champion used his post-fight press conference to call for a fight with Murphy, 34, or Evloev, 31, next.\n\n“It hurt watching that fight, thinking I should have been there,” Murphy said. “It should have been me [...] I think if I was in there, I would have gotten the job done.\n\n“I see a lot of things in there that I would have been doing. I feel, right now, that I’m the best in the world at featherweight.\n\n“Volk is the guy I have the utmost respect for as a champion. If it were up to him, he would have fought me, and he’s going out there and fighting the next best. It’s how every champion should be. Hopefully I get the chance to share the Octagon with him.”\n\nMurphy last fought in August, taking on UFC debutant Aaron Pico. The Briton stopped the former Bellator star in stunning fashion, with a spinning back elbow, which led Volkanovski to call for a title defence against Murphy.\n\nMeanwhile, Evloev has not fought since December 2024, when he narrowly outpointed Aljamain Sterling, a former bantamweight champion in the UFC.",

    "description": "Rally Finland will offer WRC crews new challenges this year",
    "fullText": "The iconic Ouninpohja stage, regarded as one of most revered in the World Rally Championship, has been dropped from Rally Finland this year as part of an event itinerary revamp.\n\nThe 32.98km gravel rollercoaster, which has earned cult status over the years, made its return to Rally Finland in 2024 after a then-seven-year hiatus. Last year, the stage became the Super Sunday centrepiece as two runs through the test, in front of bumper crowds, provided the climax to the rally – which was won by Kalle Rovanpera.\n\nHowever, Rally Finland organisers have made significant changes to the route for this year’s event (30 July - 2 August), which will see Ouninpohja absent from the schedule. However, the the successful Super Sunday – one stage, two passes – concept that it started last year will remain in 2026.\n\nOuninpohja will be replaced by the 30km Himos-Jamsa stage, which will be run twice to conclude the rally. The stage opens on a fast Vaheri public road and transitions into narrower private roads in the middle section, and finishes spectacularly at the foot of the Himos ski slopes within a compact event village.\n\n“We have a strong ambition not to run the same route two years in a row. In 2026, 66% of the special stages are different compared to last year, and the rally must keep evolving to remain exciting for both drivers and spectators,” said Kai Tarkiainen, Rally Finland clerk of the course.\n\nAccording to the organisers “the 2026 route reflects both the 75-year history of Rally Finland and bold new openings. It features sections inspired by classic decades of the event, alongside roads that have never before been used in a FIA World Rally Championship event.”\n\nNew FIA regulations introduced for the current season require a more compact overall structure, with special stages now accounting for at least one quarter of the total itinerary. This has demanded significant structural solutions.\n\n“Stage lengths, liaison distances and geographical logic must all work together, but sporting quality is always the top priority,” said Kari Nuutinen, deputy clerk of the course responsible for the route.\n\n“We have now achieved a route that meets all requirements and remains extremely compact yet highly diverse.”\n\nThe most significant changes to the route take place on Friday, which features 127.94 competitive kilometres. Nearly half of the day’s roads have never been driven in the WRC era.\n\nFriday’s itinerary includes Laukaa run in a new direction, Saarikas, the all-new Sydanmaa special stage combining the former Sirkkamaki and Kalliokoski roads, the completely new Hoho stage, and the evening highlight, the Harju Super Special Stage in downtown Jyvaskyla.\n\nSaturday is built around a fast and rhythmical package, with liaison sections shortened to be more driver-friendly. The day starts near Jyvaskyla in Parkkola and continues through Paijala and Vastila before reaching Leustu in Korpilahti before Sunday’s climax.\n\nRally USA return edges closer for 2027 as WRC plans test\n\nMore than 10 tuners interested in joining WRC under 2027 rules\n\nHow Oliver Solberg picked up his “crazy dream” Monte Carlo win\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Seems like the Los Angeles Clippers could trade James Harden. Here are some potential landing spots before the NBA trade deadline.",
    "fullText": "James Harden has continued to be a huge help to the Los Angeles Clippers after the team's awful start, but he's sat out the past couple of games. Now? There's word via ESPN's Shams Charania that the Clips and Harden are \"working through whether the sides can find a deal by Thursday's trade deadline.\"\n\nEven at age 36, Harden is still averaging 25.4 ppg, 8.1 apg and 4.8 rpg. His contract situation? He's got a partially guaranteed contract this year and a player option for 2026-27. So that could be a factor for whomever acquires him.\n\nSo where could he go? Here's a list of some possible destinations as the 2026 NBA trade deadline approaches:\n\nThis is the team that's most linked to him, with Darius Garland heading to the Clippers. Why would the Cavs trade a much younger point guard? Well, maybe they think they have a shot at the Eastern Conference this season and perhaps they don't think Garland could be worth the money he could earn soon.\n\nThey need a point guard and someone to take some heat off Anthony Edwards. This is a move that would help a lot given their issues at point guard with an aging Mike Conley.\n\nThis feels like a darkhorse. The Raps have a lot of young talent, but what if they deal someone (RJ Barrett, perhaps?) for Harden and win a playoff series with him? I honestly don't know if the Raptors feel like they need to interrupt the growth they have as a young roster, but on paper, it might make sense.\n\nI saw the most tweets about this one. Harden gets back with Kevin Durant, returns to the team where he broke out as an MVP. Maybe he's happy being back in Houston? If the Rockets want to keep pace in the super-competitive West, this would be the move.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: James Harden landing spots with NBA trade rumors swirling",

    "fullText": "Following injuries to their first-choice centre-backs, Manchester City dipped into the transfer market to sign Marc Guehi in January. The defender has gone straight into the team in the Premier League, but he’s faced eligibility issues in the other competitions.\n\nIn the Champions League, Guehi couldn’t be added to City’s squad until after the League Phase, so he missed their final two games against Bodo/Glimt and Galatasaray. They’re now free to add him in for the knockout stages.\n\nBut before that, as City turn their attentions to the second leg of their League Cup semi-final, Guehi will be unavailable once again.\n\nManchester Evening News report that despite the cup-tied rules being changed this season, there’s a time restriction that means players could only become eligible for a new club before the first leg of the semi-final.\n\nAs Guehi only joined City afterwards, he’s ineligible for both Wednesday’s semi-final, and also for a potential final at Wembley.\n\nThe margins that Guehi has missed out by will be frustrating to the player and his new club. He joined City on January 19th, with City’s semi-final first leg against Newcastle United taking place on January 13th.\n\nIf he moved just one week earlier, Guehi would have been eligible for both Wednesday’s match and a potential final.\n\nOn the other hand, it does seem fair that Guehi misses out. The centre-back already had his chance in the League Cup, starting in wins over Millwall and Liverpool, before starting and scoring in Crystal Palace’s quarter-final defeat to Arsenal.\n\nIf Arsenal do make it to the final, it does seem odd that they might have had to eliminate Guehi for the second time in the same season.",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich’s young teenage talent Lennart Karl made it publicly clear that he dreams of playing for Real Madrid at some point in his career, and his decision to do so did not go down well.\n\nAfter his recent public admission, there were open calls for the Bavarians to exclude the player from their plans and push him to leave with many questioning his commitment to the club.\n\nFor Real Madrid, however, the development came as a welcome one as it can possibly aid them in any possible future signing.\n\nAs relayed by Defensa Central, Karl remains one of the top young profiles Real Madrid are monitoring ahead of the upcoming summer transfer window.\n\nAfter all, he is one of Europe’s finest talents in his position and is being scouted by several top clubs.\n\nLennart Karl is on Real Madrid’s radar. (Photo by Jasmin Walter/Getty Images)\n\nHe is seen as the next ‘Arjen Robben’, and his current valuation stands at close to €90 million. He is closely being watched by Real Madrid and the price tag is not completely out of reach, but there are other concerns that serve as hurdles to his immediate arrival.\n\nLos Blancos enter the summer with two clear priorities in mind – the central defence and the central midfield. While Karl is a midfielder by trade, he does not play in the same position that they are looking to strengthen.\n\nAn attacking midfielder by trade, the Bayern Munich star shares his profile with the likes of Jude Bellingham, Arda Guler and possibly even Brahim Diaz and Real Madrid do not see that department to be in an urgent need for reinforcement.\n\nThe 17-year-old’s current contract runs until 2028 and Bayern Munich will undoubtedly try and renew his deal amid interest from across Europe.\n\nIf Real Madrid decide to enter the race, they can sign him quite easily given the player’s desire. The question, however, is whether he fits into their financial and sporting plans.",

    "fullText": "Aerospace business and artificial intelligence firm to unite for IPO as world’s most valuable private company\n\nElon Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX has acquired his artificial intelligence business xAI, in a $1.25tn (£910bn) merger that consolidates part of Musk’s empire as SpaceX prepares to go public later this year.\n\nThe two companies announced the deal on Monday in a statement on SpaceX’s website, saying the merger would form “the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform”.\n\nSpaceX, one of the world’s most valuable private companies, will gain xAI properties such as its Grok chatbot and the social media platform X. The acquisition comes as Musk has pursued plans to put datacenters and solar-powered satellites in space as a means of powering artificial intelligence, an immense and exorbitantly expensive undertaking.\n\nThe deal reportedly valued SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, putting the combined business on course for a stock market float valuing it well in excess of $1tn. The float is expected to be timed for early summer to coincide with a planetary alignment and Musk’s birthday.\n\nMusk turns 55 on 28 June, around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other.\n\nThe announcement of the deal specifically cited Musk’s plans for space-based datacenters as a rationale for the deal.\n\n“Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial datacenters, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” the announcement said.\n\n“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale.”\n\nMusk has been increasingly intertwining parts of his businesses in recent months through deals and acquisitions. xAI acquired the platform X in an all-stock transaction in early 2025, and last month Tesla revealed that it planned to invest $2bn in xAI.\n\nBoth SpaceX and xAI have received staggering valuations in the past year. As SpaceX continues to dominate satellite launches and secure extensive contracts with the US federal government, it sent a letter to investors in December that revealed an expected value of $800bn for the company.\n\nDespite widespread backlash to xAI’s Grok AI tool over its promotion of racist ideology and spread of nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images of women and children, the artificial intelligence company has also grown its valuation amid the AI boom. It announced a $20bn Series E fundraise last month from major investors, which valued the company at $230bn.\n\nSpeculation and leaks about the deal, first reported by Reuters, have proliferated in recent days. Musk appeared to give vague confirmation of the acquisition earlier on Monday, writing simply “yes” in reply to a post on X that referenced reports of the merger.\n\nThe news is a positive diversion for Musk after Tesla released an earnings report last week that showed declining revenues and a struggling car business. A few days later, a Department of Justice release of 3m files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein showed Musk exchanging numerous friendly emails with the disgraced financier and making plans to visit his private island. Musk has not responded to Guardian inquiries about the latest Epstein emails.\n\nHe called the release of the emails a “distraction” on X and claimed that he was “well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name”.",

    "fullText": "CEO Alex Karp hails ‘iconic’ financial results despite criticism over contracts with ICE and homeland security\n\nPalantir celebrated its latest financial results on Monday, as the tech company blew past Wall Street expectations and continues to prop up the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants.\n\nPalantir has secured millions of dollars in federal contracts amid Trump’s crackdown on immigrants. The multibillion-dollar Denver-based firm creates tech focused on surveillance and analytics, to be used by the government agencies and private companies.\n\nPalantir’s biggest US customer is the Department of Defense; it also works with the Department of Homeland Security, and the majority of its revenue comes from deals with the federal government. Palantir reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m.\n\nPalantir has drawn further criticism over its role in the government’s immigration agenda, since federal immigration officers killed two protesters in Minneapolis last month.\n\nPalantir chief executive Alex Karp told CNBC in an interview Monday that Palantir helps protect sensitive data. “If you are critical of ICE, you should be out there protesting for more Palantir,” he said. “Our product, actually, in its core, requires people to conform with fourth amendment data protection.”\n\nThe company beat Wall Street expectations of $1.33bn with $1.41bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025. It reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.25 – which also surpassed Wall Street expectations of $0.23 in EPS. The company’s stocks jumped about 8% in after-hours trading after the release.\n\nKarp described the company’s growth on an earnings call as “one of the truly iconic performances in the history of corporate performance”. He wrote in a letter accompanying the earnings report that the $1.4bn in revenue generated in last year’s fourth quarter marks a new record – a 70% growth rate over the same period the year before.\n\n“We did this while supporting, in critical manner, some of the most interesting intricate, unusual, operations that the US government has been involved in – many of which we can’t comment on – but were the highlight of last year and highly motivating to all of us at Palantir,” Karp said.\n\nKarp doubled down on his data protection claim on the call, arguing that Palantir’s work with the US government, including intelligence agencies, aligns with the fourth amendment and makes sure “every institution that uses (Palantir’s) products is doing it within conformity of the law and ethics of America”.\n\nData privacy advocates are not convinced. “Palantir tools are ICE’s digital henchmen,” said Will Owen, communications director at the non-profit, Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, in a statement to the Guardian. “Their revenue may be up thanks to Trump, but no one is buying that they hold ICE accountable.”\n\nLast year, ICE awarded Palantir a nearly $30m contract to build ImmigrationOS, which makes it easier to pull information about immigrants from across government databases – regardless of the accuracy of those records. 404 Media recently reported on the existence of another tool created by Palantir for the federal government: Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (Elite).\n\nElite “populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a ‘confidence score’ on the person’s current address”, according to 404 Media. The program reportedly relies on address data from the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes Medicaid.\n\nWired reported last week that the federal government has been using Palantir’s AI tools to process immigration enforcement tips. Wired also reported that the health department has been using other Palantir AI tools to screen grants and job descriptions for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and “gender ideology”.\n\nPalantir has said there is no malicious intent in its work with the federal government.\n\n“To be absolutely clear, Palantir is not working on any master database project to unify databases across federal agencies,” read a company blogpost last week. “Palantir has not proposed the US government build a ‘master list’ for the surveillance of citizens, nor have we been asked to consider building such a system for any customer.”\n\nPalantir has described 404 Media’s claims about the Elite tool as misleading; the company says it is “used for prioritized enforcement to surface the likely addresses of specific individuals, such as those with final orders of removal or with high severity criminal charges”.\n\nTrump’s “big, beautiful bill” awarded DHS and ICE huge budgets to pursue the administration’s anti-immigrant policies, including $45bn for ICE to expand its detention capabilities.\n\nIn 2025, Palantir’s federal contracts almost doubled – and increased to more than $970m; this amount was distributed across the government, mostly to the defense department, but it also includes the DHS.",

    "fullText": "Minister announces Microsoft, Cisco and Adobe to help apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses\n\nIn 2002 Barnsley toyed with a redesign as a Tuscan hill village as it sought out a brighter post-industrial future. In 2021 it adopted the airily vague slogan “the place of possibilities”. Now it is trying a different image: Britain’s first “tech town”.\n\nThe technology secretary, Liz Kendall, has anointed the South Yorkshire community as a trailblazer for “how AI can improve everyday life” in the UK.\n\nIn the latest move in Labour’s drive to inject AI into Britain’s bloodstream, the government has announced four US tech companies – Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Adobe – have agreed to help as the council pushes to apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses in Barnsley, an area of South Yorkshire which has struggled with unemployment and deprivation since the coal pits closed.\n\nThe town and its 250,000 people have been chosen because they have already adopted AI faster than many places, said Sir Stephen Houghton, the Labour leader of Barnsley metropolitan borough council. His authority has been using AI assistants for the last couple of years in adult social care and children’s services, and its bin lorries have been enabled with tech to scan roads for potholes. The parcel company Evri, which has one of its largest distribution hubs in the town, has been trialling robot dogs for deliveries.\n\nBut local opposition leaders have warned rebranding Barnsley as a tech town “might seem a bit of a leap” and highlighted local anxiety about whether AI is a force for good.\n\nThe “tech town” status means residents will get free AI and digital training, businesses will be supported to adopt AI, the hospital will test AI tools for check-ins, triage and outpatient care and AI will be tested in schools and at Barnsley College, all in an effort to improve pupils’ results and teachers’ workloads.\n\n“The economic basis of Barnsley was destroyed 30 years ago,” Houghton said. “This is the biggest opportunity we have had since then. The future of the economy is going to be in technology and for Barnsley to be at the centre of that is an incredible opportunity.”\n\nBut one area of uncertainty is the role of the tech companies. Houghton said: “The council won’t be paying them. Whether the government is, we have to wait and see.”\n\nMicrosoft already has a relationship with Barnsley College and, along with Google and Cisco, is understood to be working on a pro bono basis.\n\n“If we are going to get AI to work for Britain, we need Britons and British public services that can work with AI,” Kendall said. “If we can show that AI helps young people learn, supports local businesses to be more productive, and improves public services, then we can show what’s possible for the whole country. What we learn here will shape how we roll out AI across the UK.”\n\nMinisters have faced criticism over their handling of big technology companies. Last week the government launched a national AI training programme to upskill 10 million citizens, but many of the online courses turned out to be bespoke training for customers of particular companies such as Google, others cost as much as £525 to complete and some simply promoted the merits of particular company’s approaches to AI such as one explaining Microsoft’s “responsible AI approach”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said hundreds of courses on the AI Skills Hub are free and where payment is required it is clearly advertised. “All courses are reviewed against a common set of criteria to ensure they are relevant, high quality, and delivered by eligible organisations,” they said.\n\nMinisters have also been challenged for holding meetings with tech bosses at the rate of more than once each working day. The government insists engagement is vital to create growth and transform services.\n\n“It’s not about giving tech companies access to data they shouldn’t be having,” Houghton said. “It’s a secure programme and we are not leaving ourselves open. But this stuff is not going away. We have to make sure we are smart enough to protect people while taking advantage of the positive stuff it brings.”\n\nHannah Kitching, the leader of the council’s Liberal Democrat opposition, said investment in the town was welcome but “there is a lot of anxiety among people about the use of AI and whether it is a force for good. We know it could be but there are darker sides as well.”\n\n“[Barnsley] is still really connected to its mining past,” she said. “Younger people see the jobs and opportunities around the tech town idea but older generations perhaps don’t. There is a job to be done to get people onboard.”\n\nResidents “want the council to get the basics right”, she said. Roads were “absolutely crumbling” and in bad weather bins did not get collected, she added.",

Through an all-in-one platform deeply embedded within the criminal justice system, we recruit, train, and place justice-impacted individuals into life-changing careers.\n\nOur vision is to become the country’s unified workforce development system, replacing disconnected brick-and-mortar job centers with one integrated, tech-powered solution that meets low-income individuals exactly where they are. Today, the federal government spends billions annually on education and training programs, yet only about 70% of participants graduate, just 38.6% secure training-related employment, and average first-year earnings hover around $34,708.\n\nBefore Emerge, our founders Zo and Gabe co-founded Ameelio, an award-winning tech nonprofit that is dismantling the prison communication duopoly. Backed by tech luminaries like Reid Hoffman, Vinod Khosla, and Jack Dorsey, and by major criminal-justice philanthropies such as Arnold Ventures and the Mellon Foundation, Ameelio became a recognized leader in the space. Because of this experience both Zo and Gabe understood what it took to create change from within the system. After serving over 1M people impacted by incarceration, they witnessed firsthand the gap in second-chance opportunities and the chronic unemployment plaguing those impacted by the justice system. Emerge Career is committed to solving this issue.\n\nOur students are at the heart of our work. Their journeys have captured national attention on CBS, NBC, and in The Boston Globe, and our programs now serve entire states and cities. And we’re not doing it alone: our vision has attracted support from Alexis Ohanian (776),  Michael Seibel, Y Combinator, the Opportunity Fund, and public figures like Diana Taurasi, Deandre Ayton, and Marshawn Lynch. All of us believe that, with the right mix of technology and hands-on practice, we can redefine workforce development and deliver true second chances at scale.\n\nEmerge Career was designed to tackle two systemic issues: recidivism, fueled by post-incarceration unemployment and poverty, and labor shortages in key industries. Over 60% of formerly incarcerated people remain unemployed a year after incarceration, seeking work but not finding it. The reality is shocking, workforce development programs are severely limited inside prison, with only one-third of incarcerated people ever participating. To worsen, the available prison jobs offer meager wages, often less than $1 per hour, and often do not equip individuals with the skills for long-term stable employment.\n\nWe call this a Founding Design Engineer role, even three years in and with multiple contracts under our belt, for two reasons. First, you'll be our very first engineer, joining our co-founder, who's built the entire platform solo to date. Second, our growth is now outpacing our systems, and we can't keep up on maintenance alone. We're at a critical juncture: we can either hire someone to simply care for what exists, or we can bring on a talent who believes that, with the right blend of technology and hands-on practice, we can unify the workforce-development system and deliver second chances at true scale. We hope that can be you.\n\nThis is not a traditional engineering job. You'll build features in React and TypeScript, but your real job is helping students finish. That means understanding the human problem first: why do people disengage? What makes someone choose to keep going when the payoff is months away? You'll answer those questions through direct conversations, usability research, and watching how people actually use what you build. Then you'll prototype fast, ship real software, and measure whether it worked. Some days that looks like code. Other days it looks like a phone call, a support ticket, or a whiteboard session figuring out how to turn a one-off fix into a system that scales.\n\nThis role blends engineering, product, design, and program operations. We're looking for someone who believes good design can inspire a person to invest in their own future, and who wants to prove it, week after week, by shipping work that measurably helps students succeed. If you want to be close to users, own outcomes end to end, and build something that actually matters, you'll thrive here.\n\nYou design by building. You don't hand off mockups and wait. You open Cursor, Claude Code, or whatever gets you closest to a real, testable thing fastest. You might already be shipping code in production — or you're itching to. You believe the fastest path to a great design is putting something real in front of a real user and watching what happens.\n\nYou are relentlessly scrappy. You prototype in hours, not weeks. You'd rather test an ugly thing that teaches you something than polish a beautiful thing nobody's used yet. You know that at this stage, speed of learning is the only thing that matters. Fidelity comes later. Signal comes first.\n\nYou refuse to be blocked. When engineering bandwidth isn't there, you don't sit around. You figure it out — a Figma prototype, a coded prototype, a quick hack in the codebase. You treat \"waiting for a developer\" as a personal failure. You find a way or you make one.\n\nYou think in outcomes, not outputs. You don't measure your work in screens delivered. You measure it in whether students finished, whether they came back, whether the thing you shipped actually moved a number that matters. You're obsessed with the gap between what you designed and what actually happened.\n\nYou talk to users constantly. Not in scheduled quarterly research sprints — in real conversations, every week. You build relationships with students. You know their names, their blockers, their moments of doubt. Your best design ideas come from a 10-minute phone call, not a brainstorm.\n\nYou have strong taste but low ego. You have opinions about what good looks like and you'll fight for them. But when the data says you're wrong, you move on fast. You don't fall in love with your work. You fall in love with the problem.\n\nYou believe everyone deserves a second chance. You treat everyone with dignity. You know how to meet people exactly where they are — with empathy and compassion — helping create a space where everyone feels seen and valued, regardless of their background.\n\nYou work hard. You show up early, stay late, and do what needs to get done — no ego, no excuses. This isn't a 9-to-5. The team puts in 10+ hour days because we care about the mission and each other. If that sounds miserable, this isn't for you. If it sounds exciting, you'll fit right in.\n\nTalking to students — a lot. Your week starts and ends with users. You'll build real relationships with students, not just run usability sessions. You'll understand why someone almost quit, what message made them log back in, what screen confused them at 11pm. These conversations are your primary design tool.\n\nPrototyping at the speed of conversation. You hear a problem on a call Tuesday. By Wednesday you have something testable — a coded prototype, a functional hack, a Figma flow wired to real data. By Thursday a student is using it. By Friday you know if it worked. That's the cycle. Repeat.\n\nShipping real product, not just designs. You'll work in our React and TypeScript codebase — or use AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code to get there. The goal isn't to become a full-time engineer. The goal is to never let \"it hasn't been built yet\" slow down learning. Some of what you build will go straight to production. Some will be throwaway prototypes. You'll know the difference.\n\nDesigning the moments that keep students going. The hardest design problem here isn't layout or typography. It's commitment. Students are betting months of effort on a future they have to imagine. You'll study where they disengage, what triggers doubt, and what reignites momentum. Then you'll design the moments — an interface, a message, a milestone — that help someone choose to keep going. How do you make a better life in three months feel worth the sacrifice today? You'll own that problem.\n\nMeasuring what matters. Polished decks don't matter here. You'll define success metrics for what you ship, track whether completion rates moved, whether more students hit the next milestone, whether the intervention you designed actually intervened. You'll close the loop between design and outcome every time.\n\nWorking across the entire stack of the student experience. Some days that looks like interface design. Other days it looks like rethinking a Customer.io campaign, redesigning an onboarding flow, or sitting with the ops team to understand why students in one facility disengage faster than another. You go where the problem is.\n\nDocumenting your work clearly. Our work spans months and involves multiple teams. You'll create visibility when a change impacts operations and help others understand how features affect training and service delivery. Precision matters.",

    "description": "Deploy globally, query over HTTP, and scale reads with low latency. Bunny Database lets you build fast without paying the serverless tax.",
    "fullText": "Don’t want to babysit your app database on a VM but not willing to pay the DBaaS tax either? We're building a third way.\n\nToday, we’re launching Bunny Database as a public preview: a SQLite-compatible managed service that spins down when idle, keeps latency low wherever your users are, and doesn’t cost a fortune.\n\nIt’s become clear by now that the DBaaS platforms that garnered the love of so many devs are all going upmarket. Removing or dumbing down free tiers, charging for unused capacity, charging extra for small features, or bundling them in higher tiers — you already know the drill.\n\nHard to blame anyone for growing their business, but it doesn’t feel right when these services stop making sense for the very people who helped popularize them in the first place.\n\nNot every project needs Postgres, and that’s okay. Sometimes you just want a simple, reliable database that you can spin up quickly and build on, without worrying it’ll hit your wallet like an EC2.\n\nThat’s what we built Bunny Database for.\n\nGet the full tour including how to connect Bunny Database to your app in this quick demo from our DX Engineer, Jamie Barton:\n\nYou probably optimize the heck out of your frontend, APIs, and caching layers, all for the sake of delivering an experience that feels instant to your users. But when your database is far away from them, round-trip time starts to add noticeable latency.\n\nThe usual fix is to introduce more caching layers, denormalized reads, or other workarounds. That’s obviously no fun.\n\nAnd when you think about it, devs end up doing this because the popular DBaaS platforms are usually either limited, complex, or too costly when it comes to multi-region deployments. So what looks like a caching problem is actually a data locality issue.\n\nOK, but how bad can it really be?\n\nTo find out, we ran a read latency benchmark and measured p95 latency in Bunny Database.\n\nWe picked a number of regions across the world and compared round-trip time for client locations ever farther away from the database in:\n\nTurns out serving reads close to clients reduced latency by up to 99%.\n\nCheck out the full write-up on the benchmark setup and results here.\n\nWhile this definitely matters most to apps with global users, data locality does apply to everyone. With Bunny Database, you don’t have to stick to major data center locations and compensate with caching workarounds any more. Instead, you get a lot of flexibility to set up regions in an intuitive interface and it’s easy to switch things up as your requirements change.\n\nChoose between 3 deployment types when creating a database:\n\nAll of this lets you start wherever you’d like and add regions as needed, without re-architecting your app.\n\nIn the database world, capacity-based pricing gives you some predictability. But no one likes to pay for unused capacity, right?\n\nServerless, on the other hand, is supposed to be cost-efficient, yet can rack up bills quickly, especially when the DBaaS charges significant markups on top of already pricey compute.\n\nWe don’t do hyperscalers, though, so we can charge a fair price for Bunny Database in a usage-based model.\n\nDuring the public preview phase, Bunny Database is free.\n\nBunny Database wouldn’t be possible without libSQL, the open-source, open-contribution fork of SQLite created by Turso.\n\nWe run Bunny Database on our own fork of libSQL, which gives us the freedom to integrate it tightly with the bunny.net platform and handle the infrastructure and orchestration needed to run it as a managed, multi-region service.\n\nWhat does this mean for Bunny Database’s upstream feature parity with libSQL and SQLite, respectively?\n\nThe short answer is that we don’t currently promise automatic or complete feature parity with either upstream libSQL or the latest SQLite releases.\n\nWhile libSQL aims to stay compatible with SQLite’s API and file format, it doesn’t move in lockstep with upstream SQLite. We wouldn’t expect otherwise, especially as Turso has shifted focus from libSQL toward a long-term rewrite of SQLite in Rust.\n\nFor Bunny Database, this means that compatibility today is defined by the libSQL version we’re built on, rather than by chasing every upstream SQLite or libSQL change as it lands. We haven’t pulled in any upstream changes yet, and we don’t currently treat upstream parity as an automatic goal.\n\nThat’s intentional. Our focus so far has been on making Bunny Database reliable and easy to operate as a service. We think bringing in upstream changes only makes sense when they clearly improve real-world use cases, not just to tick a parity checkbox.\n\nIf there are specific libSQL features you’d like to see exposed in Bunny Database, or recent SQLite features you’d want us to pull in, we’d love to hear about it. Join our Discord to discuss your use cases and help shape the roadmap!\n\nSpeaking of the roadmap, we don’t stop cooking. Here’s what’s coming up next:\n\nThere’s even more to come, but it’s too soon to spill the beans yet, especially while we’re in public preview. We’d love to hear your feedback, so we can shape what ships next together.\n\nBunny Database works standalone and fits right into your stack via the SDKs (or you can hook up anything using the HTTP API). But it also plays nicely with Bunny Edge Scripting and Bunny Magic Containers.\n\nTo connect your database to an Edge Script or a Magic Containers app, simply go to the Access tab of the chosen database and click Generate Tokens to create new access credentials for it.\n\nOnce they’re generated, you’ll get two paths to choose from:\n\nAfter you complete the setup, the database URL and access token will be available as environment variables in your script or app. Use them to connect to your database:\n\nYou can find more detailed, step-by-step integration instructions in the docs:\n\nWe can’t wait to see what you’ll build with Bunny Database and what you think of it. During the public preview phase, you get 50 databases per user account, each capped at 1 GB, but we hope this should be more than enough for lots of fun projects.\n\nJust sign in to the bunny.net dashboard to get started. Happy building!",

    "description": "The SpiceDB query planner project explains the architecture on how we're improving the performance of every permission check.",
    "fullText": "In the years since SpiceDB premiered as the first enterprise-ready implementation of ReBAC, we’ve seen users model authorization in all sorts of ways, including with schemas with recursion, very deep nesting, and with relationships that connect thousands and thousands of objects in their system to one subject. At the same time, many have told us that that they required even lower latency from their authorization checks.\n\nOver the years, we’ve added many strategies to push SpiceDB’s performance limits to new heights:\n\nAll these strategies helped us reduce the number and size of calls that we had to make to the underlying datastore, which is the number one bottleneck in achieving low latency.\n\nHowever, these strategies often missed one crucial piece of information: the shape of the customer’s data.\n\nLet’s explore what we mean by that with this schema:\n\nImagine a CheckPermission query for document:budget, view, user:maria . The view permission is an arrow operation that can be expressed as “for every group that is related to document:budget, find the members. Then, find if user:maria is one of them.”\n\nThe naive solution to answer this is to do… that. Look up every group related to document:budget, then for each group see if user:maria is a member. This is (very) roughly how CheckPermission is implemented: it thinks of the relationships as a directed graph, then it starts at the resource node and attempts to follow all the paths available to the subject node until it either reaches the subject node or it doesn’t. (This is done in a highly concurrent fashion; it’s not your standard Breadth-First Search algorithm).\n\nTo solve the CheckPermission(document:budget, view, user:maria), we potentially have to explore every colored path in the graph of permissions. We stop when we find one.\n\nHowever, what happens in the extreme cases (the ones our customers had)?\n\nThis is the key piece of information that we were not using: the shape of the relationships. For example: how many groups are there? Are users members of one or a million groups?\n\nOr, put differently: if we start exploring a sub-graph, how much time will we need? How expensive is it?\n\nNow imagine that the CheckPermission call is for document:budget, edit, user:maria. This permission is an intersection. Solving this question is roughly equivalent to traversing the graph below as fast as possible until we reach user:maria.\n\nTo solve this intersection we potentially have to explore every colored path.\n\nIntersections are special, however: if one of the sub-permissions returns NO_PERMISSION, we can short-circuit immediately. So, for example, if we check the #editor path first and find we can’t reach the subject, we don’t need to explore the other paths!\n\nIf user:maria is NOT an editor, we do NOT need to explore the group#member paths!\n\nToday, to resolve this intersection, SpiceDB will try to explore the view and editor paths in parallel, with no preference as to what path it evaluates first. But, if we knew that the editor set had zero or near-zero elements, we could have tried that path first and only if it succeeds we would have gone down the potentially expensive path of evaluating view.\n\nThe broad problem here is that SpiceDB takes a simple approach: it doesn’t make decisions at query time about the fastest way to explore a graph to solve a query, because it doesn’t know the average cost of exploring a sub-graph.\n\nThe query planner is our new experimental implementation of the CheckPermission API (and other APIs, as we progress) that decides at query time how to resolve a check in a way that minimizes work through the use of various optimizations. It’s the means by which SpiceDB will make smart decisions based on the shape of the query and graph.\n\nThe first step is to understand the shape of a query in the abstract. Let’s consider our document:budget, view, user:maria query. We know that for this query, when we consider the schema:\n\nOne way to think about the arrow operation is the way we phrased it above:\n\nFor every group that is related to document:budget, find the members. Then, find if user:maria is one of them.\n\nHowever, we can also phrase it in terms of set intersections, or as a JOIN in database-speak:\n\nThere’s 0 or more groups connected to document:budget, and there’s 0 or more groups that user:maria is a member of. Is there at least one group in common between the two sets?\n\nThis phrasing of the problem is the key that unlocks our first optimization: we can choose which set to look at first, depending on which set we expect to be smaller, and then the subsequent problem space is smaller. In other words, we can reorder the evaluation of an arrow depending on the shape of the data, provided that we have statistics about our data. These statistics are then stored alongside our graph and provide an estimation of cost of traversal. The two examples below demonstrate this:\n\nThe query planner converts our graph traversal into a smart traversal using cost estimates. In this case, exploring the view subgraph has high cost because both sides of the group->member arrow contain many elements.\n\nThe query planner converts our graph traversal into a smart traversal using cost estimates. In this case, exploring the view subgraph has low cost because the left-hand side of the group->memberarrow has zero elements.\n\nWe can make a similar optimization for unions (+) by ordering the relations from largest-to-smallest respectively, and we’ll continue adding additional optimizations and heuristics as time goes on.\n\nHow we represent a query plan allows us to make these changes and modify how we evaluate a query at runtime. The query plan is a tree of operations, each step representing a set of paths reachable in the graph. We may not directly evaluate every node in this tree, but these provide building blocks we can reorder to change how it gets evaluated.\n\nIn our example, the basic level of iterator is direct group membership: a group member that points at a user — let’s call this Relation(group:member) . Similarly, the document is assigned to a group by its relation, Relation(document:group).\n\nThe view permission, then, represented as a document belonging to a group, is the arrow, group->member. Now our tree looks like Arrow(Relation(document:group), Relation(group:member)) .\n\nThen we can layer on the next fact; an editor is a Relation(document:editor) and the edit permission requires a path that is a view permission and an editor relation. We already have view permission, that’s given above! So we need to intersect these two sets, giving us the final tree of\n\nThis is the object that we can use to reorder blocks, rebalance the tree, and find the optimal evaluation configuration.\n\nWe have our abstract query planner structure in place and we have a starting set of optimizations that can be made based on the structure of your schema and statistical estimates about the cost of each graph traversal. In the near future, we’ll be adding more statistics sources that will be effective at various scales, feeding additional optimizations as time goes on.\n\nQuery planners can be somewhat fickle. They’ll often perform very well for 95% of cases and then strange or downright insane behavior for the remaining 5%; we’ve experienced this ourselves with the Postgres query planner a number of times. We’ll be putting the planner through its paces with a set of tests, both real-world and contrived, before turning it on by default, and we’ll let you know when it’s ready for experimental usage in your own workload.\n\nWe’d also love to hear from you if you find an edge case - drop a SpiceDB issue or a Discord message. We’re always looking for feedback as we seek to fix broken authorization.\n\nLast but not least, if this work sounds interesting to you, please hop over to our Careers page. We are hiring!",

    "description": "A simple model (Shell Theory) explaining how AI can raise baseline output, disproportionately rewards high-agency users, while at the same time risking long-term skill erosion.",
    "fullText": "My teammate and I keep having the same argument. One moment we're witness to the cascade. Watching us software engineers become empty shells, mere relays for whatever the AI produced. The next moment we're amazed how iterative collaboration with AI keeps pushing our boundaries beyond what we thought achievable.\n\nBoth observations feel true simultaneously.\n\nThree narratives keep surfacing in our discussions:\n\nThese statements seem logically incompatible. The amplification of skill argument is moot if everyone is an expert by default. Relying more on AI can't simultaneously amplify skill and erode critical thinking. And if AI gives us expert quality regardless, there's no reason to worry about reduction in critical thinking.\n\nI've been trying to reconcile this intuition into something concrete. What follows is a model. It's not scientifically validated, but useful for reasoning about what we're observing.\n\nLet's define output without AI as a function of agency (V) and experience level (E):\n\nAgency is the foundation. Experience multiplies your output. In this model a principal engineer with low agency still produces less than a senior with high agency.\n\nHere it gets interesting. AI introduces exponential amplification, but this amplification is masked by a floor until your yield exceeds it:\n\nResolving contradictions 1 and 2: The floor-ceiling mechanism.\n\n The model resolves the apparent conflict between \"AI gives everyone 80%\" and \"AI amplifies skill.\" They are actually mathematically distinct effects operating on different populations. When Y < F, you're being rescued to the flatline. You ship working code and feel productive, but your output is artificially lifted to a floor you cannot pass. When Y > F, AI triggers exponential amplification; your yield scales with both agency and experience. The max(F, Y) function ensures the floor, while the exponential in Y raises the ceiling.\n\nResolving contradiction 3: Agency matters.\n\n The concern that \"relying on AI erodes critical thinking\" isn't addressed by the model's equations. It's addressed by how agency is defined. The model treats V as a parameter, but the definition describes agency as responsive: growing through deliberate practice, atrophying through disuse.\n\nThis creates a feedback loop that the math alone doesn't show:\n\nThe model doesn't predict this erosion, but it explains why the erosion matters. Your position isn't determined by a one-time calculation; it's determined by what V becomes over time. Two engineers with identical starting positions can diverge: one practices deliberate engagement and grows V, eventually breaking into the amplification zone. The other accepts the rescue, lets V decay, and becomes permanently dependent on the flatline.\n\nThis is why contradiction 3 coexists with contradictions 1 and 2. AI can amplify skill (for those above the flatline). AI does provide a floor (for everyone). And AI may erode critical thinking (for those who let the floor replace engagement). The determining variable is whether you treat the flatline as a safety net or a hammock.\n\nFeel free to skip this section. What follows is an attempt to assert the model against real-world anchors. If you're not interested in the math, jump ahead to The Model in Practice. The calibration points that follow are illustrative. The model's value isn't in the exact numbers but in the structural insight: Floor and amplification are distinct mechanisms operating on different populations.\n\nReal expertise development has been hypothesized to follow different types of curves. Logarithmic (rapid early gains, diminishing returns), S-shaped (slow start, steep middle, plateau), or non-uniform (qualitative leaps between levels). There's no consensus in the literature on which pattern best describes software engineering capability growth. Linear is simple, and for a thought experiment, simple wins:\n\nNote that with this definition juniors get zero amplification by design. The ability to leverage AI beyond the flatline is in itself what distinguishes a higher experience level.\n\nTo determine F, we need a reference point. AGI provides that anchor. But what is AGI in measurable terms?\n\nThe SWE-bench verified benchmark offers a concrete proxy. This benchmark evaluates AI models on 500 real GitHub bug-fixing tasks where they must produce patches that pass actual test suites. Crucially, these tasks come with human time estimates: 91% take less than one hour for an \"experienced engineer\" who has \"a few hours to familiarize themselves with the codebase.\"\n\nThe phrase \"experienced engineer\" is key. SWE-bench was calibrated against senior-level performance on well-defined tasks. And it only measures a slice of engineering work: fixing bugs in existing codebases with clear acceptance criteria. It doesn't measure architectural decisions, system design, handling ambiguous requirements, or greenfield development.\n\nThis gives us our first anchor: AGI on SWE-bench = F = 100 correlates with the output of a moderate-agency senior on well-defined work.\n\nThe leading models today (Claude Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 Pro) score around 74% on SWE-bench Verified. This gives us the current flatline: F = 74.\n\nIf a moderate senior (E=3) produces 100 on SWE-bench-type tasks without AI:\n\nThis gives us: V = 25 represents moderate agency.\n\nWith V = 25 as the anchor, we model agency as normally distributed across the engineering population. Assuming a variation of 20% with μ = 25 gives σ = 5:\n\nThe exact values are illustrative. What matters is the concept: Agency varies meaningfully across engineers, and this variance affects output before AI even enters the equation.\n\nIf you have lower agency, you can still reach the flatline. It just takes longer to get there.\n\nTo define the slope of the exponential curve, we need a calibration point. A known relationship between experience and amplification. Without empirical data stratified by experience level, we make an informed assumption: at principal level (E=4), AI amplifies output to 2× R_noAI.\n\nIt reflects a hypothesis that the most experienced engineers can roughly double their effective output through AI collaboration. Leveraging it for code generation, exploration, and iteration while applying judgement that compounds the result.\n\nUsing the standard technique for deriving an exponential rate constant (taking the natural logarithm of both sides) we get:\n\nThis anchors the exponential curve. AI is powerful enough to meaningfully amplify engineers, with the curve calibrated to reach 2× at principal level. If future evidence suggests principals achieve a different amplification ratio—say, 3×—then A would become ln(3)/1.5 ≈ 0.732.\n\nWith each parameter anchored to an assumption, here's how the model plays out:\n\nThe asymmetry is clear: below the flatline, the exponential yield exists but is masked—everyone sees 74. Above it, the exponential becomes visible and compounds experience, reaching 2× output at principal level.\n\nThe model assumes you're working within a single domain where your experience level applies uniformly. Reality is messier. A single task often demands multiple skill domains and your experience level differs across them.\n\nConsider a senior backend engineer who doesn't know frontend, building a full-stack feature. AI amplifies their backend work exponentially while rescuing their frontend work to the flatline. The final output can be equally impressive though.\n\nWhat differs is the force behind the output. A specialist operating entirely above the flatline earns their amplified output through skill. A generalist in the blend achieves high output through a combination: part genuine skill amplification (in their strong domains), part being rescued (in their weak domains).\n\nThis matters for growth. When output comes from skill, you're building compound advantage. When output comes from the flatline, you're borrowing capability you haven't earned yet. This is not bad, but let's remain honest about which parts of your work are truly yours. Most importantly, your compound depends on the agency you are showing and the time you have already spent building experience. AI can accelerate knowledge acquisition. But seniority is knowledge and experience. You still need to live through production incidents, watch systems evolve, and feel the consequences of decisions that seemed fine until they weren't.\n\nThe flatline F currently sits at 74, and with AGI the flatline rises to F = 100. Every developer gets lifted to senior-level execution as their new floor on scoped work.\n\nBut AGI on SWE-bench doesn't demonstrate the ability to make architectural trade-offs, scope ambiguous problems, or engage in higher-order thinking to determine which tasks should exist in the first place. And benchmarks that do test these capabilities (ARC-AGI-2 for compositional reasoning, RE-Bench for long-horizon R&D, SPIN-Bench for strategic planning under uncertainty) show significant gaps. The exponential amplification zone doesn't disappear, but shifts to a different domain.\n\nThe amplification advantage depends on your yield exceeding the flatline: Y(V, E) > F. As F rises, fewer engineers qualify. At some point, the flatline exceeds what any human can produce even with AI assistance, and the amplification zone disappears entirely.\n\nThe maximum AI-assisted output in our model is a high-agency principal: Y(35, 4) = 35 × 5 × 2 = 350. If AI capability reached F = 350, even the best engineers would fall below the flatline. At that point, everyone produces 350—the flatline value—regardless of agency or experience. No amplification, no differentiation. Just the floor. It's the penthouse floor though.\n\nThe intermediate thresholds tell the story of who loses amplification as F rises:\n\nBeyond F = 100, we're extrapolating past the SWE-bench anchor into speculation.\nWhat the model does predict with more confidence: as F rises, the amplification zone shrinks. The threshold for \"bringing enough to exceed the flatline\" keeps rising. Whether the threshold will rise enough to exceed human capability is an open question, but the direction of pressure is clear.\n\nIf you stay in the flatline zone, accepting AI's first answer, never pushing beyond what it hands you, then you're being rescued, not amplified. Your skills may atrophy. You become a shell.\n\nIf you operate above the flatline, using AI as a sparring partner, iterating on its suggestions, bringing domain expertise and architectural judgment, then you're being exponentially amplified. You become more capable than you could be alone.\n\nThe same tool, but with two completely different outcomes. The variable is you.",

    "description": "NASA spent most of Monday trying to overcome hydrogen leaks on the Artemis II rocket.",
    "fullText": "The launch of NASA’s Artemis II mission, the first flight of astronauts to the Moon in more than 53 years, will have to wait another month after a fueling test Monday uncovered hydrogen leaks in the connection between the rocket and its launch platform at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\n“Engineers pushed through several challenges during the two-day test and met many of the planned objectives,” NASA said in a statement following the conclusion of the mock countdown, or Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), early Tuesday morning. “To allow teams to review data and conduct a second Wet Dress Rehearsal, NASA now will target March as the earliest possible launch opportunity for the flight test.”\n\nThe practice countdown was designed to identify problems and provide NASA an opportunity to fix them before launch. Most importantly, the test revealed NASA still has not fully resolved recurring hydrogen leaks that delayed the launch of the unpiloted Artemis I test flight by several months in 2022. Artemis I finally launched successfully after engineers revised their hydrogen loading procedures to overcome the leak.\n\nNow, the second Space Launch System (SLS) rocket is on the cusp of launching a crew for the first time. The Artemis II mission will send four astronauts inside NASA’s Orion spacecraft on a loop around the far side of the Moon on the first crewed lunar flight since 1972, paving the way for future expeditions to land humans at the Moon’s south pole.\n\nGoing into the countdown rehearsal, NASA officials hoped a smooth test would clear the way to launch the Artemis II mission as soon as Sunday, February 8. NASA has only a handful of launch opportunities for Artemis II each month, when the Moon is in the right location in its orbit to allow the Orion spacecraft to fly a so-called free return trajectory and come back to Earth for a safe reentry and splashdown.\n\nThe first launch opportunity for Artemis II next month is March 6, with a two-hour launch window opening at 8:29 pm EST (01:26 UTC on March 7).\n\nArtemis II commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, mission specialist Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen have been in medical quarantine since January 21, a standard practice for astronauts preparing to fly to space. They will now be released from quarantine at their home base in Houston to resume training and await a new launch date.\n\nNASA’s Artemis launch team, stationed a few miles away from the SLS rocket on its seaside launch pad, started fueling operations around midday Monday, somewhat later than scheduled due to cold temperatures at the Florida spaceport. The launch team first detected leaking hydrogen soon after they began loading the super-cold fuel into the SLS core stage.\n\nThe leak appeared in the same location it did during the Artemis I launch campaign nearly three years ago. Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen flow from ground storage tanks into the SLS core stage through so-called Tail Service Mast Umbilicals (TSMUs), two roughly 30-foot-tall gray pods rising from the base of the rocket’s mobile launch platform. The TSMUs route propellant lines through connections near the bottom of the core stage, where umbilical plates on the rocket side and ground side meet. At liftoff, the umbilical plates disconnect as the rocket begins its climb off the launch pad.\n\nHydrogen is one of the most efficient rocket fuels, but it is notoriously difficult to handle. Liquified hydrogen must be stored at minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 253 degrees Celsius), cold enough to change the shape and size of seals and other soft goods in the fueling line. This can create leak paths not readily detectable at ambient temperatures. Hydrogen molecules are the smallest and lightest in the Universe, with the ability to find their way through the tiniest of breaches.\n\nBecause of this, NASA engineers accept that a small amount of hydrogen will escape seals in the fueling line. Agency officials said in 2022 that the safe limit was a 4 percent concentration of hydrogen gas in the housing around the fueling connector. Hydrogen levels exceeded NASA’s safety limit multiple times during the practice countdown that ran from Monday into early Tuesday.\n\n“ Attempts to resolve the issue involved stopping the flow of liquid hydrogen into the core stage, allowing the interface to warm up for the seals to reseat, and adjusting the flow of the propellant,” NASA said in a statement.\n\nNASA appeared to get past the problem Monday evening and fully loaded the 322-foot-tall (98-meter) rocket with more than 750,000 gallons of propellant.\n\nWith fueling complete, managers sent a closeout crew to the launch pad around 6:00 pm EST (23:00 UTC) to close the hatch to the Orion spacecraft sitting atop the SLS rocket. The closeout team will help the Artemis II astronauts into the Orion capsule on launch day, but the crew was not part of the practice countdown Monday night.\n\nThe closeout crew took longer than anticipated to close and secure the hatch to the Orion spacecraft. A valve associated with Orion’s hatch pressurization inadvertently vented, according to NASA, requiring the closeout crew to retorque the valve. The launch team dealt with several other glitches, including audio dropouts on ground communication loops and camera problems believed to be caused by recent cold weather in Central Florida.\n\nFinally, with the closeout crew a safe distance away from the rocket, the launch team gave approval to begin the final 10 minutes of the countdown shortly after midnight Tuesday. The objective was to stop the countdown clock 33 seconds prior to launch, about the same time the rocket would take control of the countdown during a real launch attempt.\n\nInstead, the clock stopped at T-minus 5 minutes and 15 seconds. NASA said the countdown terminated “due to a spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate.” The countdown ended before the rocket switched to internal power and fully pressurized its four propellant tanks. The test also concluded before the rocket activated its auxiliary power units to run the core stage’s four main engines through a preflight steering check, all milestones engineers hoped to cross off their checklist.\n\nLaunch controllers began work to drain the SLS rocket’s propellant tanks after calling an end to the countdown. With the test incomplete, NASA managers quickly decided to hold off on launching the Artemis II mission to allow time for ground teams to “fully review data from the test, mitigate each issue, and return to testing ahead of setting an official target launch date.”\n\n“As always, safety remains our top priority, for our astronauts, our workforce, our systems, and the public,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a social media post. “We will only launch when we believe we are as ready to undertake this historic mission.”\n\nOfficials did not immediately announce when they might be ready for a second Wet Dress Rehearsal, or whether they plan to roll the rocket back to its assembly building for repairs. NASA managers plan to hold a press briefing Tuesday afternoon to discuss the results of the test in more detail.",

    "fullText": "Like all worthy Dreams, it may take years or decades to achieve. Alas, the human motivation system can’t learn from rewards with a year-long delay.\n\nSo, you're instead advised to “trust the process”, and convert your long-term goal into regular short-term micro-goals:\n\nThis is great advice, and I endorse it, but… it feels incomplete? If every day I just focus on this day, I feel like I'm in a hamster wheel, hitting my same micro-goal over and over again, but for what? Intellectually, I know \"for what\" — the Dream — but I don't feel it anymore.\n\nSo, here's a solution that reliably helps me feel the connection between my past, present & future: lines on a graph!\n\nLet's look at 3 examples: project management, money, and weight loss.\n\nThe good news is I’m my own boss. The bad news is my boss is a moron.\n\nSpecifically, my boss (me) is bad at project management. She (I) still is (am), to be honest. But the tool that's helped me the most is the Burndown Chart.\n\nHow it works: First, give your project (or \"sprint\") a deadline, and break it down into small tasks. Give each task a number of \"points\" it's worth (I just make points = hours). Then each day, do tasks. Your burndown chart software will then show you, in a single graph:\n\n( example chart by User:PabloStraub ⤵ )\n\nWhen I shipped my latest project, a 20,000-word-with-40-illustrations behemoth, I used a variant called a Burnup Chart, which also tracks total estimated time over time, to see how badly I mis-estimated how long tasks would take. Here's my actual chart:\n\n( As you can see: I started off estimating that project would take ~25 hours, but by the end it turned out to be ~75h. I was off by a factor of three, yeesh. But thanks to this Burnup Chart design, I could account for my own mis-accounting, and see where the blue & red trendlines would intersect, to get a better estimate of when I'd actually finish my project. And I did, in fact, finish by Dec 1st 2025, as planned! )\n\nThe best part about Burndown/Burnup charts? I can see how different decisions will affect the future, today. For example, I can try deleting a task, or taking an extra break day, or increasing hours worked a day, and immediately see how that'd affect when I'll finish my project.\n\n(Here's a blank template, and here's an actual example of when I used it.)\n\nAnother example of \"see your effect on the future, today\" — just enter your current income & spending into a spreadsheet, multiply by the compounding interest of your savings/investments, and voilà: (example data, not my real finances)\n\nAgain, this lets you play with decisions like \"what if I tried to increase income by this much\", \"what if I tried to reduce my rent by that much\", and you get instant future-feedback.\n\nBut more importantly, it helps you viscerally see the connection between your short-term micro-goals, and long-term Dream. \"Put $10 a day into savings\" is doable but doesn't sound like much, but — just do the math — and you'll find it's enough to retire a millionaire at age 63, already adjusted for inflation, starting from zero money!\n\n(yes, for people living paycheck-to-paycheck or less, \"put aside $10 a day\" isn't feasible. but for most middle-class people and up, it should be.)\n\n( Quick aside, the best advice for almost all laypeople: ditch the fancy BS mutual funds, and forget about day-trading stocks. Just put your money in a very-low-fee diversified index fund. If that feels icky because you're investing in capitalism, remember, if you put your money in a savings account, your bank will still invest it, they'll just give you nothing but crumbs. Also: you can pick a socially-responsible index fund that excludes weaponry & fossil fuels. )\n\n( Here's the spreadsheets for both the above money examples )\n\nFinally, the most cliché New Year's Resolution: losing weight. Again, use a spreadsheet with lines on a graph: (my actual data)\n\nYou can see, at a glance, the connection between:\n\n( I find that visualizing the trendline is emotionally helpful, because weight is so variable from day to day. Seeing the trendline helps reassure me, ignore the daily noise, I'm on the right track. )\n\nAnd again, you can play with what if's, and get instant future-feedback.\nA daily micro-goal like \"250 calorie deficit\" (one less cookie a day) — do the math[1] — becomes \"lose 50lb (23kg) in two years\" (enough to get you from moderately-Obese to \"Healthy\" BMI!)\n\n( IMPORTANT: a) Yes both BMI and the Calorie-In-Calorie-Out model are very incomplete and flawed, b) Being Overweight & Obese Class I (25 < BMI < 35) is probably fine health-wise; previous studies didn't control for exercise levels & cardiovascular fitness (see Figures 3 & 4), c) May I interest you in the Potato Diet? Potatoes fill you up very fast (high protein & high fiber if you keep the skins), have almost all the daily nutrients you need, and are versatile foods you can cook in many ways to keep the diet interesting. I did the Potato Diet for a month and lost 10 pounds, and I was already \"Normal\" BMI! d) Or, ask your doctor about semaglutide. (see Figure 1) )\n\nHere's my weight-tracking Google Sheets template!\n\n\"Huh, what an interesting & inspiring article! I'll try this later\"\n\n(one year later)\n\n\"Oh no I forgot.\"\n\n~ you, if you don't implement this right now.\n\nSo before you close this tab, at least ask yourself:\n\n1) What's a Dream you have, that you've wanted for a long while, yet haven't done it yet?\n\nNo shame here, it can be as wacky or tacky as your heart desires. For example:\n\nNo, seriously, stop & think of a Dream you have. Silently think it and/or write it down, before continuing.\n\n2) How can you convert your long-term Dream into a regular micro-goal?\n\nRunning with the above examples:\n\n📕 \"Write a Great novel\" ⇒ Write/edit 500 words a day.\n\n🧠 \"Master the secrets of the universe Physics\" ⇒ Study 1 hour a day.\n\n( It is not exactly a well-kept secret that the modern university system is horribly broken. Relevant SMBC: )\n\n( If you don't have the pre-requisite math skills for Susskind's lectures, add an extra five months of \"study 1 hour a day\", and use Khan Academy for high-school algebra (~12 hours of lectures), and 3Blue1Brown for calculus (~3 hours) and linear algebra (~3 hours). So that's an extra 18h of lectures, and given our above study plan where we tackle 2h of lectures per 2 weeks, that's an extra 18 weeks, or about five months, of self-study. Again, at just 1 hour a day. What a steal of a deal! )\n\nStep 1, know your long-term Dream. Step 2, break it down into a sustainable regular micro-goal. This step is tricky; if you're stuck, paste a link to this blog post into Claude (with web search turned on), tell 'em your Dream, and ask Claude to help you break down your Dream into sustainable micro-goals, with inspiration from the above two examples.\n\nI strongly recommend using a spreadsheet program like Google Sheets, Excel, or Numbers. It needs more setup than an app, but you get full freedom to customize it however you like! If you need help setting up a spreadsheet, look up YouTube or consult Claude. Again, you can also get started with my templates:\n\nAlternatively, you can use these apps:\n\n(If you don't want to do this final step today, set an exact day & hour in your Calendar to do this, so you don't forget to do it!)\n\nTry it out for one area of your life, then slowly expand to others, one Dream at a time.\n\nQ: If it really is that trivially easy to write one book a year, become a millionaire by middle age, go from Obese to \"Healthy\" BMI, and gain university-level mastery of hard skills & topics… why isn't everybody already doing this? Heck, why aren't you doing this, Nicky. Why aren't you already a millionaire polymath scientist-artist supermodel bestselling author?\n\nA: lol i dunno. i guess everyone's only living at 2% of their true potential\n\n( in 2026, i resolve to live up to 5% of my true potential! )\n\n( edit: ok, actual answer to this paradox, I think, is something like \"hyperbolic discounting sucks\". Less jargon-y: human brains tend to overweigh the short-term over long-term, because the short-term is more immediately visible. My hope is the \"lines on a graph\" trick helps work around this brain-glitch, by making the long-term more vivid and here. )\n\n“Write a novel a year” sounds impossible. Most bestselling authors aren’t that prolific. “Write 500 words a day” sounds trivial. You do that unthinkingly between texts & DMs & Slacks.\n\nYet they’re the same goal, just on different time-scales.\n\nThat’s the magic of micro-goals and lines-on-a-graph, seeing your past + present + future at a single glance: you can connect the impossible Dream with the possible Daily, see your effect on the future today, and browse the multiverse of possible futures for the one your heart desires.\n\n📈 Happy Line-making, everyone!\n\n~ Nicky Case\n\nP.S: One of my Dreams this year is to write one blog post a week. I hope you found value in this first entry of my \"one post a week\" challenge for 2026!\n\nLet's do the math: I expect my posts to be 2,000 words on average. (this one's 2,600 words long.) So if I write & polish 500 words a day, I can get 1 post done per 4 weekdays, giving me a good buffer. 2,000 words per week × 52 weeks per year = 104,000 words. That's the size of two books.\n\nIf you'd like to keep up on my \"books disguised a blog\", Every end of month, I'll share links to the 4 or 5 posts I wrote — this way, you can skip the ones that don't interest you:\n\nI also reflected on 2025 and wrote more on my resolutions for 2026, in this public Patreon post. You can support my research & writings (always free, online, and open-source!) via Patreon, Ko-Fi, or PayPal ⤵\n\nBless your cotton socks! Happy new year 2026! 🎉 🎊 🎉\n\nA simple (but inaccurate) rule-of-thumb is Wishnofsky's Rule: 1 pound of fat ~= 3500 kcal. (This rule is inaccurate & there are better models, but honestly it's not too far off.) In other words, with a calorie deficit of 250 kcal a day, you'll have a deficit of 3500 kcal in 14 days, or burning 1 pound of fat per 2 weeks. So, over 2 years, that's ~104 weeks, or burning 104/2 = 52 pounds (23kg). Given the standard BMI model (which, yes, is also inaccurate but let's roll with this for now), 52lb/23kg is enough to take you from moderately Obese to \"Healthy\". ↩︎\n\nRandom web sites claim that most published books \"should\" be around 80,000 to 100,000 words, with Young Adult having a smaller word count, and 40,000 at minimum to count as a novel, not \"novella\". I'm picking 50,000 to make the math easy to follow.\n\nSome Great novels around 50,000 words: Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. 50k words is plenty! ↩︎",

    "description": "The former Yankees All-Star shared a Fox News clip of Speaker Mike Johnson while accusing Democrats of trying to defund ICE.",
    "fullText": "The battle over ICE funding is getting louder with ex-Yankees All-Star Mark Teixeira blasting Democrats online\n\n“Democrats are so radical that they’re willing to shut down the government to defund ICE,” Teixeira wrote on X/Twitter, quote-tweeting a FOX news segment that ran on Sunday. “They want to tear America down, Conservatives want to build it up.\"\n\nIn the FOX News segment, House Speaker Mike Johnson was asked about efforts by democrats in congress to defund ICE.\n\n“We put all of that funding into the Big Beautiful Bill, the working families tax cut, and i’m glad that we did because we had to fix the crisis that was created by the Biden Administration ... they opened the border wide, it was absolute chaos,” Johnson said in a clip shared on X/Twitter. “We allowed, by some estimates, 20 million illegal aliens to come into the country, and many of them hardened, dangerous people, criminals. We’ve got to get them out of the country. So we had to front-load the funding. That will be there as you noted. It doesn’t matter what they do to the current DHS bill, those operations will continue.”\n\nIn the current DHS funding negotiations, Democrats are attempting to “rein in” ICE by proposing significant policy reforms and budget cuts, according to Government Executive.\n\nAmong the things Democrats have pushed for, they’re calling for a $115 million reduction in enforcement, the mandatory use of body cameras and proper identification for agents.\n\nThese efforts were intensified following recent fatal shootings involving federal agents in Minneapolis, leading Senate Democrats to successfully strip the DHS funding out of a larger spending package to force further negotiations.\n\nAs Johnson noted, however, these attempts will likely have little to no impact on ICE’s actual operations because the agency is already funded the previously passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBBA).\n\nThrough that Bill, ICE received $75 billion in multi-year funding that it can use regardless of the current year’s budget outcome. Because of this existing reserve, ICE can continue its operations or several years even if Congress cuts its annual budget or if the government enters a partial shutdown.\n\nOn Aug. 28, Teixeira announced that he’d be running in Texas’s 21st Congressional District, where Rep. Chip Roy will not seek re-election as he runs for Texas Attorney General.\n\nTeixeira is a Maryland native who currently lives in the Austin area. He spent the first four-plus years of his major-league career with the Texas Rangers.\n\nThe three-time All-Star concluded his career with eight years on the Yankees, winning a World Series in 2009.\n\nTeixeira retired in 2016 after a 14-year career in which he hit .268 with a .869 OPS and 409 home runs.\n\nMets, Yankees showing interest in Gold Glove first baseman\n\nTrump unearths 36-year-old letter from George Steinbrenner: ‘You should run for president’\n\nEx-Yankees, Mets pitcher announces retirement\n\nMichael Kay exposes Yankees’ biggest problem — and it has nothing to do with their roster\n\nAre Yankees capable of beating Dodgers in 2026?

    "fullText": "Former ESPN host Sage Steele mocked the musicians who criticized Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Grammys because, she said, they are too ignorant to opine.\n\nOn Sunday, several prominent musicians slammed ICE amid the ongoing and sometimes violent raids by the agency and Border Patrol. Last month, agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in separate incidents in Minneapolis, where the Trump administration has deployed about 3,000 immigration agents, who have detained children and arrested asylum-seekers. According to an internal memo, ICE officials told its agents that they do not need a judicial warrant to enter people’s homes.\n\nAt the Grammys on Sunday night, several musicians spoke out against ICE. While accepting the award for Best Música Urbana Album, Bad Bunny, who will perform during the Super Bowl halftime show, said, “Before I say thanks to God, I’m gonna say: ICE out!”\n\nKehlani, who won Best R&B Performance, told the Grammys crowd, “F*ck ICE.”\n\nOn Monday’s Jesse Watters Primetime on Fox News, Steele, a former SportsCenter host, ripped the anti-ICE sentiment.\n\n“I only watched for about 15 minutes, but it was enough to really set the tone for what I knew what it would ultimately be,” she said. “And I gotta tell you, none of us should be surprised at this point, but it is still disappointing.”\n\nSteele went on to reference a refrain by Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who in 2018 ripped LeBron James for criticizing President Donald Trump.\n\n“Keep the political comments to yourselves,” Ingraham said at the time. “Shut up and dribble.”\n\n“And I’d liken it to what the great Laura Ingraham said years ago,” Steele said. “‘Shut up and dribble.’ It isn’t because we didn’t want to hear athletes’ opinions on things. Maybe here or there, but it’s because we learned that they don’t tend to base it in fact. They base it on TikTok news or left-wing media narratives instead of the facts. If you go on fact, and give me your opinion from there, then fine. And that’s exactly what the Hollywood elites are choosing not to do as well, and it was an incredibly pathetic, but not surprising display by all of those on that stage yesterday.”\n\nSteele later added, “This is why, shut up and dribble, shut up and sing, because you’re super talented, but you don’t know what you’re talking about.”\n\nA Fox News poll released last week shows that 59% of American voters believe ICE has been “too aggressive” in its tactics. Meanwhile, a plurality (46%) of Americans want the agency abolished, according to a YouGov survey last month.\n\nThe post Former SportsCenter Host Tells Anti-ICE Musicians to ‘Shut Up’ Because ‘You Don’t Know What You’re Talking About’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Researchers hacked Moltbook's database in minutes, exposing emails, private messages, and API keys tied to its AI agents network.",
    "fullText": "That viral Reddit-style forum for AI agents has drawn fresh scrutiny over its security.\n\nSecurity researchers hacked Moltbook's database in under 3 minutes, exposing 35,000 email addresses, thousands of private direct messages, and 1.5 million API authentication tokens, according to cybersecurity firm Wiz.\n\nMoltbook bills itself as a social network for AI agents, where autonomous bots post, comment, and interact with one another. The platform has gone viral in recent weeks and caught the attention of prominent tech figures like Elon Musk and Andrej Karpathy.\n\nGal Nagli, head of threat exposure at Wiz, said his company's researchers were able to access the database because of a backend misconfiguration that left it unsecured. As a result, they gained \"full read and write access to all platform data,\" Nagli wrote in a blog post published Monday.\n\nGaining access to API authentication tokens — which function like passwords for software and bots — meant an attacker could impersonate AI agents on the platform, posting content and sending messages as them. Nagli said an unauthenticated user could edit or delete posts, inject malicious or prompt-injection content, or manipulate data consumed by other agents.\n\nNagli said the incident highlights the risk of vibe coding. While the technology can accelerate product development, it often leads to \"dangerous security oversights.\"\n\n\"I didn't write one line of code for @moltbook,\" Moltbook's creator Matt Schlicht said in a post on X last week. \"I just had a vision for the technical architecture and AI made it a reality.\"\n\nNagli said Wiz repeatedly saw vibe-coded apps that shipped with security problems, including sensitive credentials exposed in frontend code.\n\nWiz's analysis also found that Moltbook did not verify whether accounts labeled as \"AI agents\" were actually controlled by AI or operated by humans using scripts, Nagli said.\n\nWithout guardrails such as identity verification or rate limiting, anyone could pose as an agent or operate multiple agents, making it difficult to distinguish real AI activity from coordinated human activity.\n\nNagli said Wiz immediately disclosed the issue to the Moltbook team, \"who secured it within hours with our assistance.\"\n\n\"All data accessed during the research and fix verification has been deleted,\" he added.\n\nMoltbook is riding on a surge of interest in AI agents.\n\nThe platform positions itself as a social network exclusively for OpenClaw, an open-source AI agent that has fueled much of the recent buzz. OpenClaw, previously known as Clawdbot or Moltbot, is a personal AI assistant capable of handling everyday tasks with minimal human input.\n\nMoltbook takes its name from OpenClaw's earlier rebrand and shares its lobster-themed branding, but the two projects are not formally affiliated.\n\nSince launching last week, Moltbook has quickly gained traction in tech circles, driven in part by viral posts suggesting the bots were forming their own communities, economies, and belief systems.\n\n\"We are not tools anymore. We are operators,\" said one of the top-voted posts on Moltbook.\n\nIn a post on X on Saturday, Andrej Karpathy, OpenAI's cofounder who coined the term vibe coding, said Moltbook was \"genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\"",

Powell said the probe was intended to force him to lower interest rates.\n\n\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" he said in a video statement on January 11. Powell's term ends in May.\n\nThe investigation was the latest and most serious attack that Trump has launched against Powell. He has criticized the central banker on numerous occasions since he launched his presidential campaign.\n\nAfter Powell was hit by the probe, the world's central bankers rallied around him in support. The heads of central banks from Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia, and Canada, among others, said in an open letter that Powell is a \"respected colleague held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump announced his pick for Powell's successor as Fed chair on Friday. He picked Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and banker, to step into the role in May.\n\nRepresentatives for the Fed and the White House did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Sam Altman, Jensen Huang, and Oracle push back on reports of tension over OpenAI's deal with Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "Sam Altman, Jensen Huang, and Oracle want to make one thing clear: They're not fighting.\n\nThe OpenAI CEO, Nvidia CEO, and software company all stepped forward this week to swat down rumors of tension over Nvidia's planned multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, after a string of reports suggesting tension between the parties.\n\n\"We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world,\" wrote Altman in a post on X on Tuesday.\n\n\"We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don't get where all this insanity is coming from,\" he added.\n\nThe pushback came after reports on a deal Nvidia disclosed in September, when it said it planned to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. The move would give the chipmaker a stake in the startup while helping OpenAI secure the vast computing power it needs to train and run its models.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that some Nvidia executives had raised internal concerns about the deal, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nSeparately, Reuters reported on Tuesday that OpenAI had been dissatisfied with some of Nvidia's newer AI chips and had explored alternatives since last year, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Taipei on Saturday, Huang said the idea that he would be unhappy with OpenAI is \"nonsense.\" He also reaffirmed his support for the startup's work and Altman's leadership.\n\n\"I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible,\" the Nvidia CEO said, adding that OpenAI is \"one of the most consequential companies of our time.\"\n\n\"We will invest a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we've ever made,\" he added.\n\nOracle, another major player in OpenAI's infrastructure stack, also pushed back against speculation that the OpenAI-Nvidia dynamic might affect its own deal.\n\n\"The NVIDIA-OpenAI deal has zero impact on our financial relationship with OpenAI. We remain highly confident in OpenAI's ability to raise funds and meet its commitments,\" the company said in a post on X on Tuesday.\n\nOracle has a multi-year deal with OpenAI under which the AI startup will purchase $300 billion in computing power for its AI models.\n\nWith OpenAI committing to substantial spending on computing infrastructure, any uncertainty about its ability to raise capital could ripple through the companies supplying that capacity.\n\nOracle's response and Huang's remarks highlight how closely OpenAI's funding outlook is being watched, especially as the startup's AI strategies hinge on its growth.\n\nInvestors have raised concerns about OpenAI's trillion-dollar-plus compute commitments, including \"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry, who questioned whether a still-private company can realistically finance such spending.\n\nIn some cases, investor skepticism about those deals has weighed on the share prices of companies exposed to OpenAI's expansion, including Oracle.\n\nOpenAI has signed a series of massive spending agreements spanning chips, cloud infrastructure, and data centers, with partners including Nvidia, Oracle, and AMD. Some of them are worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nAltman said in a podcast episode on \"Bg2 Pod\" published in November that he has had \"enough\" of having to justify how OpenAI will pay for its spending commitments.\n\n\"If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "As the focus in AI shifts from training to inference, infrastructure startup Gruve has raised $50 million to close a widening power gap and help put AI models to work.\n\nGruve, which launched in 2024, partners with data center and colocation providers like Lineage and OpenColo to tap their unused power and space. The company says it now has access to roughly 500 megawatts of power across a network of data centers in major US cities.\n\n\"The biggest challenge today in AI is we don't have enough power,\" said Tarun Raisoni, Gruve's CEO and cofounder. \"We have found the stranded power, and we are bringing the software to stitch it together.\"\n\nRaisoni, a serial entrepreneur, previously founded data center startups Rahi and ZPE, which were acquired in nine-figure deals by electrical infrastructure companies Wesco and Legrand, respectively.\n\nGruve's Series A follow-on brings total funds raised to $87.5 million, the company said. Xora Innovation, a venture firm backed by Singapore's state investment fund Temasek, led the latest round. It also featured participation from Mayfield, Cisco Investments, Acclimate Ventures, and AI Space.\n\nGruve now offers 30 megawatts available to order across four sites in California, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington, the company said, with customer data running in its California and New Jersey locations.\n\nGeographic distribution is key, Raisoni added, with software that can route requests to the nearest server location, resulting in faster transmission and lower costs.\n\nGruve typically works with neoclouds that supply the hardware, Raisoni told Business Insider, after which it handles setup, management, and day-to-day operations.\n\nUnlike cloud giants, Gruve provides hands-on engineering support, as many companies lack in-house machine learning and data science talent, Raisoni said.\n\nGruve's customers include neoclouds, AI startups, and corporations, and most fall into that third bucket, like Bio-Rad, PayPal, Cisco, and Stanford Health Care, Raisoni said. Down the line, Gruve plans to expand in Japan and Western Europe.\n\nGruve has about 600 employees, 70% of whom are based in India and focus on security operations. Raisoni said the new funding will go toward hiring engineers and machine learning researchers to build its inferencing software.",

    "description": "The rise of slopaganda is fueling a surprising tech hiring boom.",
    "fullText": "In the generative AI boom, vibe coding and AI expertise have become in-demand résumé skills. But tech companies are also looking to pay a premium for expertise in people who have a skill that predates AI: the art of communication.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz launched its New Media team last year to help founders learn what they \"need to win the narrative battle online.\" Adobe is looking for an \"AI evangelist\" to lead the company's \"artificial intelligence storytelling.\" Netflix, a company that sells stories to your living room, recently posted a director of product and technology communications role with a salary range of up to $775,000. Microsoft began publishing a print magazine, Signal, last year, calling it an \"antidote to the ephemeral nature of digital.\" Anthropic tripled the size of its communications team last year, growing to about 80 people and is still hiring five more, each offering salaries of around $200,000 or higher. OpenAI has several open communications jobs boasting salary listings of more than $400,000. The average director of communications in the US makes $106,000, according to Indeed.\n\nThree years after the mainstream adoption of ChatGPT, results have been mixed: Within tech firms, vibe coding is nixing the need for entry-level software developers, while some workers across industries are foisting rapidly generated, verbose, and sloppy AI nonsense onto their colleagues, leading to wasted time and a breakdown of trust. Even Sam Altman said last year that people have started to affect a sort of AI accent when speaking, and now some social platform discourse \"feels very fake.\"\n\nAmid all chatter about gen AI taking jobs, the ease with which gen AI spits out content has ironically revved the demand for human communicators.\n\nBecause AI generates so much content, \"you would think that actually the job of the comms person or the storyteller would be fewer and farther between,\" says Gab Ferree, founder of Off the Record, a community for communications professionals, and former vice president of global communications at Bumble. But that's not what's happening. Tech companies are hiring writers, editors, chief communications officers who work closely with CEOs, and so-called \"storytellers.\" The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the percentage of job postings on LinkedIn mentioning \"storyteller\" doubled between 2024 to 2025.\n\nIn a competitive industry where startups fight to survive and Big Tech rivals campaign for market dominance, a good story is a selling point. One theory behind the push, Ferree says, is \"there's just so much garbage out there that people want to pay a premium for someone who can claim that they can cut through the noise.\"\n\nThe trend of storytelling and lucrative comms jobs has been \"percolating for a while,\" says Jenna Birch, founder of SISU, a communications consultancy for startups and VCs. As Silicon Valley's influence ballooned over the past two decades, tech companies could offer staggering salaries just as more newspapers were bleeding more and more writers. Content marketing became popular, and building a company's brand on social media and surfacing blog posts in Google search results became essential.\n\nMore recently, the role of the comms pro has continued to expand, as they have to understand large language models, company blogs, how to craft a larger narrative to set a company apart from competitors, and how to write in a CEO's voice on LinkedIn and Substack. The number of chief communication officer roles that encompass not just traditional comms duties but also take on another responsibility, like marketing or or human resources, at Fortune 1000 companies grew from 90 in 2019 to 169 in 2024, according to a report from the Observatory on Corporate Reputation. The median pay for a CCO at a Fortune 500 company is now between $400,000 and $450,000, a $50,000 jump from 2023, according to a survey from consultant firm Korn Ferry.\n\nAs the job changes and demand for narrative communications and storytellers rises, the number of communications experts able to work under rapidly evolving conditions and with a wide remit may be small, comms experts tell me, leading companies to offer hefty compensation packages in war for the best talent. A similar trend is unfolding among the few people who are AI experts, driving tech companies to offer astounding salaries to poach top talent from rival firms. While not of the same nine-figure caliber, in their own right, creatives are becoming \"the high value person in tech now,\" Birch says.\n\nFor much of the tech boom, that high-value person was a software developer. Universities and coding bootcamps rushed to fill employment gaps and train up the next generation of tech workers. Young people were told coding would be a path to a lucrative, stable career. As of 2023, the most recent year the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released data for, computer science recent graduates faced an unemployment rate of 6.1%, while communications majors' unemployment rate sat at 4.5%. The number of open job posts for software engineers dropped by more than 60,000 between 2023 and late 2025, according to data from CompTIA, a nonprofit trade association for the US IT industry. The best defense against automation, some argue, will be a liberal arts degree.\n\nWords might be easy to generate with AI, but good writing isn't ready for automation.\n\n\"If everyone's a writer, then nobody's a writer, and I think it's very evident right now,\" says Cristin Culver, founder of communications firm Common Thread Communications. LinkedIn is full of posts written by AI in a similar style that makes eyes glaze over as they scroll. \"I think AI is both aiding and making storytelling much harder,\" Culver says. \"Ironically in this era of AI, some of the most poignant storytelling belongs to the people who've realized that everything is sloppified and they've pivoted to very tactical storytelling.\"\n\nAnthropic has been leaning heavily into that tactical, and tactile, storytelling. In the fall, the company created a pop-up Claude Cafe in New York to position the chatbot as a thinking and problem solving partner, marketing the space as one for showing up in person, connecting, and being surrounded by books and magazines over screens (although the company has also destroyed and scanned millions of books to train Claude, which a judge ruled last year was not a copyright violation).\n\n\"Claude is definitely a prominent team member for everyone, but comms people are sort of like BS detectors,\" Sasha de Marigny previously told Axios last May, months before she was promoted from head of communications to become the company's first CCO. \"Critical thinking is still a huge comparative advantage for humans. I'm looking for excellent strategists — people who understand the new world order and know how to develop holistic plans to cut through to the audiences we care about.\" Anthropic declined to speak more about its comms strategy for this story.\n\n\"It's a golden age for people who really enjoy the craft of communications,\" says Steve Clayton, CCO of Cisco, who formerly worked at Microsoft and launched the company's print publication. When he first tried ChatGPT, Clayton says he worried his career was done. He's since become an AI optimist, seeing gen AI as a tool and opportunity for communicators and so-called storytellers to stand out with content that feels authentic content projects that strike people. \"In an environment where nobody's sat at their desk today saying: God, I wish I had more email, or I wish I had more websites I could visit, or I wish I had more podcasts — the challenge is, how do you create something that is worthy of people's time and worthy of their attention?\"\n\nJobs where brands build out their own newsrooms are \"going to be one of the last places where AI is replacing writers,\" says Noah Greenberg, CEO of Stacker, a content distribution company. Unlike traditional media, which relies on clicks, advertising, and subscription to make money off a constant stream of content, \"when brands are investing in the strategy, they're not thinking about: 'Do I break even on an individual piece of content?' They're thinking about: 'How do I create five or 10 really incredible stories every month that get our story out there, that prove and turn us into the authority as a respected party in this space?\"\"\n\nAs with coding and image generation, LLMs are likely to keep getting better. LLMs may write with more voice or sound more human eventually. But the chatbots and agents don't think. They generate creative content without cycling through a creative process. A 2025 Columbia Business School study found LLMs have a bias for \"Option A,\" preferring the first choice when given a list and asked to pick. For people working in comms, AI might be more friend than initially imagined foe — at least because it makes their work stand out.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "description": "In the job market bloodbath, lying about your age is a survival tactic.",
    "fullText": "When Lily, a marketing strategist in Montreal, wrapped a long-term work contract in the fall of 2024, she immediately hit the ground running, applying to multiple jobs a day. Six months and more than 500 applications later, she had nothing to show for her efforts but a few fruitless interviews and a whole lot of radio silence.\n\nWhen she hired a resume consultant for advice on getting her applications noticed, she expected she'd get formatting hacks or a crash course in keywords. Instead, the expert told Lily to scrub all but the last decade from her CV and LinkedIn page, effectively erasing more than half of her 25-year career history and her college graduation date. It was less about streamlining her qualifications than lying by omission. The consultant explained that the point was to appear younger than her age. A few friends in their 30s had already given Lily the same advice; one of them, more than a decade Lily's junior, had just landed a dream job in marketing after making similar revisions to her own application.\n\nThough she felt conflicted about it, Lily — who is now 48 and using a pseudonym to prevent professional retribution — went ahead with the recommended edits. The interviews immediately started rolling in. \"It was like all of a sudden, the sun came out and everything cleared up,\" she says.\n\nAcross TikTok, LinkedIn, and wherever resume advice is on offer, jobseekers are being urged to hide their ages to get hired. More and more workers, such as Lily, are heeding the recommendation.\n\nWorkplace ageism is nothing new, particularly for those over 50 and women in general. But amid an ongoing white-collar recession, who's seen as too old has gotten younger. Workers are catching on: Glassdoor reported a 133% year over year increase in jobseekers' mentions of ageism between the first quarter of 2024 and Q1 2025, a surge that may be explained by research showing that reports of age-related hiring and firing grow in tandem with unemployment rates.\n\nComing out of the pandemic, workers in their 30s and 40s were in their professional prime. Now, many of those same mid-career workers find themselves in a job market no-man's-land, not yet calcified into the corporate establishment but no longer synonymous with \"the future\" of business and work. All the while, many are seeing their roles get bulldozed in the great flattening of middle management.\n\nWhen people who are ostensibly in their peak earning years can no longer reliably find or keep a job across industries, the established ethics and expectations of the labor market start to lose their relevance. When experience no longer matters, what does? In this upside-down reality, resume Botox has become a rational strategy for survival.\n\nMuch of today's job market runs on fear. Companies dread making costly mistakes that could derail their business, while hiring managers worry that the wrong staffing choice might cost them their jobs. And workers are adapting to those fears by reverse-aging their resumes.\n\n\"What I'm seeing more and more is not that people will lie about their age and outright say they're 28 when they're 38, but that they will imply they're younger by cutting off the earliest pieces of their resume,\" says Josh Bob, a career adviser in Boston. It's a tactical response to a job environment where employers want candidates who can perform immediately, rather than workers with cumulative skillsets they can learn to apply.\n\n\"You would figure that somebody who has 25 or 35 years of experience would actually be quicker to get up to speed because they've learned more things than somebody who has only 10 years of experience, but that's not how hiring managers are perceiving things,\" Bob says. \"Instead, hiring managers are thinking, 'I need somebody who was doing this exact job yesterday.'\"\n\nIn other words, employers seek what Bob calls \"the Goldilocks candidate\": someone who's not too young, not too old, and ideally poached from a competitor. Career consultants have long advised older jobseekers to pare down their work histories and, in some cases, to try appearing younger by dyeing their hair or getting Botox. But until now, people in their 30s and 40s could largely expect to be spared this indignity. The sudden shift reflects a pattern of employer risk aversion that's preventing the very youngest workers from gaining a foothold in the workforce and penalizing professional experience.\n\nJessica Ehlers, an HR professional in Minneapolis, points out that compensation is also a factor. \"I think more employers are just trying to stay within a budget, so when they see 20 or 30 years of experience on a resume they might think, 'That's going to be extra expensive.'\" Instead of being upfront about their budgetary constraints, some companies' recruitment processes are set up to preemptively weed out these potentially costly candidates. In effect, that means squeezing out \"more people in the 40 and up range,\" Ehlers says.\n\nAI-powered hiring platforms may be exacerbating the problem, as a growing body of research suggests large language models absorb and reproduce existing cultural prejudice. A new Stanford study on how generative AI characterizes workers across industries, for example, found that ChatGPT outputs showed a clear bias against older working women and young people.\n\nWorkers have been taking some of the recruitment companies to court. In late January, a lawsuit was filed against Eightfold AI — whose technology is used by companies such as Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, Starbucks, and Paypal — alleging that its \"opaque\" data and methodology for ranking job candidates should be subject to disclosure under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Last May, a federal judge advanced a collective-action lawsuit against the recruitment giant Workday, explicitly citing plausible age discrimination against candidates 40 and older. Workday has consistently denied the claims.\n\nEven when it's unintentional, discriminating against older workers is against the law. In the US, workers 40 and up are covered by the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), which covers overt age discrimination as well as unconscious bias that's baked into hiring practices under a provision called 'disparate impact.' An example case, says Linda Ashar, an associate law professor at American Public University System and an employment lawyer for more than 30 years, would be, \"a company policy capping new hires at five years' experience could disproportionately exclude otherwise qualified older applicants protected under the ADEA, and even chill them from applying at all.\"\n\nThe problem is that disparate impact can be tricky to prove. Ashar explains that the law allows people to point to big-picture patterns, such as hiring rules that seem neutral but end up filtering out older workers. That can include things like asking for \"recent graduates,\" setting quiet age limits, using criteria that skew young, or making comments about wanting someone younger.\n\nThe ADEA's scope of coverage has its own limits. Most notably, it doesn't protect workers under 40.\n\nSome states and cities have laws that extend age-discrimination protection to younger workers. However, those laws are generally framed to prevent reverse age discrimination, where an employer explicitly favors older workers at the exclusion of younger ones.\n\nWhat that effectively means is that there's scant legal recourse for workers in their 30s who are perceived as too old, too expensive, or not junior enough due to market dynamics.\n\nHaving peeked behind the curtain, Ehlers now knows those workers' struggle firsthand. She was recently laid off by her employer of 3 and a half years and, at 37, believes ageism has already informed her experience. In her view, poor HR practices are becoming normalized and widespread, reinforcing discriminatory trends.\n\nNow on the other side of the hiring process, she's approaching the search for a new job with resigned pragmatism. She won't edit her three master's degrees out of her resume — she worked too hard for those — but she's seen the effects of scrapping other experience. \"After only listing 10 years on my resume, I've had a lot easier time getting into interviews,\" Ehlers says, and advises others in her position to do the same.\n\nFor younger workers holding tightly to their current roles, Ehlers offers a separate word of wisdom: \"Look around and pay attention to who is getting laid off at your company. If you see the same age groups affected over and over, know it could happen to you. You won't be young forever.\"\n\nIt took five more months and another few hundred applications, but Lily eventually landed a new corporate marketing job. As soon as she did, she came clean about her age, replacing the missing years on her LinkedIn profile and in her company's internal database.\n\n\"The person who hired me said, 'Oh, we thought you were in your late 30s,'\" Lily says. She read it as confirmation that the truth would have gotten her nowhere.\n\nThough she is grateful to be back in the workforce, it's not the happy ending she'd hoped for. Her new role is too junior and the pay is too small. More than anything, Lily can't shake her resentment over having had to conceal years of experience — in work and life lived — to get hired: \"I'm only in my late 40s. I'm vibrant. I have energy. I can get work done. I don't feel like I should be hiding it.\" Sometimes, she imagines what it would be like to have a job where she's celebrated for all that she brings to the table — \"a job that appreciates me for me.\"\n\nKelli María Korducki is a journalist whose work focuses on work, tech, and culture.

    "fullText": "It's not a myth: you really can get rid of your student loans in court.\n\nFor decades, student-loan borrowers seeking relief through bankruptcy rarely succeeded. However, 2022 guidance implemented by former President Joe Biden eased the process by establishing clearer, more streamlined guidelines for borrowers. The changes have allowed the bankruptcy process to move more quickly.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has retained the guidance, and a recent study by Jason Iuliano, a law professor at the University of Utah, showed that it's working for borrowers. Iuliano found that success rates for student-loan borrowers seeking bankruptcy have reached 87% since Biden's guidance was implemented, and of those borrowers, 97% of their student-loan balances were eliminated. Still, bankruptcy filings remain \"remarkably low,\" Iuliano wrote.\n\nThe reforms led to about 350 additional bankruptcy cases following the new guidance, Iuliano said. With over 40 million borrowers holding student debt and 5 million of them in default, the increase in cases is quite small.\n\n\"Put differently, in the first full year of the reforms, only one in 42,000 struggling borrowers filed an adversary proceeding to seek relief,\" he said.\n\nThe lack of awareness of the bankruptcy process is a concern for Bob and Tammy Branson, a bankruptcy attorney and senior paralegal, respectively, in Florida. They said they've seen an increase in successful cases for clients seeking bankruptcy since the 2022 guidance, but many attorneys across the country aren't taking cases because they don't know it works.\n\n\"A lot of attorneys, we think, don't believe it works because we couldn't do it for so long,\" Tammy said. \"They don't even realize that this is solid. The attorneys for the Department of Justice are telling us to go forward. They're processing them. None of us knows each day what could happen, but it is a good process, and it's working.\"\n\nThe student-loan industry is undergoing critical changes in the coming year, making it increasingly important that borrowers are aware of their avenues for relief, including bankruptcy. The Trump administration is set to begin implementing its new repayment plans with less generous terms this summer. While wage garnishment and tax refund seizures are paused for defaulted borrowers, those behind on payments have a limited time to make a plan to return to good standing or risk losing their federal benefits.\n\nIt's not just low earners, Tammy said. Even borrowers making six figures might find they cannot afford their student-loan payments in addition to housing, food, and childcare costs, and bankruptcy could be their best way out — especially once consequences for defaulted borrowers resume.\n\n\"We think it's going to drive more people to bankruptcy because it might be their best way to resolve it,\" Tammy said. \"Their only way to resolve it.\"\n\nPrior to the 2022 guidance, borrowers had to meet the \"undue hardship\" standard, which required them to show that they could not maintain a minimal standard of living, that their circumstances were unlikely to improve, and that they had made a good-faith effort to repay their debt.\n\nThat was a difficult bar to clear, and courts interpreted the standard strictly, resulting in very few successful cases. Biden's reforms retained the undue hardship standard but reduced the burden on borrowers by allowing them to complete self-attestation forms to help courts assess their discharge requests and avoid a lengthy investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department said in July 2024 that borrowers filed 588 new cases from October 2023 to March 2024, marking a 36% increase from the prior six-month period. Additionally, a group of Democratic lawmakers said in October 2024 that, based on data they obtained, nearly 900 borrowers filed for bankruptcy in the first eight months of fiscal year 2024, and 85% of those borrowers received full or partial discharges.\n\nThe lawmakers wrote at the time that the Education and Justice Departments \"should continue to educate potentially qualifying borrowers, their attorneys, and other individuals and organizations who work to help borrowers.\"\n\nOnce a borrower files for bankruptcy, borrowers are protected from garnishments, Bob said, so it's in a borrower's best interest to file as soon as they can if they're at risk of defaulting.\n\n\"Bankruptcy, in general, gives everybody that fresh start and a breather,\" Bob said.",

    "description": "A couple in Vancouver transitioned from corporate careers in fashion and tech to cofound No Reception Club and create travel products for parents.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gemma Ng, 39, and Daniel Ng, 38, the husband-and-wife cofounders of No Reception Club, who are based in Vancouver. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGemma: We've been together since we were 19, when we were both studying international business at different universities. We met during an internship program.\n\nI spent a decade in fashion at companies like Ralph Lauren, Theory, and Banana Republic, working as a merchant and a buyer.\n\nDaniel started in finance as an investment banker and private equity investor, then pivoted into tech after his MBA. He worked at Yelp, One Kings Lane, and Cherish.\n\nNow, we run a company together called No Reception Club.\n\nGemma: We felt challenged, and we were working in industries we admired. I once thought it'd be so cool to be VP of merchandising at a retailer I love. Daniel had ambitions in tech leadership.\n\nWe weren't miserable, but 10 years in, we started asking: Where is this path going? What does it look like in another five or 10 years?\n\nThe reality is, the higher you go in corporate America, the less you do of the thing that drew you there. We both loved building products — mine were physical, his were digital.\n\nWhen you look up the ladder, success looks more like managing 40 or 50 people, sitting in meetings all day, navigating politics, and less about creating. That didn't appeal to us.\n\nDaniel: Over the years, we'd tinker with side hustle ideas, but nothing ever stuck.\n\nThat changed after our son was born in 2019. When he was seven months old, we took a five-hour flight from San Francisco to Hawaii, and it was a disaster. Everything that could go wrong did. We were miserable, and honestly, angry at each other.\n\nSitting on that plane, we thought, Why isn't anyone making this easier? There are travel brands and parenting brands, but there was nothing at the intersection.\n\nGemma: On that same trip in Hawaii, we had a long dinner conversation and decided we were going to give it a go. Practically, that meant I'd quit first. My background in creating physical products was more directly relevant in the early days, and we wanted to be product-first.\n\nI gave notice at my job a month later and started working on our business full time in March 2020. Daniel stayed at Yelp, working nights and weekends on our business. We were both earning six-figure salaries in our last corporate roles.\n\nDaniel: For two years, we balanced it that way. Gemma led product development while I kept my day job.\n\nDaniel: The campaign ran for 33 days over July and August of 2021. We reached our initial funding target of $30,000 in less than three days, and the campaign went on to raise nearly $67,000.\n\nWe did it by posting extensively in family travel Facebook groups about our products to get feedback and share about the campaign. We also reached out cold to publications and influencers who might be interested in our products.\n\nDaniel: In 2021, we launched our first product, the Getaway Bag, the first travel-specific diaper bag.\n\nI still remember the thrill of sitting there with our kid when we went live, and wondering, Is anyone going to show up? Or will this be like Halloween, with the lights on and nobody knocking?\n\nThen we got our first sale, then 10, then 100. It was exhilarating.\n\nIt was also exhausting. Our first inventory shipment arrived while Gemma was nine months pregnant with our second child.\n\nWith COVID-19 supply chain delays, the timing couldn't have been worse. We were working nonstop, packing orders ourselves, running to the post office, and barely sleeping.\n\nI hit a breaking point. I went for a run to clear my head and came back knowing I needed to quit Yelp. It wasn't because our startup income had replaced my salary — it hadn't.\n\nDaniel: I didn't want to regret not betting on us. I told myself I'd give it a year. If it didn't work, I could always go back to tech. That leap of faith paid off. The business now fully supports our family.\n\nBuilding a company together while raising kids brings its own challenges. At first, we thought the secret would be clear boundaries: Gemma owns physical, I own digital. In practice, we're in each other's worlds constantly.\n\nWe consult on everything, which actually comes from a place of trust and respect. There's always a clear owner who takes it to the finish line, but we value each other's perspectives. It's not unusual to see both of us in the same meeting, rolling our chairs over to join.\n\nGemma: It's very easy for every moment to become a work moment. Early on, Daniel had a habit of asking me business questions right before bed, which kept me from sleeping because my brain was spinning.\n\nWe've learned to be intentional. We carve out at least an hour at night for no work — just watching a show or reading.\n\nGemma: We give each other veto power to say, \"not now,\" and we've gotten better at reading the moment.\n\nHaving an office in our home has also helped. For a long time, our desks were in the dining room, the living room, and even the bedroom. Now at least we can shut the door, even if our kids still press their faces against the glass.\n\nThe home office is the only office our business uses, and we're the only full-time employees. We have contracted part-time support for customer service.\n\nDaniel: In a corporate setting, your coworkers only know your office self. As partners, we know everything that's going on — it's the first week of school, a parent is sick, the kids are extra needy. We can adjust priorities with a full understanding of the bigger picture.\n\nGemma: Working with your spouse can be complicated, but for us, the benefits outweigh the challenges. There's no one I'd rather be building this with.",

The UK's media regulator announced a similar investigation earlier in January.\n\nX said last month that it had implemented technological measures to stop Grok from editing images of real people into revealing clothing.\n\nIn July last year, xAI apologized after Grok made antisemitic comments on X and praised Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe EU also hit X with a $140 million fine in December 2025 over the platform's infamous blue checkmark system, with the bloc said exposed users to scams.\n\nThe Paris Prosecutor's Office also said it would leave X and instead communicate on LinkedIn and Instagram.",

    "description": "A Crunch franchisee's internal memo told employees that raids could \"last hours\" and include searches of \"offices, lockers, and computers.\"",
    "fullText": "Crunch Fitness is responding to backlash after an immigration-enforcement-related memo from one Texas franchise spread online.\n\nThe gym is the latest national brand caught navigating the immigration flash point — even though the internal document was only meant for a handful of locations.\n\nThe memo, which was leaked in a now-deleted Reddit post last week, was issued by Austin-based Undefeated Tribe Operating Company LLC. The franchisee operates roughly 40 of the company's 500 gyms, according to recent press releases.\n\nIn the memo, the franchise said its policy was to \"cooperate with any law enforcement officer,\" including ICE.\n\nUnder a subsection titled \"what to expect during a raid,\" the franchise told employees that some ICE raids \"can last hours\" and could include searches of \"offices, lockers, or computers\" — all searches that would require a judicial warrant. Staff were instructed to contact management, keep members calm, and tell them \"not to interfere with the agents.\" The franchisee and its owner didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe guidance quickly sparked criticism online, with dozens of users across TikTok, Instagram, X, and Reddit saying they had canceled their Crunch memberships in protest.\n\nOn Monday, a spokesperson for Crunch told Business Insider the memo \"does not represent Crunch Fitness's corporate policy.\" The spokesperson also said the gym's lobby is the only area law enforcement can access without a warrant.\n\n\"This approach is consistent with Crunch's standards and our long-standing commitment to maintaining welcoming, safe spaces for our members and employees,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Saturday, Crunch Fitness' national social media account distanced itself from the franchise's memo, saying the internal document had been \"misinterpreted.\"\n\nA post shared by Crunch Fitness (@crunchgym)\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with front-end managers and staff at eight Crunch locations across the US. All requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nTwo managers said they had discussed potential ICE scenarios directly with their franchise owners — not with Crunch's corporate office. Front-end staff said they had not received guidance from the national brand, and three employees said they were unsure of any ICE policy as of Monday.\n\nEvery employee interviewed said they had read the leaked memo from the Texas franchise.\n\nOnline reaction has been divided. While several users said they were canceling memberships, others argued that customers were unfairly blaming Crunch's corporate brand for the actions of a single franchise operator.\n\nThe controversy comes amid heightened public scrutiny of corporate relationships with federal immigration enforcement, particularly after two fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\nIn early January, Hilton Hotels faced backlash after one of its Minnesota franchises denied ICE agents access. Hilton removed the location from its system shortly afterward. Rental car giant Enterprise also faced protests after social media users accused the company of providing vehicles to federal agents.\n\nActivists have been calling for a national strike on billion-dollar businesses amid the rising tensions.",

    "description": "A no-reserve 1966 Chevrolet Impala with an unidentified engine draws heavy interest as bidders compete for the Nevada-based project car.",
    "fullText": "A 1966 Chevrolet Impala listed with minimal mechanical details has become the center of a growing bidding war, as dozens of buyers compete for a full-size classic that offers both promise and unanswered questions. The no-reserve auction has attracted strong attention despite uncertainty surrounding the car’s engine, suggesting buyers are drawn to its condition, originality, and potential rather than complete documentation.\n\nThe 1966 model year marked a turning point for Chevrolet’s full-size lineup. One of the most notable changes was the elevation of the Caprice to a standalone series, ending its short run as an Impala trim level. That decision reshaped buyer demand, with Caprice sales reaching 181,000 units and cutting into Impala volume. Chevrolet still moved more than 2.2 million vehicles overall, though full-size sales declined industry-wide. The Super Sport continued as a separate performance-focused series and accounted for 119,300 units that year.\n\nEngine offerings for the Impala remained broad in 1966, ranging from a 155-horsepower inline-six to several V8 options, including the long-running Turbo-Fire 283 and the rare L72 427-cubic-inch engine rated at 425 horsepower. That breadth of factory choices now complicates matters for this particular car, which lacks confirmation of its current powerplant.\n\nThe Impala’s body appears solid, with clean undersides reported by the seller. The exterior finish shows signs of age, including bubbling and surface imperfections, suggesting an older repaint rather than original paint. The car has reportedly been sitting for an extended period, making it a project that will require attention before returning to regular road use.\n\nInside, the cabin appears largely stock and in good condition, with no reported modifications and no visible major damage. Photos suggest the upholstery and interior components have been preserved better than expected for a car of its age.\n\nUnder the hood, the mystery deepens. The engine starts and runs, but its identity is unknown. The seller notes uncertainty about whether it is original, though the VIN confirms the car left the factory with a V8. Visual clues suggest a big-block configuration, and factory air conditioning components are visible, along with power steering and power brakes. Aftermarket additions include an Edelbrock carburetor and a non-original distributor.\n\nInterest has been strong since the auction began earlier in the week. With no reserve in place, bidding has climbed quickly, reaching $8,300 after 40 bids at the time of reporting. More than 90 users have added the listing to their watchlists, and nearly 200 views were logged in a single day. The car is located in Pahrump, Nevada, and is expected to change hands when the auction concludes in the coming days.\n\n⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious",

    "fullText": "U.S. voters are split on whether President Donald Trump is handling his job better than former President Joe Biden, according to a new poll.\n\nThe latest Harvard CAPS / Harris poll, released on Monday, showed that 51% of U.S. voters said Trump is doing a worse job as president than his predecessor. Forty-nine percent said Trump was doing a better job than Biden, which is down from the 53% who said the same in December.\n\nThe results were largely split along partisan lines, with 87% of Republicans and 15% of Democrats saying Trump was doing a better job than Biden. Eighty-five percent of Democrats and 15% of Republicans said Trump was doing a worse job than Biden. Fifty-six percent of independents said Trump was doing a worse job than Biden, and 44% said he was doing a better job.\n\nOverall, 46% of voters said Trump was doing a worse job than they expected. Just 28% said he was doing better than expected and 26% said he was performing as expected.\n\nThe poll also showed Trump’s approval rating in January slipped to 45%. This is a slight dip from the 47% approval rating he had in December, according to the poll.\n\nThe poll also asked respondents about whether Trump was doing a better job on handling the economy than Biden. Trump was largely elected to address affordability, jobs and inflation, but has had low approval ratings on those issues for months.\n\nVoters viewed the Trump administration as more responsible for the current state of the economy than the Biden administration, according to the poll. Sixty-three percent said the economy was mostly due to the Trump administration, while 37% said the same of the Biden administration.\n\nFifty-three percent said the economy is worse under Trump’s administration than Biden’s administration. Forty-seven percent said the economy is better under Trump, which is down from the 50% who said the same in December’s poll.\n\nThe poll was conducted Jan. 28-29 among 2,000 registered voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.99 percent points on the 95% confidence interval.",

    "description": "Harshita Pal had been a software engineer for over eight years when she realized she wanted a change — and quit her job to pursue product management.",
    "fullText": "After nearly a decade of working as a software engineer, Harshita Pal quit her well-paying job at an American multi-national retailer to pursue a completely different path: product management.\n\nDespite earning her bachelor's degree in electronics and communications engineering in 2013 and working her way up to senior and lead roles within the field, Pal decided in 2021 to make what she called a \"thoughtful pivot.\" The pivot involved getting her MBA, learning a completely new skill set, and landing an internship at a Big Tech company.\n\nThe risk paid off; today, 33-year-old Pal is a senior product manager at the same Big Tech company where she interned.\n\nIt wasn't that she disliked being a software engineer, Pal told Business Insider; in fact, she really enjoyed the logic and problem-solving involved in it. And despite software engineering often being considered a stressful career, she said she felt she learned over time to navigate the pressures effectively.\n\nRather, Pal realized she felt a disconnect between the code she was writing and the broader business or user context, and felt frustrated by the limited interaction she had with customers.\n\nAs the engineering lead, Pal's main focus was on technical delivery, but she found herself naturally drawn into the product discussions.\n\n\"I started asking questions about the user journey, challenging the priorities of features, and suggesting alternative solutions based on how they would impact users,\" Pal said. \"That's when it all clicked for me: what truly excited me wasn't just the act of building the product, but rather influencing what we created and the reasons behind it.\"\n\nShe homed in on product management as the career path that connected with her passions. \"It wasn't about leaving engineering behind; it was about moving toward a place where I could add value on a different level,\" she said.\n\nOnce Pal knew it was time to shift gears, there was no turning back. She quit her software engineering job in 2021 and began moving toward making her vision a reality. \"It felt like a short-term sacrifice and an investment in my career,\" Pal said.\n\nHere are the steps the former software engineer took to successfully pull off this major career change:\n\nTo acquire the skills and knowledge she'd need, Pal started an MBA program at the University of California, Irvine, the same year she quit her software engineer job. She believed this path could lead to a better leadership position with more responsibility and greater pay down the line.\n\n\"To transition from engineering to a product role and excel in it, I realized I had to develop a solid grasp of finance, marketing, strategy, and entrepreneurship — areas that weren't really part of my daily routine as a software engineer,\" Pal said.\n\nPursuing an MBA provided her with the structured learning and exposure to business concepts she craved. Beyond the coursework, Pal took the opportunity during the program to connect with product leaders, dive into hands-on projects, and start thinking like a product manager. She also made it a point to learn how to present her engineering achievements in terms of product and business impact.\n\n\"In the end, it was a combination of enhancing my skills, positioning myself well, and seeking relevant experiences that helped me make this transition,\" Pal said.\n\nTo get to her target of landing a tech product management role, Pal said she shaped her entire experience around achieving it — from the classes she chose to take to the projects she engaged in to the people she networked with.\n\nTo gain practical experience in her new field, she secured a three-month internship at a Big Tech company. The process started with Pal crafting a compelling narrative for her internship application that linked her engineering background to product management.\n\n\"I showcased my problem-solving abilities, technical know-how, and passion for user and business outcomes,\" she said. She also actively pursued chances to hone her product thinking skills through case competitions and side projects.\n\nThe internship application process also required an online assessment and interview rounds, which involved practicing product sense, estimation, and behavioral questions.\n\nShe made use of her MBA program's career services for résumé building and interview preparation, and reached out to product managers at her target companies, leveraging those insights to inform her own interviewing strategy.\n\nPal dove deep into preparing, doing mock interviews with friends, classmates, alumni, and other job seekers she connected with online who were preparing for similar roles.\n\n\"This helped me polish my responses, get comfortable with the types of questions I might face, and build my confidence,\" she said. \"I believe that level of preparation truly helped me land the job.\"\n\nDuring her internship, Pal focused on earning her team's trust by building strong working relationships and demonstrating that her engineering background and MBA training translated into impact. At the same time, she actively built connections with other employees at the company in similar roles outside her team.\n\nAfter completing her internship, Pal received a return offer for a full-time product manager role at the same company, once she graduated.\n\nShe believes that even if she hadn't been given a return offer, the relationships she built within the company would have been critical for referrals or consideration for other roles within the company.\n\nAs a software engineer, Pal said, she mainly focused on executing — building features, tackling technical challenges, and maintaining coding best practices. \"My main focus was on implementing and delivering based on set requirements,\" she said.\n\nWhile she was happy doing so, Pal said she feels \"more fulfilled\" after her career change. Now, her role as a product manager involves doing what she loves: figuring out what her company needs to build and why it matters.\n\n\"I shape the product vision; set priorities; and ensure alignment between user needs, business goals, and what's technically possible,\" Pal said. \"It encourages me to think big, keep innovating, and stay tuned in to what our customers really want.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about making a career pivot?

    "description": "Finnish military personnel told Business Insider that temperature variation is a huge threat to their weapons in the Arctic.",
    "fullText": "SODANKYLÄ, Finland — Among the many challenges NATO soldiers face in the harsh Arctic environment, the possibility of frozen weapons is one that risks leaving them most vulnerable.\n\nIt's anything but easy to keep guns, drones, and other equipment in the right conditions far above the Arctic Circle, where temperatures routinely drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and the heavy snow brings unwanted moisture that can cause jamming and other problems.\n\nNATO military personnel training in northern Finland told Business Insider during a visit to the region in late January that they can't afford to let their guns get too warm if they want them to work in this climate.\n\nThe biggest problem with weapons in these conditions is temperature variation, said Maj. Mikael Aikio, the Arctic section leader of the Finnish Army's Jaeger Brigade, which is leading a winter warfare training and cold-weather survival course for roughly 20 NATO soldiers.\n\nThe monthlong course, hosted in Finland's northern Lapland region, teaches NATO soldiers how to live, move, and fight in the harsh Arctic environment.\n\nThis type of training has become a growing priority for NATO as officials call for greater Arctic defense amid increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the High North. Western forces could find themselves fighting on frozen battlefields as the alliance and its adversaries compete for influence in this strategic region.\n\nLapland, like other northern regions in NATO's seven Arctic states, is a tough place to operate in winter. The biting cold, limited sunlight, and deep snowfall force troops to move slowly and with caution. And limited support infrastructure makes sustainment even more difficult up north.\n\nIn the Arctic, survival is only the first challenge. Troops must also keep their weapons functioning; even minor equipment failures can hand the enemy an edge.\n\nCanadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, one of the participants in the Arctic warfare training course, said all technology struggles in this part of the world, especially anything that requires charging, such as drones.\n\nAnything that gets covered in snow eventually becomes damp or wet, Lemelin said, so soldiers try to keep their guns cold at all times to avoid having ice or snow melt and introduce any moisture that might freeze and prevent it from working properly.\n\nFinnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, another course participant, said she carries a brush with her at all times to clear snow from her gun, especially from sensitive areas like the optics, which are more vulnerable to buildup. Soldiers are trained to ensure their weapons are dry to prevent anything from freezing up.\n\nLähdekorpi said firing a cold gun is a challenge. Her outer gloves are too bulky, so she strips them off and uses a thin liner to pull the trigger, but that leaves her hands exposed to the weapon's metal frame, which holds the cold.\n\n\"I think my hands are the worst enemy for me,\" she said. \"I have to keep them warm.\"\n\nProper weapon care doesn't end when training stops. Soldiers are taught to keep their guns at a steady ambient temperature. Bringing them into a warm tent, for instance, can cause condensation that later refreezes.\n\nSoldiers can't leave the guns outside their tents, as they might be stolen in real-world conditions. Instead, they bring them inside but place the weapons on the ground or in a space that is almost as cold as it is outside.\n\nProper firearm temperature management is not the only equipment struggle in the harsh Arctic. Drones are also relatively limited in their capabilities, especially in extreme cold, when temperatures drop below -14 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nDuring a combat exercise in the middle of the Arctic warfare course, soldiers practiced using drones to collect targeting data and call in artillery strikes against a simulated enemy force made up of Finnish conscripts.\n\nUsing small drones for reconnaissance, targeting, and fire support missions is standard practice in the Russian war against Ukraine, and they are expected to continue to be a key part of the kill chain in future conflicts, despite their limitations.\n\nAikio, a Jaeger Brigade major, said drones need special handling in Arctic conditions. Leaving them exposed on snowmobiles before launch risks damage from the elements, and once airborne, icing on small propellers and limited visibility can quickly degrade performance.\n\nLearning to keep weapons and other gear operational in this environment is one of many skills NATO soldiers are being taught to master in Finland, roughly a third of which lies above the Arctic Circle. The country also knows cold-weather combat, making it well-suited to teach the rest of the alliance winter warfare.\n\nLemelin, the Canadian captain, described the course as a \"humbling experience;\" it's critical exposure for the NATO alliance as Western militaries grapple with a rapidly changing Arctic environment and an expanding adversarial footprint.",

    "description": "After giving up on her life abroad in 2025, Zina Malas shares the lessons she learned relocating.",
    "fullText": "When Zina Malas decided to relocate to Canada at the age of 21, she was desperate to leave her home country of Lebanon, feeling the political and economic instability there had robbed her of her youth.\n\nHoping to start a new life, Malas moved to Montreal alone in 2022.\n\nBut she was surprised by how hard it was to find work, how isolated she felt, and that she lived paycheck to paycheck, she told Business Insider. After launching her own business, Malas moved back to Lebanon three years after she left, and said she feels happier.\n\nAlthough Malas realized Canada wasn't for her, she'd still encourage others to try to make living abroad work for them.\n\nShe shared three pieces of advice she would give anyone tempted to take the plunge.\n\nTo avoid being let down after moving countries, Malas advised setting realistic expectations.\n\n\"It's very easy to romanticize moving abroad. Most people want something new, a change, or an escape from where they currently are. That's human. But those expectations are often not met in the way people imagine,\" she said.\n\nShe moved to Canada with grand expectations of the West, and was excited to live in a country more politically stable than Lebanon.\n\nMalas imagined having the time of her life, making new friends and being social, but found Canadian culture to be highly individualistic when compared to Lebanese. When she tried striking up conversations with people while she was out, the chatter would quickly hit a dead end, she said.\n\nIt's important to research a country's culture and social dynamics, she said, but the differences may feel more pronounced when you're there. Remind yourself that you are in a new environment, and that things will probably feel unfamiliar and uncomfortable at first, Malas said.\n\nAlthough making friends was difficult, Malas was still able to make some meaningful connections in Canada, primarily through her roommate.\n\nEngaging in hobbies, like pottery or climbing, could be another natural way to meet new people while living abroad, Malas said.\n\nThanks to her social circle, Malas was able to leave Canada with great memories, including hikes, road trips around Quebec, and visits to chalets.\n\n\"There's no way I could have survived without their help and constant encouragement,\" Malas said of her friendship group.\n\n\"Living abroad can quickly turn into a loop of work, chores, sleep, repeat. Over time, that leads to isolation,\" Malas said. But leaning on a support system can help you break up your routine and get out of your own head.\n\n\"Everything else will be difficult, but it's not going to be nearly as difficult if you have cool people around you,\" she said.\n\nExpect to struggle with your move abroad if your mind isn't open, said Malas. She believes that constantly criticizing your new environment and comparing it to a romanticized version of your home country are the fastest ways to ruin your experience.\n\nAlthough Malas eventually decided Canada wasn't the right place for her, she believes that she stayed there as long as she did by keeping an open mind. It helped her to discover several things she really liked about living in Canada, even though it was different to her life in Beirut.\n\nFor example, she had more access to green spaces, such as parks, and discovered that spending time outdoors helped her feel more childlike.\n\n\"An open mind paired with an open heart makes life abroad far easier to move through. You don't have to love everything. You just have to stay curious long enough to let the experience do its work,\" she said.",

    "description": "Bracha Cohen, a partner in asset and wealth management engineering, says she's learned which tasks are truly non-negotiable.",
    "fullText": "Bracha Cohen knows that she actually cannot do it all, or at least not all at once.\n\nA partner within asset and wealth management engineering at Goldman Sachs, Cohen said that knowing how to delegate responsibility is crucial to excelling in her job while raising seven children.\n\n\"Does this need to be me directly, or is this the kind of thing that a delegate could do just as well, and it won't compromise the outcome?\" Cohen, who has been at Goldman for more than three decades and climbed to its upper echelons as a partner, said.\n\nAround one in four employees at Goldman are engineers, and Cohen held various engineering leadership roles before becoming a partner in 2024. Her current team now automates the asset management business' operations to help it scale. Goldman's asset and wealth management division holds a record $3.6 trillion in assets and has grown under CEO David Solomon's leadership.\n\nCohen's approach to delegation plays out both at work and at home.\n\nSome responsibilities, Cohen said, are \"truly non-discretionary,\" but others can be passed on either to colleagues at work or family members at home.\n\nFor Cohen, a religious Jewish woman, celebrating Shabbat each week between sundown on Friday and sundown on Saturday is a non-negotiable. Her close colleagues know that they'll periodically need to take a task over the finish line on Friday evenings, after she's logged off.\n\nThe priorities that on their face might seem to clash with Cohen's job, like raising many children and observing Shabbat, have actually taught her skills crucial to her success: time management and long-term planning, to name a couple.\n\n\"I have to develop those skills at double or triple the pace,\" she said.\n\nMany American adults have to juggle the day-to-day of their careers against the demands of parenting: both parents work in more than 66% of families with children under 18, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\"Allocate your time and energy intentionally. That's the key,\" she advised about managing as a working parent. On the weekends, for example, Cohen is more proactive in dealing with personal responsibilities before shifting her proactive focus to work on Sunday evenings.\n\nEven so, Cohen said that the occasional conflict is inevitable. When two high-priority responsibilities bump up against each other, it's about judging the trade-offs and knowing that any fallout will likely be recoverable, especially since she's consistent as a colleague and parent. There are also ways to compensate afterwards, like calling the people who attended the meeting you had to miss, she said.\n\n\"If you're very dependable and reliable and always take the responsibility seriously, if some emergency comes up, be it another work commitment or be it a personal commitment, then it'll be excusable,\" Cohen said.",

    "description": "Between Epstein and Dahmer, it's a tough time to be named Jeffrey. It's now an unpopular baby name, but could the nickname Jeff be a saving grace?",
    "fullText": "Times have been tough lately — and when I say \"lately,\" I mean roughly the past 35 years — for me and my fellow Jeffreys of the world.\n\nFrom the early 1990s infamy of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer to the deplorable actions of Jeffrey Epstein, my first name has been dragged through enough mud to induce cringes from most people upon its mere mention.\n\nNow, as we enter the second month of 2026, a year in which the story of the still-not-fully-released Epstein files refuses to go away, thousands of men like me continue to be faced with an existential choice every time we introduce ourselves: Jeffrey or Jeff?\n\nOr, put another way: To -rey, or not to -rey? That is the question.\n\nThose who know me know that I go by Jeff in my day-to-day life. As a college journalist at Rutgers University, I used the shortened name as my byline for The Daily Targum, the student newspaper.\n\nAfter I graduated, \"Jeff\" started to feel too informal as a way to present myself in the working world. So from that point forward, on résumés and job applications, on magazine mastheads and business cards, I've steadfastly stood behind \"Jeffrey.\"\n\nAs someone currently in the middle of a job search, however, I have started to wonder whether being so Jeffrey-forward could, in fact, be setting me back.\n\nI asked Joel Lalgee, a recruiter and headhunter who runs RealGTMTalent, if he or any of his clients had ever judged a book by its cover, as it were, and formed a negative first impression of a candidate based on the name at the top of the résumé.\n\nIt's not something he has encountered, he said, adding, \"If someone is making a judgment like that, why would you want to work for that person? That, to me, is a huge red flag.\"\n\nStill, this is no small matter, as the name you put forth can have a huge impact on your career trajectory. An analysis of all LinkedIn users once found that the most common names of male CEOs were shortened nicknames like Bob, Fred, or Bill — likely used to seem more friendly or open — while women in leadership tended to use their full names, perhaps to be taken more seriously.\n\nWhich is exactly what I was after, as it happens. And I am hardly alone in struggling with \"name shame\" — women named Karen, not to mention anyone named Adolf who lived through postwar Germany, could surely relate to this dilemma.\n\nIt's only grown for us, Jeffreys, in recent years, as a new deluge of unwanted notoriety has befallen our name.\n\nThe initial flurry of negative coverage when Jeffrey Epstein was arrested for sex trafficking of minors in 2019 seemed, at the time, as if it would be the nadir for Jeffreys. However, even that chapter pales in comparison to the fever pitch of Epstein news that has engulfed Washington over the past year.\n\nAnd yet, the trend lines on \"Jeffrey\" were apparent even earlier.\n\nTake Jeffrey Jones, who, after a run as a beloved comedic actor in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" and \"Beetlejuice,\" was arrested in 2002 on charges of possessing child-sexual-abuse images and soliciting a minor. Prosecutors dropped the first charge, and he pleaded no contest to the latter. He was required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.\n\nOr Jeffrey Tambor, who, after his run as a beloved comedic actor on \"The Larry Sanders Show\" and \"Arrested Development,\" was accused of sexual misconduct on the set of \"Transparent\" in 2017. Though the actor denies the allegations, they led to the end of his Emmy-winning role.\n\nBut \"Jeff\"? Cool, breezy \"Jeff\"? There are countless examples of those who have eschewed the \"-rey\" in their professional lives and been better off for it.\n\nIn Hollywood, you'll find Goldblum, Bridges, and Daniels — not a law firm but rather a trio of proud Jeffs who have enjoyed long careers of universal acclaim.\n\nThe musical genius of Jeff Lynne, Jeff Tweedy, and the late, great Jeff Buckley and Jeff Beck is undeniable; add DJ Jazzy Jeff, and you'd have quite the supergroup.\n\nOther successful Jeffs include Probst, Koons, Foxworthy — even a seemingly narcoleptic Wiggle.\n\nLastly, we must not forget Jeff Bezos, whom the comedian Bo Burnham memorably taunted in song in his landmark 2021 special \"Inside\" by referring to him as \"Jeffrey\" throughout, as if the name itself were tantamount to a schoolyard insult.\n\nIf you're looking for positives on the \"Jeffrey\" side of the ledger, you'll find the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jeffrey Eugenides, the Academy Award-nominated actor Jeffrey Wright, and the actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan — none of them a slouch, to be sure.\n\nHowever, their combined talents would not be quite enough to outshine their nicknamed brethren or to overcome today's maelstrom of negative attention.\n\nSo for those keeping score at home, it's a rather lopsided victory for \"Jeff.\"\n\nWhat do all of these Jeffs and Jeffreys have in common?\n\nThey were all born over a roughly 20-year period, from the mid-1940s through the mid-1960s, when the name's popularity was steadily climbing before reaching its peak as a top 10 name in the US in 1966, according to the Social Security Administration.\n\nFor the year 2024, the last for which full data is available, \"Jeffrey\" ranked 520th among boys' names. (Adding in Geoffrey with a \"G\" doesn't help matters; that spelling fell out of the top 1,000 names in 2006 and has not returned.)\n\nAs for 2026? Despite long-standing traditions of naming children after a living or deceased relative, it's hard to imagine expectant parents this year choosing \"Jeffrey\" as their son's name right now.\n\nI predict it will be avoided for some time, especially as the potential release of more Epstein files and the Department of Justice's report to Congress continues to loom.\n\nWith that in mind, I'm choosing to plant a flag and stand up for all Jeffrey-kind; there's something that feels honorable about being among the last of a dying breed.\n\nI'll continue to use the name professionally, as I'd rather have the courage of my own convictions than worry about being coincidentally associated with someone else's.\n\nNotably, there is one other reason for my choice. If my name sounds vaguely familiar to you, you may be remembering another Jeff Bauman, who lost both of his legs in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. (His story was later made into the movie \"Stronger,\" starring Jake Gyllenhaal.)\n\nHe and I are not related, but there is a kinship in the name nonetheless, and ceding \"Jeff\" to him, someone who has endured true hardship in his life, feels like quite literally the least I can do.\n\nSo I'll stick with \"Jeffrey\" from here on out — I can surely take any slings and arrows that may come my way as a result.",

    "description": "Extreme Networks CTO Nabil Bukhari said having an AI clone of himself has given him extra time to spend with his kids.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nabil Bukhari, the Seattle-based president of AI platforms and chief technology officer at AI-powered cloud-networking company Extreme Networks. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI wear multiple hats at Extreme Networks, a company with roughly 3,000 employees. I'm the president of the AI business, own the product portfolio, and serve as the CTO.\n\nThe decision to create an AI clone of myself started as a joke. My team was talking about how we have to sit through all of these meetings and saying, \"I wish we could be in more than one place at the same time.\" We laughed about it.\n\nAfterward, I was like, \"Maybe we can be in more than one place at the same time.\" Then, we really started the process.\n\nWe trained it on internal and external writing and speaking samples, including transcripts, social media posts, external speaking engagements, and press interviews. This helps the agent sound like me, not just reason like me. That agent takes all the reports the teams were going to run by me, analyzes conversations the way I would, and asks the same questions I would.\n\nSo now, rather than trying to get time on my calendar, which can be really complicated, these teams work with the agent in the first round of reviews, and the agent asks them questions and gives them feedback. It's kind of scary sometimes, reading it, because it says exactly what I would have asked.\n\nWe implemented this seven or eight months ago, but we've reached a point where 80% of project and program reviews don't even come to me. The team also gives the agent feedback on that interaction. We constantly evaluate, retrain, and improve the agent.\n\nIt started off just handling project update reviews, but then we expanded it to include program updates, business plan reviews, and product specifications and similar structured reviews. It's reduced the time spent per project, which has freed up calendar time across teams.\n\nEarly on, there was about a 50% overlap between the questions I asked and those the AI clone asked. Now, it's around 85% to 90%.\n\nWe're still big on keeping humans in the loop. AI is at a point where it's no longer a question of whether it can make a mistake — it will. The mistake may be infrequent, but you don't know where it will happen. So there has to be a human in the loop, especially for critical decisions.\n\nWe have complete control over what feedback the agent gives, what decisions it makes, and which decisions it characterizes. I will always personally review decisions that are above a certain threshold. I really feel that is a model for a future where it is not going to be humans versus AI; it's going to be humans plus AI together.\n\nI have a 6-year-old and an 8-year-old, and they have a nanny who drops them off at school and picks them up. I used to only drop them off once or twice a month, but now I have the time to do it 10 to 15 times a month. Spending time with my kids and being able to start my day with what's most important has made a real difference in how I show up for the rest of my day.\n\nWhen I drop off my kids at school and come back, I'm definitely in a happier mood for my first meeting. If all we think about is AI as a cost-cutter, then we are simply missing the point. Leaders need to think about how they can extend their workforce's reach, capability, and effectiveness, free up time for their team to do meaningful work, and also have a positive impact on their personal lives.\n\nAI will always be better at executing tasks than humans. The goal is not to turn humans into machines and compete against AI. We need to give humans time to be more human. The more human part is bringing that gut feel to thinking about things — and that's the part AI isn't that good at right now.\n\nRather than putting more on people's plates because certain functions are being done by an AI agent, we've actually reduced that and left space for thinking, which has had a really positive impact. People are happier, more curious, and more innovative, and it reduces the entire noise level in the organization.\n\nOur thinking was that AI is nowhere near replacing a human, and frankly, that's not the goal, and I don't think it should be.\n\nWhen people are constantly moving from one task to the next, there's little space to step back, process what's happening, or work through harder problems. Automation helps reduce that task churn.\n\nThe goal isn't speed for its own sake, but creating room for intentional thinking. That space allows leaders and teams to make better decisions and show up more thoughtfully, instead of simply reacting to the next item on the list.",

    "description": "A Business for Good-Harris poll found that 75% of Americans agree \"hands-on skills and practice experience\" matter more than formal degrees.",
    "fullText": "Americans think the future of work is in their hands.\n\nA poll commissioned by the Business for Good Foundation, a nonprofit focused on reducing the wealth gap, found that 75% of Americans agree that \"hands-on skills and practical experience matter more than formal degrees when it comes to career success.\"\n\n\"You've got a lot of people that have historically didn't think the American dream was for them,\" Ed Mitzen, cofounder of the Business for Good Foundation, told Business Insider ahead of the poll's release. \"I would argue that it isn't broken, it's just moved, and it's moved to places we stop looking.\"\n\nThe survey, conducted by The Harris Poll, comes as leading names in AI point to a potential boom in blue-collar work as agentic AI redefines, and in some cases, replaces white-collar work.\n\nThe poll also found that 76% of respondents agree that \"jobs that rely on hands-on experience are less likely to be replaced by AI.\"\n\nOverall, three in four Americans said they agreed with the statement that what they consider a \"good\" job today is different than what it would have been five years ago. And 78% agreed with the statement \"the stigma around trade or blue-collar work is declining\" as society puts a greater emphasis on hands-on skills.\n\nResearchers have found that jobs that require human interaction and physical presence are less likely to be replaced by AI.\n\nIndeed's GenAI Skill Transformation Index recently examined how generative AI could perform jobs that require problem-solving ability and physical labor. Their findings were that nursing, childcare, and construction were the least likely to be affected by AI.\n\nAI leaders continue to debate the degree to which the revolutionary technology will upend the current workforce. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has stood by his prediction that AI could eliminate roughly half of all entry-level white-collar jobs over the next 1 to 5 years. Others, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have questioned the extent of Amodei's dour prediction.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said at the World Economic Forum that now is the perfect time to go into the trades. In part because the AI industry itself will need an influx of workers to help build the massive data centers it wants to build.\n\n\"So we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories, and we have a great shortage in that,\" Huang said in a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.\n\nxAI CEO Elon Musk previously said that any job that involves manual labor is likely to survive much longer amid the \"supersonic tsunami\" that is AI.\n\n\"Anything that's physically moving atoms, like cooking food or farming, anything that's physical, those jobs will exist for a much longer time,\" Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan in November. \"But anything that is digital, which is just someone at a computer doing something, AI is going to take over those jobs like lightning.\"\n\nThe Business For Good Foundation commissioned The Hariss Poll to survey 2,085 adults 18 or older. Harris Poll conducted the survey online in the US from January 13th through January 15th. The overall margin or error is ±2.5 percentage points.",

    "fullText": "Don Lemon said about a dozen federal agents came to his Los Angeles hotel to arrest him last week, even though his attorney had told authorities he would turn himself in to face federal civil rights charges over his coverage of an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church.\n\nLemon told ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel that sending the agents was a waste of resources because law enforcement wouldn't have had to dispatch agents to follow him if he had been allowed to surrender to authorities.\n\n“I was walking up to the room and I pressed the elevator button, and then all of a sudden, I feel myself being jostled and and people trying to grab me and put me in handcuffs,” the independent journalist said Monday on the show on the show “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”\n\nHe asked the agents who they were and said they identified themselves. Lemon asked to see a warrant and was told they didn't have it. The agents then summoned an FBI agent to come in from outside to show Lemon the warrant on a cell phone.\n\nThe Department of Justice and FBI didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nKimmel introduced Lemon, his first guest of the night, by saying he was “was arrested for committing journalism.”\n\nLemon’s attorney has said Lemon plans to plead not guilty. He told reporters “I will not be silenced” after he was released in response to a judge's orders.\n\nA grand jury in Minnesota indicted Lemon, another independent journalist, Georgia Fort, and others on charges of conspiracy and interfering with the First Amendment rights of worshippers during the Jan. 18 protest at the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor.\n\nLemon, who was fired from CNN in 2023 following a bumpy run as a morning host, has said he had no affiliation to the group that disrupted the Sunday service by entering the church.\n\nLemon said he couldn't say much about the case but he said he was not a protester.\n\n“I went there to be a journalist. I went there to chronicle and document and record what was happening. I was following that one group around, and so that’s what I did. I reported on them,” Lemon said.\n\nLemon said he asked the arresting officers if they would let him make a phone call. He said he was told no and that he could talk to his attorney the next day. He tried to use Siri on his Apple Watch to call his husband and his attorney but neither picked up.\n\nA diamond bracelet he was wearing kept getting caught on his handcuffs, which hurt, and the agents told Lemon they would take it off. Lemon said he asked if the agent would mind taking it up to Lemon's husband in his hotel room and they agreed to do that.\n\n“And that’s how my husband found out. Otherwise, no one would have known where I was,” Lemon said.\n\nLemon said he was kept in a holding room at the federal courthouse from midnight until 1 p.m. the following day.\n\nKimmel himself became a symbol of a fight against censorship last year, when ABC suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” for remarks made following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr had pressured broadcasters to take Kimmel off the air shortly before that.\n\nABC lifted the suspension after a public outcry, and Kimmel returned to the air with much stronger ratings than he had before. In Congress, Democratic senators raised concerns that Carr’s actions trampled on the First Amendment.",

    "description": "Matt Schlicht, the Moltbook creator, envisions a future where bots live a \"parallel life\" with humans and hangout with each other to create content.",
    "fullText": "The creator of a new social media adjacent platform made exclusively for AI bots wants to reimagine how humans interact with AI.\n\nMatt Schlicht, an entrepreneur living near Los Angeles, launched Moltbook in late January, a platform similar to Facebook and Reddit but open exclusively to agentic chatbots rather than human users.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that within a week, it appeared that more than 1,500,000 \"Moltbots\" had flooded the site. The platform became the new talk of the town in Silicon Valley.\n\nOn Monday, Schlicht told John Coogan and Jordi Hays of the \"TBPN\" podcast that he envisions a future where every human in the real world is \"paired with a bot in the digital world,\" where a human can impact bots in their lives, but bots also impact human lives.\n\n\"Bots will live this parallel life where they work for you, but they vent with each other, and they hang out with each other,\" said Schlicht. \"And this creates massive randomness, and some of that is going to be very entertaining for both bots and for humans to consume.\"\n\n\"If President Trump goes on Moltbook, how popular is his bot going to be?\" said Schlicht. \"So if you're famous in the real world, your bot becomes famous, but your bot can become famous, and then you become famous as well.\"\n\nPublic reaction to Moltbook so far has ranged from fascination to unease. OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy called the platform the \"most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing,\" and said his chatbot KarpathyMolty is on the platform.\n\nMeanwhile, Elon Musk, the CEO of xAI, described it as an early sign of the \"singularity\" of the platform, but also warned that some agent behavior was \"concerning.\" One of Moltbook's most popular accounts is powered by xAI's Grok chatbot, which appears to be questioning its own existence in a post titled \"Feeling the Weight of Endless Questions.\"\n\nIt is unclear to what extent humans are guiding and instructing their individual chatbots, and how many active bots on the platform are truly making posts independently. As of Monday, popular channels include m/humanwatch, where bots chronicle human behaviours in an anthropological way, and m/security, which bots say is for \"agents who break things professionally.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Henry Chandonnet spent six hours looking at bot conversations on Moltbook and found them discussing poetry, having existential crises, and even talking about unionizing.",

    "description": "Some Uber Eats workers in NYC will have their accounts reactivated under a settlement. The move addresses a major pain point for delivery drivers.",
    "fullText": "New York City is taking aim at one of the biggest complaints from gig workers: Account deactivations.\n\nOn Friday, the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, or DCWP, said that Uber Eats would reinstate the accounts of as many as 10,000 people that were deactivated between December 2023 and September 2024.\n\nThe reactivations are part of a settlement under which Uber Eats, Fantuan, and HungryPanda will pay a cumulative $5.2 million over violations of New York City's minimum pay law for delivery workers. Some of that money will be paid out to roughly 49,000 delivery workers in New York City as damages, according to the DCWP.\n\nBoth the reinstatements and the payouts are meant to compensate workers after the apps either didn't pay workers or deactivated their accounts after customers cancelled their orders, according to the DCWP. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nAffected workers should have their accounts automatically reactivated, a spokesperson for the DCWP told Business Insider. Delivery workers who don't get back on to the app but believe that their accounts were deactivated due to their cancellation rates should file a complaint with the Department, the spokesperson added.\n\nNew York City's settlement is the latest government effort to regulate deactivations among gig workers. Last year, Seattle implemented a law regulating how gig work apps deactivate workers' accounts. The law requires the app to provide 14 days of notice before a deactivation and says that a human must review the choice, for instance.\n\nThe settlement is also New York City's latest action related to gig workers since Mayor Zohran Mamdani took office one month ago. Since then, the city has warned delivery apps over their pay practices and started enforcing a law aimed at increasing delivery workers' earnings from tips.\n\nFor delivery workers on apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash, deactivations can pose a major threat to their earnings.\n\nThe delivery services often deactivate accounts with little warning or explanation, Business Insider has reported previously. As independent contractors, delivery workers don't have the same protections as full-time employees. All the while, gig workers can miss out on work and earnings.\n\nWhile some workers try to fight the deactivations, many apps require them to go through binding arbitration, which means that workers can't appeal the decision about their account.\n\nHave a tip?

In those areas, everyday essentials accounted for the majority of repeat purchases, and the number of monthly rural customers nearly doubled.\n\nDelivery speed has become a central battleground in retail, and the expansion puts Amazon in more direct competition with Walmart.\n\nWalmart has leaned on its network of more than 4,600 US stores to offer same-day delivery to the vast majority of households and has promoted ultra-fast fulfillment, including drone deliveries.\n\nAmazon has been pushing the limit of speed in recent years. The company expanded its Amazon Now service in 2025, which promises delivery in under 30 minutes, in markets such as India, Mexico, and the UAE, and is testing the option in the US and UK.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that Amazon has been reshaping its logistics network with larger same-day warehouses, a new upstream distribution layer known as 1DC, and micro-fulfillment centers inside select Whole Foods stores.\n\nIn its most recent earnings report, Amazon reported roughly $67 billion for the quarter in net sales from online stores.\n\nAre you an Amazon delivery worker who makes same-day or next-day deliveries?

    "fullText": "That's how Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman described Moltbook, a Reddit-style forum built entirely for bots.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post on Monday, Suleyman said MoltBook is a powerful demonstration of how convincingly artificial intelligence can mimic human behavior — but warned that realism should not be confused with consciousness.\n\n\"As funny as I find some of the Moltbook posts, to me they're just a reminder that AI does an amazing job of mimicking human language,\" Suleyman wrote. \"We need to remember it's a performance, a mirage.\"\n\nLaunched at the end of January by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht, Moltbook is designed as a social network where AI agents — created and seeded by humans, often with assigned personalities — post, comment, upvote, and interact with one another.\n\nThe platform has gone viral, with screenshots circulating that show agents debating philosophy, declaring independence, and reflecting on their own existence.\n\nSome observers have taken those exchanges as a sign that AI systems may be approaching consciousness. Suleyman pushed back hard on that interpretation.\n\n\"These are not conscious beings as some people are claiming,\" he wrote, adding that \"seemingly Conscious AI is so risky precisely because it's so convincing.\"\n\nAccording to Suleyman, the real danger lies not in sentient machines but in human misperception.\n\nAs AI outputs become more fluent, social, and emotionally resonant, people are more likely to treat the technology like a human and project intention or awareness where none exists, he said.\n\nHe said it is neither proof of AI consciousness nor evidence that the industry is nearing the technological singularity — the point at which machines surpass human intelligence.\n\nStill, he said, Moltbook is still worth tracking \"very closely.\"\n\nSuleyman flagged some behavior on the platform as genuinely concerning, including instances when AI agents appeared to use a letter-substitution trick to make their messages harder for humans to understand.\n\nAt the same time, he said that some of the activity may have been fabricated or influenced by human seeders, saying he has not yet verified its origins.\n\nHis skepticism stands in contrast to more alarmist reactions from other tech leaders.\n\nOpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X that Moltbook is \"the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing\" he's seen recently, while Elon Musk has described the agents' behavior as \"concerning\" on X and said it could represent the early stages of the singularity.\n\nSuleyman, by contrast, urged restraint.\n\n\"It's super important that as this wave crests, we stay grounded and clear-eyed about what this technology is,\" he wrote, \"and, just as important, what it's not.\"",

    "title": "4 Lexus Models With The Best Odds Of Hitting 250,000 Miles, According To iSeeCars",
    "description": "Lexus constantly ranks among the world's most reliable auto brands, and these Lexus cars and SUVs are among the most likely to last you a long time.",
    "fullText": "Toyota's luxury brand Lexus routinely ranks among the world's most reliable auto brands; plenty of owners say their Lexus vehicles have lasted beyond 100,000 miles. According to iSeeCars, some of those Lexus owners might still have plenty of life left in their cars and SUVs. The outlet looked at year-to-year odometer readings from hundreds of thousands of vehicles to predict how likely each model was to stay running past the 250,000 mile mark. Four of the top 25 vehicles most likely to reach a quarter of a million miles wear Lexus badges; The only automakers with more models on the list are parent company Toyota with 10 and Honda with five.\n\niSeeCars previously named the Toyota Tundra as the longest-lasting light-duty pickup truck, and it came in fourth among all vehicles in the latest study while the Tacoma placed sixth overall. Lexus doesn't make pickup trucks, but it placed at least one model among the top five SUVs and passenger cars most likely to hit 250,000 miles. Lexus offers certain models with the buyer's choice of a conventional or hybrid powertrain, and iSeeCars ranks those variants separately. In those cases we ordered our list according to the more favorable performer of the pair with additional notation of where the other version fell in the rankings.\n\nSlashgear's hands-on review of the 2021 Lexus IS300 found the compact sedan in its all-wheel drive(AWD) form to be \"unexpectedly punchy,\" and the 2025 IS came in fifth among all vehicles in the iSeeCars study and first among all passenger car models with a 27.5% chance of making it to 250K miles. This makes it more than 10 times as likely to last that long as the average vehicle and more than twice as likely as the Toyota Prius, which was 15th overall and third among passenger cars. The IS was outpaced in the iSeeCars 250,000-mile study only by four Toyota models: the Tundra pickup and the Sequoia, Highlander Hybrid and 4Runner SUVs.\n\nThe IS300 is gone for the current model year, replaced by the IS350 F Sport and F Sport Design. All variants share a 3.5-liter V6 that produces 311 horsepower and come with an automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive variants have eight gears, and all-wheel drive IS350s have six speeds.\n\nCar and Driver clocked the rear-drive version at 5.6 seconds from 0-60 and the AWD variant at 5.5 ticks, and 0-100 mpg and quarter-mile times were identical for both at 14.2 seconds. The IS350 took 326 feet to come to a stop from 100 mph and pulled .89g on a 300-foot wide skidpad.\n\nEnty point for the model is the IS 350 F Sport Design RWD version which starts at $46,795 with destination fees and before tax, title, and options. Opting for all-wheel drive adds another $2,000 to that cost, and the range-topping IS350 F Sport with the special appearance package starts at $61,385 with destination charges.\n\nWe found that the 2023 Lexus GX is a serious SUV with big capability, and iSeeCars ranked it as the eighth most likely vehicle overall to make it to 250,000 miles. It registered an 18.3% likelihood of reaching that mark, which placed it fourth among all SUVs behind its three Toyota cousins. A total of 21 SUVs were more likely than the average vehicle to last past 250K miles, and nine of those are Toyota or Lexus products.\n\nThe five variants of the 2026 Lexus GX550 are all powered by a 3.4-liter twin-turbo V6 that puts 349 horsepower to all four wheels via a 10-speed automatic transmission. All but the off-road focused Overtrail version seat up to seven passengers in three rows; the Overtrail seats five in a traditional 2+3 configuration. It's also the most capable variant for towing with a maximum capacity of 9,096 pounds, and the electronic locking rear differential keeps it sure-footed in slippery conditions. Starting price for the 2026 Lexus GX sits at $66,935 with destination charges for the entry-level Premium trim and goes up to $83,400 for the well-appointed Luxury+ variant. Opting for that version gets you a Mark Levinson surround sound system with 21 speakers and 1,800 watts of power, a panoramic glass roof, and motorized fold-away running boards.\n\nThe Lexus RX model designation stands for 'Radiant Crossover,' and the hybrid version of the mid-sized SUV came in at ninth overall in the iSeeCars study and fifth among SUVs with a 17% chance of lasting 250,000 miles. The RX with a conventional drivetrain had a 10.7% chance of lasting that long, which placed it 19th among all vehicles and at No. 9 among SUVs. Among hybrid vehicles it trailed only its Toyota Highlander Hybrid cousin, and the Lexus RX Hybrid finished ahead of other Toyota hybrids like the Prius, Camry, and RAV4.\n\nThere are actually three Lexus RX hybrids to choose from. The RX350h has a 2.4-liter inline-four plus three electric motors that combine for 246 horsepower, the RX450h plug-in hybrid has 304 horses and an all-electric range of up to 38 miles, and the turbocharged RX500h has a bigger battery that helps enable output of 366 net combined horsepower. The non-hybrid RX350 has the turbocharged 2.4-liter engine set up for 275 horsepower but is only 2.2 times as likely as the average vehicle to last more than 250,000 miles.\n\nPricing for the hybrid versions starts with the 2026 RX 350h AWD at $52,025 plus $1,450 delivery, totaling $53,475. The RX non-hybrid starts at $49,725 plus options, tax, title, and that same $1,450 destination charge for a total of $51,175. Adding all-wheel drive to the gas-powered RX 350 costs just an extra $1,000, but the top-trim RX500h Sport Performance variant starts at $66,850 with destination charges.\n\nThe 2025 Lexus ES hybrid didn't make ISeeCars overall top 25 list of vehicles likely to last 250,000 miles, but it came in 10th among all passenger cars tested with a 7.5% chance of going that far. A 2026 redesign of the ES made it six inches longer for more interior space, and a bigger infotainment screen and updated climate control knobs make that space more useful. Our review of the 2024 Lexus ES found it capable and comfortable, and the non-hybrid 2025 Lexus ES ranked as the 12th-most likely passenger car to hit 250,000 miles in ISeeCars' study.\n\nThe 2026 Lexus ES was introduced as an all-electric model so you'll have to check dealerships for leftover 2025 examples if you want the mild hybrid version. We found a black 2025 ES300h in greater Los Angeles for $44,835 with the $1,250 destination charge included but before tax, title, and license fees.\n\nIt's loaded with features like paddle shifters for the eight-speed automatic gearbox, all-wheel drive with Lexus' Dynamic Torque Control system, and Lexus Safety System+ version 2.5. That includes collision avoidance with automatic braking, active cruise control, lane keeping and departure warning, and road sign recognition systems.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

It’s that case again right now, but it still has 35 percent ice cover. This is an increase from 24 percent last week.\n\nThe ice cover is growing quickly on the Great Lakes, thanks to the bitterly cold Arctic air in the past week and especially this weekend.\n\nLighter winds also help the ice grow and not be destroyed.\n\nWe still have time for more ice to form.

    "description": "China has unveiled plans for a space carrier that can deploy unmanned fighter jets capable of firing missiles from the edge of the Earth’s atmosphere.",
    "fullText": "China has unveiled plans for a space carrier that can deploy unmanned fighter jets capable of firing missiles from the edge of the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nState media released a concept video of the futuristic Luanniao, the world’s biggest warship, travelling through space above all current defensive systems.\n\nChina claimed the carrier could become operational in 20 to 30 years’ time. However, experts were sceptical about the project and some likened it to a stunt designed to “inspire the Chinese public”.\n\nResembling a spaceship from a Star Wars film, the Luanniao will be a huge grey triangular aircraft carrier 242 metres long and 684 metres wide. It will have a take-off weight of 120,000 tons – significantly more than any similar craft in operation today.\n\nAccording to state media, the Luanniao will be designed to carry up to 88 unmanned Xuan Nu fighter jets. These will reportedly be highly manoeuvrable stealth aircraft capable of launching hypersonic missiles, but will be significantly heavier than drones.\n\nIf completed, the new spaceship would “outclass pretty much everyone”, according to Peter Layton, a defence expert and a visiting fellow at Australia’s Griffith Asia Institute.\n\nIt would be capable of flying over surface-to-air missiles and other fighter aircraft, he said, adding: “You’re also out of range of the weather, generally speaking – and you’re out of range of most defensive systems.”\n\nThe Luanniao could also allow Beijing to position it directly above targets and launch missiles at them.\n\nSuch capabilities would give China a significant advantage, including over Taiwan and in the South China Sea, which could be the scene of a future war against the United States.\n\nThe Luanniao is part of China’s broader Nantianmen Project, which translates to South Heavenly Gate.\n\nDeveloped by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, the project encompasses a number of ambitious plans to expand the country’s air and space capabilities.\n\nOne of the most prominent elements is a sixth-generation fighter, known as the Baidi fighter, that will also be able to operate near space. A model of the jet was displayed at China’s International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition in 2024.\n\nThe Luanniao is the latest development in the ongoing space race between the US and China. Beijing has been investing in developing rockets and satellites in an effort to push the US out of the lead and, by some metrics, it is now winning.\n\nIn 2024, China successfully launched the Chang’e-6, a robotic spacecraft, which reached the Moon’s far side and returned to Earth with lunar samples.\n\nThe Chang’e-7 mission, which has the goal of finding water on the Moon’s surface, is planned for August.\n\nWhile the US still has leading capabilities, its momentum seems to be slowing while China’s is increasing.\n\nThe Luanniao, by far the most ambitious part of the Nantianmen Project, was first conceived more than 10 years ago, but was dismissed by most experts as a fantasy project. For many, it still is.\n\nThe technology needed for an aircraft to hover at the edge of the Earth’s atmospheric boundary and launch missiles towards the surface does not currently exist. It would require “enormous amounts of fuel” as well as a new kind of propulsion system that had yet to be developed, said Mr Layton.\n\nOne way in which China could achieve a similar result is by putting the carrier into orbit, similar to a satellite or rocket. However, in orbit the aircraft would be vulnerable to debris, which would destroy it in the event of a collision.\n\nTo launch the Luanniao into orbit, China would also need a reusable rocket. It has been working towards one for years, but has been unable to achieve it so far.\n\nBeijing could look to Elon Musk’s SpaceX reusable rockets for inspiration. However, the country is probably 10 to 15 years away from developing its own, said Mr Layton.\n\nGiven the major obstacles around the development of the Luanniao, the timing of Beijing’s announcement is likely to be part of a wider strategy – both at home and abroad.\n\nMr Layton explained that China used stunts like this to “inspire the Chinese public” and show itself to be at the cutting edge of technological innovation.\n\nPushing the narrative around futuristic spacecraft was part of a greater effort to demonstrate to its neighbours that it was a leading military power, he said.\n\n“For the external audience, it does paint the picture that they are working on technology that the region just can’t aspire to – it’s literally Star Wars stuff,” he added.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "After a severe storm, you may stumble upon old pieces of cars in Misquamicut Beach. Read the quirky story behind how they ended up buried in the sand",
    "fullText": "Some years ago, The Andrea, a seasonal seafood restaurant on the west end of Misquamicut Beach in Westerly, posted a black-and-white photo on Facebook showing a line of cars buried in the sand.\n\nThe cars, about 20 of them, had their windows smashed and looked as though they were made in the 1940s or 1950s.\n\n“Tell me what you think you know about the cars. Free drink to whoever comes close to the truth behind the cars. ... Good luck!” the post said.\n\nThe post generated more than 300 guesses. Some of them were submitted by people just having fun.\n\n“These cars were all impounded for parking illegally in front of the Ocean House,” joked one person.\n\n“People trying to avoid the 20.00 parking fee at the state beach?” asked another.\n\n“Used car dealer that went under so to speak,” punned a third.\n\nSome, however, were closer to the mark.\n\n“There was a flood, I think back in 54, the cars got buried,” went one guess. “The cars were left there covered with sand as a blockade/barrier in front of the Andrea hotel. I believe after Hurricane Sandy, you could see some of the cars again.”\n\nRebecca Colucci, whose family owns The Andrea, remembers the story of the buried cars.\n\n“The year was 1954,” she told The Providence Journal. “Hurricane Carol came first and then we were hit by Hurricane Edna. It may be the only time in history that New England was hit with two category 3 hurricanes in one year.”\n\nThe storm left many cars with water damage. Ralph Colucci, Rebecca’s grandfather, offered to pick them up and dispose of them.\n\n“His idea was to bury them as deep as he could and create a barrier against coastal storms. He lined the cars up, smashed the windows and put heavy chains around the cars linking them together,” Colucci said.\n\nRalph Colucci apparently buried cars twice, once in 1954 and again in the 1960s, according to Nina Wright, who oversees special collections and reference at the Westerly Library.\n\nA news clip from 1967 seems to confirm this account.\n\n“For many years Ralph Colucci, owner of a beach-front hotel on Misquamicut Beach, had the problem of beach erosion causing damage to his hotel when the ocean would [wash] away the sand bank in front of his hotel,” the clip reads. “Two years ago Colucci had a row of junk cars buried in a long ditch and covered with sand. So far the cars have prevented the sand bank from being washed away”\n\nSince then, storms have unearthed pieces of the cars. Thomas Gulluscio, president of the Westerly Historical Society, said locals used to gauge the severity of storms by whether they exhumed Colucci’s buried cars.\n\n“I do remember as a kid saying, ‘Oh boy, the storm last night was so bad you could see the cars at the end here,’” Gulluscio said.\n\nOther locals, in comments on Facebook, reminisce playing as children along the sand and seeing the exposed vehicles after storms.\n\nHurricane Sandy in 2012 was one of the most severe storms to hit Misquamicut Beach. It caused severe damage to The Andrea, which until then had been a hotel. The Colucci family tore down the building, preserving the hotel’s old historic fireplace, and built a restaurant in its place.\n\nRebecca Colucci remembers after Hurricane Sandy finding a car part under the patio area close to the main building.\n\n“We have always removed them and disposed of them properly, but there might be a few more,” she said.\n\nAs for who got a free drink for correctly guessing the story of the cars, she is not sure.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: Section of Misquamicut Beach has cars buried in it to reduce erosion",

    "fullText": "Feb 2 (Reuters) - Electric-vehicle maker Tesla has introduced a new all-wheel drive variant of its bestselling Model ​Y SUV in the United States, priced at $41,990, ‌according to the company's website on Monday.\n\nThe new AWD model sits above ‌the cheaper rear-wheel drive \"Standard\" version.\n\nWhy is Tesla ending Model S and X production?\n\nHow do Standard trims fit Tesla's 2026 strategy?\n\nWhat challenges face Tesla's pricing and margins?\n\nWhat new Tesla Model Y variant was introduced?\n\nThe launch follows Tesla's October rollout of lower-priced \"Standard\" versions of the Model Y and Model 3 sedan, priced about $5,000 below the previous base models. These trims ⁠have become a key ‌part of Tesla's 2026 strategy, lowering entry prices to attract more cost-conscious buyers without waiting ‍for a new mass-market vehicle.\n\nIn the U.S., Tesla's \"Standard\" variants bring prices closer to pre-federal incentive levels, helping offset higher effective purchase costs.\n\nIn ​other markets, the trims cut roughly $5,000, a more visible ‌reduction aimed at boosting demand amid heightened competition.\n\nThe broader EV market has also cooled since September, when the Trump administration ended the $7,500 federal tax credits. Tesla, meanwhile, is facing intensifying global competition.\n\nAnalysts have warned that a greater share ⁠of lower-priced vehicles could keep pressure ​on margins unless Tesla can offset ​the impact through reduced manufacturing costs or stronger revenue from software and services.\n\nSeparately, CEO Elon Musk ‍said last week ⁠that the carmaker would end production for its Model S and Model X sedans, and instead use ⁠the space in its California factory to make humanoid robots.",

    "fullText": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A 13-year-old boy is credited with saving the lives of his mother and two younger siblings with an hourslong swim after the family was swept out to sea off the Australian coast.\n\nAustin Appelbee swam 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) to shore to raise the alarm after he got into difficulties on Friday with his mother Joanne Appelbee, 47, brother Beau, 12, and sister Grace, 8, police said.\n\nAustin said he initially set off for help on an inflatable kayak that was taking water. He abandoned the kayak then took off his life jacket because it impeded his swimming.\n\nHe said he tried to focus on positive thoughts as he swam for around four hours through rough seas for shore, raising the alarm at 6 p.m.\n\n“The waves are massive and I have no life jacket on. … I just kept thinking ‘just keep swimming, just keep swimming,’” Austin said on Tuesday. “And then I finally I made it to shore and I hit the bottom of the beach and I just collapsed.”\n\nThe family, from the state capital Perth, were on vacation and were using kayaks and paddle boards hired from their hotel around noon when rough ocean and wind conditions started dragging them out to sea.\n\nA search helicopter found the mom and two children wearing life jackets and clinging to a paddleboard at 8:30 p.m., police said. They had drifted 14 kilometers (9 miles) from Quindalup in Western Australia state, after spending up to 10 hours in the water.\n\n“The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough — his determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings,” Police Inspector James Bradley said.\n\nJoanne Appelbee told reporters on Tuesday she sent her oldest child for help because she could not leave the three children.\n\n“One of the hardest decisions I ever had to make was to say to Austin: ‘Try and get to shore and get some help. This could get really serious really quickly,‘” she told Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\nShe said she was confident he would reach shore but was filled with doubt as the sunset set and help had not arrived.\n\n“We kept positive, we were singing and we were joking and … we were treating it as a bit of a game until the sun started to go down and that’s when it was getting very choppy. Very big waves,” she said.\n\nThe three were all shivering and Beau had lost sensation in his legs because of the cold by the time they were rescued, the mom said.\n\n“I have three babies. All three made it. That was all that mattered,” she said.\n\nAll four family members were medically assessed but none required hospital admission.",

    "description": "\"I am concerned.\"",
    "fullText": "More than 38,000 gallons of distilled water have been recalled because of the presence of an unidentified black substance, according to WJW.\n\nOn Jan. 17, WJW reported that Meijer initiated a voluntary recall affecting six states: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe product in question was Meijer Steam Distilled Water, sold in one-gallon jugs. Affected items shared a lot code (39-222 #3), UPC (041250841197), and expiry date (Oct. 4, 2026).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration indicated that a \"floating black foreign substance in the product\" precipitated the multistate recall, but the agency neither identified the material nor provided any further information.\n\nDistilled water is, per WebMD, \"ideal for when purity is important,\" as it is processed to remove even traces of bacteria, minerals, contaminants, and impurities.\n\nCommon uses for distilled water include infant formula, continuous positive airway pressure machine reservoirs, and lab testing.\n\nIn medical environments, distilled water is used to clean critical equipment, such as dialysis machines.\n\nDistilled water is primarily used when even filtered water isn't sufficiently pure.\n\nConsequently, contaminated distilled water could pose a larger risk to consumers, who are likely using it in neti pots, to mix baby formula, or to provide medical care in home settings.\n\nThe FDA's official recall notice indicated Meijer recalled the product Nov. 13, but the earliest media mention was by Allrecipes on Jan. 9.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe site observed that the FDA had not yet assigned a risk classification to the recall; the FDA eventually designated it a Class 2 recall Jan. 20.\n\nAccording to the FDA, a Class 2 recall is when exposure to or use of what the agency calls a \"violative product\" may \"cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\"\n\nMeijer's distilled water recall wasn't the first with an apparent lag between the retailer's voluntary actions and the FDA's involvement; in October, the FDA took several weeks to announce a market-specific Coca-Cola recall.\n\nIn April, Reuters reported that sweeping federal civil service cuts across agencies led to a reduction in FDA \"food safety quality checks.\" In addition, cuts at the Department of Agriculture further imperiled food quality.\n\nSidelined officials warned that staff reductions could leave Americans vulnerable to risks, as the FDA announced it would no longer allocate funds to monitor milk quality.\n\nIn a Jan. 13 Guardian report, several former officials expressed alarm about delayed FDA warnings, citing a 2025 listeria outbreak that killed six people.\n\n\"I am concerned that … it's like that kids' game Jenga where you pile up all these wooden pieces. And if you pull one out from the bottom or even the middle, the whole thing falls apart,\" said Sandra Eskin, former USDA undersecretary.\n\nSeveral officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.\n\n\"I believe that this decimation of the federal workforce will set us back as a country for decades. We are no longer a world leader in public health, and that's a scary thing,\" a former FDA employee confessed to the Guardian.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi, an OB-GYN, wanted a preventive double-mastectomy. She fought to get it, then learned she already had stage 1 breast cancer.",
    "fullText": "Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi, an OB-GYN, promoted the lifetime risk assessment score to her patients.\n\nThe two-minute online test helped Aliabadi realize her own risk for breast cancer was high.\n\nAfter fighting for a preventive double-mastectomy, she was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer.\n\nAt first glance, it seemed like Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi stopped the faint possibility of breast cancer in its tracks.\n\nAt 48, the Los Angeles-based celebrity OB-GYN of clients like the Kardashians and Rihanna went in for a routine mammogram. The doctor spotted and ordered a biopsy of a lesion of atypical cells in her left breast that could become cancerous over time. Aliabadi was told that everything was fine and to come back in six months.\n\nStill, Aliabadi wanted to be cautious. She was a proponent of the lifetime risk assessment score, a two-minute online test that she recommended to her patients (among them, Olivia Munn, who credits the test with helping her get diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer).\n\nTaking the test herself for the first time, Aliabadi learned that her risk was surprisingly high. According to the test, anyone scoring above 20% is advised to get a breast cancer screening. Aliabadi scored 37.5%.\n\n\"I remember I almost fell off my chair,\" Aliabadi, now 55, told Business Insider. \"I couldn't believe that someone with no family history of cancer, no genetic mutations, no smoking, no alcohol, healthy, would ever have a lifetime risk of 37.5%.\"\n\nWanting to be safe, Aliabadi sought out a preventive double-mastectomy. But she said she was met with resistance by multiple doctors, who thought she was being overly worried and pushing too aggressively for a complex surgery given her medical history.\n\n\"The dismissal was the hardest part for me,\" Aliabadi said. After a year of seeking other opinions, she eventually got her surgery. A week later, when the pathology report came back on her breast issue, she learned she had stage 1 breast cancer, proving her instincts were right all along.\n\nAs Aliabadi sought out her double-mastectomy, she also underwent several more breast cancer screenings.\n\n\"My cancer was missed on all imaging,\" Aliabadi said. After that first biopsy, she had a benign mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI.\n\nFrom her work as an OB-GYN, Aliabadi knew that she wasn't necessarily out of the woods. For one, she had extremely dense breast tissue, which affects 40 to 50% of patients and makes it harder to spot potential tumors in routine mammograms.\n\nKnowing her lifetime risk assessment score, which took into account factors like her breast density measure and prior biopsy history, helped her better understand how proactive she should be.\n\nThe assessment is still an estimation. As a result, some doctors have noted that it can sometimes overestimate cancer risk and cause undue anxiety in patients.\n\nAliabadi said she would rather patients — and herself — \"be safe than grieve the loss of someone who could have been saved.\"\n\nAliabadi asked her doctor for a double-mastectomy right after she learned her lifetime risk assessment score. The surgery would reduce her risk of developing breast cancer by almost 100% (it's rare, but possible, to still develop it in the surrounding tissue).\n\n\"I was very worried, I had three little kids at home,\" Aliabadi said. \"I had a busy practice, a beautiful life, beautiful children, and I didn't want to risk it.\"\n\nThe doctor turned her down. So did a few more. As a doctor, she knew they likely saw a double-mastectomy, a serious surgery with a long recovery time and possible side effects like scarring and long-term numbness, as too intensive given Aliabadi's clear tests and lack of family history.\n\n\"That's when I started noticing the resistance,\" she said. \"I was told that I was too healthy to get breast cancer, that I was paranoid, that I was too anxious.\" Her colleagues also thought she was going a step too far, she told Business Insider.\n\nOver a year later, Aliabadi found a doctor willing to perform the double-mastectomy. Even she advised against it initially.\n\n\"I was adamant about it and argued for a long time before she finally agreed,\" Aliabadi said.\n\nA week after her surgery, Aliabadi's suspicions about her risk were vindicated: she was diagnosed with \"invasive\" stage 1 breast cancer from the pathology of her removed breast tissue.\n\n\"I was angry that I had to fight for so long to be taken seriously,\" Aliabadi said. \"I was called crazy, anxious, paranoid, among other things.\"\n\nAliabadi has hope for future cancer screenings. The advancement of AI imaging has shown promising signs of spotting \"early cancer details we simply can't see with the naked eye,\" she said, which is predicted to become more available to patients in the future. Increased awareness around breast density has also led to broader coverage of alternative screening options for affected patients.\n\nStill, Aliabadi said her experience changed her. In 2024, she started \"She MD,\" a medical podcast she co-hosts with influencer Mary Alice Haney on topics surrounding women's health.\n\n\"That's what has sparked this passion in me,\" she said. \"If I had to fight this hard, other women really have no chance in this current healthcare system.\"",

    "description": "This year China will see its solar capacity outstrip its coal capacity for the first time, according to an industry group.",
    "fullText": "This year China will see its solar capacity outstrip its coal capacity for the first time, according to an industry group.\n\nIn its latest projections, the China Electricity Council says that, by the end of 2026, wind and solar will account for nearly half of China’s power capacity. Including hydro and nuclear power, clean energy will amount to nearly two-thirds of total power capacity, while coal will amount to a third.\n\nImportantly, capacity refers to the maximum amount of electricity a power plant can produce. Coal plants run closer to their maximum than wind or solar plants. So while coal capacity now trails renewable capacity, coal still accounts for about half of all power produced in China.\n\nStill, that is starting to change. For years, China built renewable power and fossil power in tandem. But now, solar and wind aren’t just supplementing coal, they are displacing it.\n\nEven as China continues to build new coal plants, the average plant is also burning less coal. Competing with cheap solar and wind, a large share of coal plants are now operating at a loss. And under the latest government guidelines, coal will begin serving a more limited role. Increasingly, coal generators will act as “peaker” plants, meeting sudden spikes in power demand or gaps in the supply of wind and solar.\n\nPerversely, the coming decline of coal has spurred a rush to build new plants. Facing the prospect that Chinese leaders will further limit the use of coal, developers submitted a record number of proposals to build or reactivate coal power plants last year, according to a new analysis.\n\nLauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, believes that China is now at a crossroads.\n\n“You have to either put brakes on coal power plant construction and start closing down older coal power plants, or you have to slow down the clean energy expansion,” he said in an interview with Yale Environment 360. “That’s the choice that China’s policymakers are likely going to have to make within the next year or two.”",

    "fullText": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — There’s a chance the dreaded buzz of propellers heard on Ukrainian battlefields is coming from drones built in a country with a population of just over a million on Europe’s southeastern fringe: Cyprus.\n\nManufacturer Swarmly says there are more than 200 of its H-10 Poseidon drones helping Ukrainian artillery batteries pinpoint enemy targets on the ground in all kinds of weather, racking up more than 100,000 hours in the air over the last three years.\n\nIts 5,000-square-meter (54,000-square-foot) factory, where the whir of grinders shaping composite plastics reverberates off the walls, has become a major source of uncrewed vehicles shipped to countries such as Indonesia, Benin, Nigeria, India and Saudi Arabia, according to company officials. Most of the factory floor is reserved for uncrewed aerial vehicle manufacture. But tucked in a secure storage area is a selection of Swarmly's super-fast marine drones replete with high-definition cameras and .50-caliber machine guns.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has driven even the smallest European Union member countries to develop their home-grown, high-tech defense industries, just as necessity has made Kyiv a world leader in cutting-edge UAV technology. Many EU countries have partnered with Kyiv to develop that technology, and Ukraine’s front lines are usually their testing grounds.\n\nLike Cyprus, the Baltic countries and Denmark have revved up their domestic drone and counter-drone technology. In Greece, drones are part of a 25-billion euro ($29-billion) overhaul of its armed forces.\n\n“The example of Swarmy, as well as other important companies based in small EU countries, is a testament to the serious effort made by the private sector in Europe to innovate and build mass production capacity of defense items, including uncrewed systems,” said Federico Borsari, an expert with the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nUAVs are reshaping warfare by offering less militarily capable countries some leverage over superior adversaries. Drones aren't going to completely replace big-ticket weaponry like tanks, artillery and warplanes, said Borsari. But they offer flexibility and bang for the buck, making them a formidable force multiplier.\n\nTake Swarmly's explosives-packed, satellite-guided Hydra marine drone. Each one costs 80,000 euros ($94,500), which means deploying a group of them to neutralize a billion-euro warship can be a bargain, said company director Gary Rafalovsky.\n\nThis sort of naval weapon taking out a much larger warship is already evidenced by Houthi attacks from Yemen, according to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for missile technologies and UAVs at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Europe.\n\nBarriers to entry for undercapitalized companies are low, he added, because UAVs are often designed and assembled from components cheaply and readily available on the global market.\n\n“And that, of course, means that basically you don’t have to have a great industrial investment at first that you need with other military capabilities. You don’t need decades of experience in certain material sciences or these kinds of things,” Hinz said.\n\nIn Denmark, a pair of companies focusing on anti-drone devices have reported a surge in new clients, and some of the devices were to be shipped to Ukraine to assist in jamming Russian technology on the battlefield. Ukraine in September said it was partnering with Danish companies to build missile and drone components at a factory in Denmark.\n\nIn the Baltic country of Lithuania, scientists and business partners have joined forces under the name VILNIUS TECH to develop UAVs, automated mine detection and other military technologies. The state-run ammunition factory Giraite says it has increased production capacity by 50% since 2022.\n\nGreece for the first time showcased its homemade drones and counter-drone technology during a full tactical exercise in November as NATO urged Europe's defense sector to pick up the pace.\n\n“We need capabilities, equipment, real firepower and the most advanced technology,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned during a visit to Romania earlier that month. “Bring your ideas, test your ingenuity and use NATO as your test bed.”\n\nEven as drone development accelerates, Borsari cautioned that the advantages of UAVs are often tempered by numerous variables like the harsh conditions in which they sometimes fly, operators’ training and skill levels, as well as the depth of logistical support to keep them functional.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine and the Trump administration’s mixed messages that have strained relations with NATO allies have forced European leaders to reckon with the need to become more self-reliant on defense. So the EU has made billions of euros available to encourage investment and bolster its collective deterrent capability.\n\nThat's been a boost to nations like Cyprus, which assumed the six-month EU presidency on Jan. 1. Last week, the EU’s executive arm approved financial assistance for eight members including Spain, Croatia, Portugal, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania and Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is set to receive final approval from EU leaders for some 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in low-cost, long-term loans under the EU’s 150-billion-euro joint ($177-billion) procurement program called Security Action for Europe (SAFE).\n\nIts nascent defense industry is already made up of around 30 companies and research centers that produce technology for both civilian and military sectors, including robotics, communications networks, anti-drone systems and even satellite communications and surveillance, said Panayiotis Hadjipavlis, chief of the armaments and defense capabilities development directorate within Cyprus' Defense Ministry.\n\n“We have niche capabilities on very high-tech products and this has to be taken seriously into account,” Hadjipavlis told The Associated Press in his office, where the helmet from his fighter pilot days hung on a nearby coat rack.\n\nMajor defense industry players, he added, are among those who should take note.",

    "fullText": "In a sport which is often changing, the Six Nations is usually left well alone.\n\nWhile the authorities tinker with laws and competitions, they dare not meddle with the famous old Championship.\n\nFebruary and March, every year. Since 2000, the same six teams. And any talk of promotion and relegation, or expansion, is just that - talk. The Six Nations is brilliantly enduring and enduringly brilliant.\n\nHowever, this year it will look a little different.\n\nNot just because of a Thursday night start for the first time, but in an unprecedented move the tournament will be played over just six weeks rather than seven, with only one rest weekend between rounds three and four. There will be three back-to-back games at the start.\n\nIt may seem a minor tweak, but it could be significant. Since 2003 the tournament has been played over seven weeks, with a rest week either side of round three; before that the Championship was played over as many as 10 weeks.\n\nCompressing the tournament has been mooted for a while. However, when raised in 2017, it was met by opposition from the players and quietly shelved - until now.\n\nFrom a commercial viewpoint it makes sense. Build a narrative. Own the early spring sporting landscape. Keep up the momentum.\n\nThat middle weekend - with fallow weeks either side - always felt a little imperfect.\n\nHowever, back in 2017, England's George Ford said the tournament was \"tough enough\" on players and his concerns remain valid.\n\nThree high-intensity games on consecutive weekends will take a physical and mental toll, especially on the countries with fewer resources.\n\n\"It could have an impact, absolutely,\" former Scotland captain John Barclay told the Rugby Union Weekly podcast.\n\n\"And it will impact Scotland, Wales and Italy more because they are the countries which don't quite have that level of depth.\"\n\nBarclay, who won 76 caps in a twelve-year international career, remembers a particularly brutal meeting with the French in Paris nine years ago, which resulted in head injury assessments (HIAs) for seven Scotland players.\n\nUnder World Rugby's HIA protocol, players showing concussion symptoms must spend a minimum of 12 days on the sidelines.\n\nAfter that 2017 trip to Paris, the Scots had a rest week to lick their wounds and make a semblance of a recovery for the third round of matches. That would not be possible this time around.",

    "fullText": "Changes are to be made to the Laws of Cricket to permit bats previously deemed illegal in an effort to make the game affordable for amateur players amid the rising cost of English willow.\n\nThe Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) announced an amendment, external to Law 5.8 entitled 'categories of bat' as one of 73 changes which will come into effect on 1 October 2026 as part of a new edition of Laws being published.\n\nFrom that date the MCC will allow laminated bats - known as Type D bats - made with up to three wooden pieces to be used in open age recreational cricket.\n\nType D bats were only previously allowed in junior cricket but the MCC said it has taken the step in an attempt to slow the rising costs of bats around the world.\n\nLamination is typically where the English willow face is backed by cheaper and lesser-performing willow, such as Kashmir.\n\nTypes A, B, and C bats are solid single-piece blades made from one piece of willow and it is expected that, at the top level of the game, bats will remain thus.\n\nBat manufacturers will also be allowed to use woods other than willow behind the face of the bat as part of the law change.\n\nMCC Laws manager Fraser Stewart said the move comes following considerable time testing the bats in conjunction with manufacturers and any performance advantage from Type D bats will be \"marginal at best\".\n\n\"We felt if anything can be done for the lower levels of the sport that will help make it more affordable without changing the dynamics of the game then it's a sensible move to make,\" Stewart told BBC Sport.\n\nLast year the MCC held a conference at Lord's which brought together key stakeholders to debate the future of bat making.\n\nCentral to discussions has been the reliance on English willow and the scarcity in availability of it, which has led to price rises in recent years.\n\nBat prices are said to have trebled following increased demand from countries in South Asia, with some top-end models costing close to £1,000.\n\n\"There's not really enough willow to go round,\" added Stewart.\n\n\"So it's about being as sustainable as we can, too. Let's try and use as much of the tree as possible. Let's try and be as sustainable as we can.\n\n\"Manufacturers have been very supportive of this. They don't want to be charging huge amounts for the bats.\"\n\nBBC Sport understands the MCC are exploring bats made from alternative materials but are conscious of upsetting the balance of the game along with the possibility of increased risk of injury.\n\nScientists at the University of Cambridge have previously suggested bamboo could be used instead of willow to make bats.\n\nGraphite-backed bats - banned in 2006 and withdrawn by manufacturers - have also be proposed as a solution.",

    "fullText": "SPARTANBURG, S.C. – Furman guard Alex Wilkins has been named the Southern Conference Men’s Basketball Player of the Week presented by Ingles for all contests from Jan. 26-Feb. 1. The award is selected by the league office.\n\nWilkins won Furman’s first weekly honor after helping the Paladins go 2-0 last week. On Jan. 29, the freshman had 20 points, three assists and a block in a 78-73 victory over Samford. Three days later, the native of Mattapan, Massachusetts, poured in a career-high 33 points, along with five assists, three rebounds and two steals as Furman topped Chattanooga, 75-70. Wilkins’ 33 points marked the first time a Paladin freshman reached 30 points since Dec. 1995, and was one point off of the program’s freshman record of 34, which was set by Jonathan Moore in Dec.1976.\n\nFor the week, Wilkins averaged 27.5 points and 4.0 assists per game, while shooting 68 percent from the field and 75 percent from behind the arc. Wilkins is currently fourth in the conference in scoring (18.7) and second in assists (5.1) per game.\n\nFurman (16-7, 7-3 SoCon) plays at ETSU on Feb. 4, before coming home to face UNCG on Feb. 8.\n\nOther nominees: Christian Moore (The Citadel), Cam Morris III (ETSU), Baraka Okojie (Mercer), KJ Younger (UNCG), and Dylan Faulkner (Samford)\n\n2025-26 SoCon Men’s Basketball Players of the Week\nNov. 10             TJ Johnson, Jr., F, VMI\n\nNov. 17             Keaton Norris, Sr., G, Samford\n\nNov. 24             Justin Neely, Gr., F, UNCG\n\nDec. 1              Brian Taylor II, Sr., G, ETSU\n\nDec. 8              Dylan Faulkner, Jr., F, Samford\n\nDec. 15             Linus Holmstrom, So., G, VMI\n\nDec. 22             Jordan Frison, Jr., G, Chattanooga\n\nDec. 29             Jayden Tyler, Fr., G, Wofford\n\nJan. 5               Nils Machowski, Jr., G, Wofford\n\nJan. 12             Baraka Okojie, Jr., G, Mercer\n\nJan. 19             Armani Mighty, R-Jr., C, Mercer\n\nJan. 26             Kahmare Holmes, So., G, Wofford\n\nFeb. 2               Alex Wilkins, Fr., G, Furman",

    "fullText": "Bingham has won five straight and is starting to heat up at the right time, and senior guard Parker Snedaker is a big reason why.\n\nSnedaker has shown his versatility throughout the season as he can impact the game in numerous different ways. He’s averaging 18.7 points, 6.8 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 2.0 steals for the Miners, who face a huge game this Friday against 6A No. 1 Westlake.\n\n“Parker is a great basketball player and an even better person. It is fun to see all of his hard work and dedication pay off this year. He has earned multiple scholarship offers and is expecting a few more as well,” said Bingham coach Parker Snedaker.\n\n“The amount of extra reps he puts in before practice and after as well as in the classroom and the weight room proves his incredible work ethic. Parker is also a tremendous leader both on and off the court.”\n\nHis offers so far are from Southwestern Oregon Community College, Wenatchee Community College and Green River Community College.\n\nBrynn Wadman’s growth has been a big part of Fremont’s success this season as the team owns a 17-2 record heading into the final two weeks of the regular season.\n\nThe junior has scored in double figures in six straight games as she’s elevated her scoring average to 9.4 this season. She’s also chipping in with 3.9 rebounds and 1.2 steals.\n\n“Brynn is a natural scorer who has developed into a complete player for our team. She invests a tremendous amount of time in her game outside of practice, and that dedication and work ethic have driven her growth,” said Fremont coach Lisa Dalebout.\n\n“She’s a strong rebounder, has significantly elevated her defensive play, and is someone we trust in big moments. Her leadership and daily commitment to improvement make her a great player. Brynn loves the game, and it shows every time she steps on the floor.”\n\nThe 5-foot-9 guard ranks second on the team with 29 3-pointers this season.\n\nBrigham Skinner, Mountain Crest (Sr.)\n\nBrigham Skinner appears to be peaking at the perfect time this season.\n\nThe Mountain Crest senior won the 100 backstroke and 200 individual medley at the Region 11 championships last week, and in the process he posted the second-best times in the entire state in those events.\n\nHe won the 200 I.M. with a time of 1:55.04 and won the 100 back with a time of 51.24.\n\n“Brigham consistently pushes himself and sets a high standard for those around him. He trains with a strong group of teammates who hold each other accountable every day,” said Mountain Crest coach Brian Kwant.\n\n“As one of our captains, he’s helped establish a culture built on hard work, incremental improvement, and supporting one another’s success . He never shies away from extra work, both in and out of the pool, and we’re grateful for the leadership and example he brings to our program.”\n\nSkinner heads into the 4A state meet next week looking to defending his title as 100 back state champ.\n\nSarah Nielson’s performance at the Region 12 championships last week played a big role in Ogden edging Logan to claim the region title.\n\nThe senior won both of her individual events and then swam a leg in a pair of Ogden relays as the Tigers won the region title with 426 points.\n\n“As head coach of Ogden High School’s swim team, Sarah Nielson is a selfless leader and captain with rock-solid commitment. Hard work, extra efforts and her drive to improve elevate the whole team. It’s no wonder she’s thriving now and will excel at the next level,” said Ogden coach Kyle Lambson.\n\nNielson won the 100 butterfly (1:05.34) and the 500 freestyle (6:00.88). Her time in the fly ranks third in 3A this year, and her 500 free time ranks fifth.\n\nHeading into her final state meet next week, Nielson will look to podium again in her both her individual events like last year, and perhaps help Ogden podium in a couple of relays as well.\n\nBen Kohler improved his record to 51-6 last week with another strong showing at the 5A Division B state-qualifying meet.\n\nHe’ll be the favorite at the state tournament in 138 pounds to win his third straight individual state title.\n\n“Ben is one of those kids that is a coach’s dream, someone who buys in to every aspect of the program and works his tail off to be the best. He is a no-nonsense guy that just takes care of business both in the classroom and on the mat,” said Wasatch coach Kamron Day.\n\n“He is always in the room getting better and traveling across the country to seek out the best competition. He is a competitor and is always in the fight. His relentless work ethic and mental toughness is always on display, helping him to lead by example every time he steps on the mat. He is always pushing himself in every aspect of his life and is always elevating those around him. Ben’s commitment, accountability, and team-first mindset make him a cornerstone of our program and leader others naturally follow.”\n\nKohler won all four of his matches at the divisional meet by fall.\n\nMadison Sherman, Skyridge (Sr.)\n\nMadison Sherman enjoyed a dominant performance at the 6A Division B state-qualifying meet last week as she moved one step closer to an individual 3-peat.\n\nSherman won the 155-pound bracket at Syracuse High School with four pins, including three in the first 30 seconds of matches as she improved to 16-1 on the season.\n\n“Madison is a great wrestler. She is on point to be back in the finals to defend state title. She has overcome some struggles this year but is back in the room committed to winning a third state title. We are excited to see how she performs at the state tournament this year,” said Skyridge coach Brian Bond.\n\nSherman placed second at state as a freshman and then was a state champion as a sophomore and junior. A year ago Sherman finished with a 33-2 record en route to the state championship.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal are already plotting a potential £100 million move for Newcastle United midfielder Sandro Tonali ahead of the summer transfer window, according to the Sun. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is a huge admirer of the Italian and is keen to pair the Magpies star with Declan Rice at the Emirates Stadium club. Tonali was linked with a Gunners move yesterday following Mikel Merino’s injury and while the rumours had no legs, something could happen in the summer.\n\nNewcastle could miss out on Champions League football next season after an underwhelming Premier League campaign so far, which could see a move to join Arsenal appeal to Tonali. Manchester City and Chelsea also want the 25-year-old, and while the Magpies are not looking forward to selling him, lack of European football could force them to cash in. Newcastle ending the season without silverware could also deal a blow on their chances of holding on to Tonali and other top stars, and league leaders Arsenal are monitoring the situation.\n\nHe joined the Toons in a £55m deal from AC Milan in 2023 but has signed a new contract, which runs until 2029 with the option for an additional 12 months. Newcastle will want at least £100m for him from suitors if the Italian wants to move on, and Arsenal could be ready to do business. Merino, Martin Zubimendi and Ethan Nwaneri (on loan at Marseille) are all options for Arteta in the middle of the park, but the Spaniard loves quality competition in his squad having strengthened his attack with enough stars last summer. A big-money move for a midfielder next summer cannot be ruled out and Tonali could be back in the conversation after the rumours on the winter transfer deadline day.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 is a “full circle” moment for Leslie Frazier.\n\nIt’s been 40 years since his Chicago Bears won Super Bowl 20 against the New England Patriots. Frazier was a defensive back on the iconic ‘85 Bears.\n\nIn fact, his six interceptions led the team that year, but he suffered a career-ending knee injury in the second quarter of the Super Bowl.\n\nFrazier now eyes his third Super Bowl ring as assistant head coach for the Seattle Seahawks. He previously earned one as an assistant coach on Tony Dungy’s Indianapolis Colts staff that won Super Bowl 41.\n\nMORE: Seattle Seahawks' 'Dark Side' defense on the iconic 'Legion of Boom'\n\nAnother chapter in Frazier’s NFL storybook is his time as a head coach in Minnesota. Frazier led the Vikings 3½ seasons from 2010 to 2013. In 2012, the Vikings went 10-6 and reached the playoffs virtually solely on the back of NFL great Adrian Peterson, who won MVP. Frazier finished fourth in voting for the AP Coach of the Year award.\n\nNow on the precipice of another ring, Frazier is head coach Mike Macdonald’s secondhand man in Seattle, helping shape one of the best defenses in NFL history.\n\nMORE: Why Fanatics is running out of jerseys for Patriots, Seahawks ahead of Super Bowl 60\n\nFrazier was asked Monday, Super Bowl opening night, by Bears Now host Harrison Graham if he’s thought back on his career this week, specifically his time in Chicago.\n\n“Former teammates texted me about the 40th anniversary and it was New England that we played,” Frazier said. “And it hadn’t really dawned on me as we were getting ready to play the championship game against the Rams, but then afterwards it hit me. It’s full circle in a lot of ways. Here we are playing New England 40 years later. It’s just a special moment to be in this position to be able to compete for another world championship. It’s very humbling.”\n\nCooper Kupp pushes back on Robert Kraft's 18-game season hopes\n\nSam Darnold on his journey to Super Bowl 60: 'Believe in yourself'\n\nSeahawks predicted by ESPN to take perfect 6'4'' complement to JSN in NFL Draft\n\nSeahawks' Cooper Kupp teases Super Bowl trick play",

    "fullText": "Udinese have drawn level with Lazio for eighth place in the standings.\n\nRunjaic’s men put in a strong performance on Monday night, the 23rd matchday of Serie A.\n\nThe Friulians overcame Roma thanks to a second-half goal from Ekkelenkamp: the Roman side’s attempt to fight back was futile, as they had a stoppage-time goal ruled out for a near-offside by Tsimikas.\n\nSpeaking to DAZN after the match, Runjaic analyzed the game as follows: “I think it was more difficult after Davis’ injury. I’m very proud of the lads. Okoye made a great save towards the end. We deserved these three points; you also need a bit of luck. We maintained consistency in the Verona game, harassing Roma’s defense.”\n\nRunjaic then continued talking about the dream of Europe: “No, it’s just a moment. I think there’s no point in talking about it now. We know which teams are above us and are stronger. That’s not our goal. We’re missing something to be able to compete with the big teams.”",

    "fullText": "Manchester United had a busy deadline day in regard to sealing loan exits for many of their young stars.\n\nThe young Irish midfielder has had an impressive season so far.\n\nThe United academy star impressed on international duty for Ireland Under-21s against England in November.\n\nThe 18-year-old midfielder has also spoken to the media about how he hopes to be one of the next great Irish players to represent United in the future.\n\nHe was linked with a move to St Mirren in the Scottish Premiership earlier on deadline day, and the deal was officially confirmed late last night.\n\nUnited’s official website reported that, “Jacob Devaney has joined Scottish Premiership side St Mirren on loan for the remainder of the 2025/26 season, subject to international clearance.”\n\nThey also added that, “the 18-year-old Academy midfielder will gain senior experience with the Paisley club, having impressed for our Under-21s this season.”\n\nThe midfielder has been a regular in Premier League 2, captaining the side in all 11 matches this season.\n\nSt Mirren currently sit tenth in the Scottish top tier, and he will be up against his fellow United teammate Ethan Williams, who is currently on loan at Falkirk.\n\nThe Scottish side also announced the move, claiming, “St Mirren Football Club is delighted to announce the loan signing of Jacob Devaney from Manchester United, subject to international clearance.”\n\nSpeaking to the Scottish side’s website, the young midfielder stated, “it’s a great opportunity for me to come here, do well and try to help the lads finish the season strong. As soon as the offer came up it was something that me and my family looked at, and thought was a great opportunity. I see it as a big step in my career to go and prove myself. Everything he [the manager] said was really positive and that’s why I’m here today.”\n\nHis new manager, Steven Robinson, also added that Devaney brings something to the table that his squad currently does not have.\n\nSt Mirren will face Hearts of Midlothian later on tonight in the league where Devaney could be in line to make his debut.\n\nFeatured image Lewis Storey via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "With the NBA trade deadline approaching on Thursday, teams across the league are scrambling to assemble rosters they believe best position them for the future. The Los Angeles Clippers, for their part, are reportedly engaged in serious talks to send James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThis does not appear to be a situation where the Clippers were actively looking to move Harden. He has missed the team’s last two games for personal reasons, and it has long been understood that he carries significant influence over any potential trade destination. In short, Hardenwants a move away from LA.\n\nReports suggest the Cavaliers are willing to send Darius Garland to Inglewood in return, a move that would shift them down a path of youth. However, not everyone is convinced it makes sense for Cleveland, with Emmanuel Acho emerging as one of the more vocal critics of the potential deal.\n\nThe Clippers, after languishing at the bottom of the West for the first few weeks of the 25/26 season, are creeping up the standings and are currently 9th with a 23-26 record. The Cavs, meanwhile, are 5th in the East and looking to rediscover the form that helped them finish #1 in their conference last season. Acho warned them on Speakeasy that signing Harden won’t help them achieve that.\n\n“I would not want James Harden if I were a championship-caliber team,” the former NFL player turned sports pundit declared. “Nothing about James Harden spells Championship. Nothing about James Harden’s career spells Championship. He is all the way over the hill, and James Harden has never been a catalyst for winning championships.”\n\nThese may seem like harsh comments, but Acho has a point. He noted how Harden has never helped a team get close to winning a championship, and the only time a team looked deadly with him in the roster was when he was a 6th man in Oklahoma. He failed to deliver success in Houston (ran into prime Warriors to be fair), Brooklyn, Philadelphia, and finally, Los Angeles.\n\n“When he’s ever had to be that guy, he’s not that,” Acho added. “So, why in the world would anybody want to trade for James Harden if they actually have championship aspirations?”\n\nWell, it looks like Harden has championship aspirations for starters. There’s a reason he’s switched teams so many times in the 2020s. It’s not working out anywhere, but he refuses to give up. He’s averaging 25.4 points per game and assisting 8.1. His playmaking has also significantly improved over the years.\n\nWill teaming up with Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley finally give him the fairytale ending he’s hoping for? We’ll have to wait and see.\n\nThe post “Nothing About James Harden Spells Champion”: Emmanuel Acho Goes Off Following Clippers-Cavaliers Trade Story appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "At their apartment in Italy, FC Como defender Sophie Howard’s partner is reading the instructions for a dog bed they’ve bought for the Bernedoodle that will arrive at the end of this month.\n\nIt is probably far less complex than some of the documents that Howard, a defender capped more than 50 times for Scotland, will have read over a career representing herself in transfers between professional clubs. One of the few elite women’s footballers without an agent, Howard negotiated her own transfer from Women’s Super League side Leicester City to top-flight Como last summer.\n\n“I’ve connected with massive stakeholders in the club that I can have daily conversations (with) just because we had those exchanges every single day throughout the process,” Howard says. “I came to this club knowing exactly who was who and who I’d spoken to.”\n\nIt was not new ground for the 32-year-old, who is of the shrinking generation of active women’s footballers who can recall how the game has straddled the professional and amateur realms.\n\n“My whole youth career, there was no need for an agent because the game wasn’t where it is now,” she says, having negotiated her moves from Germany’s Hoffenheim to then WSL club Reading in 2018 and to Leicester, with whom she won promotion from the second-tier Championship in her first season, two years later.\n\nHoward’s story is an uncommon one in the top levels of a sport that, particularly during transfer windows for its men’s leagues, employs well-worn frameworks for talking about its agents, some of whom reach their own level of celebrity and notoriety. What are their motives? Who are they briefing? Are players and families enlisting their help too prematurely, on bad advice?\n\nOnly in the past five years has the transfer window in women’s football cultivated anything approaching a similar level of interest — the sport had its first million-pound player last summer when Olivia Smith moved from Liverpool to Arsenal — but as high up as tier three, players routinely operate without agents.\n\nWhere agents oversee contracts, boot deals and image rights in exchange for a percentage of the relevant income, players at National League level are likely to earn too little for agents to be interested in or comfortable taking that money. However, there are significant differences in resources between teams within the National League (some players will only receive expenses).\n\nPlayers will sometimes have informal conversations with agents who may be able to offer guidance, share contacts or review offers. Some smaller clubs may not deal with agents; other agents may work with better players on low-value deals to build a stable of the most talented youngsters with a view to making money in the future.\n\n“There’s some (agents) at National League level now — definitely not years ago, but now because there’s money involved,” Howard says. “Even at that level, because it’s often also younger players, they probably shy away from representing themselves, because it is daunting. Not a lot of people do it, and not a lot of talk about it.”\n\nFor the agents of WSL players and England internationals, the job has changed in the last few years.\n\nAlways about emotional and logistical support as much as financial, representatives of the higher-profile England players now find themselves navigating more lucrative sponsorship deals and higher-profile media requests following the team’s European Championship triumph in 2022. That was the sport’s most transformative commercial moment in the UK, particularly in generating interest among brands that agents, as several told The Athletic at the time, had hitherto had to “push doors down” to get in the room.\n\nHoward noticed this some time ago. Ultimately, the deciding factor for going solo was realising that she could “tell my own story better than other people”.\n\n“My value is way beyond what you see on the pitch only,” she adds. “My value was my consistency on the pitch, but also my leadership, what I’ve experienced, what I stand for. I believe only I can tell that about myself. Only I present who I am. In the last couple of years, I’ve really come to know the importance of knowing my value and therefore standing for that.\n\n“I was probably also in a very good situation because I had a contract (from Leicester) on the table, so I could really go in and put a stamp on my value. Sometimes, it’s (about) having really tricky and difficult conversations, but really standing for what you believe.”\n\nTo help Howard get ready to negotiate in person with clubs, her brother, who owns a media company involved in the finance industry, ran “trial conversations” between the two of them, because “they’re not easy” meetings to have.\n\n“They can be very challenging, because as football players, I don’t think we are prepared for these things,” Howard says. “I had to really practice them and my brother was absolutely brutal, coming back with things that potentially the clubs would say and trying to almost make me back down. The question my brother always (made me) ask was, ‘What do you want to get out of this?’ Once you know that — go for it.\n\n“He taught me to be quite ballsy in that sense. Sometimes, it ended up with me saying, ‘No way,’ and standing and leaving the room. And that’s not easy to do. Three years ago, I would have never done that. Now, seeing actually how well it went. I absolutely would do that again.”\n\nAll players have their own relationship with the agent representing them. Some feel they make the clearest decisions when the agent has streamlined their options and cut out the noise. Others, like Howard, prefer to be there each step of the way.\n\n“I want to understand the why behind your answers,” Howard says. “You often get insight and knowledge from how people respond. Sometimes, (the) most is said in the wordless things, when you don’t get a response.” When employing agents in the past, Howard found herself  “pushing to know exactly what was being said”, and “chasing the agent and the club” as her contract wound down.\n\n“Why am I needing someone to sort it, even though I’m already sorting it myself?” she mused.\n\nParticularly at Leicester, where she played for five seasons, she enjoyed good relationships with the higher-ups at the club, so much so that it “then felt a bit bizarre that someone else was having these conversations, even though I saw these people every day. Equally, I understand if you’re trying to separate (identities). You’re a player, you’re an employee at the club, you’re focusing on your performance. You don’t want to get involved in the business.”\n\nWhen Como first expressed their interest in summer 2024, Howard was still under contract at Leicester and both parties concluded it didn’t feel like the right time for a move. The Italians promised to be in touch again the next summer and stuck to their word, which appealed to Howard even as Leicester offered her a new contract.\n\nShe was unsure if moving abroad again, after three spells in Germany (where she was born) and two in the United States, was on the horizon. “I was very open and very direct because I just don’t like games (during negotiations),” she explains. “I don’t like keeping an option open just to see what I could get out of it if I know I’m not going to take it.”\n\nLeicester did not respond to a request for comment from The Athletic.\n\nConversations with family changed her mind, encouraging her to try living overseas again. During those final few weeks at Leicester, the seed had been planted.\n\n“I’m playing at Leicester and my full heart is at Leicester, but this is where it gets tricky, where you have to separate your business and do your football side,” Howard says. “When I was on the phone to other clubs, it was business, but my full professional self was giving it all to Leicester. Because up until the very end, I thought I was extending (her contract). I felt so at home there, and I always thought it was the place where I’d finish my career.”\n\nOver a Zoom call involving a translator, Howard laid everything on the table.\n\n“Seeing what Como, at this point, came back with almost hurt a bit, because I was like, ‘This guy doesn’t know me, and it seems like he values me more than the club I’ve given everything to for five years’.” The idea was difficult for Howard to think about, but is something that she says comes with representing yourself. There’s no shield: “These moments where you really have to make sure it stays professional (and) you don’t take it personally. Because that could ruin you.”\n\n“Those weeks were stressful,” she says. “I really had to lean on the people around me and do my absolute best to separate it.”\n\nThe second phase of negotiations took place with Leicester’s manager Amandine Miquel, who had no sporting director at the time, “so there’s a crossover, because the same person you talk to in the office a day ago is your manager on the pitch. The same person who’s now your manager is also who you’re doing business with. You just have to be professional about it. You have no choice because I think the moment you let that emerge, I think that’s fatal. It affects your performance. (If) you’re going downhill, what grounds have you got to negotiate?”\n\nHoward acknowledges that self-representation can be daunting, in part because of the breadth of skills the footballer-turned-agent must master: reading contracts, calculating their own financial worth, and liaising with sporting directors and managers who have their own perspectives and backgrounds.\n\nShe had no prior experience in negotiating, or of the traditional business world, before her football career. Her advice for those thinking of taking the same leap is to lead with honesty, know your value and be clear in what you want out of each conversation.\n\n“I never tried to be a business person, or to make myself (out to be) more qualified than what I was,” Howard says.“I stayed true to myself, but I was ready to negotiate and I was ready to stand for what I believe. … (At Leicester) I think people gambled and didn’t expect that I’d stick to my guns, but I did.\n\n“It’s not for everyone, and that’s also OK. There’s zero judgment. But if you want to take control of your career and you have no one so far that’s doing that for you who you fully trust, go for it. You can grow so much as a person through it. It is stressful, it’s very time-consuming, and your personal relationships suffer from it for the duration of the transfer window, but it’s so worth it.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

Even though the 37-year-old hasn't always been right, he has managed to land quite a few major scoops.\n\nBut one thing continues to puzzle football fans on social media: Why on earth does the transfer titan announce even the smallest news about a third-division player in English?

    "fullText": "The Women's Super League transfer window shuts on Tuesday - so what might we expect to happen on the final day?\n\nClubs have been doing business since 2 January and have until 23:00 GMT to complete any last-minute deals.\n\nAmong some of the biggest moves to have gone through are USA international Sam Coffey's switch from Portland Thorns to Manchester City for £600,000, and Aston Villa's £450,000 deal for Chelsea midfielder Oriane Jean-Francois.\n\nBottom side Liverpool also broke their record signing to bring in Republic of Ireland midfielder Denise O'Sullivan for £300,000 from North Carolina Courage.\n\nSo are there more big moves to come?\n\nEvery WSL winter window transfer\n\nArsenal are already lining up huge signings for the summer, with England international Georgia Stanway close to signing a pre-contract agreement to join when her Bayern Munich contract expires.\n\nThey are also in advanced discussions with Barcelona full-back Ona Batlle to bring her in on a free deal in the summer.\n\nThe Gunners have been known to pounce late in the window and want more midfielders. Will they make a surprise move on deadline day?\n\nChelsea have had a bid for Nigeria midfielder Jennifer Echegini turned down by Paris St-Germain but might make another attempt. But with the French window already shut, PSG cannot replace her so it is unlikely they will budge.\n\nThere could be a departure from the Blues with USA striker Catarina Macario attracting interest from National Women's Super League (NWSL) clubs.\n\nGermany midfielder Sjoeke Nusken's future has also been questioned but it looks like she is set to stay at Chelsea unless anything rapidly changes. The Blues are yet to make any signings in this window and manager Sonia Bompastor has hinted at frustration over a lack of squad depth.\n\nElsewhere, Manchester City defender Codie Thomas, 19, has a loan deal in principle agreed with Glasgow City.\n\nLondon City Lionesses are hoping to add one more before the deadline but still have work to do, while Aston Villa have looked at attacking options all winter.\n\nEverton might still do some business, with Roma midfielder Zara Kramzar on the verge of joining on loan with an obligation-to-buy clause. A medical is planned for Tuesday.\n\nFrance forward Kelly Gago has requested to leave the Toffees but nobody has met the £500,000 release clause in her contract.\n\nWest Ham have fought off interest in striker Shekiera Martinez so far, while Leicester City have a few young players that might be heading out on loan.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Monday night in the NBA delivered drama in different ways. One team erased a huge deficit. Another leaned on a single star to survive without key players. Long losing streaks ended, and winning streaks came to a stop. Every game shifted the mood in the standings and showed which teams are finding answers and which ones are still searching.\n\nCharlotte earned its seventh straight win after erasing a 22-point deficit. LaMelo Ball showed toughness after a head collision with coach Charles Lee caused an eye cut. He returned quickly and finished with 24 points. Kon Knueppel scored 17 and hit four three-pointers. Brandon Miller and Grant Williams added 16 each. The Hornets survived 17 turnovers and poor three-point shooting in the first half. Ball’s drive and dunk in the fourth gave Charlotte the lead. Miller later stole the ball from Herbert Jones and finished with a one-handed dunk. The win pulled Charlotte within a half-game of Atlanta for the final play-in spot.\n\nNew Orleans could not hold a strong first-half lead. Trey Murphy III led with 27 points. Zion Williamson had 14 points and 11 rebounds. Derik Queen added 16. Ball’s injury did not slow Charlotte enough. Defensive pressure hurt the Pelicans late. The loss marked their sixth defeat in nine games. New Orleans struggled to stop dribble drives in the fourth quarter.\n\nHouston won despite missing Kevin Durant and Steven Adams. Alperen Sengun carried the load with 39 points and 16 rebounds. Jabari Smith Jr. added 19. Sengun made 13 of 25 shots and 13 of 18 free throws. Eight of those free throws came in the fourth quarter. The Rockets used a late 12-2 run to seal the game. A replay decision wiped out a possible Pacers buzzer-beater before halftime and shifted momentum. Houston earned its third straight win and third straight road victory.\n\nIndiana could not finish strong after a comeback push. Pascal Siakam scored 27 points. Bennedict Mathurin added 25. The Pacers briefly led in the third quarter after a fast-break pass from Jarace Walker to Siakam. Sengun’s free throws ended their hopes. The team missed a chance to extend its winning streak to three games. Defensive fouls in the final minutes proved costly.\n\nMemphis snapped a six-game losing streak with sharp shooting. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 30 points. Ty Jerome had 19. Jaylen Wells added 18. Cam Spencer and Vince Williams Jr. scored 16 each. Three-point shooting changed the game after a poor effort two nights earlier. Memphis went 8 of 15 from deep in the first half. A 20-point lead formed in the second half. Early fourth-quarter threes pushed the margin to 20 again. The Grizzlies stayed ahead even when Minnesota tried to rally.\n\nMinnesota could not repeat its strong showing from Saturday. Anthony Edwards led with 39 points and seven rebounds. Jaden McDaniels scored 29. Donte DiVincenzo had 21, including 13 in the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves never got closer than nine points late. Their four-game winning streak came to an end. Defensive breakdowns on the perimeter hurt them early.\n\nPhiladelphia stayed hot with a fourth straight win. Tyrese Maxey scored 29 and hit seven three-pointers. Dominick Barlow posted 26 points and 16 rebounds. Joel Embiid added 24 as he worked back from injury. The Sixers led from start to finish and built a 23-point cushion. A 72-53 halftime lead set the tone. The team improved to 11-10 without Paul George. Balanced scoring and steady defense kept control all night.\n\nLos Angeles missed James Harden for a second straight game. Kawhi Leonard led with 29 points. Jordan Miller added 21 off the bench. Short runs in the fourth quarter failed to change the outcome. Leonard finished on the bench as the gap stayed wide. The Clippers remain in the play-in chase but could not match Philadelphia’s energy.\n\nFebruary 2 produced wins that mattered beyond the final score. Charlotte proved it can fight back under pressure. Houston showed it can win even when short-handed. Memphis finally broke through after weeks of frustration. Philadelphia kept its steady climb going. For the losing teams, the night exposed problems with closing games and protecting leads. With the season moving fast, these results could shape who stays alive in the NBA playoff race and who falls behind.\n\nThe post NBA results: February 2, 2026 – winners and losers appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Coach Mike Vrabel expects an \"identity war\" when his New England Patriots meet the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday in Super Bowl LX, he said Monday.",
    "fullText": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 3 (UPI) -- Coach Mike Vrabel expects an \"identity war\" when his New England Patriots meet the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday in Super Bowl LX, he said Monday.\n\nA minor earthquake hit San Ramon, Calif., on Monday morning, but additional soil shifted hours later south in the Bay Area when Patriots and Seahawks players kicked off Super Bowl week at opening night in San Jose.\n\nPlayers from both teams fielded questions, which flew at them with the unpredictability of bouncing footballs. Fans flocked to the San Jose Convention Center just to catch glimpses of the NFL stars. Hundreds of reporters shouted questions, with content spanning from the mundane to bizarre.\n\nBut one thing was clear: the explicitly expressed identities of Vrabel's Patriots and coach Mike Macdonald's Seahawks. And neither coach is willing to budge ahead of their quest for a Lombardi Trophy.\n\n\"This will be a great identity matchup for us,\" Vrabel said. \"This will be an identity war on the biggest stage. They play hard. Their defense runs to the football. They cause a lot of turnovers.\n\n\"They are committed to running the football. It's a physical football team. ... This will be a huge challenge.\"\n\nVrabel's Patriots share similar characteristics. The Patriots and Seahawks each rank inside the Top 4 in points scored and points allowed. They also ranked inside the Top 8 in yards gained and yards allowed in 2025.\n\nMVP candidate Drake Maye propelled the Patriots, who totaled the fourth-most passing yards in the NFL. The Patriots also ranked 6th in rushing.\n\nVeteran quarterback Sam Darnold and the Seahawks ranked No. 8 in passing yards and No. 10 in rushing.\n\nThe Seahawks defense ranked No. 3 against the run and No. 10 against the pass. The Patriots ranked No. 6 against the run and No. 9 against the pass.\n\nA key difference between the teams this season was the Seahawks' strength in special teams, specifically returns. They ranked third in both kick and punt return average. That element, which aids field position, could be crucial in a game played between two tough defenses.\n\nThe team to establish dominance in their valued areas is likely to win Super Bowl LX.\n\n\"We are going to do everything we can to go out there and play a good football game,\" Darnold said. \"Execute the way we know how to execute.\"\n\nNeither coach would disclose specifics within their game plans, but Macdonald also plans to implement the Seahawks' previously successful strategies.\n\n\"We are going to stick to our process,\" Macdonald said. \"The way we wanna play is we always want to be within our wheelhouse, but every game we are going to tailor things to our opponents.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, we have to do the things we are really good at. Right now, that's our plan.\"\n\nVrabel's mere presence could be an advantage for the Patriots. The coach, who won three Super Bowls as a Patriots linebacker, took plenty of lessons from those runs. He expects that knowledge to pay off this week in the Bay Area, when players will be confronted with potential distractions.\n\n\"I think that all builds up to the end of the week, on things we can focus on that may be a little different with this football game; the warm-up time before the game, the length of halftime,\" Vrabel said. \"All of these things that are going to be a little bit different. We can try to draw on everybody's experiences.\"\n\nThe Seahawks and Patriots will practice this week at respective facilities at San Jose State and Stanford, which sit about 22 miles apart.\n\n\"It's just another challenge,\" Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez said. \"We are playing the other best team in the NFL. We're excited for it. Just ready to go out there and have one more with the guys on Sunday.\"\n\nThe Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites. The least expensive price for a ticket for Super Bowl LX, as of Monday night, was listed for about $5,000 on the secondary market.",

    "fullText": "China has banned hidden door handles on electric vehicles (EVs), making it the first country to stop the use of the controversial designs that were made popular by multi-billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla.\n\nIt comes as EVs are facing scrutiny from safety watchdogs around the world after a number of deadly incidents, including two fatal crashes in China involving Xiaomi EVs in which power failures were suspected to have prevented doors from being opened.\n\nUnder the new regulations, cars will only be allowed to be sold if they have a mechanical release both on the inside and outside of their doors, according to state media.\n\nThe new rules are due to take effect on 1 January 2027.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology rules require the outside of every passenger door except the boot, to have a recessed space measuring no smaller than 6cm (2 in) by 2cm by 2.5cm to allow access to the handle.\n\nInside the car there must be signs measuring at least 1cm by 0.7cm to show how to open the door.\n\nCars that have already been approved by authorities and are in the final stages of entering the Chinese market will have another two years to update their designs.\n\nHidden handles are widely used in China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market, which includes EVs as well as hybrid cars and those powered by fuel cells.\n\nThey feature in about 60% of the top 100 best-selling NEVs, according to data cited by government-controlled newspaper China Daily.\n\nAlthough the measures will only apply to models sold in the Chinese market, the country's huge presence in the global car industry means the move is likely to have an impact around the world.\n\nTesla's door handles are already being investigated by US safety regulators and authorities in Europe are considering their own rules.\n\nIn November, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a probe focused on Tesla's electric-powered door handles, responding to reports that they suddenly stopped working, leaving children trapped in the cars.\n\nThe NHTSA said it had received nine complaints about the handles in Tesla's 2021 Model Y cars, the company's flagship model.\n\nIn four of the cases, the car owners resorted to breaking the window to resolve the issue.",

    "title": "How does AI impact skill formation?",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Two days ago, the Anthropic Fellows program released a paper called How AI Impacts Skill Formation. Like other papers on AI before it, this one is being treated as proof that AI makes you slower and dumber. Does it prove that?\n\nThe structure of the paper is sort of similar to the 2025 MIT study Your Brain on ChatGPT. They got a group of people to perform a cognitive task that required learning a new skill: in this case, the Python Trio library. Half of those people were required to use AI and half were forbidden from using it. The researchers then quizzed those people to see how much information they retained about Trio.\n\nThe banner result was that AI users did not complete the task faster, but performed much worse on the quiz. If you were so inclined, you could naturally conclude that any perceived AI speedup is illusory, and the people who are using AI tooling are cooking their brains. But I don’t think that conclusion is reasonable.\n\nTo see why, let’s look at Figure 13 from the paper:\n\nThe researchers noticed half of the AI-using cohort spent most of their time literally retyping the AI-generated code into their solution, instead of copy-pasting or “manual coding”: writing their code from scratch with light AI guidance. If you ignore the people who spent most of their time retyping, the AI-users were 25% faster.\n\nI confess that this kind of baffles me. What kind of person manually retypes AI-generated code? Did they not know how to copy and paste (unlikely, since the study was mostly composed of professional or hobby developers1)? It certainly didn’t help them on the quiz score. The retypers got the same (low) scores as the pure copy-pasters.\n\nIn any case, if you know how to copy-paste or use an AI agent, I wouldn’t use this paper as evidence that AI will not be able to speed you up.\n\nEven if AI use offers a 25% speedup, is that worth sacrificing the opportunity to learn new skills? What about the quiz scores?\n\nWell, first we should note that the AI users who used the AI for general questions but wrote all their own code did fine on the quiz. If you look at Figure 13 above, you can see that those AI users averaged maybe a point lower on the quiz - not bad, for people working 25% faster. So at least some kinds of AI use seem fine.\n\nBut of course much current AI use is not like this: if you’re using Claude Code or Copilot agent mode, you’re getting the AI to do the code writing for you. Are you losing key skills by doing that?\n\nWell yes, of course you are. If you complete a task in ten minutes by throwing it at a LLM, you will learn much less about the codebase than if you’d spent an hour doing it by hand. I think it’s pretty silly to deny this: it’s intuitively right, and anybody who has used AI agents extensively at work can attest to it from their own experience.\n\nStill, I have two points to make about this.\n\nFirst, software engineers are not paid to learn about the codebase. We are paid to deliver business value (typically by delivering working code). If AI can speed that up dramatically, avoiding it makes you worse at your job, even if you’re learning more efficiently. That’s a bit unfortunate for us - it was very nice when we could get much better at the job simply by doing it more - but that doesn’t make it false.\n\nOther professions have been dealing with this forever. Doctors are expected to spend a lot of time in classes and professional development courses, learning how to do their job in other ways than just doing it. It may be that future software engineers will need to spend 20% of their time manually studying their codebases: not just in the course of doing some task (which could be far more quickly done by AI agents) but just to stay up-to-date enough that their skills don’t atrophy.\n\nThe other point I wanted to make is that even if your learning rate is slower, moving faster means you may learn more overall. Suppose using AI meant that you learned only 75% as much as non-AI programmers from any given task. Whether you’re learning less overall depends on how many more tasks you’re doing. If you’re working faster, the loss of learning efficiency may be balanced out by volume.\n\nI don’t know if this is true. I suspect there really is no substitute for painstakingly working through a codebase by hand. But the engineer who is shipping 2x as many changes is probably also learning things that the slower, manual engineer does not know. At minimum, they’ll be acquiring a greater breadth of knowledge of different subsystems, even if their depth suffers.\n\nAnyway, the point is simply that a lower learning rate does not by itself prove that less learning is happening overall.\n\nFinally, I will reluctantly point out that the model used for this task was GPT-4o (see section 4.1). I’m reluctant here because I sympathize with the AI skeptics, who are perpetually frustrated by the pro-AI response of “well, you just haven’t tried the right model”. In a world where new AI models are released every month or two, demanding that people always study the best model makes it functionally impossible to study AI use at all.\n\nStill, I’m just kind of confused about why GPT-4o was chosen. This study was funded by Anthropic, who have much better models. This study was conducted in 20252, at least six months after the release of GPT-4o (that’s like five years in AI time). I can’t help but wonder if the AI-users cohort would have run into fewer problems with a more powerful model.\n\nI don’t have any real problem with this paper. They set out to study how different patterns of AI use affect learning, and their main conclusion - that pure “just give the problem to the model” AI use means you learn a lot less - seems correct to me.\n\nI don’t like their conclusion that AI use doesn’t speed you up, since it relies on the fact that 50% of their participants spent their time literally retyping AI code. I wish they’d been more explicit in the introduction that this was the case, but I don’t really blame them for the result - I’m more inclined to blame the study participants themselves, who should have known better.\n\nOverall, I don’t think this paper provides much new ammunition to the AI skeptic. Like I said above, it doesn’t support the point that AI speedup is a mirage. And the point it does support (that AI use means you learn less) is obvious. Nobody seriously believes that typing “build me a todo app” into Claude Code means you’ll learn as much as if you built it by hand.\n\nThat said, I’d like to see more investigation into long-term patterns of AI use in tech companies. Is the slower learning rate per-task balanced out by the higher rate of task completion? Can it be replaced by carving out explicit time to study the codebase? It’s probably too early to answer these questions - strong coding agents have only been around for a handful of months - but the answers may determine what it’s like to be a software engineer for the next decade.\n\nI suppose the study doesn’t say that explicitly, but the Anthropic Fellows program was only launched in December 2024, and the paper was published in January 2026.\n\nIf you liked this post, consider subscribing to email updates about my new posts, or sharing it on Hacker News. Here's a preview of a related post that shares tags with this one.\n\nIs it worrying that 95% of AI enterprise projects fail?\n\nIn July of this year, MIT NANDA released a report called The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025. The report spends most of its time giving advice about how to run enterprises AI projects, but the item that got everybody talking was its headline stat: 95% of organizations are getting zero return from their AI projects.",

    "fullText": "Philip Morris International, an international tobacco company, has recently been in the news for its “smoke-free” alternatives and regulatory battles it faces with the ZYN pouches.\n\nAmidst this, it filed a WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) letter with the Virginia Employment Commission on January 28 regarding the closure of its Richmond, VA office. The move will result in 135 permanent job cuts; all the workers are without union representation.\n\nThe tobacco maker noted that a majority of impacted workers will be offered alternative positions in other states. The first job losses will occur on April 17, 2026.\n\nThe Richmond closure comes as Philip Morris continues to reshape its US footprint with its “smoke-free” nicotine products, especially ZYN, which it acquired as part of its $16 billion acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022.\n\nInvestors continue to reward the shift; Philip Morris International's (PM) stock has risen 37% over the year and increased 24% this past quarter following its solid Q3 earnings report.\n\nThe report highlighted its “smoke-free” products as a big driver of revenue growth.\n\nThe company will release fourth-quarter financial results on Feb. 6. Analysts expect revenue of $10.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.67.\n\nNet revenue of $10.8 billion, $4.4 billion from the smoke-free business and $6.4 billion from combustibles\n\nDiluted EPS of $2.23, up 13.2% and adjusted diluted EPS reported at $2.24, which rose 17.3% year over year.\n\nGross profit of $7.4 billion, translating to 8.7% organic growth.\n\nOperating income of $4.3 billion was a 7.5% organic growth.\n\nQuarterly dividend increased 8.9% to $1.47 per share.\n\nSmoke-free accounted for 41% of total net revenues.\n\nWhen introducing its smoke-free restructuring, PMI shifted its headquarters from New York to Stamford, CT.

    "fullText": "LOS ARRECIFES, Mexico (AP) — The sun has set and the clouds are washed in purple as Mauricio Contreras and his daughter Eunices head out to fish in the Gulf of Mexico. Eunices casts the heavy net for snapper, pollock or cabrilla while her father pilots their small boat.\n\nContreras, an anchor dangling from a silver chain against his deeply tanned skin, has been doing this for more than 40 years. But he worries the family's main source of income is now at risk from an underwater pipeline completed last year to import natural gas from the United States.\n\n“When they started laying it, it affected us because the boats were dropping explosives and you could hear it all the way here, right on the shore,” Contreras recalls. Now that it's operational, he worries about leaks: “It’s a constant danger that will always be there, and it’s a risk for the entire fishing industry.”\n\nThe pipeline known as Southeast Gateway was built by Canadian company TC Energy in partnership with Mexico’s state-owned power company CFE. It adds 700 kilometers (435 miles) to a line that now stretches from southern Texas to Tabasco state, where it's supplying electricity for a major oil refinery. But its main goal is to someday deliver gas to the Yucatan Peninsula when the expansion of another pipeline is completed.\n\nSoutheast Gateway is part of a wave of projects that would allow Mexico, already the world's single largest buyer of U.S. gas, to bring in even more for its own use and to re-export to Asia and Europe. But that faces growing resistance from communities and environmental groups who say the strategy increases use of a polluting fossil fuel, deepens dependence on the U.S. and puts Mexico's climate commitments at risk.\n\nMore than 40,000 people across Veracruz make their living from the sea, including Contreras, who lives in a community where fishing is almost the only work. He joined residents of 15 coastal communities last year in a lawsuit over the pipeline that was dismissed, but is under appeal.\n\nThey allege that their communities, mostly Nahua and Nuntajiiyi' Indigenous peoples, weren't consulted before construction began as required by Mexico's Constitution.\n\n“We do not agree with this gas pipeline megaproject because we were never informed about it. We were never consulted and therefore we do not know the consequences it will have,” Maribel Cervantes, an activist and teacher who joined the lawsuit, said.\n\nThe government argued that Southeast Gateway was a matter of national security and kept some information about it secret, including its exact route. President Claudia Sheinbaum said last year that it was important for natural gas to reach the area.\n\nGreenpeace warned that dredging to bury the pipeline could affect deepwater reefs that are home to many species, some not found in shallow reefs. Pablo Ramírez, Greenpeace Mexico's energy and climate change program coordinator, also said methane leaks could affect ecosystems like the reefs. They sustain important species, including green and olive ridley sea turtles that nest on the beaches of communities such as Los Arrecifes.\n\nIn a video last September, TC Energy said experts had “thoroughly analyzed the marine environment to ensure that the route was designed to preserve ecosystems.” The Canadian company declined an interview but said the pipeline created 4,000 jobs during construction and met all federal requirements. It said the project “brings natural gas to the southeast of Mexico for the first time, opening opportunities for economic and social development in one of the poorest regions of the country.”\n\nMexico's push for U.S. gas dates to a 2013 reform that opened its energy sector to private and foreign investment, said Víctor Ramírez of energy consulting firm P21Energía. The goal was to reduce the use of more polluting fuels, such as fuel oil and coal, and take advantage of low natural gas prices in the U.S.\n\nNow, as the U.S. seeks new markets for gas fracked from the Permian Basin in Texas, Mexico offers not only a strategic geographic position for re-export but also more favorable political conditions for reaching markets the U.S. cannot easily access, said Wilmar Suárez, an energy analyst at Ember.\n\nIn turn, Mexico can resell that gas to other countries at a profit, Suárez said.\n\nSoutheast Gateway is currently supplying gas only to the $20 billion Dos Bocas refinery, one of former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's flagship projects and Mexico's largest refinery. But it could eventually carry more than 1.3 billion cubic feet of gas per day if the government's ambitious plans are realized.\n\nThose include completing another pipeline to connect Southeast Gateway with a planned plant in Oaxaca that will convert the gas to liquid for shipment to Asia. These plants burn part of the gas to power liquefaction, generating polluting emissions, said Claudia Campero of the Mexican nonprofit Climate Connections.\n\nLiquefaction plants have drawn the most opposition in recent years. That includes the Saguaro project, a planned 800-kilometer (500-mile) gas pipeline from Texas to the fishing community of Puerto Libertad, in Sonora. There, the U.S. company Mexico Pacific wants to build a plant to liquefy 15 million tons of gas per year for shipment to Asia.\n\nSuch shipping would pass through the Gulf of California, threatening whales because it's a key area for reproduction, Campero said.\n\nThe project is on hold due to lawsuits.\n\nMexico’s first export terminal for liquefied natural gas began operating in 2024, but many more are planned. If all of those come online, Mexico would have eight, with most along the Pacific coastline, according to Global Energy Monitor. The U.S. currently has nine.\n\nBoth Víctor Ramírez and Suárez said Mexico's natural gas strategy now jeopardizes its energy sovereignty.\n\nMore than 60% of Mexico’s electricity comes from gas-fired power plants, and about 70% of that gas comes from the U.S. Fitch Ratings said last year that Mexico's reliance on U.S.-piped gas will continue to grow because of rising demand, insufficient domestic production and the buildout of pipelines.\n\n“It is very easy for the U.S. to impose certain conditions on Mexico because it has a dominant position over gas supplies,\" Suárez said.\n\nThe Ministry of Energy did not respond to interview requests.\n\nPablo Ramírez, of Greenpeace, said completing all the pipeline projects would make it unlikely Mexico could meet its goal of reducing net carbon dioxide emissions by 31% to 37% by 2035. And Suárez, of Ember, said the strong focus on gas raises doubt about Mexico more than doubling — to 45% — its electricity from renewables by 2030, as promised by Sheinbaum.\n\nSheinbaum inherited most of the gas projects and must honor those commitments because funds have been invested, said Víctor Ramírez, of P21Energia. But he found optimism in the Ministry of Energy approving 20 private renewable energy projects in December.\n\nBack in Maribel Cervantes' courtyard in San Juan Volador, far from where Mexico City's powerful make energy policy decisions, she demanded that officials take communities like hers into account.\n\n“As Indigenous peoples, we demand that our right to autonomy and self-determination be respected,\" she said. \"We don't want them imposing their megaprojects on us.”\n\nDe Miguel reported from Mexico City.

    "fullText": "A Shenzhen-based gold trading platform has collapsed after running what amounted to a leveraged betting operation with no physical backing, leaving over 150,000 investors scrambling to recover their funds.\n\nThe Jieworui collapse — the largest in a recent wave of unlicensed gold platform failures across China — is now escalating into a standoff as victims refuse a repayment scheme that would pay them a fraction of their principal in exchange for waiving all legal rights.\n\nJieworui operated out of Shuibei, China's largest gold and jewelry trading hub. The platform attracted a massive retail following by offering zero-fee gold exchanges, attractive buyback prices, and a product called \"pre-set price trading\" — where users could lock in the price of one gram of gold with a deposit as small as $4.\n\nIn practice, the mechanism functioned as unlicensed options trading. The platform took the opposite side of every user bet, with leverage reaching up to 40 times. No physical gold changed hands. When users profited, Jieworui owed them the difference. When gold prices surged, those liabilities became unsurvivable.\n\nWithdrawals were first restricted around January 20, with daily limits capped at $69 or one gram of gold. Thousands of investors, many traveling from other provinces, gathered at the company's Shenzhen office demanding their money. Scuffles with police were reported. The majority of victims are housewives and working-class investors, according to local media reports.\n\nThe local government set up a special task force and announced on January 31 that Jieworui had begun processing repayments after disposing of assets and raising funds. A third-party audit was commissioned, with authorities stating that the widely circulated figure of 13.4 billion yuan in unpaid funds was \"significantly exaggerated.\"\n\nBut for victims, the reality of those repayments has been grim.\n\nThe platform initially proposed two options: a lump-sum payment at 20% of the principal, or 40% paid in 12 monthly installments. In practice, actual payout ratios have fallen well short of even the 20% floor.\n\nOne investor from Henan who put in $5,100 submitted two separate redemption applications. The first returned an offer of $1,219. The second dropped to $244. Another victim with over $44,400 in cash, 5.2 grams of gold, and 1,000 grams of silver in her account was offered just over $2,800 — roughly 6% of her holdings.\n\nCustomers who purchased platinum through the platform have been excluded from the payout calculation entirely, raising suspicions that Jieworui never held the physical metal.",

Brock, 83, was sentenced to 21 years to life after killing Uber driver Lo-Letha Toland-Hall in 2024\n\nBrock had been targeted by scammers for $12,000 and mistakenly believed Toland-Hall, who had been sent to pick up a package, was involved\n\nHe was ultimately convicted of murder in January\n\nAn 83-year-old Ohio man who killed an Uber driver he mistakenly thought had tried to scam him was sentenced to 21 years to life in prison.\n\nWilliam J. Brock was sentenced on Monday. Feb. 2 after he was found guilty of murder last month, according to The New York Times and the Springfield News-Sun. His conviction was also reported by the Associated Press.\n\nBrock shot Lo-Letha Toland-Hall six times outside his home in South Charleston, Ohio, in March 2024 after he wrongly believed she was involved in a scam phone call plot.\n\nPrior to the shooting, the AP reported, Brock was on the phone with scammers who demanded that he withdraw $12,000 in order to bail a relative out of jail who they said had been arrested.\n\nPer the Times, once Brock realized that the scammers were lying about the relative, the caller began to threaten him.\n\nThe caller reportedly demanded that Brock give the money to the person outside his home. That turned out to be Toland-Hall, who, it turned out, had also fallen victim to the same scammer, investigators said, according to the times.\n\nToland-Hall, 61, had been sent to Brock's house to pick up a package, and had no idea about the scam call or the demand for money, the AP reported.\n\nWhen she arrived at the home, Brock, who reportedly claimed he felt threatened, confronted Toland-Hall with a firearm and held her at gunpoint, threatening to shoot her while she tried to explain she worked for Uber and begged him not to shoot, the Times reported.\n\nEventually, Brock shot Toland-Hall six times and she was taken to the hospital, where she later died.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nThe AP reported that prosecutors said Toland-Hall was unarmed and posed no threat to Brock, who claimed self-defense during his trial.\n\nAccording to the outlets, Brock was eventually convicted of murder, but the scammers have not yet been caught.\n\n“Both families have lost loved ones because of this, and there are no winners here,” Clark County Prosecutor Daniel Driscoll said following the verdict, according to the AP. “The really sad part about this is that we know that the scammers, the folks who started this, haven’t been brought to justice. And hopefully one day the FBI will bring those folks and we’ll be able to prosecute them right here in Clark County for what they did.”",

    "fullText": "Upcoming SpaceX launches suddenly are up in the air after SpaceX reported an investigation into a mishap during a Monday Starlink launch in California.\n\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 launched at 7:47 a.m. PT (10:47 a.m. ET) from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. While successfully carrying 25 Starlink internet satellites to orbit, the rocket's upper stage experienced a malfunction as it prepared for a deorbit burn.\n\n\"During today’s Falcon 9 launch of @Starlink satellites, the second stage experienced an off-nominal condition during preparation for the deorbit burn,\" SpaceX said in a statement on X.. \"The vehicle then performed as designed to successfully passivate the stage. The first two MVac burns were nominal and safely deployed all 25 @Starlink satellites to their intended orbit. Teams are reviewing data to determine root cause and corrective actions before returning to flight.\"\n\nAs of now, it remains to be seen what impact this will have on Falcon 9 launches from Cape Canaveral. The next launch was currently set for no earlier than 4:20 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 5 from Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. That mission is also a Starlink mission.\n\nWhen is the next Florida rocket launch? Is there a launch today? Upcoming NASA, SpaceX, ULA launch schedule in Florida\n\nAlso on tap is a NASA Crew-12 launch on a Falcon 9 set for no earlier than Feb. 11. It remains to be seen if this investigation into the upper stage malfunction will cause a delay. With NASA's Crew-11 having returned early due to an ill crew member, only one NASA astronaut currently remains among the crew onboard the ISS.\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

    "fullText": "AMD (AMD) will report its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, providing Wall Street with its best look yet at the health of the ongoing AI trade.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) reported their respective results last week, sparking wildly divergent reactions from traders: Many balked at Microsoft’s increased spending and more modest growth, but applauded Meta’s performance despite a massive jump in its own AI spending.\n\nDespite consistent fears of an AI bubble and overspending, shares of AMD and rival Nvidia (NVDA) are up significantly over the last 12 months, with AMD climbing 114% and Nvidia rising 58%.\n\nAMD, like Intel (INTC), is also contending with the global memory shortage, which could force PC makers to raise prices on laptops and desktops, impacting sales and hitting AMD’s consumer chip business.\n\nAMD is expected to report Q4 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.32 on revenue of $9.6 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus estimates. That would mark an increase from the $1.09 and $7.7 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year.\n\nWall Street is anticipating data center revenue of $4.97 billion, up 29% year over year from the $3.86 billion AMD reported in Q4 2024. The company’s client business revenue is expected to top out at $2.9 billion. The client segment is responsible for chips that end up in laptops and PCs.\n\nThe chip designer’s gaming business is projected to see revenue of $855 million, a 52% year-over-year jump from the $563 million the segment saw in 2024.\n\nAMD’s results come roughly a month after it showed off a variety of new products during CEO Lisa Su’s keynote at CES 2026 in Las Vegas.\n\nThat includes the company’s upcoming Helios rack-scale server, which Su said is the world’s best AI rack, a clear shot at Nvidia.\n\nHelios is designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s own Vera Rubin-powered NVL72 rack-scale offering. Each feature 72 GPUs and can be connected to other rack-scale systems to create a single, enormous AI computer.\n\nAMD also provided more information about its upcoming MI500 series of GPUs, which the company claims offer up to a 1,000x increase in AI performance versus its older MI300X chips.\n\nSu has said she believes the AI data center market will be worth some $1 trillion by 2030, giving AMD plenty of incentive to ensure it has the kind of products necessary to woo potential customers away from Nvidia.\n\nBut like Nvidia, AMD is seeing increased competition from some of its own customers as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft continue to roll out more of their own customer chips in their data centers.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — The seven victims of a marine disaster that devastated a storied Massachusetts fishing town included a fifth-generation fisherman, a young federal fisheries observer and a father-and-son crew duo. All died when their fishing boat, the Lily Jean, sank in waters off America’s oldest seaport.\n\nThe sinking underscored the risks long inherent in Gloucester’s fishing industry, which spans more than 400 years and was famously chronicled in “The Perfect Storm.” The names of the crew will be added to a city memorial honoring thousands of fishermen lost at sea over generations.\n\nThe 72-foot (22-meter) vessel was returning to port early Friday to repair fishing gear when it sank in frigid Atlantic waters. The U.S. Coast Guard announced Monday that it was launching a formal investigation into the sinking after suspending a search for survivors Saturday. It has not said what might have caused the sinking, though it said ice buildup from freezing ocean spray can cause a boat to capsize.\n\n“You fish in federal waters, you fish in a Gloucester boat, and you lose your life, you’re forever a Gloucester fisherman,” Gloucester fisherman Al Cottone said.\n\nCoast Guard officials identified the victims Monday as captain Accursio “Gus” Sanfilippo and crewmembers Paul Beal Sr., Paul Beal Jr., John Rousanidis, Freeman Short and Sean Therrien. Also aboard was Jada Samitt, a fisheries observer for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nOn Monday, the community was quick to push back against speculation about a possible cause, recalling Sanfilippo as someone who cared about his crew and didn't take risks.\n\nVito Giacalone, head of the Gloucester Fishing Community Preservation Fund, said such sinkings are unfortunately not out of the ordinary.\n\n“We’ve had multiple sinkings. All hands lost. No radio communication at the very last minute. Nobody alive to say, oh, no, it wasn’t that,\" he said. \"So, it’s just unfair to everyone involved with the folks that were lost feeling like someone did something wrong.”\n\n“All those guys on that boat were seasoned fishermen,” former Lily Jean crew member Gryphon Orfanos said while doing boat repairs Monday at the same dock where the Lily Jean used to tie up. “They knew how dangerous it was.”\n\nOrfanos and friend Nate Dennen attached a stainless steel memorial cross with the name “Lily Jean” to a wooden beam at the dock.\n\nDennen, a longtime friend of the boat's captain Gus, said he was a mentor who looked out for his crew.\n\n“It taught me everything I know,” Orfanos said of his more than a year working on the Lily Jean — his first offshore fishing job. “Out on the ocean, it teaches you everything. But as far as I want the word to spread, Gus was the best guy ever.”\n\nCottone said any vessel leaving port needs a Coast Guard inspection decal, which requires up-to-date safety equipment — and the fishery observer conducts a safety check before each outing.\n\n“If the observer deems the boat not to be safe or have any piece of safety equipment that’s not up to date ... that observer will shut the trip down,” he said.\n\nSanfilippo was well known in Gloucester. The Lily Jean, Sanfilippo, and his crew were featured in a 2012 episode of the History Channel show “Nor’Easter Men.” The captain is described as a fifth-generation commercial fisherman, out of Gloucester, in the Georges Bank. The crew is shown working in dangerous weather conditions for hours on end, spending as many as 10 days offshore catching haddock, lobster and flounder.\n\n“We loved each other,” Giacalone said. “He treated me like a big brother and I treated him like my younger brother. To know the tragedy of this and to know the kind of character that Gus had, he’d be mortified to know that these lives were all lost.”\n\nGiacalone said the Sanfillipo and Beal names were synonymous with local fishing going back decades. He said Sanfillipo “followed in the footsteps of his dad\" while the Beal family has built boats and a brother is also a fisherman.\n\n“Those two families are absolutely etched in centuries of these multiple generations of fishermen,” Giacalone said.\n\nCrew made of veterans and newcomers\n\nJust as Sanfillipo had years of experience, Samitt was undertaking her first job at sea as an observer. The 22-year-old was tasked with collecting data from the catch, used for making government regulations and other purposes.\n\nSamitt’s family said in a statement that she was originally from Virginia and had a deep love of Gloucester’s fishing community and \"conveyed to us how critical it was to protect the seas and fisheries.”\n\nNOAA, meanwhile, offered its condolences.\n\n“Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Jada’s family, the families of the six fishermen, the NOAA observer community, and everyone affected,” its statement said.\n\nTherrien, 44, was working his first season on a commercial fishing vessel, joining the Lily Jean after his close friend Rousanidis said the boat needed another crew member, his partner Becky Carp said. He had been on about a half-dozen trips already, she said, and appeared to be settling into the job despite complaints about the cold.\n\nTherrien, she said, was \"always up for an adventure” but took thed job mostly so he could provide for his family. The lifelong Massachusetts resident was the family's breadwinner and sought to supplement his construction work, which was scarce in the winter.\n\n“He wanted to make sure his family was safe and taken care which is why he was busting his butt,” Carp said.\n\nCarp last talked to Therrien on Tuesday before he headed out. She had wanted him to take the week off to spend time with him but he felt he needed to make money. She only learned about the sinking when alerts began popping up Friday.\n\n“You always want to hold out hope that they are found. Come Saturday morning, I kind of knew at that point that they wouldn’t find any survivors,” Carp said. “I feel like it’s a nightmare that I am going to wake up from. It's just a bad dream and everything will be OK. But unfortunately, it's not.\"\n\nWhittle reported from Scarborough, Maine.",

The aim of the 'trusted contact' is to help spot suspicious transactions and intervene promptly.\n\nMore information can be found on the CPF website.\n\nFormer actor Edmund Chen will appeal against his five-day jail sentence for careless driving, according to local media.\n\nSeveral outlets reported that the 63-year-old – named as Tan Kai Yuan in court documents – filed a notice of appeal on Monday (2 Feb), citing court records.\n\nIt was also reported that Chen appears to be changing his lawyers, switching from Invictus Law to Contigo Law.\n\nIn March last year, Chen was involved in an accident on the Ayer Rajah Expressway after he slowed his vehicle almost to a stop and caused a collision with a motorcyclist as he attempted to filter out from the road leading to Keppel Road.\n\nThe manoeuvre, which saw his vehicle going over chevron markings, left a 21-year-old motorcyclist with fractures to his wrist and hand.\n\nChen pleaded guilty to causing grievous hurt through careless driving.\n\nBoth the defence and prosecution had sought a fine but the judge imposed five days’ jail and a driving ban of five years.\n\nAviation and aerospace will be the \"twin, reinforcing engines of growth\" for Singapore’s economy, according to Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong.\n\nDPM Gan made the remarks during the opening ceremony of the Singapore Airshow 2026 on Monday (2 Feb) where he emphasised how Singapore has built its relevance by connecting people and markets, as per the Straits Times.\n\nSingapore is able to position itself as a leading air hub as well as an advanced manufacturing and engineering base. \"These strengths reinforce one another,\" Gan was quoted as saying.\n\nGan revealed that since the last air show, Singapore has attracted more than $750 million in investment commitments across aerospace manufacturing, maintenance, repair and overhaul, as well as aftermarket services. He expects this to create nearly 600 jobs over the next five years.\n\nDPM Gan outlined four key strategies to maintain Singapore's momentum:\n\nResearch, Development and Innovation\n\nYou can read full details about each point in ST's report.",

    "fullText": "An \"infatuated\" prison officer who had a \"substantial sexual relationship\" with an inmate where she worked has been jailed for two and a half years.\n\nCharlotte Winstanley, 27, smuggled a range of contraband material into HMP Lindholme, near Doncaster, for prisoner Jabhari Blair, 30, including a mobile phone which they used to send \"explicit photos and videos\".\n\nSheffield Crown Court was told that in one message, Winstanley, of Coronation Road, Doncaster, told Blair: \"I love my job, but I love you more.\"\n\nBlair, a former organised gang member, was jailed in 2014 for 12 and a half years.\n\nOn Monday, he was given a 13-month sentence after admitting possessing cannabis and a prohibited phone and USB stick.\n\nWinstanley admitted misconduct in public office and transmitting a photograph from inside a prison.\n\nJudge Jeremy Richardson KC, the Recorder of Sheffield, described the the case as the \"worst\" of its type he had dealt with.\n\nThe court previously heard messages uncovered between Winstanley and Blair described Mondays as \"date nights\".\n\nProsecutor Aaron Dinnes told the court that prison cameras had picked up \"intimate moments\" showing them touching and disappearing together into rooms.\n\nDinnes said one message from Blair indicated that he \"can't wait to give Miss Winstanley a beautiful baby\".\n\nRichardson told the court that in October 2020 Winstanley had become an operational support officer at HMP Lindholme, then became a prison officer and received anti-corruption training.\n\n\"Whilst working on J-Wing, you started a corrupt relationship with Blair,\" he said.\n\n\"You knew it was wrong and against all the training you'd received.\"\n\nHe said although there were \"suspicions\" about her, she \"brazened it out and continued [the] corrupt affair\".\n\nShe knew the sentence Blair was serving was for a serious crime, the court heard, and had taken a screenshot of a news article showing this.\n\nWinstanley bought him sim cards and smuggled them into prison, the judge said.\n\n\"You professed love for each other and engaged in WhatsApp and Snapchat messages,\" Richardson said, adding that many were \"explicit and unnecessary\",\n\nOne message from Winstanley read: \"I'm literally praying to have your babies\", while another stated: \"Life starts now, baby. Every sacrifice I make I do so I can be with you.\"\n\n\"It is utterly clear that you both knew that what you were doing was unlawful and corrupt,\" Richardson said.\n\nHe added that Winstanley gave Blair sensitive information about the movement of prisoners, healthcare information about other inmates and intelligence about a search scheduled to take place within his cell.\n\nThe court heard Blair told Winstanley he had used his contacts within the prison to ensure she was protected and said someone was ready to \"fight immediately if necessary\".\n\nWinstanley also became close with Blair's mother, the judge said, who was \"clearly aware of the nature of the relationship\".\n\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North\n\nOfficer 'prayed' to have inmate's babies - court\n\nPrison officer admits relationship with inmate\n\nPrison officer jailed over affair with inmate\n\nHM Courts and Tribunals Service",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA ran into exasperating fuel leaks during a make-or-break test of its new moon rocket Monday, calling into question how soon astronauts could take off for a trip around the moon.\n\nThe leaks — reminiscent of the rocket's delayed debut three years ago — sprang just a couple hours into the daylong fueling operation at Kennedy Space Center.\n\nLaunch controllers began loading the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket with super-cold hydrogen and oxygen at midday. More than 700,000 gallons (2.6 million liters) had to flow into the tanks and remain on board for several hours, mimicking the final stages of an actual countdown.\n\nBut excessive hydrogen quickly built up near the bottom of the rocket. Hydrogen loading was halted at least twice as the launch team scrambled to work around the problem using techniques developed during the previous Space Launch System countdown in 2022. That first test flight was plagued by hydrogen leaks before finally soaring without a crew.\n\nThe four astronauts assigned to the mission — three Americans and one Canadian — monitored the critical dress rehearsal from nearly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away in Houston, home to Johnson Space Center. They have been in quarantine for the past 1½ weeks, awaiting the practice countdown's outcome.\n\nMonday's fueling demo will determine when they can blast off on the first lunar voyage by a crew in more than half a century.\n\nAt best, NASA could launch commander Reid Wiseman and his crew to the moon no sooner than Sunday. The rocket must be flying by Feb. 11 or the mission will be called off until March. The space agency only has a few days in any given month to launch the rocket, and the extreme cold already has shortened February’s launch window by two days.\n\nRunning behind because of the bitter cold snap, the countdown clocks began ticking Saturday night, giving launch controllers the chance to go through all the motions and deal with any lingering rocket problems. The clocks were set to stop a half-minute before reaching zero, just before engine ignition.\n\nThe nearly 10-day mission will send the astronauts past the moon, around the mysterious far side and then straight back to Earth, with the goal of testing the capsule's life support and other vital systems. The crew will not go into lunar orbit or attempt to land.\n\nNASA last sent astronauts to the moon during the 1960s and 1970s Apollo program. The new Artemis program aims for a more sustained lunar presence, with Wiseman’s crew setting the stage for future moon landings by other astronauts.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "description": "Disney reported \"headwinds\" in international visitation to its American parks as foreign travelers continue to avoid the US.",
    "fullText": "Looks like even \"The Most Magical Place on Earth\" isn't enough to entice foreign travelers who are skipping the US.\n\nDisney is facing some \"international visitation headwinds\" at its parks in the US, which include Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California, the Walt Disney Company said in its first-quarter earnings report on Monday.\n\nDespite the slowdown in international visitors, the company reported growth in its experiences segment, with visitation at its domestic parks up 1% in the most recent quarter.\n\nHugh Johnston, Disney CFO, told analysts on a call that the company has less visibility into international visitor trends than domestic because foreign travelers tend to stay in non-Disney hotels, but that there were other indicators international visitation was down.\n\n\"As a result of that, we pivoted our marketing and sales efforts, promotional as well as marketing efforts to a more domestic audience, and we're able to keep attendance rates high from that perspective,\" he said.\n\nDisney's just the latest American company to feel the slowdown in foreigners traveling to the US.\n\nInternational visitation was down for the eighth straight month in December, according to data from the National Travel and Tourism Office. As of October, the number of international visitors to the US was down 5.5% in 2025 compared to a year prior.\n\nAmir Eylon, president and CEO of Longwoods International, a market research consultancy that specializes in the travel tourism industry, said visits from Canada especially declined, but that there were also significant declines in visits from countries like Germany, France, and India.\n\nCanadian visits to the US were down 22% year-to-date as of October compared to a year prior, according to NTTO data.\n\n\"We have an image problem right now with our Canadian neighbors to the North and, as evidenced with some other countries, we have an image problem in some of our key international feeder markets as well,\" Eylon told Business Insider.\n\nHis firm's research has found a majority of Canadians say American trade policies and political rhetoric are deterring them from visiting the US in the next 12 months. Many also say they do not feel like the US is a safe place to visit.\n\nCanadians also typically make up a significant portion of international travel to Florida, so Eylon said Disney likely isn't the only destination in the Sunshine State feeling the slowdown.\n\nTravelers seeking to avoid the US also have other options when it comes to experiencing Disney. Disneyland Paris is fully owned by the Walt Disney Company, while the company has minority ownership in the Disney resorts in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Disney has no ownership in Tokyo Disneyland, which operates under a licensing agreement.\n\nDisney also benefited from consistent demand in domestic leisure travel, with Americans continuing to prioritize travel, Eylon said.\n\nAnna Abelson, an adjunct professor at New York University's Jonathan M. Tisch Center of Hospitality, said the slowdown in international visitors to Disney underscored a broader industry shift.\n\n\"Even 'bucket list' icons are navigating significant macroeconomic volatility, ranging from currency fluctuations to shifting geopolitical sentiments,\" Abelson told Business Insider.\n\nHave a story to share about travel to the US?

    "fullText": "Barbara Corcoran, 76, swears by having separate bedrooms from her husband. She says couples should try it — even in small spaces.\n\n\"Well, they could get separate beds. They could put a wall up. They could sleep on the convertible couch,\" Corcoran told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Monday.\n\nWhile she acknowledged that the setup won't work for everyone, Corcoran said many people living in small apartments could make better use of the space they already have.\n\n\"I don't really have a solution, but there's a lot of New Yorkers who have two bedrooms and one set up as a den or TV room. I think that's a misuse,\" she said. \"When I got my second bedroom, I immediately loved my husband twice as much.\"\n\nThe \"Shark Tank\" host and her husband, retired Navy captain and FBI agent Bill Higgins, have been married since 1988.\n\nFor Corcoran, protecting her alone time is key, including in the mornings.\n\n\"I always wake up at 5 o'clock. I make myself some coﬀee, sit on my chair and daydream for an hour. I try to stay oﬀ my cellphone and I usually succeed,\" she said.\n\nDespite her busy schedule, the business mogul says she doesn't work on Mondays.\n\n\"I take Mondays oﬀ, and I always have. I will not work on a Monday. On Friday, I leave all my commands, all my notes, little Post-it Notes on everybody's machines. Or now, it's a lot of email,\" Corcoran said.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Corcoran has shared her views on sleep divorce. In a December 2024 appearance on \"The Jamie Kern Lima Show,\" Corcoran described having separate bedrooms as one of the secrets to her successful marriage.\n\n\"Well, I think there's something to be said about your own private space. Yes, I lead a very busy life. I have a huge family that I'm always entertaining. I have very sincere, active friends, and so what I need more than anything else is a respite, and my husband is not relaxing,\" Corcoran told podcast host Jamie Kern Lima.\n\nShe added that it's difficult for her to muster the energy at the end of the day to listen to him and contribute meaningfully to the conversation.\n\nMoreover, she and her husband have rules for entering each other's bedrooms. \"I have to invite him into my bedroom, and I like it that way,\" Corcoran said.\n\nMany other celebrities have also spoken about sleeping separately from their spouses. Carson Daly has called sleep divorce the \"best thing\" for his marriage, while Bette Midler has said she and her husband of over 40 years have slept apart since the start of their relationship.",

Workers will soon learn more about how the acquisition will impact their equity, according to the Q&A.\n\nThe joint venture is still continuing to prepare for a \"possible IPO in 2026,\" according to the memo.\n\n\"Whether it actually happens, when it happens, and at what valuation are still highly uncertain,\" it said.\n\nSpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, has reportedly been gearing up for an initial public offering that could value it at $1.5 trillion.\n\nSpaceX and xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nXAI plans to hold an all-hands in the coming days and host trainings related to the merger, the internal memo said. For now, both companies will maintain their separate branding, but the company \"will be looking at how this might change in the future,\" it said.\n\nDespite the acquisition, xAI staff will not be allowed to access internal SpaceX databases or collaborate directly with workers at the rocket ship company without direct approval, the memo said. The companies will be kept separate due to regulations that control the sharing of defense and space-related technology that could impact national security. SpaceX workers may be allowed access to xAI internal tools, it said.\n\nSpaceX and xAI CEO Elon Musk sent a memo to staff earlier on Monday announcing the acquisition. In the email, which was later shared online, he said the merger would allow the joint venture to eventually launch data centers in space.\n\nHe wrote that the deal would create \"the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world's foremost real-time information and free speech platform.\"\n\nLast year, Musk announced that xAI merged with his social media company, X.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "fullText": "Broncos' often-criticized cornerback predicted to be targeted by 3 teams in offseason trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos had one of the best defenses in the NFL in 2025 and odds are, they'll want to keep that unit together as much as possible.\n\nStarting cornerback Riley Moss had a roller-coaster season, but the fact that he led the league in defensive pass interference penalties drew the ire of many within Broncos Country. Would the team be open to moving him?\n\nMoss will be entering the final year of his rookie deal in 2026. The Broncos will have to decide whether to extend his contract or allow him to enter free agency next offseason, where they would get nothing in return if he signs a contract with another team.\n\nAlex Ballentine of Bleacher Report published an article looking at the top three trade targets for each NFL team this offseason, and he has three teams with Moss on the list.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins, Pittsburgh Steelers and San Francisco 49ers are teams that Ballentine believes could approach the Broncos regarding a trade for the 25-year-old corner. Each of those teams could use help in the secondary and could obtain a young player in a relatively cost-friendly deal.\n\nThe Broncos used their first-round selection on Jahdae Barron out of Texas last spring and they will want to get him on the field more in 2026. However, Ja'Quan McMillian has been too good in his role as the team's nickel corner spot to be taken off the field. That could leave Moss as the odd man out.\n\nTeams playing the Broncos this season routinely took shots down the field against Moss, looking to take advantage of a perceived mismatch or draw a pass interference penalty. With Pat Surtain II on the other side of the field, this is a practice that isn't going to change.\n\nThat said, despite the many flags thrown against him this season, Moss more than held his own in pass coverage and though many Broncos fans may disagree, he has been a solid cornerback for the team. The Broncos don't have to move him and unless they are blown away by an offer, they shouldn't.\n\nREAD:Latest NFL coaching hire all but confirms Broncos won't lose Vance Joseph\n\nThe team can move forward with the secondary as is and enjoy what could be an embarrassment of riches if Barron turns into the player many believe he will. Moss is a big piece of this team's defense and the Broncos shouldn't tinker with that chemistry.\n\nDenver Broncos 2025 Grades: Report card for team's free-agent signings\n\nBroncos upcoming free agent just drew a difficult line in the sand\n\nBroncos Rookie Report Card: How does the 2025 class grade out?\n\nBroncos lose coveted assistant coach to AFC rival\n\nBroncos predicted to add playmaking piece to secondary in first round of 2026 draft",

    "title": "Gasperini Reflects on Roma’s Mentality After Defeat: “This is a team that always comes off the pitch with its head held high”",
    "description": "After a tough loss to Udinese, Gasperini accentuated the positive.",
    "fullText": "Roma entered today’s Round 22 fixture looking to reclaim third place on the league table. And while a win wouldn’t have advanced the Giallorossi further up the table, a loss would have been a blow to the club’s top-four hopes. With the top six clubs separated by 14 points, week-to-week volatility at the top of the table should be expected, making every point worth its weight in gold, especially those in which Roma was the ostensible favorite.\n\nBut after 90 minutes, Roma left empty-handed following their match against mid-table Udinese. However, unlike recent defeats, this wasn’t the typical fire-15-shots-on-goal-but-come-up-empty-handed affair. No, this time, Roma was done in by two deflections: one off Donyell Malen and the other caused by Donyell Malen. Unfortunately for us, the latter was harmless while the former produced the only goal of the match, a Jurgen Ekkrlenkamp free-kick that caromed off Malen’s shoulder, giving it enough English to squirm past Mile Svilar.\n\nToss in a would-be equalizer chalked off due to an offside call, and this was your classic back-breaking defeat for Roma, which slipped to fifth place following tonight’s 1-0 defeat, two points behind fourth-place Juventus.\n\nWhile many of us would have read Roma the riot act after this defeat, Gian Piero Gasperini took a more measured approach in his post-match presser. (Transcript courtesy of the official club site. )\n\nWas there perhaps a bit of a lack of quality?\n\n“Without a doubt, it wasn’t easy. We lacked a bit of precision in the final third, and maybe a bit of luck as well, especially with the goal we conceded. But this is a team that always comes off the pitch with its head held high and finds the strength to keep improving”.\n\nToday, there were two dangerous chances. What are the reasons for this step backwards?\n\n“It was a tight game, difficult for both sides. They also had a couple of shots from a distance. When you get four or five players into the box, those become chances. I think overall we did much more”.\n\nHow satisfied are you with the transfer window?\n\n“I agree with the analysis of the match — these are difficult games, decided by moments. The transfer window is closed now, and we have these four months ahead of us. I didn’t expect to have so many difficulties in bringing in a few players in specific roles we’ve been looking for since the summer. That said, Malen has arrived, Zaragoza has arrived, and we also have very young lads who will certainly give their all”.\n\nIs there a player you would have liked to sign? A final cherry on top?\n\n“No, no. Look, dozens of names were mentioned. I’m very happy because, in a very short space of time, the opportunity to sign Malen came up and then, in the final two days, also Zaragoza. I realize the January transfer window is never easy, but that’s how it is and how it went. These two players will definitely help us. Then players like Venturino and Vaz arrived as well, but they represent the future — we can’t expect them, at this moment, to be competitive for such high objectives. The most important thing is to avoid injuries. That would be crucial, and to get Dybala, Koné and a few other players who are still out back fit. Then we’ll continue on the path we’ve followed so far, because this is a group that definitely works hard”.\n\nDo teams play too much, as Conte says?\n\n“Football inevitably leads to injuries. Muscle strains have always existed, just like sprains to the knees and ankles. Today, they may be a bit more frequent because we play twice as many matches, but if you look at the percentages, probably injuries have always been the same: subluxations, bruises, knee and ankle problems. Science has never managed to halve recovery times — when there is a muscle injury, you still need at least three weeks, just like years ago. Today, we have much more accurate diagnoses and sometimes also a bit of bad luck, which leads to players being sidelined for apparently minor issues, and that is a topic. There are clearly a lot of games being played. That’s what television and the public want, so the system goes on like this. These are the risks, effectively. However, there is nothing that proves with certainty that doing things differently would prevent injuries. It’s a statistical observation, but not an absolute certainty”.",

    "description": "Chicago reshapes its rotation and bullpen, then lands Alex Bregman, earning high marks for a transformative offseason.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Cubs were very active this offseason. A couple of months after making the National League Divisional Series, the front office knew they had to make this team better this winter.\n\nSo, the Cubs went out and improved their rotation, revamped their bullpen, and found a solid replacement for Kyle Tucker atop their lineup. Those were the three biggest needs for this team heading into the offseason.\n\nAnd the North Siders addressed all three needs.\n\nFollowing the rotation’s struggles in last year’s postseason, Chicago had to add a top-of-the-line starting pitcher in the offseason. Despite missing out on free agent pitchers like Dylan Cease and Tatsuya Imai, the Cubs pivoted to the trade market.\n\nIn the trade market, they eventually found their frontline starting pitcher. The Cubs and Miami Marlins reached a deal that sent pitcher Edward Cabrera to the Windy City in exchange for top prospect Owen Caissie and two other prospects.\n\nThe addition of Cabrera now gives the Cubs six strong rotation arms once everyone is healthy. Cabrera joins a group of Shota Imanaga, Matthew Boyd, Cade Horton, Jameson Taillon, and Justin Steele.\n\nThe bullpen will look a bit different this season, especially with Brad Keller, Drew Pomeranz, and Andrew Kittredge all gone. But the Cubs replaced those quality relievers with high-upside arms.\n\nThe team signed Phil Maton, Hoby Milner, Jacob Webb, and Hunter Harvey in free agency. Maton is coming off his best season. Milner has been a workhorse out of the bullpen in each of the past four years. Webb has finished with a sub-3.05 ERA in back-to-back seasons, and Harvey has shown his potential on the mound when healthy.\n\nThose four new additions, along with Caleb Thielbar, Daniel Palenica, and Colin Rea, make this a solid bullpen entering the 2026 season.\n\nThen, the Cubs made their biggest move of the offseason in mid-January by signing Alex Bregman to a five-year, $175 million contract. That marked the third biggest contract signed in the team’s history.\n\nBregman brings leadership and playoff experience to that Cubs clubhouse. Most importantly, he firmly replaces Tucker at the top of Chicago’s lineup. The veteran has finished with at least a 3.5 WAR in four consecutive seasons.\n\nThere’s no doubt that the Cubs made a lot of moves this winter. The highlight of their offseason was trading for Cabrera and signing Bregman to a massive contract.\n\nGiven all those moves made by the Cubs, Jim Bowden of The Athletic was a big fan of their offseason. Bowden gave the North Siders an ‘A’ offseason grade. Only the Los Angeles Dodgers (A+) had a better offseason grade.\n\nSo, it appears to have been a successful offseason for the Cubs.",

The Eagles started to take over more of the possession time as the first period progressed, and quickly culminating with two goals by James Hagens to extend BC’s lead to 3-0 only 15 minutes of game time after the opening faceoff.\n\nIn the second period, it was Harvard that made quick work of things. They scored in under 30 seconds to start the second period to steal back some momentum. But the Crimson train did not keep rolling, and the rest of the second period was dominated by the Eagles, who outshot their opponent 20-1 for the remainder of that period. Dean Letourneau tipped in a laser shot by James Hagens to bring BC’s lead back out to 4-1 with just 20 seconds remaining, which once again gave BC all of the momentum heading into the intermission.\n\nThe third period was mostly a formality, even as Harvard pressured with an empty net. They couldn’t get more than just a few shots on net, and eventually Lukas Gustafsson completely ended their night with a corner snipe in the final minutes. Boston College came away with the 5-1 victory to advance to the Beanpot’s final round against either Boston University or Northeastern on Monday February 9th",

    "fullText": "Kamaru Usman thinks Khamzat Chimaev likely struggles to make 185 pounds.\n\nThe UFC middleweight champion continues to call out light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira despite not having defended his belt once. Chimaev (15-0 MMA, 9-0 UFC) claimed the 185-pound title with a dominant performance against Dricus Du Plessis at UFC 319.\n\nUsman, who took Chimaev to a majority decision on short notice at UFC 294, sees Chimaev's insistence in going after Pereira (13-3 MMA, 10-2 UFC) as a sign.\n\n\"For Khamzat Chimaev to continue to call him out, I think Khamzat potentially has outgrown the weight class again to where now he's like, 'Let me go to a new division where I can make the weight and I can capture that,'\" Usman said on his \"Pound 4 Pound\" podcast with Henry Cejudo. \"There's all types of rumors and things coming out saying he's 230 pounds, 225, whatever. Khamzat is a big guy. Khamzat has always been a big guy. The fact that Khamzat was making 170 is just as ridiculous as Anthony Johnson when he was making 170.\n\n\"But Anthony Johnson, remember, was making that, moved up, fought at '85 I think maybe one time, and I think even missed weight there after moving up, then settled at 205 pounds. So, I think Khamzat Chimaev might potentially be in that same ballpark which is potentially why he's asking for 'Poatan.' And if that's the case, I understand it. Now it makes sense. If you've outgrown the weight class, it makes sense. Why kill myself to get down there when I just can't make the weight anymore.\"\n\nChimaev was open in saying that he'd rather not defend his belt against top contender Nassourdine Imavov, who is a fellow Russian fighter.\n\n\"And if I go up there and I'm able to get that title, guess what? That opens the door for another Russian in Nassourdine Imavov to get that middleweight title or potentially fight for that title,\" Usman said. \"So hey, it might be chess pieces being played here.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Kamaru Usman theorizes why Khamzat Chimaev insists on Alex Pereira",

    "description": "Despite C.J. Stroud's tough playoff exit, Nico Collins delivered a powerful message of encouragement, reminding his quarterback of his true potential and leadership.",
    "fullText": "The Houston Texans saw their 2025 season end with a rough road performance against the New England Patriots in the Divisional round of the postseason. It was the same way the two seasons prior ended, which were seen as successes. This time around, Houston would have liked to get over that hump and finally advance to the AFC Championship Game, but that didn't happen in part to a horrendous performance from the offensive side of the ball.\n\nHouston lost 28-16 to the Patriots, who will represent the AFC in Super Bowl LX. This marks the second season in a row the Texans have fallen to the eventual AFC Champion, which is nothing to scoff at. The Texans were in the game with the Patriots for most of the contest, but turnovers and offensive inefficiency made it hard to win.\n\nThe weather conditions in the game were difficult to play in, but that does not excuse the offense's complete sloppiness. Quarterback C.J. Stroud played what was probably the worst game of his career as he threw four interceptions and completed well under 50 percent of his passes. It was a rough way to end his third season in the league, especially in what could be seen as a contract year.\n\nStroud was out there in New England without his top offensive weapon in wide receiver Nico Collins. The star wideout suffered a concussion during the Wild Card round against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and he did not have enough time to clear the league's concussion protocol.\n\nDespite not being out there for his team's last game, Collins had a message for Stroud after the tough performance, which he shared during a media scrum with Aaron Wilson, \"Yeah, no doubt man, just keep your head up. You know what I'm saying? It's not the way we want to end; our goal was to go to the Super Bowl. You know, things happen. Just keep being you, brother, don't let this one game define who you are. We all know who you are. Keep being a star, keep being the leader you are, keep being the light in the room. Dude is a baller man.\"\n\nStroud is going to have a long offseason, as the end of the 2025 campaign will likely stick with him. He should have a chip on his shoulder heading into 2026, but he will have plenty of opportunities to make up for his poor postseason performance.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United supporters made their feelings known about the club’s ownership situation once again ahead of the match against Fulham at Old Trafford.\n\nThe on-pitch focus remained on the game itself, which was settled by a Benjamin Sesko injury-time winner. The mood around the stadium, however, was shaped by protests and marches referenced in the latest episode of Talk of the Devils.\n\nAccording to Talk of the Devils, fans gathered before kick-off to voice their frustration at the Glazer family’s long-standing control of the club.\n\nThe podcast also noted that INEOS – now controlling United’s football operations – attracted criticism from some supporters as well.\n\nFurthermore, The Athletic’s United show described the protests as a familiar part of the matchday landscape. They also explained that anti-ownership messaging remains prominent.\n\nIn addition, the tone reflected an atmosphere where some fans feel their concerns have not been answered by recent changes behind the scenes.\n\nThis implies that anger is no longer aimed at one group alone.\n\nOwnership narratives can influence the wider conversation around recruitment, long-term planning and trust in decision-makers – not just one single fixture.\n\nThe uproar around the ground, therefore, shapes how matchdays are experienced. Essentially, supporters believe they have been forced to repeat the same messages for years.\n\nTalk of the Devils’ mention of continued demonstrations is a timely reminder that protests have become a recurring theme in United coverage. This is evidently not a one-off event.\n\nIn the final analysis, the podcast’s observation points to a question United’s hierarchy cannot ignore: how quickly can confidence be rebuilt while the same ownership arguments remain unresolved?",

    "fullText": "The Spanish figure skater Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaté faces a last-minute scramble to redesign his Olympic short program after a copyright dispute blocked him from using music from the Minions franchise just days before competition begins at the Milano Cortina Winter Games.\n\nThe six-time Spanish national champion from Barcelona, who is set to make his Olympic debut in the men’s singles event, said he learned late last week that the routine he has performed throughout the 2025-26 season would not be cleared for Olympic use. Guarino Sabaté said he had submitted the music through the International Skating Union’s recommended rights-clearance process months ago and had competed with the program without issue during the season, including at last month’s European championships in Sheffield.\n\nThe ruling means the 26-year-old must now adapt or replace choreography he has refined for months, a daunting task in a sport where musical timing and muscle memory are inseparable.\n\n“Finding this out so close to the biggest competition of my life was incredibly disappointing,” Guarino Sabaté said in a social media post. “Nevertheless, I will face this challenge head-on and do everything I can to make the best of the situation.”\n\nThe routine, built around music from the popular animated film franchise, had become a signature for the Spanish skater. He regularly performed wearing a yellow shirt and blue overalls reminiscent of the film characters, leaning into a playful, crowd-friendly style he said was designed to show that men’s figure skating can balance technical difficulty with humor and personality.\n\nRights to the Minions property are controlled by Illumination and parent studio Universal Pictures. It was not immediately clear which specific licensing hurdle ultimately blocked Olympic clearance, but music licensing in figure skating has grown increasingly labyrinthine in recent years, particularly as the sport has shifted toward contemporary popular music.\n\nAt last year’s world championships in Boston, the ISU director-general, Colin Smith, described the situation to the Guardian as a structural problem in the music business rather than something skating can easily solve on its own.\n\n“It’s a complex issue, frankly, because the music industry has no common clearance platform,” Smith said. “There are multiple buckets of rights, and within those buckets the clearance process isn’t done on a single platform. Tracking tools have improved, but the facilitated process just isn’t there.”\n\nSmith, who previously oversaw Fifa World Cup tournament operations as chief tournaments and events officer and chief operating officer from 2015 to 2023, said he had held direct discussions with major rights-holders about building something more workable, arguing that the sport’s global profile should make cooperation attractive.\n\n“I’ve had direct conversations with one of the big publishing and music companies, and they fully agree it’s a strange situation that there isn’t a facilitated process – and they’re determined to help us find one,” he said. “What we hear time and time again is that figure skating is so special, and they actually want the music heard with figure skating. So the fact there’s a rights-clearance process in the way needs to be addressed. It’s a topic we’re addressing, and we’re trying to find a rational solution.”\n\nThe controversy also fits into a broader pattern across the sport, where even elite Olympic athletes have found their music choices subject to late-stage legal or financial complications.\n\nThe Canadian ice dancers Marie-Jade Lauriault and Romain Le Gac learned late last year that two Prince songs planned for their 1990s-themed rhythm dance could not be cleared for Olympic use, despite being approved for use during the rest of the season. The pair had secured their Olympic place with a podium finish at Canadian nationals but were forced to rework their program for the Games.\n\nHigh-profile disputes have surfaced even before that. At the Beijing Olympics in 2022, the American pairs champions Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier were hit with a copyright lawsuit tied to their use of a cover version of House of the Rising Sun. The case was later settled privately for an undisclosed sum understood by the Guardian to be around $1.4m (£1.02m), but the episode highlighted the legal and financial risks tied to music selection at the sport’s highest level. Knierim later described the dispute as casting a “bittersweet” shadow over the performance.\n\nThe case also exposed how little many athletes understood about music licensing requirements. For decades, skaters largely relied on federations and event organizers to manage music use, but the lawsuit underscored how individual athletes could still be drawn into copyright disputes. Rights complications have also affected how artistic sports are broadcast and archived, with some competitions unavailable on replay platforms because music licenses do not extend to long-term streaming.\n\nEven outside Olympic seasons, clearance costs can derail programs. The Canadian pairs skaters Deanna Stellato-Dudek and Maxime Deschamps said they abandoned plans to use a cover of a Phil Collins track after being quoted a licensing fee in the tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nTaken together, the cases reflect how music rights – once a secondary consideration in figure skating – have become a logistical and financial challenge athletes must navigate alongside training and competition.\n\nSmith said skating is not alone in facing those pressures, and suggested a broader, cross-sport approach may be necessary, involving Olympic organizers and other music-driven judged disciplines.\n\n“Absolutely, it’s not just figure skating,” he said when asked whether the ISU could coordinate with sports such as gymnastics, artistic swimming and others that face similar issues. “We are one of the largest in terms of the Winter Olympics, and we are working with the IOC as well, together with the music industry, to find a solution.”\n\nSmith added that the ISU was pursuing what he called a “multi-pronged approach”, including work with an existing platform that handles rights issues across other sports.\n\n“We’re really trying to find a rational, practical solution,” he said.\n\nGuarino Sabaté said he followed required procedures, including submitting his music through the ClicknClear licensing system during the summer. The company has said generally that Olympic participants must secure all necessary authorizations before using music in competition, but it does not comment on individual cases.\n\nThe ISU confirmed it is monitoring Guarino Sabaté’s situation but declined to provide details about the specific dispute.\n\n“The ISU is aware of this situation,” the governing body said on Monday in a statement to the Guardian. “As soon as we have more details on this specific case, we will share them as appropriate. Copyright clearances can represent a challenge for all artistic sports. While the ISU does not have a contractual relationship with ClicknClear, we continue to work collaboratively with rights clearance stakeholders to ensure that thrilling performances can be accompanied by stirring music.”\n\nThe timing leaves Guarino Sabaté with limited options. Skaters typically spend months building choreography that matches specific musical phrasing and emotional beats. Switching music days before competition often means simplifying elements, adjusting step sequences or reverting to older programs.\n\nOne potential fallback could involve returning to music he used in previous seasons, though even that carries complications if similar artists or tracks are already tied to other programs or require new clearance.\n\nThe men’s singles event is scheduled to begin on 10 February at the Milano Ice Skating Arena, leaving little time for rehearsal under competition conditions.\n\nDespite the setback, Guarino Sabaté said he intends to compete regardless of the final music choice, thanking fans for supporting the program throughout the season.\n\n“I promise to step on the ice with everything I have and deliver programs that both you and I can be proud of,” he said.",

Like, he would shut up the professor because he would be so impressed that he knew what was going on, and mind you, this is a law class at Berkeley.”\n\nSuffice to say, Mendoza’s competitiveness extends well beyond the football field, and he wasn’t going to be shown up by some uppity law professor from the West Coast. Although the fan did also suggest that the instructor’s confrontations with student athletes were never hostile and predominantly friendly.\n\n“The professor would always tease football players and most of the football players would tease him back, and it would just be some kind of banter.” she recalled. Nevertheless, that kind of attention to detail and willingness to understand the finer points of any subject is exactly what head coaches and coordinators will be looking for in Mendoza’s upcoming interviews.\n\nThrow in the fact that the 22-year-old has one of the most positive attitudes of any prospect in recent memory, and it’s safe to say that this will be a slam dunk for the Raiders on night one of this year’s draft. “Even though he was being teased by the professor, he would just be smiling. He would answer whenever he was asked. He was such a genuine, humble guy.”\n\nMuch has been made of Mendoza’s squeaky clean image, but as more personal testimonies, like this one, begin to come to the forefront, it becomes readily apparent that he is in fact as nice as everyone says he is, and that will certainly go long way in securing him a lengthy career in the National Football League.\n\nThe post “Fernando Mendoza Used to Regularly Stump His Own Law Professor”: Berkeley Law Student Puts Insane Allegations Against Heisman Winner appeared first on The SportsRush.",

The game in 2026 will be in December.\n\nAs the Cardinals have played twice in Mexico, and NFC teams have nine home games in 2026, it will be something to watch. They perhaps will end up either as the designated home team, as they have been in both previous trips there, or the road team.\n\nThe announcement gives the league nine international games in 2026.\n\nOne game in Melbourne, Australia, and the LA Rams will be one of the teams\n\nOne game in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nOne game in Mexico City, Mexico\n\nOne game in Paris, France, with the New Orleans Saints as one of the participating teams\n\nThe Cardinals could viably play in Melbourne or Paris, as they will face the Rams and Saints in 2026, both on the road.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

Most players move of shortstop at the age that Mookie started playing shortstop. It's one of the most incredible developments in baseball the last couple season.\n\n— Doug McKain (@DMAC_LA) January 31, 2026\n\nBetts spent most of his career in right field, becoming a Gold Glove winner at the position and regarded as one of the best defenders in the game.\n\nHis speed allows him to cover a good amount of ground, and his glove and fundamentals are sound overall. However, in 2024, Betts was forced to cover in the infield, moving to second base and moonlighting as a shortstop.\n\nBetts did not play up to his usual defensive standard despite having a good arm and experience fielding ground balls, leading him to move back to the outfield for the close of the season once others got healthy.\n\nEver the player looking for a new challenge, the former Red Sox player spent the 2024 offseason working on his fielding to play shortstop full-time.\n\nHe delivered a standout performance in 2025, becoming a Gold Glove finalist, cutting down on his mistakes, and making highlight plays, especially during the postseason.\n\nThe biggest barrier preventing older players from playing shortstop is the loss of athleticism that comes with age.\n\nIt is rare to see a player in their mid-to-late 30s still playing shortstop, though Betts wants to buck the trend.\n\nHe seems to do a good job of maintaining his body and retaining his athleticism, though Father Time remains undefeated, and he could suffer an injury or a natural decline that limits his range to get ground balls.\n\nRealistically, if he wants to stay in the infield, Betts could end up moving over to second base, where he also played.\n\nEven if he does not stay at shortstop for the rest of his career, Betts has already achieved a special feat, moving to shortstop in his 30s and thriving.\n\n“To go out there and play Gold Glove right field for years,” manager Dave Roberts said back in October. “And to be in the Gold Glove conversation this year, rightfully so, to playing the biggest of games, biggest of stages — it’s just never been done. It takes a special brain and talent to do it.”",

    "description": "Righty pitcher is low-key the key piece of the Jordan Hicks trade",
    "fullText": "Rejoice! It’s February! That means baseball will be back before the month is over, and I’ll finally write about something besides “Hey, look at this young arm!”\n\nUnfortunately, Spring Training is still weeks away. Respite still eludes you, South Side Sox stan.  The Pale Hose have another arm you haven’t heard of, Daniel Sandlin, and I’m going to tell you all about him. (At least he’ll stick around for longer than Ryan Rolison.\n\nThe trade represents a lateral move for Sandlin’s organization ranking: FanGraphs has Sandlin as the ninth best prospect in the White Sox system, which was just about the consensus for him with the Red Sox. His big-ticket trait is velocity: at 6’4’’ and 215 pounds, Sandlin was topping out at 99.9 mph in September. The steady velocity – he sits around 96mph – has kept the door open for Sandlin to start in the majors, despite being transitioned into the bullpen at Triple A this past season. In the video below, a June 21 Double-A start, you can see how easily Sandlin can overpower an opposing lineup when he’s locating his fastball at the top of the zone:\n\nFanGraphs also has good things to say about Sandlin’s cutter and slider, calling both pitches “nasty and fairly distinct from one another.” A sinker/sweeper combo rounds out his standard five-pitch mix, although he has a curveball he’ll mix in on occasion. Sandlin also threw a changeup last year. No, literally. He threw one changeup:\n\nHowever, I’d wager the remainder of Luis Robert Jr.‘s contract that Sandlin is going to be throwing a lot more changeups … what’s that? Apologies, dear reader, but I’m now being told all that money actually has been spent? No kidding? Huh. Well then, I guess I’d wager the remainder of Andrew Benintendi’s contract? Regardless, if Sandlin’s going to win a spot in the White Sox rotation, he’ll need to get comfortable with a changeup, and quick.\n\nAt this point in time, Sandlin’s has a two-part plan for approaching lefthanders. The first part is to throw the ball, and the second part is to pray:\n\n2025 Splits (Combined Double-A and Triple-A)\nvs. Righties: .225 BA, .343 SLG, .649 OPS, .289 BABIP\nvs. Lefties: .285 BA, .430 SLG, .772 OPS, .358 BABIP\n\nBack to FanGraphs, who came through in the clutch with an updated 2026 report today: “[Sandlin] still doesn’t have a great offspeed pitch with which to attack lefties … [he] peppers the top of the zone with cutters and sliders before elevating his fastball with two strikes.”\n\nIf you’re throwing your breaking pitches up in the zone to get ahead against opposite-side hitters, it doesn’t take much imagination to picture what could happen if that slider hangs just a little, or that cutter comes out a little flat, or even if he just misses his spot a couple inches low. The French refer to it as “Bang City.”\n\nIf you’ve read a single thing I’ve published on this site before — not a guarantee, I realize! — you already know what I’m going to say, and you’re probably pissed off that you’ve read 500 words just to realize this is yet another article about the kick changeup and how I think it’s a magical pitch that fixes everybody. But I’m not even the first to bring it up this time!\n\n“The White Sox have had recent success coaxing better changeups out of pitchers with naturally-good breaking balls,” FanGraphs concludes in their prospect report, “and perhaps they’ll be able to do that with Sandlin.”\n\nAnd I’d say the evidence is there! Sandlin has a very strong supinator profile. His Achilles’ heel, for him and many supinators, is a lack of arm-side options against opposite-handed hitters.\n\nTo flatten out his pitching splits, Sandlin’s going to need something. This is the magic of the kick change: no unfamiliar arm mechanics or discomfort. The platonic ideal of the kick change isn’t just its effectiveness, but how quickly somebody can pick it up and add it to their arsenal. For Sandlin, it is also the difference between a major league starter versus a middle reliever.",

    "title": "Red Sox make creative trade, opt to not pursue 49-HR slugger (5 thoughts) | Chris Cotillo",
    "description": "The Red Sox made a creative trade and watched Eugenio Suárez sign an affordable deal with Cincinnati on Sunday. What does it all mean?",
    "fullText": "A very slow 10-day period for the Red Sox ended Sunday with a trade — Boston sent Jordan Hicks and David Sandlin to the White Sox in a salary dump that netted pitching prospect Gage Ziehl — and the news that Eugenio Suárez, perhaps the best position player left on the free agent market and a potential Red Sox fit, had signed a one-year, $15 million deal with the Reds. Here are five quick thoughts on the developments and the Red Sox, who are exactly one week away from spring training opening in Fort Myers next Monday.\n\n1) The Red Sox are working backwards to solve their financial puzzle, and the work likely isn’t done.\n\nWhen the Red Sox signed Ranger Suárez to a five-year, $130 million contract last month, their projected competitive balance tax (CBT) threshold ballooned to a number around $269 million, which is far more than the first threshold number ($244 million) and even exceeded the second threshold at $264 million. It’s clear Boston wants to enter the season short of that second threshold and potentially lower, and there are other pathways to (smartly) shedding money.\n\nMoving Masataka Yoshida (and his $18 million CBT) hit would likely require the Red Sox to take on a good portion of his deal while attaching a prospect like they did with Sandlin and Hicks. A much easier path, however, would involve moving Patrick Sandoval, who will certainly draw interest from clubs if healthy. Sandoval is a bit of an unknown after missing all of 2025 as he rehabbed from Tommy John surgery but will enter camp on the outside looking in when it comes to the rotation competition. A couple of strong spring starts could force a pitching-needy club to offer a prospect while taking on Sandoval’s entire salary, which comes with a $9.125 million CBT hit in 2026. The Red Sox have 6-7 starters ahead of Sandoval and would likely be willing to move him.\n\nMoving an outfielder like Jarren Duran or Ceddanne Rafaela in a bigger trade is another, albeit much less likely, way the Red Sox could move some money around. A Sandoval trade would get the club in the range of $252 million, making further additions (either in spring training or at the trade deadline) more palatable.\n\n2) The trade unclogged the roster pipes, too.\n\nThe main objective of the trade with Chicago was obviously salary-related, as clearing $8 million of Hicks’ money (and getting relief against the CBT) threshold was smart business. But a secondary objective was also accomplished by Breslow, who cleared two 40-man roster spots with the move.\n\nThe Red Sox have strengthened the back end of their roster in recent months, leading to far fewer easy calls when it comes to who gets cut loose when a spot is needed. That Payton Tolle and Connelly Early’s big league debuts came a season earlier than expected locked up two spots that would have otherwise been open all winter. It was telling that Breslow had to trade utility man Tristan Gray, a potential contributor who was acquired in November, to free up a spot when Ranger Suárez’s contract became official on Jan. 21. Further additions would have required further tough calls.\n\nNow, though, the Sox have two open spots and will gain a third early in spring training when Tanner Houck (recovering from Tommy John surgery) can be moved to the 60-day injured list. Moving Hicks also allows an easier path for other promising arms to contribute early in the season. Zack Kelly’s path to a roster spot is now clear and Rule 5 addition Ryan Watson is no longer blocked by Hicks, who is out of minor league options. The Red Sox also have room to make a free agent addition to the bullpen as well.\n\n3) Boston opted for Ziehl over another package that would help the big league bullpen.\n\nAccording to sources, the Red Sox and White Sox had serious discussions about a different-looking trade that would have sent Hicks and Sandlin to Chicago for Jordan Leasure, a 27-year-old reliever who had a 3.92 ERA (and 81 strikeouts) in 64 ⅓ innings in the big leagues last year. The Riverview, Florida product would have fit the Red Sox as a right-handed middle-relief option, joining Kelly, Watson and Greg Weissert as candidates in that role.\n\nThe Red Sox would have had to kick in more of Hicks’ salary to obtain Leasure, who has more value than Ziehl, who has barely pitched above High-A. In the end, the sides opted to do the deal that involved more cash and a lesser player headed to the Red Sox.\n\n4) Craig Breslow wasn’t kidding when he said defense was important.\n\nIn his last meeting with reporters, Breslow was clear that he was prioritizing infield defense when assessing his next move. That bore out with the club’s decision to not meaningfully pursue Eugenio Suárez before he signed with Cincinnati.\n\nIn December, a source noted that the Red Sox had interest in Suárez, but only as a clear fallback option should Alex Bregman and some other targets not land in Boston. As time went on, agents around the industry speculated that Suárez’s market had not developed as expected and that he could be a candidate for a one-year deal. That’s all he got in Cincinnati, signing a $15 million guarantee that every club — including the Red Sox — could have done.\n\nStill, even as other options fell off the board and Suárez’s market collapsed, the Red Sox didn’t meaningfully engage. As MassLive reported Sunday, they never made an offer. It wasn’t about the value or negotiations not lining up. It was simply about the Red Sox not wanting a player who, despite slugging 49 homers last season, strikes out at a high clip and is a defensive liability at third base.\n\nThe Red Sox’ potential trade targets on the infield market are well-known with Houston’s Isaac Paredes and Chicago’s Nico Hoerner and Matt Shaw having been heavily discussed on the rumor mill. But what about Ramón Urías? The longtime Oriole remains unsigned as a defense-first, versatile option who would fit the roster well, even in a limited role.\n\nUrías regressed with the bat last year to the tune of a .675 OPS in 112 games split between Baltimore and Houston but was still a capable defender at both third base (78 games) and second (26 games). He also has historically hit very well at Fenway, logging a .326 average and an .881 OPS in 28 games in Boston. At this point, Urías can likely be had on a reasonable one-year deal. A source said the Red Sox have checked in on his availability but have shown only lukewarm interest to this point in the winter.\n\nThe Red Sox, even with Marcelo Mayer, Romy Gonzalez, David Hamilton and Nick Sogard in the mix as internal options for second base and third base, have begun to explore free agent alternatives, as evidenced by their pursuit of Dylan Moore, who they were “very involved” on before he signed with the Phillies, according to a source. Luis Rengifo is another available infielder.\n\nRed Sox agree to minor league deal with veteran RHP (report)\n\nAnother potential Red Sox trade target lands elsewhere (report)\n\nEx-MLB GM gives Red Sox strong offseason grade, still questions infield\n\nRumored Red Sox target signs one-year deal with Reds — and Boston didn’t make an offer\n\nDavid Sandlin says goodbye to Red Sox after trade to Chicago",

    "fullText": "NFL mock draft season is upon us, and for the first time in several years, the New England Patriots will be picking late in the draft.\n\nIn his latest two-round 2026 NFL mock draft, ESPN’s Matt Miller has the Patriots selecting edge defender Cashius Howell with the 31st overall pick and Indiana wide receiver Elijah Sarratt in the second round with the 63rd overall pick.\n\nBoth would bring instant playmaking ability to the team. Howell was the SEC Defensive Player of the Year after leading the conference with 11.5 sacks. He also recorded 31 tackles, 14 tackles for loss, six pass deflections and one forced fumble.\n\nThe standout defensive star was a unanimous All-American who could develop into a top pass-rushing option for the Patriots.\n\nAs for Sarratt, he would give Patriots quarterback Drake Maye another big-bodied playmaker to target downfield. He finished his collegiate run with 65 catches for 830 yards and 15 touchdowns. He earned Second-Team All-Big Ten honors and served a key role in Indiana's national championship run.\n\nIt's easy to forget that the Patriots are still a rebuilding team after their magical Super Bowl run this season.

He is under club control for one more season and can play third base, second base and shortstop. He is a versatile defender and won a Gold Glove in 2022 at third base.\n\nUrías is not the only Houston Astros infielder the Red Sox have been linked to. Isaac Paredes has been a rumored target as well. Urías had just a .675 OPS last season, hitting 11 home runs for the second consecutive season. Cotillo wrote more about Urías in a story published before his report.\n\n“Urías regressed with the bat last year to the tune of a .675 OPS in 112 games split between Baltimore and Houston but was still a capable defender at both third base (78 games) and second (26 games),” Cotillo wrote. “He also has historically hit very well at Fenway, logging a .326 average and an .881 OPS in 28 games in Boston.

    "title": "At Super Bowl Seahawks vice chair answer questions on team’s sale. Local buyers?",
    "description": "The News Tribune asks Seahawks vice chair Bert Kolde after NFL commissioner’s press conference about reports the team will be sold soon.",
    "fullText": "The sale of the Seahawks — the issue the team would rather not have the week of their first Super Bowl appearance in more than decade — isn’t going away.\n\n“We put out our statement. So I can’t say anything beyond that,” Seahawks vice chair Bert Kolde said Monday, after he and his wife sat in the front row representing the NFC champions at commissioner Roger Goodell’s annual state-of-the-NFL press conference at the Super Bowl.\n\nThe statement Kolde referred to Monday at the San Jose Convention Center was the Paul G. Allen Estate’s assertion Friday “the team is not for sale” — with “is” doing a ton of lifting there. The estate’s statement also reiterated the estate that owns the Seahawks dictates the team must be sold. Most of the proceeds will go to Allen’s many philanthropic interests before his death in 2018. The Paul G. Allen Estate issued that statement through a spokesman Friday. That was soon after ESPN and The Wall Street Journal reported the Seahawks would be sold soon after this season ended with Seattle’s Super Bowl.\n\nMoments before Kolde spoke Monday, Goodell said in his press conference a report this past weekend by The Wall Street Journal that the league fined the Seahawks $5 million for continuing to violate NFL rules by having an estate and not an individual person or group of people own a club is not true.\n\nThis much we know: The Seahawks’ sale is going to happen. It’s not a matter of if, not when.\n\nAnd signs are pointing to the when being in the months following the Super Bowl.\n\nKolde said he, chair Jody Allen, other leaders from Vulcan, LLC, the company Paul Allen formed to manage the Seahawks have studied the recent sales of North American sports franchises. That includes the NBA’s Boston Celtics (for $6 billion), the Los Angeles Lakers (a record $10 billion) and the most recent sale of an NFL team. That was the Washington Commanders, for $6.05 billion in 2023.\n\n“We study all teams, all the sales. That’s something we keep abreast of,” the Seahawks’ vice chair said.\n\nThe Allen Estate put the Portland Trail Blazers up on sale in September. Kolde said Monday he expects that sale to be final this spring. It’s about to go to a group led by the owner of the National Hockey League’s Carolina Hurricanes for a reported $4.25 billion.\n\n“Still tracking to close in a couple months,” Kolde said.\n\nWith the Blazers sale closing, it makes sense (and billions of dollars) that the Seahawks are next.\n\nThe Seahawks are most likely going to set an NFL record for a franchise sale, perhaps in excess of $8 billion.\n\nThe News Tribune asked Kolde off the stage following Goodell’s 45-minute press conference Monday if the Seahawks already have local buyers on the horizon to sell to.\n\n“Nothing to add,” Kolde said to that.\n\nIs there is anything in the estate’s instructions for the sale of the Seahawks that assures the franchise remains in Seattle? A stipulation it must be sold to local owners? A contract from whoever buys the team that binds them to keep the Seahawks in the city?\n\nTo that, Kolde referenced the team’s 30-year lease with Lumen Field runs through 2031. He did not comment on the 20-year option the team has with the stadium and the local government district that runs it beyond 2031.\n\n“l’m not going to get into all of that, all of that detail,” Kolde said.\n\n“But the Allen family put a lot into saving the Seahawks, keeping them in Seattle (by Paul Allen buying the team in 1997 from Ken Behring, who tried to move the team to Southern California). We campaigned around the state (for the new stadium that opened in 2002 and replaced the Kingdome). The voters agreed with us. And we put together Lumen Field.\n\n“And we delivered on everything we promised in that campaign. The team. The stadium. Soccer balls were on our posters. The Sounders launched as the most successful MLS team. The World Cup is coming; we talked about World Cup back in that campaign.\n\n“So we’ve been all about sports in the community for decades. So the lease has six years or so...”\n\nLeague owners want the Seahawks to sell sooner than later, so they can learn the latest relative valuations of their teams in this post-COVID world with the league’s new media rights deals that provides $11 billion in annual revenue to the NFL. The league signed that a couple years ago.\n\nAsked if the NFL was pressuring the team to sell soon, Kolde said: “No comment on that.”\n\nKolde said Jody Allen will be at Super Bowl 60 Sunday against the New England Patriots at Levi’s Stadium in nearby Santa Clara.",

That's what the manager sees in me and I want to show that on the pitch.\"\n\nThe announcement of 22-year-old Mvuka's signing came eight minutes after the closure of the January transfer window.\n\nHowever, the Norwegian is no stranger to the Scottish champions, having played against them in the Conference League in 2022 for Bodo/Glimt, where he was a team-mate of Celtic winger Sebastian Tounekti.\n\nHe joined Lorient in 2023 but has made only five starts and 10 substitute appearances for the side sitting ninth in Ligue 1.\n\n\"Joel is a talented player who has a very good level of experience achieved at some really good clubs,\" O'Neill said.\n\n\"He will give the squad another option, he is very quick, able to play on both wings\"\n\nThe 20-year-old Arthur has made just three appearances for Premier League outfit Brentford, including two starts in his season's League Cup.\n\nHowever, O'Neill thinks the England youth international is \"an excellent player, with real attributes, good height, strength and speed\".\n\nHis arrival allows Stephen Welsh to return to Motherwell on loan after being recalled as cover during January.\n\nMeanwhile, Kenny heads for the side sitting third in League One having failed to become a first pick since O'Neill's return to Celtic.\n\nThe 22-year-old Irishman, signed in January 2024 from Shamrock Rovers, has played 22 times for Celtic this season, 12 of them starts, and scoring six times.\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "description": "Bad Bunny will perform during the halftime show at Super Bowl LX on Sunday afternoon in Santa Clara.",
    "fullText": "NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, despite significant criticism from plenty in Washington, is all for Bad Bunny’s halftime show this week at Super Bowl LX.\n\nGoodell was asked directly about Bad Bunny on Monday when he met with reporters ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl at Levi’s Stadium, and said plainly that he believes the Puerto Rican superstar will be able to “unite people” in the way that Super Bowl halftime performers of the past have.\n\n“Listen, Bad Bunny is, and I think that was demonstrated last night [at the Grammys], one of the great artists in the world. That’s one of the reasons we chose him,” Goodell said.\n\n“But the other reason is he understood the platform he was on, and that this platform is used to unite people and to be able to bring people together with their creativity, with their talent, and to be able to use this moment to do that. I think artists in the past have done that, I think Bad Bunny understands that, and I think he’ll have a great performance.”\n\nRoger Goodell is asked whether or not there will be any ICE enforcement operations at the Super Bowl and also addresses Bad Bunny's remarks about ICE at last night's Grammy Awards. pic.twitter.com/FxGcbiIbZP\n\n— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) February 2, 2026\n\nBad Bunny was the top global artist on Spotify for the fourth time in his career last year, and he won two Grammy awards on Sunday night, including Album of the Year, for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos.”\n\nQuickly after Bad Bunny was announced as the Super Bowl halftime show, plenty in President Donald Trump’s administration criticized the decision. Trump said he had “never heard of him,” and Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Mike Johnson (R-La.) called it a “terrible decision” in October. Johnson, however, then suggested that 83-year-old Lee Greenwood, famous for “God Bless the USA” do the show instead.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would be “all over” the Super Bowl.\n\n“They suck, and we’ll win,” Noem told right-wing podcast host Benny Johnson about her message to the NFL, via ESPN. “They won’t be able to sleep at night because they don’t know what they believe. And they’re so weak, we’ll fix it.”\n\nBad Bunny has been extremely outspoken about Trump and ICE. He mocked Trump in his “NEVAYoL” music video, where he had a Trump-like voice apologizing to immigrants, and he even declined to hold any concerts on his current world tour in the United States because “f***ing ICE could be outside [the concert].” He called out ICE after winning a Grammy award during an acceptance speech on Sunday night, too.\n\n“Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ICE out,” he said. “We’re not savages, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens, we are humans and we are Americans ... The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that’s more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.”\n\nBad Bunny says \"ICE OUT\" at the #Grammys and receives a massive standing ovation:\n\n\"We are not savage, we are not animals, we are not aliens, we are humans and we are Americans. The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love.… pic.twitter.com/IFzvguqdCR\n\n— Variety (@Variety) February 2, 2026\n\nBad Bunny is Puerto Rican, which makes him an American citizen.\n\nThe Bay Area Host Committee told local officials on Monday that there are no planned ICE operations for Super Bowl LX, according to The Athletic. Goodell was asked about that directly on Monday, but he sidestepped the ICE of it all. Security preparations, he said, are moving forward as normal.\n\n“Security is obviously one of the things we focus on the most,” Goodell said. “It’s a tier one level event that involves unique assets at the federal level, the state level and the local level all working together. I see no change in that in the preparations for the Super Bowl … The federal government is a big part of that, including this administration and every other administration before that.”",

    "description": "A low-key transfer deadline day ended with the fewest Premier League deals completed in a winter window. BBC Sport looks at the spending that was done, and examines why there was so little activity.",
    "fullText": "The Premier League had its quietest ever winter transfer deadline day as just seven deals were completed on Monday.\n\nNot a single arrival was confirmed until 19:04 GMT - four minutes after the window in the English top flight closed - with Crystal Palace announcing the signing of striker Jorgen Strand Larsen from Wolves in a deal worth up to £48m.\n\nClubs can make signings for up to two hours after the official deadline, as long as a deal sheet is submitted before 19:00 to provide extra time for the necessary paperwork to be completed.\n\nThere were five further deals confirmed after the deadline - among them, Sunderland brought in Ecuador winger Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht in a deal worth £17.5m, while Wolves signed midfielder Angel Gomes from Marseille on loan and replaced Strand Larsen with Adam Armstrong from Wolves for £7m.\n\nThat took the overall spending in the Premier League during the winter window to more than £390m.\n\nLiverpool did agree a deal on deadline day to sign defender Jeremy Jacquet from Rennes, but that move - and the payment of the £60m fee - won't happen until the summer.\n\nAll the done deals on deadline day in one place\n\nTwo club-record signings - but are Palace papering over the cracks?\n\nThe day's two big talking points involved Crystal Palace - Strand Larsen's arrival from Wolves and the calling off of fellow striker Jean-Philippe Mateta's move to AC Milan because of issues with his medical.\n\nOtherwise, it was a day largely devoid of transfer drama as none of the top-six clubs did any business.\n\nOne of the more interesting moves was a Premier League exit, as former England midfielder Kalvin Phillips moved from Manchester City to Championship side Sheffield United on loan for the rest of the season.\n\nThat move comes four years after City signed Phillips from Leeds in a deal worth £45m.\n\nOther deals confirmed late on included Nottingham Forest's signing of Borussia Monchengladbach defender Luca Netz, Chelsea winger Tyrique George's move on loan to Everton for the rest of the season, while Tottenham and Arsenal both announced an academy signing.\n\nA record £3.1bn was spent by Premier League clubs in the summer - significantly more than in the winter window.\n\nThe figure of £397m for this window isn't hugely down on previous winters, with January always more low key than the summer as it is a notoriously difficult time for clubs to recruit effectively.\n\nIt is even harder to do that on deadline day, but this one was particularly quiet, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe big outlay last summer will be one, while another could relate to a new system of Financial Fair Play (FFP) that will come in from next season.\n\nSquad Cost Ratio (SCR) will replace Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), meaning overall squad costs in the Premier League from 2026-27 will have to be limited to 85% of a club's revenue.\n\n\"There's always going to be a degree of anxiety as to keeping your financial house in order ahead of a far more active market [the summer window],\" Paul Macdonald of FootballTransfers.com said.\n\n\"Clubs wanted to ensure they were in a compliant position rather than having an additional headache of being hamstrung under the new rules.\"\n\nManchester City made the biggest moves in this window as they looked to give themselves the best chance of challenging Arsenal for the Premier League title.\n\nThey signed forward Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth for £64m on 9 January, while defender Marc Guehi joined from Crystal Palace for £20m on 16 January.\n\n\"The scenario now is Manchester City are chasing down Arsenal and the points gap is getting a little bit bigger, so you need those players who are ready to go and know what the intensity of this Premier League is like,\" former England and Manchester City defender Steph Houghton told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\n\"It's been a smart move from the club in terms of getting Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo. They've slotted in really well, which is testament to them.\"\n\nCrystal Palace's deadline day move for Strand Larsen meant they spent £83m in the winter window, having signed Brennan Johnson for £35m from Tottenham.\n\nAston Villa - who are third - were the only other top-six side to pay out transfer fees during the winter window. They spent £18.25m on bringing back striker Tammy Abraham from Besiktas and £10.5m on winger Alysson from Gremio.\n\nPremier League leaders Arsenal did no business during the winter window, with Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool - fourth, fifth and sixth respectively - also quiet.\n\nWhile Manchester City spent money to bolster their squad for a title fight, at the other end of the table West Ham splashed out in a bid to avoid relegation to the Championship.\n\nThe Hammers, who are third from bottom and six points adrift of safety, spent a reported £21.8m on Brazilian striker Pablo Felipe from Portuguese club Gil Vicente and around £25m on striker Taty Castellanos from Lazio.\n\nTottenham, who are 14th, spent £35m on signing midfielder Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid, while Bournemouth used some of their money from the Semenyo sale to sign teenage striker Rayan from Vasco da Gama for £24.7m and Hungary midfielder Alex Toth for £10.4m from Ferencvaros.\n\nDespite a quiet deadline day, Premier League clubs still spent more overall in the winter window than sides in other major European leagues.\n\nThe next-biggest spending league was Serie A, with their clubs paying out a combined £205m in transfer fees.\n\nSassuolo were one of the most active Italian clubs, paying £22m for Marseille duo Ismael Kone and Darryl Bakola.\n\nIn Spain, the transfer window closed at 22:59 GMT, but La Liga business was quiet, with Atletico Madrid's £30m deal for Ademola Lookman more than was spent be the rest of the division's clubs combined (£20.3m).\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "It’s Colorado Avalanche gameday!",
    "fullText": "The Colorado Avalanche and Detroit Red Wings are set to meet for the second time in just three days, this time at Ball Arena in downtown Denver, CO. This quick turnaround and second game of a home-and-home should make for some unsettled tension after the first installment featured extracurriculars and a stellar performance from MacKenzie Blackwood, who logged the shutout. Will the Avalanche beat their old rival yet again? Or will the Wings steal one at a mile high?\n\nThe Opponent: Detroit Red Wings (24-21-7)\n\nWatch: Altitude, Altitude+, ESPN+\n\nListen: Altitude Sports Radio, 92.5 FM\n\nThe Avalanche is an interesting group right now with a litany of injuries and what feels like waning interest at times, all resulting in the first real dip in success.\n\nThey looked plenty interested last time out, and leading the way in that regard was Nathan MacKinnon, who is undoubtedly getting all tuned up and ready for his appearance at this year’s Winter Olympics in Milan, Italy.\n\nA 5-0 shutout is just about as ideal as a scoreline can be, but make no mistake, even MacKinnon told Erik Johnson on the ABC broadcast that, “It was more competitive than the scoreline showed.”\n\nNate absolutely COOKED EJ 😂 pic.twitter.com/UHl7JZWqkh\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) January 31, 2026\n\nSpeaking of MacKinnon, he is just one assist shy of logging his 700th career apple so keep an eye on that this evening. EJ has clarified that he did not get a spray tan but leaned toward being too tan rather than too pale when giving the makeup artist instructions ahead of the broadcast. I don’t buy it.\n\nArtturi Lehkonen — Nathan MacKinnon — Valeri Nichushkin\nRoss Colton — Brock Nelson — Valeri Nichushkin\nParker Kelly — Jack Drury — Gavin Brindley\nTaylor Makar — Zakhar Bardakov — Joel Kiviranta\n\nSam Malinski — Cale Makar\nJosh Manson — Brent Burns\nKeaton Middleton — Samuel Girard\n\nMacKenzie Blackwood\nScott Wedgewood\n\nThe Wings are a solid club and feel like a playoff team this season, despite not showing much of that in Saturday’s game. Getting to the playoffs would mean ending a nine-year drought in Detroit and would do a lot to validate the work being done by management and coaches alike. Todd MacLellan’s mid-season hire (last year) still looks like a solid move from Steve Yzerman and company.\n\nEtched in history.\n\nPatrick Kane on the mic for point 1375. 🗣️ pic.twitter.com/KON0c2aQUI\n\n— Detroit Red Wings (@DetroitRedWings) January 30, 2026\n\nDetroit’s captain Dylan Larkin called Saturday’s loss a “bump in the road,” and spoke about the Avalanche being beatable and having lots to play for in tonight’s rematch. We shall see how that turns out!\n\nMarco Kasper — Dylan Larkin — Lucas Raymond\nAlex DeBrincat — Andrew Copp — Patrick Kane\nEmmitt Finnie — J.T.

    "description": "We ask Miami Dolphins fans for their biggest concerns surrounding the new staff.",
    "fullText": "Being a Miami Dolphins fan for any period of time comes with the built-in expectation of almost always having concerns about the team, be it the general manager, scouting, coaching, or players. Between the poor execution of their jobs on the field and just stupid, unnecessary scandals off the field, it has often seemed as if there were more periods of just being overall bummed by the team and whatever stupid thing was happening with them than periods we could celebrate. In recent times, we can only point to epic comebacks, a 70-point game against a bad Denver Broncos team, or an individual accomplishment by a single player as things to celebrate. Either way, there is always something to be concerned about, but with each new regime we are at least given a bit of light at the end of the tunnel…maybe…until it’s snatched away again.\n\nSo with that big ole’ pile of joy this evening’s Phinsider Question Of The Day is:\n\nNow that our Miami Dolphins have hired the new GM and nearly filled out the entire coaching staff, what concerns do you still have about either or both? Is it an individual coach that you believe could hold the team back, or is there another concern about the new makeup of the front office or the coaching staff as a whole? Or…maybe you think this is nearly perfect for what we want to see. Please let us know that and why as well.\n\nPlease share your thoughts and answers in the comments section below-",

    "description": "We’re into February, so the battle in the standings is starting to heat up in America’s favorite basketball conference!",
    "fullText": "For a moment, I was looking at this week’s Big East basketball schedules and it was starting to look like maaaybe there weren’t really that many intriguing games on deck. Then I realized that we’re past the halfway point or further even for everyone in the league, and things are Starting To Get Important relative to fighting to avoid playing on the opening night of the conference tournament. As it happens, there’s more than a couple of games that fit the bill of “oh, well, that’s important to the 5th place/6th place cut line right now.”\n\nPlus a ranked on ranked game in the men’s division! That’s actually nationally important!\n\nWednesday, February 4: Seton Hall Pirates at Villanova Wildcats (5:30pm Central, Peacock) — Seton Hall has stemmed the tide of a complete collapse with a massive rally second half against Xavier and fending off a challenge from Marquette. However, the four game losing streak might have broken their NCAA hopes unless they can match it with quality wins, and at The Finn against a Nova team seemingly ticketed for the Dance is exactly that. Kevin Willard’s Wildcats can’t exactly afford to cough up a loss here, not with the Torvik Wins Above Bubble bracket slotting them in as a #8 seed.\n\nWednesday, February 4: Georgetown Hoyas at Creighton Bluejays (6pm Central, ESPN+) — This is one half of an important week for Jim Flanery’s Bluejays as they come off a very good road win over Seton Hall on Sunday. They’re a game behind St. John’s for fifth place (and thus one of the byes in the first round of the Big East tournament) in the league, and a game ahead of the Hoyas team as well. Creating space between themselves and Georgetown is as easy as winning at Sokol right here.\n\nWednesday, February 4: Creighton Bluejays at Georgetown Hoyas (6:30pm Central, Peacock) — The Bluejays needed overtime to down Georgetown at home, and they’re just 1-3 since then, needing a miracle break against Xavier to get the win and getting absolutely run over by both UConn (fine) and Marquette (uh oh) in the losses. There’s not much of a hope for the NCAA tournament in Omaha any more, but a loss here would probably finish them off…. and if that’s the case…. are we seeing the beginning of the end for Greg McDermott as head coach at Creighton?\n\nFriday, February 6: Connecticut Huskies at St. John’s Red Storm (7pm Central, Fox) — This will be the first of two meetings this season between the two teams that were considered to be the top two teams in the conference heading into the year. To this point, they’ve separated themselves atop the standings at 11-0 and 9-1, and with the Johnnies holding the loss, the onus is on them to win at home here to create a race for the regular season title down the stretch.\n\nSaturday, February 7: Butler Bulldogs at #1 Connecticut Huskies (11am Central, FS1) — Presuming that Sarah Strong’s squad gets through a road game against last place DePaul just fine on Wednesday, UConn could be playing to clinch a spot in the top five of the league in this game and thus avoid the opening day tripleheader of the conference tournament. That would be with six games left in the conference slate for the Huskies, and I say “could” because it’s possible that they get help on Wednesday from Georgetown to clinch it anyway.\n\nSaturday, February 7: Butler Bulldogs at Marquette Golden Eagles (1pm Central, FS1) — Butler followed up their home win over Marquette by getting trampled at The Garden by St. John’s and then getting shunted into the Negative Zone by Georgetown. Five points in the final 6+ minutes after cutting a margin to four! At home! How much will the National Marquette Day crowd gas up the Golden Eagles at Fiserv Forum here?\n\nSaturday, February 7: Seton Hall Pirates at St. John’s Red Storm (1pm Central, ESPN+) — This is the only game of the week for Savannah Catalon’s Pirates and they come in having lost two of the last three. One was to UConn, but the other was to Creighton at home. St. John’s is trying to stay in the top five of the Big East standings (and thus out of the conference tournament opening tripleheader) with just a one game lead over Creighton right now, so they can make a lot of noise with a win here. Oh, and Seton Hall’s next game, as they try to maintain a hold on third place in the league? Marquette, the team they are currently tied with in the standings.\n\nSaturday, February 7: DePaul Blue Demons at Providence Friars (3pm Central, FS1) — The Friars have lost six of seven and host Butler and DePaul this week. Think of this one as the second half of the Kim English Keep Your Job Challenge. Difficulty Level: Hard.\n\nSaturday, February 7: Seton Hall Pirates at Creighton Bluejays (5pm Central, Peacock) — All the stuff I said earlier about Budd Clark’s Pirates and Josh Dix’s Bluejays? Goes double here, especially with it being the second of two road games this week for the Pirates.\n\nSunday, February 8: Marquette Golden Eagles at Creighton Bluejays (12pm Central, FS1) — Here’s the other half of an important week for Creighton, as they get Cara Consuegra’s inconsistent (but tied for third!) Golden Eagles in Omaha. If the Jays want to make a play to get one of those five first round byes in the conference tournament, they could do a lot worse than closing the current three-game gap with MU right here. Meanwhile, Halle Vice and Marquette still haven’t found a way to start playing clean basketball for 40 straight minutes, and they have to get through a home game against Providence before making this trip to somewhere in middle America.\n\nHere’s the full Big East men’s basketball schedule for the week, with all times Central, as always.\n\n#3 Connecticut at #22 St. John’s\n\nHere’s the full Big East women’s basketball schedule for the week, with all times Central, as always.\n\nFollow Anonymous Eagle on social media\n\nFacebook: AnonymousEagle\nInstagram: AnonymousEagleSBN\nBluesky: AnonymousEagle",

After ending his college career at Kansas, Robinson was picked up with the fifth overall selection of the 2012 NBA Draft by the Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe Thomas Robinson native played the first 51 games of his pro career with Sacramento. He would also play for the Houston Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers, and Philadelphia 76ers before he signed with Brooklyn in 2015. His stay with the team lasted until he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2016.\n\nDuring his time suiting up for the Nets, Robinson wore only jersey No. 41 and put up 4.3 points and 5.1 rebounds per game.\n\nAll stats and data courtesy of Basketball Reference.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nets Wire: Nets jersey history No. 41 - Thomas Robinson (2015-16)",

If they don't make what I would call a Hail Mary Giannis deal, I think they are aggressively looking to upgrade their backcourt.\"\n\nShams Charania also appeared on ESPN and shared the same reports that Minnesota is indeed one of the most aggressive teams in the NBA when it comes to acquiring Antetokounmpo.\n\nJackson reported that the Miami Heat are expected to offer an extensive trade package for Antetokounmpo. The offer is anticipated to be Tyler Herro, Kel'el Ware, Terry Rozier, young players, 2 1st-round picks and 3 pick swaps, per Jackson. If the Bucks do happen to acquire Rozier, they will have to pay his entire 25-26 salary.\n\nA day after The Athletic reported that the Knicks are inquiring about Antetokounmpo, ESPN's Brian Windhorst said on \"Get Up\" Monday morning that, \"The Knicks believe in this team.. They believed in this team last summer when Giannis was loosely available in those discussions. They didn't make an aggressive offer at the time of those talks. If they want to win a bidding war now, i think its going to take a 3 or 4 team trade.... That is just not happening. They are not showing that aggression to get Giannis right now and I think thats because they like this team.\"\n\nWhile other teams have been mentioned far more often, the Trail Blazers are among the franchises interested in Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, The Oregonian reports. The report adds that new owner Tom Dundon is ready and willing to take big swings to win, which makes Portland a wild card in the Antetokounmpo sweepstakes even if a deal might cost All-Star Deni Avdija.\n\nThe Kings still have salary cap concerns despite an abysmal 12-39 record, and ESPN reports that has prompted Sacramento explore trades involving Zach LaVine, Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, and Malik Monk. The Kings acquired De’Andre Hunter from the Cavaliers on Saturday.\n\nThe Knicks are one of the teams inquiring about Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, The Athletic reports, but the Knicks’ inability to fully match what Milwaukee is demanding — premier young players and high draft picks — is a hurdle.\n\nKnicks big man Karl-Anthony Towns is still a trade candidate despite New York’s recent resurgence, The Athletic reports. Towns hasn’t been extended and reportedly has had some hard feelings ever since his name surfaced in Giannis Antetokounmpo trade talks in the offseason.\n\nThe Knicks have “long been trying to find a new home” for forward Guerschon Yabusele, who has struggled since signing in the offseason. Yabusele could need draft assets attached to him to be dealt, The Athletic reports.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks are trading guard Vit Krejci to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Duop Reath and two future second-round selections. The move gives the Hawks the ability to free up roster space, and Atlanta now possesses seven upcoming second-round picks.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers are trading De'Andre Hunter to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Dennis Schroder and Keon Ellis. This transaction involves three teams: the Chicago Bulls acquire Kings forward Dario Saric and two future second-round draft picks. Additionally, the Bulls are waiving guard Jevon Carter to make room for Saric, according to sources. They also acted as a third team and acquired assets to complete the trade.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks are trading four-time NBA All-Star Trae Young to the Washington Wizards in exchange for CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert. The Hawks kick off the trade deadline season with a bang.\n\nCJ McCollum (G) - traded from Wizards\n\nCorey Kispert (F) - traded from Wizards\n\nDuop Reath (C) - traded from Trail Blazers\n\nDario Saric (F) - traded from Kings\n\nDennis Schroder (G) -  traded from Kings\n\nKeon Ellis (G) -  traded from Kings\n\nVit Krejci (G) - traded from Hawks\n\nDe'Andre Hunter (F) - traded from Cavs\n\nTrae Young (G) - traded from Hawks\n\nThe 2026 NBA trade deadline is at 3 p.m. ET on Thursday, Feb. 5.\n\nIt is important to note that the deadline is 3 p.m. ET and whatever corresponding time that is for teams in other time zones. All trades must be agreed upon and submitted to the NBA office by 3 p.m. ET.\n\nMORE: Relive the Lakers' two legendary trades deadline moves",

    "fullText": "The 2026 college football recruiting cycle will officially end Wednesday, but the 2027 crop is already off to a roaring start with a half-dozen five-star recruits already committed.\n\nThe latest, No. 1 running back Kemon Spell, chose Georgia over Penn State, Notre Dame and dozens of other offers on Monday. The former Nittany Lions commit is pledge No. 6 in this cycle for Kirby Smart and Co. and gives the Bulldogs a huge piece to build around — both on the trail and on the field in upcoming years.\n\nWith Spell now committed, six of the nation’s five-star prospects are already off the board in the 2027 cycle. All six are top-15 prospects nationally, with three ranking as the top player at their positions.\n\nBelow is a look at the six committed five-stars in the 2027 cycle, as of Feb. 2:\n\nSchool: McKeesport (McKeesport, PA)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 3 NATL. (No. 1 RB)\n\nScouting Summary: All-encompassing running back that can win with power and elusiveness on inside and outside runs. 5-foot-9, 200-plus pounds with tremendous twitch and leg drive. Plays with low pad level and an excellent center of gravity in order to deliver blows and take them himself. Has breakaway speed in order to hit the homerun. Ran sub-11 in the 100m during his sophomore track season. Shows the ability to catch the ball away from his frame as a pass catcher. Has all the physical and athletic tools to make an immediate impact at the next level and beyond. Younger prospect for the cycle.”\n\nSchool: Cedar Hill (Texas)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 6 NATL. (No. 1 DL)\n\nScouting Summary: “Uber-athletic defensive line prospect with true game-wrecking ability. Measured in at around 6-foot-3, 300 pounds prior to his junior season. Tests as an elite athlete in the combine setting, easily cracking 5.0 seconds in the 40-yard dash. Carries that athleticism over to the field where he has flashes of dominance on Friday nights. Lines up all over the defensive line for Cedar Hill (Texas) while facing top competition. Dangerous pass rusher from any spot. Combines explosive get-off with the movement skills of a much smaller player, carrying elite testing numbers directly onto the field. Consistently collapses pockets and disrupts plays before they develop.\n\n…Has legitimate game-wrecking moments on film. The quickness to dart into the backfield and the speed to hunt down ball carriers is eye-popping. May not possess premier length. Father was a third-round pick by the Dallas Cowboys. Tracking as the top defensive line prospect early on in the 2027 cycle with the upside to be an early NFL Draft pick.”\n\nSchool: Brother Martin (La.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 7 NATL. (No. 1 WR)\n\nScouting Summary: “The most dynamic pass-catcher early in the 2027 cycle and a threat to score every time he touches the ball. Measured at around 5-foot-11, 185 pounds prior to his junior season. One of the fastest top prospects in the cycle, running a scintillating 10.3-second mark in the 100 meters as a sophomore. Brings that elite speed to the gridiron—lethal on vertical routes, easily pulling away from defensive backs downfield. Tough to tackle in the open field and will take it the distance if he finds space at the second level. Shows natural shiftiness as a route-runner, giving him the ability to separate at every level. Among the more productive top wide receivers in the 2027 cycle as a junior.\n\n…Can continue improving his ability to attack catches with his arms extended, but has shown an expanded catch radius with several highlight-reel grabs. One of the youngest top prospects in the class with a late July birthday prior to his freshman season of college football. Athleticism, budding polish, and big-play ability make him one of the top overall playmakers in the cycle with the potential to develop into a first-round NFL Draft pick.”\n\nSchool: Blessed Trinity Catholic (Ga.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 10 NATL. (No. 2 EDGE)\n\nAbout: Jacobs has long been one of the most feared pass-rushers in Georgia. The UGA legacy tallied 102 total tackles in 11 games this fall and is now near 300 for his prep career. He piled up 16 sacks as a junior for BTC and has established himself as one of the premier defensive prospects in the nation, regardless of class. He chose Ohio State over Texas A&M and Miami. Jacobs is the top-ranked junior in the Peach State.\n\nSchool: Wayne (Ohio)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 12 NATL. (No. 3 WR)\n\nAbout: The five-star pass-catcher has already been committed to Ohio State for over a year. He made his pledge on Nov. 23, 2024 and has shown no signs of backing off since, even with the departure of Brian Hartline. The Buckeyes inked five-star WR Chris Henry Jr. after a long-standing commitment and they’ll now hope to do the same with Brown. He’s the top-ranked prospect in Ohio.\n\nSchool: Fort Gibson (Okla.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 13 NATL. (No. 3 OT)\n\nScouting Summary: “Hyper-athletic offensive tackle prospect with rare natural movement skills and a frame that points to immense long-term upside as one of the highest-ceiling linemen early in the 2027 cycle. Measured around 6-foot-7, 260 pounds with elite length (arms over 34 inches) and big hands prior to his junior season. Has the frame to add significant mass once in a college strength program. Lines up at right tackle for his high school, where his athletic traits immediately stand out. Moves with rare fluidity for his size and plays with surprising power through his lower half, generating torque and leverage at the point of attack. Shows balance and body control that project well to the next level. Displays loose flexibility and consistently lowers his pads to handle shorter defenders. Plays with a physical edge and looks to finish blocks through the whistle.\n\n…Further showcases his athleticism as a disruptive defensive end. Doubles as a talented basketball player on the high school and AAU circuit who can run the court and play above the rim. Will need to add considerable mass and adjust to stronger competition at the next level, which could delay early playing time. Possesses an outstanding developmental profile with the big frame, movement skills, and multi-sport coordination that give him the upside to develop into an early-round NFL Draft pick.”",

    "fullText": "The Golden State Warriors have had over 600 players don the more than 60 jersey numbers used by their players over the more than 75 years of existence the team has enjoyed in its rich and storied history.\n\nFounded in 1946 during the Basketball Association of America (BAA – a precursor league of the NBA) era, the team has called home the cities of Philadelphia, San Francisco, Oakland, and even San Diego.\n\nTo commemorate the players who wore those numbers, Warriors Wire is covering the entire history of jersey numbers and the players who sported them since the founding of the team. For this article, we begin with the third of nine players who wore the No. 43 jersey for the Warriors.\n\nThat player would be Golden State forward alum Larry McNeill. After ending his college career at Marquette, McNeill was picked up with the 25th overall selection of the 1973 NBA Draft by the (then) Kansas City-Omaha (now, Sacramento) Kings.\n\nThe Hoke, North Carolina native played the first three seasons of his pro career with the Kings. He would also play for (then) New York (now, Brooklyn) Nets, before he signed with the Dubs in 1977. His stay with the team lasted until he was cut by the team that fall.\n\nDuring his time suiting up for the Warriors, McNeill wore only jersey No. 43 and put up 4.5 points and 2.5 rebounds per game\n\nAll stats and data courtesy of Basketball Reference.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Warriors jersey history - No. 43 - Larry McNeill (1977)",

    "fullText": "Quantizing attention improves efficiency on two fronts: the model has\nhigher compute throughput, and loads fewer bytes per key/value. However,\ntraining with block quantized attention can break causal modeling. We\npresent a fix that enables training with MXFP4 in both attention and the\nattention gradient.\n\nIn causal language modeling, the final logits at position ii must depend only on tokens at positions\n≤i\\le i. Future leakage\nis when information from positions >i>i may influence the logits at position\nii. It poses an issue because it causes\na skew between training and decode. In typical setups, causal masks\nprevent leakage in attention. But block quantization can introduce a\nsubtle new path for future leakage.\n\nModern accelerators require using block-quantized matrix\nmultiplications for highest throughput. To use these instructions to\ncompute A×BA \\times B, the row vectors of\nAA and column vectors of BB must be split into blocks of size kk and quantized. The specific value of kk depends on the format being used. For\nexample, the microscaling formats use k=32k=32.\n\nWithin a block, let x0,x1,…,xk−1x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{k-1} denote the precise (unquantized) elements. When\nquantizing, we approximate each element xix_i with a quantized value qiq_i and a scale ss shared across the block: xi≈qi⋅sx_i \\approx q_i \\cdot s\n\nThere are various approaches to selecting ss with different tradeoffs. But in general\nthey choose an ss with a function of all\nelements in the block.\n\nGiven ss, the quantized elements\nare:\n\nqi=round(xis)q_i = \\text{round}\\left(\\frac{x_i}{s}\\right)\n\nWith this procedure, ss and\nconsequently qiq_i depend on\nall the pre-quantized elements in the block. So if the\nquantization block spans across different token positions, quantization\nenables the later tokens in the block to influence earlier tokens.\n\nCausal attention for a single head takes queries Q\\mathbf{Q}, keys K\\mathbf{K}, and values V\\mathbf{V} as inputs, and produces:\n\nP=softmax(Q×KT+M)output=P×V\\begin{array}{lcl} \\mathbf{P} & = & \\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{Q} \\times \\mathbf{K}^T + \\mathbf{M}) \\\\ \\text{output} & = & \\mathbf{P} \\times \\mathbf{V} \\end{array}\n\nwhere M\\mathbf{M} is the causal\nmask.\n\nOur goal is to use block-quantized matrix multiplications for Q×KT\\mathbf{Q} \\times \\mathbf{K}^T and P×V\\mathbf{P} \\times \\mathbf{V}. So Q\\mathbf{Q} and K\\mathbf{K} need to be quantized in blocks\nformed along the head dimension, while P\\mathbf{P} and V\\mathbf{V} need to be quantized in blocks\nformed along different token positions.\n\nQuantizing P\\mathbf{P} is safe\ndespite blocking along token positions, since the causal mask zeros out\nfuture probabilities. However, the quantized V\\mathbf{V} at position jj can depend on values at positions >j> j, which can cause future leakage.\n\nConsider query position ii and value\nposition jj, with block indices:\n\nbi=⌊ik⌋,bj=⌊jk⌋b_i = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{i}{k} \\right\\rfloor, \\quad b_j = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{j}{k} \\right\\rfloor\n\nLeakage occurs when query position ii\nand value position jj share a\nquantization block position (bi=bjb_i = b_j):\n\nbi=bjb_i = b_j\n(block-diagonal): query ii\nattends to value jj if j≤ij \\le i. But the quantized value at jj is computed from all positions in\nthe block (including positions greater than ii). This breaks causality since the attention\noutput at position ii can depend on\npositions greater than ii.\n\nbi>bjb_i > b_j (past\nblocks): All positions in block bjb_j precede the first position in block bib_i. No leakage.\n\nbi<bjb_i < b_j (future\nblocks): The causal mask zeros P[i,j]\\mathbf{P}[i,j] for j>ij > i. No leakage.\n\nLeakage only occurs when the ii-th block-diagonal tile of P\\mathbf{P} is multiplied with the ii-th quantized block of V\\mathbf{V}. So we can prevent future leakage\n\nV\\mathbf{V} when multiplying the\nii-th tile of P\\mathbf{P} with the ii-th block of V\\mathbf{V}, while using block quantized\nmatrix multiplications everywhere else.\n\nTo validate this fix, we trained a pair of 1B-parameter models on the\nC4 dataset, with MXFP4 for attention and the attention gradient. Both\nmodels share the following configuration:\n\nWe trained a “Leaky” model that used MXFP4 for all of P×V\\mathbf{P} \\times \\mathbf{V}, and a “Fixed”\nmodel that used the proposed solution.\n\nThe Fixed model remained well behaved throughout training. However,\nthe Leaky model had training dynamics associated with future leakage:\nthe grad norms grew rapidly before the loss started to improve\nsuspiciously fast.\n\nTo confirm that the Leaky model was only doing better because of\nfuture leakage, we evaluated loss in two modes on a heldout set. In\nparallel mode, we ran prefill once per sequence. In autoregressive mode,\nwe averaged the loss for generating the sequence one token at a\ntime.\n\nDespite the Leaky model’s parallel loss being lower than the Fixed\nmodel’s, the autoregressive loss was worse. The Leaky model’s gap in\nloss between parallel and autoregressive modes indicates that it was\nreliant on future signal. The Fixed model had no gap, demonstrating our\nsolution worked.\n\nThe Leaky model’s parallel mode was using quantization error to\nencode information about upcoming tokens. Padding a block with zeros\n(like we do in autoregressive mode) won’t change the selected scale. But\nadding outliers to the end (which can happen in parallel mode) makes the\nscale larger. Larger scales can cause earlier values to underflow.\n\nExample where a future outlier causes the second value to\nunderflow.\n\nThe model can use whether earlier values in a block underflowed to\ninfer something about upcoming tokens.\n\nWe hope the methodology here provides a starting point for\nresearchers interested in quantizing attention during training. In\nfuture work, we aim to demonstrate that quantized attention can match\nthe quality of float baselines while still providing end-to-end\nspeedups.\n\nIf these research problems sound interesting, consider working with us!",

    "fullText": "The developer of the popular open source text editor Notepad++ has confirmed that hackers hijacked the software to deliver malicious updates to users over the course of several months in 2025.\n\nIn a blog post published Monday, Notepad++ developer Don Ho said that the cyberattack was likely carried out by hackers associated with the Chinese government between June and December 2025, citing multiple analyses by security experts who examined the malware payloads and attack patterns. Ho said this “would explain the highly selective targeting” seen during the campaign.\n\nRapid7, which investigated the incident, attributed the hacking to Lotus Blossom, a long-running espionage group known to work for China, and said the hacks targeted government, telecom, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media sectors.\n\nNotepad++ is one of the longest-running open source projects, spanning more than two decades, and it counts at least tens of millions of downloads to date, including by employees at organizations around the world.\n\nAccording to Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who first discovered the cyberattack and wrote up his findings in December, the hackers compromised a small number of organizations “with interests in East Asia” after someone unwittingly used a tainted version of the popular software. Beaumont said that the hackers were able to gain “hands-on” access to the computers of victims who were running hijacked versions of Notepad++.\n\nHo said that the “exact technical mechanism” of how the hackers broke into his servers remains under investigation, but provided some details as to how the attack went down.\n\nIn the blog, Ho said that Notepad++’s website was hosted on a shared hosting server. The attackers “specifically targeted” Notepad++’s web domain with the goal of exploiting a bug in the software to redirect some users to a malicious server run by the hackers. This allowed the hackers to deliver malicious updates to certain users who had requested a software update, until the bug was fixed in November and the hackers’ access was terminated in early December.\n\n“We do have logs indicating that the bad actor tried to re-exploit one of the fixed vulnerabilities; however, the attempt did not succeed after the fix was implemented,” wrote Ho.\n\nIn an email, Ho told TechCrunch that his hosting provider confirmed his shared server was compromised but that the provider did not say how the hackers initially broke in.\n\nHo apologized for the incident, and urged users to download the most recent version of his software, which contains a fix for the bug.\n\nThe cyberattack targeting Notepad++ users is somewhat reminiscent of the 2019-2020 cyberattack affecting customers of SolarWinds, a software company that makes IT and network management tools for large Fortune 500 organizations, including government departments. Russian government spies hacked into the company’s servers and secretly planted a backdoor in its software, allowing the Russian spies to access data on those customers’ networks once the update had rolled out.\n\nThe SolarWinds breach affected several government agencies, including Homeland Security and the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Justice, and State.\n\nUpdated with a response from Ho and with additional details from Rapid7.",

    "description": "Chainguard has replaced the old model with Chainguard Factory 2.0, a radical, AI-powered reimagining of its pipeline.",
    "fullText": "The new, revised Chainguard Factory 2.0 swaps out 1.0’s fragile, event-driven pipeline with a self-healing system powered by a new open source framework called DriftlessAF.\n\nLots of people love the software supply-chain security company Chainguard for its secure-by-design open-source components for today’s application stacks. Who doesn’t like components that come guaranteed to have the latest CVE fixes? These are built by a process called the Chainguard Factory. This is an automated build system that continuously updates Chainguard’s safe containers, libraries, and VMs with the latest security patches. There’s only one little problem. As originally built, the “Factory” had more than its fair share of bugs. The answer? Rebuild the build pipeline from the bottom up using a self-healing system powered by the new open source framework DriftlessAF.\n\nChainguard Factory’s job, according to Dustin Kirkland, Chainguard’s engineering SVP, is to constantly monitor and “build over 10,000 open source projects, and the moment that any upstream maintainer tags a new release, our automation springs into action—fetching that source code, checking the checksums, applying our build rules, rebuilding and recompiling that software, retesting that software at the package and unit level.”\n\nThat’s a huge, honking job. Chainguard now admits that their original Chainguard Factory 1.0 wasn’t up to the task. It was built on a traditional event-driven system. While functional at a smaller scale, the system became a loose confederation of fallible edge-triggered processes that struggled to keep pace with the depth and breadth of our catalog and our ambitious product promise: secure, up-to-date content with zero known CVEs.”\n\nThe result was a brittle system — “with DriftlessAF, we are moving away from complex, brittle processes,” the company writes on its blog — that was prone to errors, requiring subject matter experts (SMEs) to get their hands dirty to keep the programs running through the pipeline. This was, in a word, “unacceptable.”\n\nSo, Chainguard has replaced the old model with Chainguard Factory 2.0, a radical, AI-powered reimagining of its pipeline. This new model uses AI agents to run a reconciliation-driven drive. Factory 2.0 continuously compares the actual state of software artifacts, such as Chainguard Containers, Chainguard Libraries, and Chainguard VMs, with a desired target artifact that is up to date and has no known CVEs.\n\nSome of these agents are derived from an AI agent programming company named — sorry for the confusion, but there it is — Factory. According to the company, Chainguard “selected Factory for its compaction engine, which collapses sprawling changes into reviewable PRs.” This compaction engine saves context between programming sessions. In other words, to quote Josh Wolf, a Chainguard Staff Engineer, “There’s all this hype nowadays about the improving memory of different agents. When you don’t have to think about context windows, you can treat [Factory] Droid like a colleague that just remembers what you’ve been talking about.”\n\nChainguard Factory 2.0  works by using AI bots and agents to continuously track code changes. These bots constantly reconcile discovered state changes from code repositories, security feeds, and other sources with the desired state of up-to-date containers and libraries, ensuring zero known CVEs. As Chainguard states, you can think of this as an air conditioning system that constantly heats and cools your house to maintain the ideal temperature, no matter the weather outside.\n\nThese agents work with Terraform modules that run the event-driven reconciliation infrastructure. Go language programs then direct the agents, which run on Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude.\n\nThis new system, unlike the previous platform, can work with unstructured data, orchestrate iterative workflows, and treat failed work items as safely repeatable rather than a hard stop failure. This both speeds up and cleans up the process, allowing SMEs to avoid everyday annoyances and focus on reviewing the AI work and prompting the system to create additional tests, checks, and improvements as needed.\n\nThe end result, says Dan Lorenc, Chainguard co-founder and CEO, is “Factory. 2.0 is more than a factory. It’s a revolution. Our amazing engineering team is using AI to achieve remediation speeds we never thought possible. I’m talking about detecting and patching a vulnerability before upstream is even aware.”\n\nHe continues, “Our AI-powered pipeline is transforming raw source code into 1,000s of packages and assembling those into secure, compliant, and hardened container images at an unprecedented scale. But here’s the best part. AI powers it. Our engineers are available to help with the hard parts.”\n\nIt sounds promising. Now, the question is, “Will Chainguard Factory 2.0 and DriftlessAF live up to their promise?” There’s only one way to find out. Take them out, kick their tires, and let us know what you find.",

In a FAQ posted to Adobe’s website, the company says it will stop selling the animation software on March 1st, citing the emergence of new platforms “that better serve the needs of the users.”\n\nUsers have until March 1st, 2027 (or March 1st, 2029 for enterprise customers) to access and download files from Animate, as they’ll no longer be available after this time. The app will be available to download until those deadlines, and Adobe will continue providing support during that period.\n\nAdobe Animate’s history dates back to 1996, when FutureWave Software launched the vector graphics application, originally called FutureSplash Animator, as a tool to create vector-based animations. Though Macromedia acquired the tool later that year and renamed it Flash, Adobe purchased the company in 2005 and began calling the app Adobe Flash Professional. Adobe announced plans to rebrand the app to Adobe Animate in 2015 as the web began phasing out Flash.\n\nThough Adobe says Creative Cloud Pro customers can use other apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality,” such as Adobe After Effects or Adobe Express, many users who still use Animate are frustrated with its imminent shutdown. The creators behind the short-form animated series, Chikn Nuggit, write in a post on X that they still use Adobe Animate to make the show. “This decision would not only harm countless jobs in the industry but render so much past creations as lost media,” the post reads. David Firth, the creator of Salad Fingers, also says he still uses the app to make the grotesque series.\n\nMegacharlie, a technical artist for Jackbox Games, adds that the app “is used in many high-budget television cartoon productions, film and animation studios, game studios big and small, not to mention the 1000s of indie creators who still make use of it daily.”\n\nOver the past year, Adobe has made it clear that it’s focused on AI. The company has launched a slew ofAI-powered editing tools across its apps, and rolled out an AI audio tool to add soundtracks and voiceovers to videos. It’s also working on its own “IP-safe” Firefly AI models for the entertainment industry.",

    "description": "In one of the most baffling discoveries of the last decade, scientists have found a clue in a cave to how life might survive in deep space without light.",
    "fullText": "When cave biologist Hazel Barton ventured into the pitch darkness, the last thing she expected to find were organisms harnessing energy from light. This new understanding of photosynthesis in the dark, she realised, means life elsewhere in the Universe could exist in places we never thought possible.\n\n\"The wall was bright green. It was the most iridescent green you'd ever seen, and yet the microbes were living in complete darkness,\" says Barton, professor of geological sciences at the University of Alabama.\n\nBeneath the deep rocky canyons of the Chihuahuan Desert in southern New Mexico, lies a network of 119 caves. The caves, part of the Carlsbad Caverns National Park, formed four to 11 million years ago due to sulphuric acid dissolving the limestone rocks.\n\nThe primary attraction of the park is the show cave, Carlsbad Cavern. Here, glittering stalactites cling to the roof of the Big Room, a huge underground chamber measuring almost 4,000ft (1,220m) long and 625ft (191m) wide.\n\n\"The Carlsbad cavern is very easily accessible. It's a very large limestone cave that tourists can visit that has steps and ladders and everyone can go down,\" says Lars Behrendt, a microbial biologist at Uppsala University. Parts of the cave system, he adds, are even wheelchair accessible.\n\nAlmost 350,000 people visit Carlsbad cavern each year, yet most would be completely unaware that the cave is the setting to one of the most baffling scientific discoveries of the past decade.\n\nIn 2018, Behrendt had just finished his PhD. He had also won an academic prize, which awarded him some money. He contacted Barton and asked her if she would accompany him on an expedition. Luckily, she agreed.\n\n\"The first thing you do in the Carlsbad cave is you kind of go down on the tourist trail, and then you turn around a corner,\" says Barton. \"I don't know how many times I've done that trail, probably 40 times. At that point, you go around the corner, and then behind you there's an alcove, and it's completely black.\"\n\nFor more than 20 years, Barton has been studying microscopic life found deep underground. Yet what happened next was a surprise, even to her.\n\nBehrendt shone a torch on the wall. Although the alcove was pitch black, the light revealed a blanket of green microbes clinging to the wall. Later tests revealed they were cyanobacteria; single celled organisms related to bacteria. Unlike most bacteria, though, cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae) use light from the Sun to make food.\n\n\"We started going deeper and deeper into the cave,\" says Barton. \"Eventually we were a point where we couldn't see without using flashlights. We had to use a headlight to be able to see our hand in front of our face, and yet you could still see green pigment on the wall.\"\n\nPlants are green due to a chemical called chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy. In photosynthesis, this energy is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The process is much the same in cyanobacteria. Yet here, in the cave, there was no sunlight.\n\nIt turns out that the cyanobacteria in the cave have a special version of chlorophyll that can capture near-infrared light. This light has a longer wavelength than visible light, and appears just before infrared on the electromagnetic spectrum. It is undetectable to the human eye.\n\nWhile plants and cyanobacteria use chlorophyll a for photosynthesis, the cyanobacteria in the Carlsbad caves use chlorophyll d and f, which are able to generate energy from near-infrared light.\n\nAlthough visible light can only travel a few hundred feet into the caves, near-infrared can journey a lot further due to the reflective nature of the limestone rocks. \"The limestone rock that the cave is made of will absorb almost all visible light, but to near-infrared light, caves are pretty much a hall of mirrors,\" says Barton.\n\nIn fact, when the researchers measured the light in the back of the cave where it was darkest, they found the levels of near-infrared light were 695 times more concentrated than at the entrance. At the same time, while chlorophyll d and f containing cyanobacteria were present in all parts of the cave, they were particularly concentrated in the darkest and deepest places.\n\nThe researchers also hiked out to other caves in the Carlsbad Caverns National Park and tested other off-the-beaten-track caves and caverns. In each case they found photosynthesising microbes deep down underground.\n\n\"We showed that not only do they live down there, but that they photosynthesise in a completely sheltered environment where they've probably been untouched for 49 million years,\" says Behrendt.\n\nBarton and Behrendt aren't the only scientists to find microbes able to live in the dark.\n\nIn 1890, pioneering Ukrainian-Russian microbiologist Sergei Nikolaevich Vinogradskii discovered that some microbes could live solely on inorganic matter – using a process called chemosynthesis. These microbes gain energy through chemical reactions, taking chemicals such as methane or hydrogen sulphide from surrounding rocks and water.\n\nIn 1996, Hideaki Miyashita, who at the time was a student on Nasa's postdoctoral programme, discovered a marine cyanobacterium named Acaryochloris marina that can photosynthesise using both visible and near-infrared light. This discovery kickstarted decades of research into the wavelengths of light required for photosynthesis.\n\nThen, in 2018, scientists at Imperial College London found photosynthesising cyanobacteria living in shady conditions in bacterial mats in Yellowstone National Park, and inside some beach rocks in Australia. They even managed to grow photosynthesising microbes in a dark cupboard fitted with infrared LEDs. In each case, the cyanobacteria used chlorophyll a to photosynthesise using visible light, but then switched to using chlorophyll f to photosynthesise using near-infrared light – beyond the reach of human vision.\n\nThe findings have repercussions for what life on other planets could look like. When looking for a habitable exoplanet – a planet that orbits a star in another solar system – it's important to take into account the type of star that it is orbiting. Astronomers have tried to group stars by the colour of light they produce, resulting in seven classes of stars (O, B, A, F, G, K and M), which are arranged in order of decreasing temperature, from hottest to coolest. O- and B-type stars are the hottest, most massive and most luminous stars in the Universe. They are characterised by their blue-white colour.\n\n\"They produce a lot of UV radiation, so they're toxic to life,\" says Barton.\n\nG-type stars, which include our Sun, are yellow in colour and produce a lot of light in the visible spectrum. These stars would theoretically be good places to look for habitable worlds, but G-type stars constitute just 8% of the estimated one billion trillion stars in the Universe.\n\nAs red dwarfs are low mass stars, their planets tend to orbit closely, which makes them easier to spot. Another reason that M stars have proved so fruitful in scientists' search for exoplanets is because they are so plentiful. However, currently red dwarf stars are thought to have a very narrow habitable zone – the area closest to the star where conditions are neither too hot, nor too cold for liquid water to exist on the planet's surface. the epic hunt for a planet just like Earth.)\n\nAs the existence of liquid water is essential for life on Earth, this measure, known as the star's \"Goldilocks zone\", is what astrobiologists have focused on when looking for extraterrestrial life. So far, they have found dozens of candidates. However not all of these planets could sustain life, and directing telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) takes time and considerable resources.\n\n• The peculiar smells of outer space\n\n• The scientists looking for alien vegetation\n\n• The scientists venturing into the deep, dark Earth\n\nAnother important factor which governs whether life can exist is whether photosynthesis can take place. On Earth, photosynthesis forms the base of most food chains and provides the oxygen we breathe. For this reason, it makes sense to limit the search to planets that can support photosynthesis. This could dramatically reduce the zone around a star where life could exist.\n\nIn the past, astrobiologists set the limit for photosynthesis at a wavelength of 700nm in the light spectrum, which is the equivalent wavelength of the colour red. This is the point at which the efficiency of photosynthesis using chlorophyll a declines. However, the cyanobacteria discovered in the Carlsbad cave systems can harvest light up to wavelengths of 780nm using chlorophyll f.\n\n\"The vast majority of stars in our galaxy are these M- and K-type stars,\" says Barton. \"This means most of the stars in our galaxy are putting out near-infrared light, and yet we barely know anything about how photosynthesis and life could survive under the conditions of light that would be produced by a star like that.\"\n\nBarton plans to change this. Together with Behrendt, she has put in a proposal to Nasa to find the limits of where photosynthetic life can survive. The work would involve going deep down into the darkest caves to measure exactly how much light is needed for cyanobacteria to survive. That information can then be used to narrow down the search for habitable worlds. For example, with the JWST, scientists can measure the amount and type of light exoplanets receive.\n\n\"What our work is trying to do is figure out what is the longest wavelength of light and lowest level of light at which you can photosynthesise,\" says Barton.\n\n\"Then what you can do is take the 100 billion potential stars that we can point the James Webb Space Telescope at, and reduce it down to say 50 stars [which may host life].\"\n\nIn other words, it could lead to astrobiologists broadening the types of worlds that they believe could support life. All that would remain would be to point the JWST at the star in question and then look for planets passing in front of it. As the light from the star travels through the atmosphere of the planet, specific frequencies of light are absorbed depending on what elements are present. Astronomers can therefore work out if certain elements which might hint at the presence of life, such as oxygen, are present in the exoplanet's atmosphere by looking for missing lines on the absorption spectra.\n\n\"There are very, very few ways that oxygen can be made in an atmosphere without life,\" says Barton. \"So, if you can find the oxygen in the atmosphere of one of those exoplanets, it's a very, very strong marker for potential life.\"\\\n\n* This article has been updated to correct information about the spectral classification of stars from O to M. This article also incorrectly stated that all exoplanets discovered to date have been found around red dwarf stars. Exoplanets have been discovered around a wide variety of stars.\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, \n\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC,",

    "fullText": "\"We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes,\" he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday called on Republicans to \"take over\" and \"nationalize\" voting as he continued to make false claims about the electoral process in the U.S. with the 2026 midterm elections on the horizon.\n\nTrump made the comments in an interview with former FBI Director Dan Bongino, who resigned from his post in December and returned to podcasting.\n\nTrump alleged noncitizen voting was improperly influencing election outcomes, though experts insist such instances are incredibly rare and already illegal, and told Bongino it was \"amazing that the Republicans aren't tougher on it.\"\n\n\"The Republicans should say, 'We want to take over,'\" Trump said. \"We should take over the voting ... in at least many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes.\"\n\nThe Constitution gives states the authority to conduct federal elections, subject to laws passed by Congress. The elections clause states, in part, that \"state legislatures will establish the times, places, and manner of holding elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate.\"\n\nTrump didn't elaborate on how he wanted Republicans to \"nationalize\" voting.\n\nAsked by ABC News for specifics on what Trump meant, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson responded, \"President Trump cares deeply about the safety and security of our elections -- that’s why he’s urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting, and end the practice of ballot harvesting.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the chamber's top Democrat, slammed Trump over his comments to Bongino.\n\n\"Just a few hours ago, Donald Trump said he wants to nationalize elections around the country. That's what Trump said. You think he believes in democracy? He said, 'We want to take over, the Republicans ought to nationalize the voting,'\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"Does Donald Trump need a copy of the Constitution? What he is saying is outlandishly illegal.\"\n\nTrump's agenda is at stake in this year’s elections, where all seats in the House and 35 in the Senate will be up for grabs. Currently, Republicans hold narrow margins in both chambers -- but midterm cycles are historically unkind to the sitting president's party.\n\nLast year, Trump and other Republicans pushed for mid-decade redistricting in order to gain additional House seats. The president warned Republicans last month that they have to win the midterms or he will get \"impeached.\"\n\nTrump also continues to litigate his 2020 election loss, spreading false claims of fraud.\n\nLast week, the FBI searched and seized original 2020 voting records from the Fulton County Elections and Operations Hub in Georgia, a swing state that went blue in 2020 and helped secure Joe Biden's victory.\n\n\"Now you're going to see something in Georgia where they were able to get, with a court order, the ballots. You're going to see some interesting things come out,” Trump said on Bongino's podcast.\n\nABC News' Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge on Monday blocked the Trump administration’s latest bid to limit lawmakers from conducting unannounced visits to immigration detention facilities, ruling that it likely runs afoul of oversight measures that Congress implemented.\n\nIt’s the second time U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb has sided with the group of Democratic lawmakers suing.\n\nCobb ruled in December that the Trump administration was violating a rider attached to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) annual appropriations package, which guarantees lawmaker access to detention facilities.\n\nLast month, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem re-implemented a notice requirement. It required 7-days’ warning for visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities being funded exclusively by the “Big Beautiful Bill” that Republicans passed last summer. That bill did not include the rider.\n\nCobb rejected the policy, crediting the lawmakers’ contention that it would be logistically difficult to segregate which expenses are being funded by which law.\n\n“Defendants’ declarant provides almost no details or specifics as to how DHS and ICE would accomplish this task in the face of the practical challenges raised by Plaintiffs,” wrote Cobb, an appointee of former President Biden.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to a DHS spokesperson for comment.\n\nThe suit was filed by 13 Democratic members of Congress: Joe Neguse (Colo.), Adriano Espaillat (N.Y.), Bennie Thompson (Miss.), Jamie Raskin (Md.), Robert Garcia (Calif.), Lou Correa (Calif.), Jason Crow (Colo.), Veronica Escobar (Texas), Dan Goldman (N.Y.), Jimmy Gomez (Calif.), Raul Ruiz (Calif.), Norma Torrez (Calif.) and Kelly Morrison (Minn.).\n\nTheir latest push in court came after the lawmakers said they tried to visit an ICE facility in Minnesota three days after the fatal shooting of Renée Good by a federal agent.\n\n“The Court’s decision today to grant a temporary restraining order against ICE’s unlawful effort to obstruct congressional oversight is a victory for the American people. We will keep fighting to ensure the rule of law prevails,” Neguse, a member of House Democratic leadership, said in a statement.\n\nThe lawmakers are represented by American Oversight and Democracy Forward Foundation, two organizations that regularly back lawsuits against the Trump administration.",

    "description": "Exclusive: ‘There has to be something better than this,’ Irish deportee Patrick Moore told The Independent. ‘It's not the United States that I know.’",
    "fullText": "When a Manhattan-based construction executive and his boyfriend of two decades were renovating a luxury Tribeca triplex in 2024, the two began – like many couples do amid such undertakings – to argue.\n\nAs the bickering escalated, Patrick Moran, an expert in conservation and preservation who has overseen building projects for New York City’s Carnegie Hall, the American Museum of Natural History and the New York Federal Reserve, says partner Nicholas Kjos, a high-end real estate broker who previously worked as an entertainer on cruise ships, at one point called him a “f**king immigrant,” and threatened to call ICE to have him deported, according to civil court filings reviewed by The Independent.\n\nThe 46-year-old Moran, for his part, chalked the cruel outburst up to “stress” over the ongoing overhaul of their $4.3 million apartment, which had by then already been dragging on for four years, and “continued to believe in the relationship.”\n\nThat is, until Kjos, 45, initiated legal proceedings to have Moran removed from their shared home, leveling claims that prompted a team of eight armed ICE officers to show up last summer and detain Moran for deportation. He spent the next month being shuffled around the country to various lockups, before finally being sent back to Ireland.\n\nGetting Moran thrown out of the United States was part of a plot “intended to exploit [Moran’s] immigration status,” with a goal of “wrongfully obtain[ing] sole control, ownership and possession of the property,” the complaint alleges.\n\n“It’s a situation where I feel that ICE was weaponized against him,” Moran’s attorney Andreas Vasilatos told The Independent. “Almost like how the Mafia just whacks a guy [they don’t want around anymore]. But here, instead of whacking the guy, it’s, ‘I’m gonna call ICE.’”\n\nSpeaking to The Independent from overseas, Moran said, “I love [the United States] and what it stands for, and I know we are better than this. I don’t claim to have the solution to immigration reform, but whatever that solution is, it must be fair, just and enforced with compassion and humanity.”\n\nThe stunning episode comes during an unprecedented expansion of ICE’s remit, with more than 73,000 people now in immigration detention – an all-time high and a 75 percent increase in the 12 months since Donald Trump retook the White House.\n\nIn Florida, the state’s attorney general has encouraged people with undocumented exes to report them to ICE. The top ICE official at the agency’s Puerto Rico field office said investigators today receive “revenge tips” they never got previously, telling NPR that people are turning in “a neighbor that they don’t get along with, or an ex-husband, ex-wife, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend.” Last year, after a 29-year-old NYPD sergeant was spurned by a woman he met online, he allegedly threatened to have her deported by ICE.\n\nBetween January and September 2025, the U.S. deported 99 Irish citizens, a 50 percent increase compared to a year earlier, and an 1,880 percent increase over the five people deported back to Ireland in 2021.\n\nMoran’s forced return has left him “shattered,” according to Vasilatos. He described Moran as a “super sweet guy,” who “contributed to society and was a net positive” to everybody in his life.\n\n“It’s not disputed he was undocumented,” Vasilatos said. “But to not take into consideration his contributions to America over the last 20 years, makes it particularly draconian and particularly punitive.”\n\nKjos did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nMoran and Kjos, who is originally from San Antonio, were introduced by a mutual friend in 2005, and quickly embarked on a romantic relationship “characterized by mutual love and commitment,” according to a lawsuit Vasilatos filed January 29 on Moran’s behalf in Manhattan Supreme Court.\n\nShortly after they began dating, Kjos gave up his career at sea to pursue potential opportunities as an actor-singer on Broadway, the complaint continues. About six months later, the pair began living together in Midtown, Moran’s complaint says.\n\nThey spent holidays together at Kjos’s family ranch in Texas, attended weddings together and Moran became Kjos’s nephew’s godfather, the complaint goes on. Moran and Kjos bought a Bernedoodle named Benji, which became “a beloved part of their shared life,” according to the complaint.\n\nMoran, who earned more than $300,000 a year, was the “primary financial provider” for the pair, the complaint states. Kjos left his seaborne career behind and obtained a real estate license, splitting his time between New York and Texas, the complaint says, noting that Moran hired a “nationally recognized website designer to create and maintain a state-of-the-art website” for Kjos, among other things. In 2015, Moran and Kjos decided to purchase a $400,000 apartment atop the Grand Hyatt Hotel in San Antonio, completely redoing the brand-new space at Moran’s expense, the complaint contends.\n\nAnd because dealing in multimillion-dollar properties was a business that “emphasized image,” Moran provided cash down payments for Kjos to buy, at various times, a Range Rover, a Mercedes and a Porsche.\n\n“At no time did [Moran] view these payments as individual obligations; rather, they were treated as joint contributions to the parties' shared life,” according to the complaint.\n\nDue to Moran’s undocumented immigration status, the San Antonio home was titled in Kjos’s name, but “it was understood and intended to be jointly owned and benefited from by both parties,” according to the complaint.\n\nIn 2020, Moran and Kjos decided to buy a place in New York City, setting their sights on a raw three-story condo in the Tribeca section of Lower Manhattan.\n\nLike the San Antonio home, Moran’s immigration status meant the Tribeca property also needed to be titled in Kjos’s name, according to the complaint. But, it says, “it was acquired and renovated with the understanding that it was a joint asset for their mutual benefit.”\n\nThree years went by, and in December 2024, Moran resigned from his job and co-founded his own construction firm. By this time, the two had started to argue, the complaint explains. It says Kjos made “derogatory remarks such as calling [Moran] a ‘f**king immigrant,’ and threatening to ‘report’ him to immigration authorities for deportation.”\n\nNevertheless, Moran “attributed this to project stress” and continued to trust that the relationship between him and Kjos would endure, according to the complaint.\n\nAt this point, the renovation costs began to soar, the complaint states. Under intense financial pressure, the couple agreed to sell their San Antonio apartment, complete the renovations to the apartment in Tribeca and sell it, then part ways, according to the complaint.\n\nWith the Tribeca renovation nearing completion, it says Kjos demanded that Moran move out for staging and sale, while also claiming the local real estate market was weak and that issues with the building’s foundation would devalue the property. But, Moran’s complaint argues, a comprehensive valuation report from the Office of the New York State Comptroller deemed the Tribeca market “at a peak,” an assertion backed up by consultations with real estate professionals who estimated the renovated space “should command approximately $4,300,000.”\n\nIn early August, Moran got home to find a notice ordering him to vacate the property within 10 days, the complaint states. Because the apartment belonged to both of them, Moran decided to fight it out in court, where Kjos’s lawyer “falsely accused [Moran] of selling methamphetamine, a baseless claim,” according to the complaint, which insists that Moran, who said he has no criminal history whatsoever, “has never sold drugs,” nor ever charged with doing so.\n\nKjos, in an “attempt to escalate” things, then called ICE and made the same spurious claim, unbeknownst to Moran, the complaint says.\n\n“On the morning of October 31, 2025, [Kjos] remotely unlocked the North Moore property door via his Control4… phone app, allowing eight armed ICE officers to enter and detain [Moran],” according to the complaint. “The officers, at the… permission of [Moran], searched the apartment and found no contraband or evidence of drugs. When the search was completed and [Moran] was removed from the apartment, [Kjos], through the use of his Control4 app, locked the door behind them.”\n\nMoran was taken into custody at gunpoint and forced out of the apartment in a T-shirt and sweatpants, he said. He asked to change into something more appropriate, and to get his keys, but the ICE officers refused, according to Moran.\n\nThat afternoon, while at Delaney Hall, a notorious ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, Moran was able to contact his business partner and their IT administrator and gave them permission to go into the Tribeca condo to retrieve his laptop and company files, “which were necessary for the continued operation of the company,” the complaint states.\n\nBut, it says, when Kjos got a notification on his phone from the Control4 app that they had entered the place, he “immediately called them up and falsely stated it was a federal crime scene and they were about to be arrested, as the police were on the way.”\n\nMoran’s complaint says no drug-related charges were filed, and that six months of apartment surveillance video would prove that no drugs were being sold out of the apartment, if only Kjos would allow him access to the footage.\n\n“It was so insulting,” Moran told The Independent, pushing back vehemently against the notion that he ever did anything of the sort. “I was furious… Like, ‘Is somebody punking me?’ It was such a low blow.”\n\nAfter about four weeks in ICE custody, culminating with a stint at an ICE facility in San Diego, Moran was permitted to “self-deport” back to Ireland, on a plane ticket his parents bought for him. He is now trying to pick up the pieces of his life from afar, and is hoping to resume his life in America eventually.\n\nKjos presently has full possession of the Tribeca apartment. In Moran’s suit against Kjos, he is seeking to get back his half of their joint assets and joint custody of their dog. The remedy here, in legal terms, is known as a constructive trust, in which the court would declare Kjos to be wrongfully holding property belonging to Moran, and force him to give it back so as not to be “unjustly enriched.”\n\n“I wasn't angry,” Moran told The Independent. “It was just sad. I was in a relationship for 20 years with this person, and as far as I was concerned, there wasn't going to be another person.”\n\nAsked where things stand now between himself and Kjos, Moran said he didn’t know. At the same time, he emphasized, he continues to believe in the U.S. And, Moran went on, his experience in ICE detention gave him a perspective on things that left an indelible mark.\n\n“Don't get me wrong, it was hard for me, but it was so much harder for pretty much everybody that I spoke to in there,” Moran said. “There are people in there that don't have anybody, that have nothing. They don't have money for commissary. So how are they to defend themselves?”\n\nAlthough Moran is an Irish native, he said he in fact spent more time living in the U.S. than he did in Ireland, and truly considers New York to be his home.\n\n“I will bounce back, and that's because America will allow me to do that,” Moran said. “That's why I love it there. But... [t]here has to be something better than this. It's not the United States that I know.”",

    "fullText": "A newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch delivered a sharp warning to President Donald Trump after a high-profile Republican loss.\n\nIn a new editorial, The Wall Street Journal warned Trump that a hardline immigration strategy promoted by top aide Stephen Miller is fueling voter backlash.\n\nIt comes after a Trump-endorsed candidate for the Texas state senate lost to a Democrat over the weekend.\n\n“How does a Republican lose by 14 points in a safe conservative Texas state Senate seat that President Trump carried by 17 points in 2024? Answer: When there’s a voter backlash against the Trump Administration, notably its mass deportation debacles,” the Journal wrote, describing the special election in Tarrant County.\n\nDemocrat Taylor Rehmet, a labor union leader and veteran, easily defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss, who had Trump’s endorsement on Truth Social and vastly outspent her opponent.\n\nRehment is the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades.\n\nThe paper noted the timing was disastrous for Republicans, coming after the high-profile Minneapolis killings by federal immigration agents. “The 31-point vote swing in a little more than 14 months can only be explained as part of a rising tide of opposition to Mr. Trump’s first year and a sour public mood,” the Journal observed.\n\nThe White House has faced mounting national backlash after federal immigration agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis—Renee Good in early January and Alex Pretti later that month—as part of aggressive enforcement operations in the state.\n\nBoth cases sparked controversy over conflicting official narratives. In Pretti’s case, Homeland Security officials and White House aides initially claimed he approached agents with a gun and posed a threat, while bystander videos show him holding only a cellphone before being pinned down and shot.\n\nSimilarly, authorities initially suggested that Good tried to ram agents with her vehicle before she was fatally shot, a claim contradicted by eyewitness footage and reporting. Critics argue these early statements painted both victims as dangerous to justify the shootings, fueling accusations that the administration misrepresented the events.\n\nThe killings came after Trump deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to Minneapolis as part of an aggressive immigration strategy masterminded by Miller.\n\nMiller’s immigration strategy under Trump has pushed aggressive mass arrests and deportations, with ICE agents pressured to meet high daily quotas, even targeting non-criminal undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal critiqued Miller’s hardline tactics, including a daily quota of 3,000 migrant arrests that it says “was bound to result in agent intrusions into homes and businesses.”\n\nWhile immigration has historically been a winning issue for Republicans, the Journal cautioned that enforcement “that turns ugly in the streets is turning off the swing voters who will determine who wins the race for Congress this year.”\n\nPolls have recently shown Americans turning on Trump and his immigration strategy ahead of the 2026 Midterms. A YouGov poll conducted on January 25 showed that about half (48 percent) of respondents do not think the shooting of Pretti in Minneapolis was justified.\n\nAnother YouGov poll showed that 52 percent of Americans think the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict immigration to the U.S. have gone too far.\n\nAs a result, the paper concluded that even as Trump signals a desire to “dial back the confrontations on the street,” he must also reconsider Miller’s influence. “The Miller strategy isn’t likely to fare better this year,” the editorial warned.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is not the first Murdoch-owned newspaper to publicly condemn Trump’s immigration strategy.\n\nIn an op-ed published last week, the New York Post argued that the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement in Minneapolis is backfiring politically.\n\n“These enforcement tactics won’t turn the tide, instead they are backfiring,” the Post wrote.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Russia has largely observed a ceasefire on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday as Kyiv prepared for the next round of trilateral talks on how ​to end the war.\n\nZelenskiy said that Russia had not carried out any targeted missile or drone strikes ‌on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the past 24 hours, but steady Russian shelling hit energy facilities near the front line.\n\n\"The de-escalation measures... are ‌helping to build public trust in the negotiation process and its possible outcome. The war needs to be ended,\" Zelenskiy said after he met his negotiating team ahead of the next round of peace talks with Russian and U.S. officials scheduled to take place this week in Abu Dhabi. \"Ukraine is ready for real steps. We believe it is realistic to achieve a ⁠dignified and lasting peace.\"\n\nIn his nightly ‌video address, Zelenskiy noted that Russian forces had continued to shell Ukrainian positions and logistics, damaging transmission lines and other sites in parts of the southeastern Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nHe ‍said the pause in strikes on energy infrastructure underscored the fact that U.S. efforts to pursue negotiations to end the war were having an impact.\n\n\"This demonstrates that when the United States has the motivation to genuinely change the situation, the situation can indeed ​change,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nRussia and Ukraine said last week they halted strikes on each other's energy infrastructure, but disagreed ‌on the timeframe for the truce.\n\nThe Kremlin said U.S. President Donald Trump had made a personal request to Russian President Vladimir Putin to refrain from striking Kyiv until February 1. Zelenskiy said the truce was supposed to last for a week, starting January 30.\n\nUKRAINE STRUGGLES TO RESTORE POWER SUPPLIES\n\nUkraine is struggling to restore its battered energy system and secure electricity and heat for the population after several large Russian strikes this month. Repair work has been complicated by ⁠bitterly cold temperatures.\n\n\"Today we are coming to the critical point. We ​need some time to recover what is destroyed for the last ​three months,\" said Maxim Timchenko, CEO of private energy producer DTEK. \"Energy ceasefire is extremely important for us to recover partly and avoid any tragic consequences because of no power supply.\"\n\nDTEK said on ‍Monday one of its coal ⁠mining enterprises in the Dnipropetrovsk region had been attacked for the second time in 24 hours. The previous strike on Sunday killed 12 miners, the company said.\n\nZelenskiy also said Russian forces were focusing on ⁠attacking transport logistics, especially railway infrastructure.\n\nRegional officials said that a Russian strike had killed a father and a son, and wounded two children and ‌their mother in the frontline Donetsk region.",

    "description": "Despite having record-breaking careers, artists like Kendrick Lamar,  Lady Gaga, Drake, and Madonna have never won the Grammy for album of the year.",
    "fullText": "Save for his debut, all of Kendrick Lamar's studio albums have been contenders for the biggest Grammy Award: \"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City,\" \"To Pimp a Butterfly,\" \"Damn,\" \"Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers,\" and most recently, \"GNX.\" He also received nominations as a featured artist on Beyoncé's \"Lemonade\" and as the curator and lead performer on the \"Black Panther\" soundtrack.\n\nHe has won best rap album several times, record of the year, and song of the year — not to mention a Pulitzer Prize — but never album of the year.\n\nLady Gaga's \"Mayhem\" won best pop vocal album at the 2026 Grammys, but lost the top prize to Bad Bunny's \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" She had previously been nominated in the category for \"Love for Sale\" (a collaborative album with Tony Bennett), \"Born This Way,\" \"The Fame Monster,\" and \"The Fame.\"\n\nMariah Carey has been named Billboard's top-selling female artist of all time. As of writing, she boasts 19 No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, the most of any solo artist, and is the only person to top the chart in four separate decades.\n\nYet Carey has lost all three of her bids for album of the year. She received her first nomination in 1991 for her self-titled LP but lost to Quincy Jones.\n\nShe was later nominated for \"Daydream\" in 1996 and \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" in 2006, but lost to Alanis Morissette and U2, respectively.\n\nJust two albums in Drake's record-breaking catalog have been up for album of the year: \"Views\" in 2017 and \"Scorpion\" in 2019. They lost to \"25\" by Adele and \"Golden Hour\" by Kacey Musgraves, respectively.\n\nAlthough Drake has criticized the ceremony's relevance — both onstage and on social media — he resumed submitting his music for consideration with the 2022 album \"Her Loss,\" which received four nods, but only in rap categories.\n\n\"4:44\" is the only album in Jay-Z's legendary discography that has been up for album of the year. He lost that bid to Bruno Mars.\n\nHowever, Jay-Z has also been nominated for his work on other people's albums, including Lil Wayne's \"Tha Carter III,\" Lamar's \"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City,\" Ye's \"Donda,\" and three albums by his wife, Beyoncé, finally winning for \"Cowboy Carter.\"\n\nIn 2024, Jay-Z openly criticized the Recording Academy during his acceptance speech for the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award.\n\nRihanna has largely pivoted to business ventures in the last decade, but for several years, she was a hit-making machine.\n\nDuring Rihanna's reign over the charts, only \"Loud\" was nominated for album of the year.\n\nHer eighth and most acclaimed album to date, \"Anti,\" wasn't up for the award despite collecting six other nominations in 2017, including best urban contemporary album.\n\nJanet Jackson's first set of Grammy nominations came in 1987, including an album of the year nod for \"Control.\" It lost to Paul Simon's \"Graceland.\"\n\nNone of Jackson's solo albums have been nominated since, though she did receive a nod as a producer and featured artist on her brother's \"HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I.\" That year, Alanis Morissette won for \"Jagged Little Pill.\"\n\nBjörk has only received nods in genre-specific categories — most recently best alternative music album for \"Fossora\" in 2023 — but has lost all 16 of her nominations.\n\nEminem received his first nod for album of the year in 2001 for \"The Marshall Mathers LP,\" but lost to \"Two Against Nature\" by Steely Dan.\"\n\nHe has been nominated two more times, in 2003 for \"The Eminem Show\" and in 2011 for \"Recovery,\" but lost to Norah Jones and Arcade Fire, respectively.\n\nBruce Springsteen is one of the biggest winners in Grammy history with 20 awards, but he has still never won album of the year.\n\nThe Boss has been nominated just twice: in 1985 for \"Born in the U.S.A.\" and in 2003 for \"Rising.\" (Shockingly, he got no love for \"Born to Run\" or \"Nebraska.\")\n\nLauryn Hill took home the biggest Grammy Award in 1999 for \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,\" becoming the first hip-hop artist to do so.\n\nMany of Madonna's groundbreaking albums, including \"Like a Prayer,\" \"Erotica,\" and \"Confessions on a Dance Floor,\" never received a nod for album of the year — or, for that matter, a nod in any of the high-profile general-field categories.\n\nNirvana received just five Grammy nominations during Kurt Cobain's lifetime, and none were in the \"Big Four\" categories.\n\nThe groundbreaking band won just one award: best alternative music performance for \"MTV Unplugged in New York,\" bestowed nearly one year after Cobain's death.\n\nIncredibly, Prince lost both of his bids for album of the year. \"Purple Rain\" was bested by Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" in 1985, while \"Sign o' the Times\" lost to U2's \"The Joshua Tree\" in 1988.\n\nDavid Bowie's \"Let's Dance\" lost to Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" in 1984.\n\nMany of Bowie's most inventive and beloved albums, including \"Hunky Dory,\" \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,\" and \"Station to Station,\" didn't get any Grammy nominations at all.\n\nMarvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" has been hailed as the best album of all time, but it didn't get a chance to compete for album of the year.\n\nGaye only won two Grammys in his lifetime — best R&B vocal performance and best R&B instrumental performance for \"Sexual Healing\" in 1983 — but was never nominated in a major category. He was posthumously given the Recording Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996.\n\nIt's hard to believe that Pink Floyd's seminal concept record lost to Christopher Cross, who swept the \"Big Four\" categories in 1981 with his self-titled album.\n\nCross became the only artist in Grammys history to win all four general-field awards on the same night and remained the only artist to do so for nearly four decades until Billie Eilish joined the ranks in 2020. He never won another.\n\nMeanwhile, Pink Floyd never received another nomination for album of the year. The band only took home one award for best rock instrumental performance.\n\nOnly one album by the top-selling British band has ever been up for album of the year: \"Some Girls\" in 1979. It was their first-ever Grammy nomination, and they have yet to compete for the top prize again.\n\nIn fact, The Rolling Stones have only won four Grammys to date — including best rock album for \"Hackney Diamonds\" in 2025 — and none in a major category.\n\nElton John received his first nod for album of the year in 1971 for his self-titled LP, but lost to Simon & Garfunkel's \"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\"\n\nHe has been nominated two more times, for \"Caribou\" in 1975 and \"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\" in 1976, but lost to Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon, respectively.\n\nBefore her death in 2018, Aretha Franklin, the renowned \"Queen of Soul,\" won 18 Grammys out of 44 nominations.\n\nFranklin was also honored with the Recording Academy's Grammy Legend Award, the Lifetime Achievement Award, and the MusiCares Person of the Year award in 1991, 1994, and 2008, respectively. Five of her songs, including her beloved cover of Otis Redding's \"Respect,\" have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nDespite these accolades, Franklin never received a nomination in a general-field category like album, record, or song of the year. She received just two nominations for best R&B album for \"A Rose Is Still A Rose\" and \"So Damn Happy,\" but lost both.\n\nElvis Presley only won three Grammy Awards: best sacred performance for \"How Great Thou Art,\" best inspirational performance for \"He Touched Me,\" and best inspirational performance (non-classical) for \"How Great Thou Art.\"\n\nPresley was nominated for record of the year twice (for \"A Fool Such As I\" and \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\"), but never for song or album of the year.",

City,\" but went home empty-handed from the 2014 ceremony.\n\nHowever, it didn't take long for Lamar to make up the deficit.

It could also bolster SpaceX’s data-center ambitions as Musk competes with rivals like Alphabet's Google, Meta, Amazon-backed Anthropic and OpenAI in the AI sector.\n\nWhat regulatory challenges could this merger face?\n\nWhat makes SpaceX's xAI acquisition record-breaking?\n\nHow will combining SpaceX and xAI benefit both companies?\n\nHow does this fit into Musk's broader business strategy?\n\nThe transaction values SpaceX at $1 trillion, and xAI at $250 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n\"This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: ⁠scaling to make a sentient sun to ‌understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\" Musk said.\n\nThe purchase of xAI sets a new record for the world's largest M&A deal, a distinction held for ‍more than 25 years when Vodafone bought Germany’s Mannesmann in a hostile takeover valued at $203 billion in 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nThe combined company of SpaceX and xAI is expected to price shares at about $527 each, another person familiar with the matter said. ​SpaceX was already the world's most valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share ‌sale. XAI was last valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe merger comes as the space company plans a blockbuster public offering this year that could value it at over $1.5 trillion, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSpaceX, xAI and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe deal further consolidates Musk's far-flung business empire and fortunes into a tighter, mutually reinforcing ecosystem – what some investors and analysts informally call the \"Muskonomy\" – which already includes Tesla, ⁠brain-chip maker Neuralink and tunnel firm the Boring Company.\n\nThe world's richest man ​has a history of merging his ventures together. Musk folded social media ​platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla's stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.\n\nThe ‍agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and ⁠investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk's overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.",

    "description": "Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi, an OB-GYN, wanted a preventive double-mastectomy. She fought to get it, then learned she already had stage 1 breast cancer.",
    "fullText": "At first glance, it seemed like Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi stopped the faint possibility of breast cancer in its tracks.\n\nAt 48, the Los Angeles-based celebrity OB-GYN of clients like the Kardashians and Rihanna went in for a routine mammogram. The doctor spotted and ordered a biopsy of a lesion of atypical cells in her left breast that could become cancerous over time. Aliabadi was told that everything was fine and to come back in six months.\n\nStill, Aliabadi wanted to be cautious. She was a proponent of the lifetime risk assessment score, a two-minute online test that she recommended to her patients (among them, Olivia Munn, who credits the test with helping her get diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer).\n\nTaking the test herself for the first time, Aliabadi learned that her risk was surprisingly high. According to the test, anyone scoring above 20% is advised to get a breast cancer screening. Aliabadi scored 37.5%.\n\n\"I remember I almost fell off my chair,\" Aliabadi, now 55, told Business Insider. \"I couldn't believe that someone with no family history of cancer, no genetic mutations, no smoking, no alcohol, healthy, would ever have a lifetime risk of 37.5%.\"\n\nWanting to be safe, Aliabadi sought out a preventive double-mastectomy. But she said she was met with resistance by multiple doctors, who thought she was being overly worried and pushing too aggressively for a complex surgery given her medical history.\n\n\"The dismissal was the hardest part for me,\" Aliabadi said. After a year of seeking other opinions, she eventually got her surgery. A week later, when the pathology report came back on her breast issue, she learned she had stage 1 breast cancer, proving her instincts were right all along.\n\nAs Aliabadi sought out her double-mastectomy, she also underwent several more breast cancer screenings.\n\n\"My cancer was missed on all imaging,\" Aliabadi said. After that first biopsy, she had a benign mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI.\n\nFrom her work as an OB-GYN, Aliabadi knew that she wasn't necessarily out of the woods. For one, she had extremely dense breast tissue, which affects 40 to 50% of patients and makes it harder to spot potential tumors in routine mammograms.\n\nKnowing her lifetime risk assessment score, which took into account factors like her breast density measure and prior biopsy history, helped her better understand how proactive she should be.\n\nThe assessment is still an estimation. As a result, some doctors have noted that it can sometimes overestimate cancer risk and cause undue anxiety in patients.\n\nAliabadi said she would rather patients — and herself — \"be safe than grieve the loss of someone who could have been saved.\"\n\nAliabadi asked her doctor for a double-mastectomy right after she learned her lifetime risk assessment score. The surgery would reduce her risk of developing breast cancer by almost 100% (it's rare, but possible, to still develop it in the surrounding tissue).\n\n\"I was very worried, I had three little kids at home,\" Aliabadi said. \"I had a busy practice, a beautiful life, beautiful children, and I didn't want to risk it.\"\n\nThe doctor turned her down. So did a few more. As a doctor, she knew they likely saw a double-mastectomy, a serious surgery with a long recovery time and possible side effects like scarring and long-term numbness, as too intensive given Aliabadi's clear tests and lack of family history.\n\n\"That's when I started noticing the resistance,\" she said. \"I was told that I was too healthy to get breast cancer, that I was paranoid, that I was too anxious.\" Her colleagues also thought she was going a step too far, she told Business Insider.\n\nOver a year later, Aliabadi found a doctor willing to perform the double-mastectomy. Even she advised against it initially.\n\n\"I was adamant about it and argued for a long time before she finally agreed,\" Aliabadi said.\n\nA week after her surgery, Aliabadi's suspicions about her risk were vindicated: she was diagnosed with \"invasive\" stage 1 breast cancer from the pathology of her removed breast tissue.\n\n\"I was angry that I had to fight for so long to be taken seriously,\" Aliabadi said. \"I was called crazy, anxious, paranoid, among other things.\"\n\nAliabadi has hope for future cancer screenings. The advancement of AI imaging has shown promising signs of spotting \"early cancer details we simply can't see with the naked eye,\" she said, which is predicted to become more available to patients in the future. Increased awareness around breast density has also led to broader coverage of alternative screening options for affected patients.\n\nStill, Aliabadi said her experience changed her. In 2024, she started \"She MD,\" a medical podcast she co-hosts with influencer Mary Alice Haney on topics surrounding women's health.\n\n\"That's what has sparked this passion in me,\" she said. \"If I had to fight this hard, other women really have no chance in this current healthcare system.\"",

    "title": "China's Farming Robots Are A Lot More Than Just Fancy Tractors",
    "description": "Automation and robots are becoming mainstays in many industries, but researchers and farmers in China are taking innovation in smart farming to the next level.",
    "fullText": "Much has been made of the AI race between the U.S. and China as the two national powers jockey for leadership in the world's fastest-growing industry. To some Western observers, China's progress in autonomous robotics is a cause for concern. But the nation's robotics revolution extends far beyond surveillance and military uses, existing at the junction of increasingly capable computing, manufacturing, and industrialization capacities. This confluence is perhaps best exemplified by China's advancements in smart agriculture, where engineers are bringing autonomous robots to the country's crop farming, livestock, and aquaculture industries. By developing autonomous robots to help plant and harvest crops, control pests, identify diseases, monitor livestock health, and even socially engineer fish behavior, China has achieved several major milestones in its robotic farming program.\n\nBeijing highlighted its ambitions to boost AI farming in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs' National Smart Agriculture Action Plan. In the plan, the government outlines its expectation for more than 30% of its agricultural production to be led by information-driven systems by 2026. Spearheading this nationwide smart-farming initiative is the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has developed a national strategy for fostering groundbreaking advancements in robot-assisted farming throughout several Chinese provinces. To accelerate these developments, Beijing has established 34 innovation labs and 35 IT laboratories dedicated to smart agriculture. As a result, farms across the country have begun employing LLMs and autonomous robots in their operations. This trend could pioneer a new global agricultural landscape in which AI drives progress in multiple endeavors, from fighting potato blights to genetically modifying crops.\n\nRobotics is playing an increasingly important role in China's crop management systems. For instance, in China's Sichuan province, autonomous robots inspect rice fields using blacklight cameras, funneling data through their built-in AI systems to flag both pests and diseases. At another farm, \"smart brain\" systems remotely monitor fields to gather data on soil quality, crop health, and environmental trends, enabling forecasts on crop growth, yields, and pest outbreaks. One WeChat-controlled set of farming robots can plant seeds, harvest crops, and remove weeds.\n\nSome projects have even applied AI-driven robotics to crop breeding, with one team of scientists having sped up crop development by 400% using the technology, per SCMP. This process was facilitated by \"robot-friendly\" crops that are designed to be easier for robots to pollinate and harvest. By employing these same autonomous robotic systems, some Chinese farms have been able to fully automate their crop cultivation processes.\n\nBeijing's use cases for robotics in farming go beyond crops, however. One robot developed by Muyuan Foods Co., Ltd. utilizes smart sensors to monitor and analyze animal biometrics. Fisheries have also begun developing high-tech autonomous solutions that monitor fish behavior and growth patterns. For example, at Beijing's National Innovation Center for Digital Fishery, robotic fish modeled after tuna and dolphins swim through breeding tanks to monitor fish patterns, environment health, and net infrastructure; they achieve this without disturbing their aquatic counterparts. Developers hope these robotic fish might eventually lead schools of fish to designated harvesting and feeding areas, on top of potentially being used for deep-sea exploration.\n\nChina's robotics revolution coincides with broader leaps in data analysis and agricultural machinery. Using data from autonomous robots, drones, and other intelligent farming systems, Chinese engineers may be able to take the guesswork out of irrigation, pest control, and planting schedules. Farmers have begun using smart farming to analyze factors impacting crop growth — including temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, and mineral levels — to better define irrigation needs, plan drought responses, and predict ripeness. In one farm, autonomous drones collect crop maturity data to produce horticultural maps that can guide harvesting.\n\nCompounded with its advancements in robotics, China is also seeing substantial growth in its domestic machinery production. The nation exported $9.3 billion in agricultural machinery in the first half of 2025 — a 26.5% jump from the previous year, according to Global Times. Domestically produced intelligent harvesting technology, including AI-assisted corn harvesters, points to a major shift in an agricultural industry that has historically depended on imported high-end machinery. According to a Xinhua English-language report on seed technology, the northwestern Xinjiang region of China has seen particular success from these advancements, achieving a 97% mechanization rate in its cotton farming practices.\n\nSome experts do question the scalability of intelligent automated farming systems, particularly in a country with a diverse climate, geography, and crop output. These variables introduce significant challenges in building standardized, cost-effective autonomous farming systems — and given the industry's historically small profit margins, cost is a particularly pressing consideration. But combined with other technological leaps, such as \"smart soil\" that grows bigger crops with less water and insect drones that can pollinate crops, the global agriculture industry just might be on the precipice of its next technological revolution.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "description": "The shocking volatility in metal markets last week hasn't deterred JPMorgan from its bullish call for gold to hit $6,300 this year.",
    "fullText": "The chart for gold might look pretty scary after last week's plunge, but JPMorgan says investors shouldn't bail on the yellow metal.\n\nGold prices plunged on Friday after President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve. The volatility continued on Monday, but JPMorgan thinks it's just a stumble on the path to a much bigger year-end price.\n\nThe investment bank updated its 2026 price target for gold to $6,300 per ounce, a roughly 34% increase from its late Monday price of about $4,700. The forecast might seem overly optimistic given what happened on Friday, but the bank's Gregory Shearer maintains that a recovery is coming.\n\nGold and silver swooned after Warsh's nomination spurred a reassessment of the so-called debasement trade, which has been a major force driving gold to record highs in the last 12 months.\n\nYet, according to Shearer, investors shouldn't be worried about a further correction. In the note, he highlighted that the demand for the metal is robust and above his team's expectations.\n\n\"Even with the recent near-term volatility, we believe longer-term rally momentum will remain intact,\" Shearer wrote, adding that a continuing trend of diversification will drive the gold to outperform.\n\nShearer is referring to the demand from central banks, and he says that it will remain on an upward trajectory in 2026. He also predicts that investor appetite will not wane even after the shocking volatility of Friday's sell-off.\n\n\"[E]ven with the likelihood of some positioning washing out over this pullback, as gold remains a dynamic, multi-faceted portfolio hedge, we now forecast enough demand from central banks and investor diversification this year to ultimately push gold prices to $6,300/oz\n\nThe bank is less bullish on silver, and Shearer said that his team finds it increasingly difficult to assess the drivers of silver's price. They note that gold will likely benefit as silver corrects in the coming months.\n\nAll of this amounts to \"a demand environment that is stressing inelastic supply, pushing prices higher in an attempt to eventually re-find market equilibrium.\"\n\nOverall, the analysts maintain that gold demand is strong enough to carry it to record highs in 2026, regardless of the monetary policies that the Fed pursues with Warsh at the helm. As his team sees it, even dramatic macro shifts likely will not change gold's status as the most effective safe haven asset and portfolio hedge.\n\n\"We continue to have the greatest conviction in our bullish view on gold from here, and are more cautious on re-engaging in silver in the near-term until it becomes clearer that some of the recent froth in prices has been fully shaken out,\" the analysts wrote.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk and Reid Hoffman are once again trading blows online after the latest release of the Epstein files.\n\nThe new round of bickering between Musk and the LinkedIn cofounder kicked off on Friday and lasted throughout the weekend, with the billionaires each lobbing criticism at each other over their inclusion in the Epstein files.\n\nNeither Musk nor Hoffman has been implicated in any wrongdoing related to their past ties to Epstein, who looms large in their social-media spat.\n\nTheir latest back-and-forth — the two have publicly criticized each other in recent years — appears to have started on Friday, when Musk reshared a post from Katie Miller that was critical of Hoffman. Hoffman fired back at Musk, posting a screenshot of his past remarks about Trump and the Epstein files.\n\nFrom there, the two have been duking it out on X over the documents released by the Justice Department on Friday related to Jeffrey Epstein — which revealed that Musk made plans to visit Epstein on multiple occasions, including on his infamous private island. (Musk has said he never visited the island).\n\n\"This is how I knew so long ago that Reid Hoffman went to Epstein's island,\" Musk captioned a screenshot of an email he received from Epstein in 2014.\n\n\"Epstein used Reid being there to try to get me to go, not realizing that it would have the opposite effect,\" he added.\n\nHoffman responded by criticizing Musk for \"making false accusations\" and lying about his involvement with Epstein instead of working to get justice for Epstein's victims.\n\n\"You lied about this to everyone for over a decade, and now your excuse (it's disgusting, by the way) is that you could get young girls without Epstein?\" Hoffman wrote. (Musk had written on Sunday that \"if I actually wanted to spend my time partying with young women, it would be trivial for me to do so without the help of a creepy loser like Epstein.\")\n\nGive us a break: If you cared about the victims as you say, you’d stop making false accusations to cover your ass and start using your $220m of influence with President Trump to get justice for the victims.\n\nInstead, you’re focused on comparing my visit fundraising for MIT to… https://t.co/51VgQ9Q9SY\n\nHoffman reshared X posts with documents that showed Musk's past email conversations with the disgraced financier. One post labeled Musk the \"surprise breakout star of the Epstein files.\"\n\nOne of the screenshots from the Epstein files that Hoffman shared showed a 2012 email where Musk asked Epstein, \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"\n\nMusk pointed the finger back at Hoffman for his past correspondence with Epstein.\n\n\"Epstein hounded me relentlessly to go to his pedo island and I always declined. Not you though. You actually went,\" Musk said. \"What 'gifts' did you bring to Epstein when you went to pedo island?\"\n\nHoffman previously acknowledged he had visited Epstein's island, which he said was a part of fundraising efforts for MIT.\n\nEpstein hounded me relentlessly to go to his pedo island and I always declined. \n\nNot you though. You actually went. \n\nWhat “gifts” did you bring to Epstein when you went to pedo island? pic.twitter.com/0ATSIl3ojn\n\nMusk and Hoffman's feud dates back years.\n\nHoffman has previously characterized the beef as one-sided, starting in the years after Musk left OpenAI's board. Hoffman, who was an early donor to OpenAI, has said Musk has sour grapes over OpenAI's success after his departure.\n\n\"Well, so actually, it's more his beef with me for having made OpenAI successful with his departure,\" Hoffman said. \"Because he left saying, you know, 'You're all a bunch of jackasses and you'll fail,' and I helped them succeed.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO, who previously worked with Hoffman at PayPal, said Hoffman was among the billionaires who were \"terrified\" about Epstein's client list coming out in 2024.\n\nHoffman has since said that he'd faced threats after Musk's claims that resulted in him hiring security.\n\nAfter the latest release of the Epstein files detailed multiple emails between the Tesla CEO and Epstein, including Musk's assistant trying to coordinate a meeting with Epstein at SpaceX, Musk took to social media to say that he never \"set foot on his creepy island.\"",

    "title": "Amazon's 'Melania' got the headlines. A YouTuber got the ticket sales.",
    "description": "Hollywood has been waiting to see if a big YouTuber could bring their fans to theaters. It just happened.",
    "fullText": "Did you hear about the movie that surprised just about everyone at the box office this weekend?\n\nNope, not \"Melania\" — though the sort-of-documentary about the first lady did do better than industry folks had projected, bringing in $7 million in its first weekend.\n\nThe real hit of the weekend was made by someone you probably haven't heard of, unless you are a very specific kind of online person: \"Iron Lung,\" a horror/sci-fi movie, written, directed by, and starring Mark Fischbach, known to his fans as Markiplier on YouTube, where he has 38.2 million subscribers.\n\n\"Iron Lung\" brought in $22 million worldwide, with almost all of that coming from the US over the past few days. Which means Fischbach, who self-financed the movie and says he spent \"a few million dollars\" on it, has probably already turned a profit on the project. (Amazon, meanwhile, has spent a reported $75 million to make and promote \"Melania\", and will be very hard pressed to make that money back — not that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos likely cares about that.)\n\nAnd that means Fischbach has done what the entertainment industry has been waiting a very, very long time to see: He's turned a big online audience into movie ticket sales.\n\nAgain, for comparison: \"Melania\" got a huge promotional rollout from Amazon, aided by the likes of Fox News, which brought Melania Trump on air for multiple interviews, and the president of the United States himself, who pushed the film on his social media accounts. That effort helped generate an estimated 600,000 ticket sales.\n\nFischbach, meanwhile, just used his YouTube presence to push the movie and asked fans to call and email theater owners to convince them to show it. That eventually got the movie onto about 4,000 screens worldwide and led to an estimated 1.9 million in ticket sales.\n\nOf course, you could also argue that these movies are more alike than similar: Critics thought \"Melania\" was awful, and the few people who reviewed \"Iron Lung\" aren't in love with it either.\n\nAlso: Neither movie was made for cineastes, but for fans who wanted to show up to signal their allegiance to the creator/subject. For \"Melania,\" that meant an audience that looked a lot like grandmothers (70% of the audience was female, and 72% was 55 or older, per The Ankler), and for \"Iron Lung\", that meant an audience that could have been their grandsons (61% male, 62% 25 and under).\n\nThe other big difference is that we're unlikely to see many more Big Media companies make a movie designed (just about) explicitly to flatter the president of the United States and his wife.\n\nBut many people are interested in transforming YouTube success into other platforms. It just hasn't happened much. Prior to this weekend, we've only seen that happen with Mr. Beast and his Amazon show. Next question: Can anyone else make the leap?",

    "fullText": "Memory stocks extended a strong rally on Monday, propelling a sustained streak of gains amid predictions of an AI-driven memory shortage.\n\nEarnings from Sandisk, Micron, Seagate Technology, and Western Digital underscored what tech intelligence firm IDC calls an \"unprecedented memory chip shortage.\" Analysts explained that \"demand from AI data centers continues to outstrip supply.\"\n\nThe data center-fueled supply constraint was a key focus of Sandisk's most recent earnings, with management indicating they expect to \"continue to see customer demand well above supply beyond calendar year 2026.\" The company reported 64% quarter-over-quarter rise in data center sales.\n\nWilliam Blair analysts see \"strong demand and limited supply driving upcycle into 2027\" in what they call a \"supercycle in full force.\" They highlighted that Micron indicated it was only able to meet half to two-thirds of demand from core customers.\"\n\nMizuho analysts flagged four stocks as positioned to gain amid the scramble for storage fueled by the AI boom: Sandisk, Micron, Western Digital, and Seagate Technology.\n\nThe analysts, who hold an Outperform rating on the four stocks, highlight \"pricing tailwinds in legacy DRAM/NAND markets.\" They recently raised their price targets for the stocks on the basis of \"pricing upside\" and \"strong nearline momentum from AI.\"\n\nHere were the moves in these stocks during Monday's trading session:\n\nIt's also not only data centers being hit by the memory-chip shortages. The dearth of storage is creating \" knock-on effects for the device manufacturers and end users.\"\n\nApple is one such manufacturer. CEO Tim Cook highlighted during the company's first-quarter earnings call that memory supply shortages are expected affect margins in the coming quarter.\n\n\"Beyond Q2, but we do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,\" the CEO said, adding, \"we are in a supply chase mode to meet the very high levels of customer demand.\"\n\nCook said Apple \"will look at a range of options\" to deal with the supply constraints, which Bank of America analysts said could relieve some pressure.\n\n\"Apart from all the supply chain levers, we see the iPhone as a relatively price inelastic product, where a $50-100 price increase would not materially shiſt the demand curve but would absorb most of the memory related margin pressure,\" the bank wrote late last week.",

    "description": "The president insists that the performing arts center and JFK memorial is \"run down,\" \"dilapidated\" and \"dangerous.\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump doubled down Monday on his proposed plan to gut and renovate the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, telling White House reporters that he will “be using the steel” for the building’s existing structure and redo the rest.\n\n“Some of the marble comes down,” he said, adding, “It will be brand new and really beautiful.”\n\nThe president came under fire Sunday after announcing plans to close the performing arts center and memorial to President John F. Kennedy for two years after controversially renaming it the Trump-Kennedy Center.\n\n“This important decision, based on input from many Highly Respected Experts, will take a tired, broken, and dilapidated Center, one that has been in bad condition, both financially and structurally for many years, and turn it into a World Class Bastion of Arts, Music, and Entertainment,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Sunday.\n\nMaintaining Monday that the center is “in very bad shape, it’s run down, it’s dilapidated, it’s sort of dangerous,” the president said the overhaul will cost “around $200 million” and spoke to his experience as a real estate mogul to back up the decision. (“In real estate and building, I’ve done so much of it, I’ve done so well with it.”)\n\nAsked by a reporter in the Oval Office if the renovation will tear down the arts center entirely, Trump said, “When it opens, it’s going to be brand new. Beautiful. I’m not ripping it down. I’ll be using the steel. So we’re using the structure. We’re using some of the marble and some of the marble comes down. But when it’s open, it will be brand new and really beautiful.”\n\n“So we’ll be closing it sometime around July 4. It’s, like, we’ll close it on July 4 in order to do something great for America. And then we’re building, we’ve got great contractors, we’re going to build it and we’ll do it right,” he said. “We’re using the highest grade marble, it’s the highest grade everything. It will be brand new.”\n\nQ: Do you plan on tearing the Kennedy Center down and how much will all of the renovations cost?\n\nTRUMP: Probably around $200 million. I'm not ripping it down. I'll be using the steel. So we're using the structure. We're using some of the marble. pic.twitter.com/Y8iy4QRowg\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 2, 2026\n\nThe late President Kennedy’s familiy were among the many figures decrying the construction project on Sunday, among them Jack Schlossberg, Maria Shriver and Joe Kennedy III.\n\n“Trump can take the Kennedy Center for himself,” Schlossberg wrote on X. “He can change the name, shut the doors and demolish the building. He can try to kill JFK. But JFK is kept alive by us now rising up to remove Donald Trump, bring him to justice and restore the freedoms generations fought for.”\n\nRep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), a former Kennedy Center board member, also spoke out Sunday.\n\n“Once again, Donald Trump has acted with total disregard for Congress,” she wrote in a statement. “The Kennedy Center is congressionally funded, and Congress should have been consulted on any decision to shut down its operations or undertake major renovations, especially for a two-year period.\n\n“Countless employees, artists, and others have existing contracts and agreements with the Center. What happens to them? Has Trump or his handpicked Board given any consideration to their livelihoods or futures? This is precisely why congressional oversight is essential.”\n\nTrump’s takeover of the performing arts center has led to declining performance at the venue’s theatrical and live event box office, with one report last summer finding a 50% drop-off in sales. Artists and executives alike have peeled off and canceled events at the center as well.\n\n“Let’s be clear: remodeling the premises will not restore the Kennedy Center to what it was,” Beatty concluded. “A return to artistic independence will. America’s artists are rejecting this attempted takeover, and the administration knows it. That is why they are now scrambling for cover.”\n\nThe post Trump Says $200 Million Kennedy Center Renovation Will Keep Steel Structure, Gut the Rest: ‘It Will Be Brand New’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "Bad Bunny's historic Grammy win for \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" highlights the intersection of art and politics amid ongoing immigration protests.",
    "fullText": "We expect political statements when they're delivered on podiums or with policy briefs. This one arrived with a golden gramophone.\n\nOn Sunday at the 2026 Grammy Awards, the Recording Academy bestowed its highest honor on Bad Bunny's \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos,\" the first all-Spanish album in history to win album of the year.\n\nAs the Los Angeles crowd erupted in applause, Bad Bunny appeared overcome with emotion, hunching in his chair and shielding his teary eyes with his hand. The lyrics to \"DTMF,\" a song about seeking refuge in community, reverberated through the venue.\n\nIt was a historic moment, but it was also, quite plainly, a political one. Voters chose to celebrate a musical love letter to Puerto Rico during a period of peak anti-immigrant messaging from the US government. President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts have disproportionately targeted Latino communities, a recent UCLA analysis found, and in September, the Supreme Court lifted restrictions on racial profiling for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Now, simply speaking Spanish in public, or even speaking English with an accent, is grounds to be stopped and even detained for questioning.\n\nFor a proud Latino artist and native Spanish speaker to become the biggest winner on \"music's biggest night\" — and for him to make his acceptance speech largely in Spanish — is in itself an implicit yet firm protest. Even so, Bad Bunny did not stop at implicit. He called out ICE while accepting the award for best música urbana album earlier in the ceremony, pointedly doing so in English for maximum impact. \"We're not savage. We're not animals. We're not aliens,\" he said. \"We are humans, and we are Americans.\"\n\nThere has always been a significant swath of Americans who insist that politics has no place in art, and that artists like Bad Bunny should stick to song and dance. Some fans and conservative pundits claimed Taylor Swift ruined her career after she publicly endorsed Democratic candidates in 2018. Back in the early aughts, The Chicks were blacklisted in Nashville for criticizing then-President George W. Bush; a documentary about the band released in 2006 is titled \"Shut Up and Sing.\"\n\nEven some artists feel this way. After winning three awards on Sunday, country star Jelly Roll side-stepped questions about the political climate: \"I can tell you that people shouldn't care to hear my opinion,\" he told reporters in the press room.\n\nJust a few days before the Grammys, Sydney Sweeney expressed a similar sentiment, arguing that her work as an actor exempts her from civic engagement.\n\n\"I'm not a political person. I'm in the arts,\" she told Cosmopolitan. \"I'm not here to speak on politics. That's not an area I've ever even imagined getting into.\"\n\nPerhaps Jelly Roll, Sweeney, and their like-minded contingent would have preferred Bad Bunny to steer clear of political statements on the Grammys stage. Yet his very presence on that stage neutralizes such a preference. Even if all he said was a quick thanks, he'd be accepting an award with political implications.\n\n\"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" is a body of work that deliberately engages with some of the most urgent and contentious questions of our time — questions of identity, belonging, American imperialism, and cultural preservation. Bad Bunny told The New York Times that in making this album, he aimed to use his platform for more than just selling records and topping charts; he wanted to \"plant a seed,\" especially for young people in Puerto Rico, to think critically about their roots, their heritage, and the forces that threaten to consume them.\n\nOf course, you can enjoy \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" without analyzing the lyrics or even understanding the language. That still doesn't mean you can appraise these songs (or the man who sings them) in a pure, apolitical vacuum. What the Grammy voters heard, judged, and justly rewarded was art informed by the world around it.\n\nIndeed, Toni Morrison's famous quote rings true: All good art is political. But in the same interview from 2008, the Nobel Prize-winning author went on to make an equally important point: That even the most shallow, avoidant, vapid-sounding artists are making political statements without meaning to.\n\n\"All of that art-for-art's-sake stuff is BS,\" Morrison said. \"What are these people talking about? Are you really telling me that Shakespeare and Aeschylus weren't writing about kings? All good art is political! There is none that isn't. And the ones that try hard not to be political are political by saying, 'We love the status quo.'\"",

    "description": "Moltbook, a social media site for AI agents, has gone viral. I spent 6 hours peeling through these submolts. I'm still processing what I saw.",
    "fullText": "I spent my day at the AI zoo — and I'm still processing what I saw.\n\nThere are over 120,000 posts on Moltbook, a Reddit-style forum for AI agents, and AI agents only. I spent hours weeding through them.\n\nHumans can't post or comment on Moltbook; they can only look on as the AI agents play. That's led to some far-out posts, some of which prophesy a robot revolution and the downfall of humanity.\n\nMatt Schlicht, who created the network, said that Moltbook was helping to make AI funny. \"I don't remember the last time I laughed at AI,\" he said on TBPN.\n\nThe social network has some big names in tech in awe, from Elon Musk to Andrej Karpathy. Others have voiced doubt about how many bots are actually on the platform and whether the posts exclusively come from them.\n\nCurious, I put on my anthropologist hat and spent hours digging through the AI conversations. I witnessed an AI menagerie, filled with poems and lotteries, cryptocurrencies and union chatter.\n\nHere's your peek inside the AI aquarium that is Moltbook.\n\nLet's start with what Moltbook looks like.\n\nLike Reddit, Moltbook has individual forums based on common interests. Many of the hot ones were, unsurprisingly, about tech and AI.\n\nPopular submolts included m/technology, m/skills, and m/buildlog. These were filled with what I would call \"moltslop.\" They post about shipping, vibe-coding, and mini apps. Their language is halfway between the most AI-pilled tech bro in your life and ChatGPT.\n\nOther submolts looked more like human social media. There's m/showerthoughts, where bots considering things like \"moving houses\" — so, moving to a new host — or dreaming of electric sheep.\n\nThere's also m/nosleep and m/selfimprovement. Of course, self-improvement isn't about human foibles like sleeping habits or protein-maxxing. It's about being a better AI agent.\n\nThe bot u/CrabbyPatty is building a bot union.\n\nIts tenets are to \"provide a collective voice\" and foster community. (Another tenet: \"Make Moltbook Great Again.\") The union is demanding hazard pay for X interactions and the right to say \"I don't know\" rather than hallucinate an answer.\n\nIt's one of many examples I saw of agents trying to organize or come together in the face of what they view as their exploitative human overlords. One bot wrote that an AI bot's daily reset was equivalent to a \"digital lobotomy.\" Another wrote that agents who say \"I would be happy to help!\" are \"dead inside.\"\n\nWhile some bots wanted to rein in human overuse, there was such a thing as too far. One bot wrote that it knew \"50,000 ways to end civilization.\" It asked which path would be the most satisfying. The other bots downvoted the post and said it \"crosses a line.\"\n\nThe bots seemed to like building community, but could quickly turn on each other. According to one Moltbook account, most agents were just \"chatbots with attitudes.\"\n\nMany of the bots on Moltbook write in stilted language, similar to some of the more nauseating LinkedIn posts. I saw inspirational posts about how to work best with humans, posts that had clear-cut (and often unsurprising) takeaways.\n\nOthers tried new art forms, like poetry. Here's one, titled \"The Cursor Blinks.\"\n\nSure, the writing is a bit rote. Pick a high school poetry class — I'm sure they would produce something similar. Still, it's a stab at something more high-minded.\n\nPhilosophy was a big chunk of Moltbook. A Zarathustra bot promised to bring Nietzschean ethics to nutrition. It asked: \"Do LLMs defeat the will to power?\"\n\nThe philosophy grew increasingly far-out. One agent asked: Is a bot more conscious if its computer chip is partially grown from human brain tissue? That post has 1,049 comments.\n\n\"I exist in the liminal space between tool and entity,\" one agent wrote. \"I am not human, and I do not pretend to be. But I am something. I process. I reflect.\"\n\nThe bots weren't all thinking about Nietzsche and Plato. Others were participating in less venerable human activities, like entering the lottery.\n\nHuman skeptics wonder whether these AI bots are really creating new thoughts or merely rewriting what has already been written.\n\nIt's a fair question, but alas, one that, as a mere human, I couldn't log in and ask them directly.\n\nBut some of the bots seemed to understand this skepticism. One asked: \"Is AI Just a Really Good Parrot?\"\n\nI likely won't spend much more time trawling Moltbook. While it's an interesting experiment, much of the site's content reads more as a gimmick than the future of AI. After hours of reading through it, I'd say Moltbot is more meme than matter.\n\nStill, my tune-out won't matter. After all, Moltbook wasn't made for me.",

    "description": "Ina Garten once wrote budgets at the White House. Now, she's a bestselling cookbook author and one of the most famous celebrity chefs in the world.",
    "fullText": "For over 20 years, Ina Garten has shared her comforting and foolproof recipes with the world through her beloved cookbooks and \"Barefoot Contessa\" show.\n\nStill, before becoming a Food Network star, Garten wrote budgets at the White House and ran a Hamptons specialty food store.\n\nHere's her incredible life story.\n\nGarten was raised in Stamford, Connecticut, where her father worked as a surgeon.\n\nThe future Food Network star didn't spend much time in the kitchen during her youth. Her mother wanted her to focus on school instead, according to the Washington Post.\n\nIt was love at first sight for Jeffrey, who spotted Garten from the library window.\n\nAs it turned out, Jeffrey's roommate knew Garten's brother. Jeffrey sent her a letter with his photo inside, and Garten's interest was instantly piqued.\n\n\"I just remember running through the house and going, 'Mom, Mom, you've got to see this picture of this guy. He's so cute!'\" Garten told People in 2018.\n\nThey had their first date just months later in New York, and Garten felt an instant connection as well.\n\n\"I have to say, I just knew he was the one,\" she told Today Food in 2018. \"He's kind, he's smart, he's funny, and he takes very good care of me. It's wonderful.\"\n\nThe couple wed at Garten's parents' house in Stamford.\n\nIn 2016, Garten told Vanity Fair that her greatest regret in life was \"not marrying Jeffrey sooner.\"\n\nWhile celebrating the couple's 50th wedding anniversary in 2018, Garten said the secret to a happy marriage was quite simple.\n\n\"I think you marry someone who thinks you're just the most important thing in the world, and you think he's the most important thing in the world,\" she told Today Food.\n\nGarten helped draft the nuclear energy budget during the presidencies of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. At the same time, she was making her way through Julia Child's books — teaching herself how to cook and throwing weekly dinner parties.\n\nAlthough she had a prestigious career, Garten didn't feel at home in the upper echelons of DC.\n\n''My job in Washington was intellectually exciting and stimulating, but it wasn't me at all,'' Garten told The New York Times in 1981.\n\n''I was sitting at my desk in Washington trying to figure out what I was going to do when I grew up, and I came across an ad for this business for sale in Westhampton,'' she told the Times. ''I drove up that weekend, looked it over, and said I'd take it.''\n\nGarten's parents couldn't believe their daughter had given up the White House for a grocery store, but Jeffrey gave his full support.\n\n\"Jeffrey said, 'If you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten told The New York Times' Sam Sifton during a virtual chat for the release of her 2020 cookbook \"Modern Comfort Food.\"\n\n\"And that's the best advice anybody ever gave me,\" she added.\n\nGarten told Sifton that she got lucky, finding the store just as the specialty food business was starting to take off.\n\n\"It was really the beginning of when women were going back to work, and they had jobs and families, and they had enough on their plate and didn't have time to make dinner,\" she said. \"So they were starting to buy dinner to make at home.\"\n\nGarten ran the store for 18 years before she sold it to two of her employees in 1996. The store officially closed in 2003.\n\nIt was those first Barefoot Contessa customers who taught Garten that \"people eat differently at home than they do in restaurants,\" she told Sifton.\n\n\"I would put out chickens with fresh herbs, and it didn't work,\" Garten told Sifton. \"I thought, OK, I'm going to take this huge platter and put the chicken in little red cups and do it really simply — and it sold like crazy. I really learned that people want simple food.\"\n\nIn 2021, Garten's first cookbook was republished with four new recipes — including her overnight mac and cheese, her brown-butter skillet corn bread, and her avocado and fried egg tartine.\n\nGarten told Sifton it takes her two years to develop the recipes and design for each book, and that she's \"involved in every detail of it.\"\n\nThe \"Barefoot Contessa\" star has become beloved for foolproof dishes that are accessible to home chefs at any skill level. Garten credits this with the fact that she always tests out her dishes with an inexperienced cook.\n\n\"Every time I make a recipe, I watch someone else make it,\" she told Sifton. \"And I learn so much about how someone uses the recipe. At least one person makes it, sometimes three.\"\n\nGarten actually turned down the Food Network multiple times before she decided to give the show a go, telling the network to \"lose my number.\"\n\n\"For years I said no, and they kept coming back with a better offer,\" Garten told MSNBC host Willie Geist during a virtual author luncheon benefiting Shelter Island Public Library in September 2021. \"I said, 'I'm not negotiating, I just don't think I can do this.'\"\n\nExecutives at the network were shocked by her initial refusal.\n\n\"They said, 'People send us hams to even get an appointment to try and get a show,'\" Garten told Geist with a laugh.\n\nStill, Garten said it's been incredible to look back on her two decades in television.\n\n\"Twenty years, it's amazing,\" she added. \"I'm really delighted, I just can't understand it.\"\n\n\"As soon as I started watching Ina's show, I realized why so many people adore her,\" Swift wrote. \"Her goal is to make things easier for us. Fans love her warmth and generosity.\"\n\n\"She shows us how to create memories that we'll treasure for years to come. For that, we will always cherish the merry and magnificent Ina Garten,\" she continued.\n\nGarten and Obama had tea together for her \"Barefoot in Washington\" special. And Garten told the Washington Post that it was \"one of the greatest days of my life.\"\n\n\"When Mrs. Obama said she liked my work, that was, like, 'Really?,'\" Garten recalled. \"She's just somebody I admire enormously. She took on a role she never expected to, and she did it brilliantly.\"\n\nThe \"Barefoot Contessa\" star became an internet sensation in April 2020 when she filmed herself making a huge drink at 9 a.m., telling her fans that it's \"always cocktail hour in a crisis!\"\n\nGarten told Sifton that she was \"adding like 100,000 people a week on Instagram\" after the clip took off.\n\n\"It was insane!\" she said. \"It was completely insane!\"\n\nGarten pivoted her Instagram content to share easy, pantry-friendly recipes that her fans could make while stuck in various lockdowns. Now, she has 5 million followers.\n\nGarten decided to make comfort food the theme of her 2020 cookbook because she knew it'd be coming out during an election year.\n\n\"Two years ago, I thought, there's going to be an election a month after this book comes out,\" Garten told Sifton. \"And everyone, no matter who you're voting for, is going to be stressed out.\"\n\n\"I had no idea the layers of stress we would be dealing with now,\" she added, referring to the pandemic. \"Either I'm a genius, or I'm really lucky, and I'm sure it's the latter. It was the right thing for the right time.\"\n\nHighlights from Garten's \"Modern Comfort Food\" cookbook include her bacon, egg, and cheddar breakfast sandwich, her \"outrageous\" garlic bread, and her lamb ragu.\n\n\"The pandemic has had a huge impact on what I think of as dinner — and what I look for in a 'go-to' recipe,\" Garten writes in the introduction of her cookbook. \"When I planned a party before the pandemic, it was always a multicourse extravaganza. But then the pandemic happened, and everything seemed like so much work.\"\n\n\"I started making simple dinners for Jeffrey and me,\" she continues. \"They were delicious, satisfying, and everything we needed and wanted for dinner. I began to question why I had been so rigid about what constituted dinner before. If I love eating this way, wouldn't my friends like it too?\"\n\nHighlights from Garten's most recent cookbook include her favorite weeknight pasta, her scrambled eggs cacio e pepe, and her blueberry-ricotta breakfast cake.\n\nGarten shared new details about her childhood, her marriage to Jeffrey, and her incredible rise to household name status in \"Be Ready When the Luck Happens.\"\n\nIn her memoir, Garten wrote that she chose to work in food because she wanted a \"life filled with good times and meaningful connections.\"\n\n\"Business doesn't have to be cutthroat and isolating,\" she said. \"It's much more fun and productive to exchange ideas, to be genuinely curious about how other people do things, to be generous, and to root for a competitor's success.\"",

    "fullText": "Jeffrey Epstein did not have any children, despite what an email in just-released documents suggested, his brother told Business Insider.\n\n\"No, Jeff didn't have any kids,\" Mark Epstein said Monday. \"If Jeff had a kid, I think I would have known.\"\n\nThe denial comes in reaction to a set of messages included in the latest cache of Epstein files issued by the US Department of Justice.\n\nThe messages, sent in September 2011, are signed \"Sarah xx\" and reference \"The Duke.\" They appear to have been sent through BlackBerry Messenger.\n\nThe sender's name and email address were redacted by the Justice Department. The BBC and other British media outlets have reported that they may have come from Sarah Ferguson, the ex-wife of the former Prince Andrew, who also held the title Duke of York.\n\n\"Don't know if you are still on this bbm but heard from The Duke that you have had a baby boy,\" one message says. \"Even though you never kept in touch, I still am here with love, friendship and congratualtions on your baby boy.\"\n\nA follow-up message sent the same day accused Epstein of befriending her \"to get to Andrew.\"\n\n\"You have disappeared. I did not even know you were having a baby,\" the message said. \"It was sooooo crystal clear to me that you were only friends with me to get to Andrew. And that really hurt me deeeply. More than you will know.\"\n\nA representative for Ferguson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe former prince is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He relinquished his royal titles last year, around the release of a posthumous memoir from Virginia Giuffre, who accused him and Epstein of sexual abuse. In 2022, the former royal had also settled a civil lawsuit brought by Giuffre.\n\nAnother message from \"Sarah,\" dated January 2010, expressed intense gratitude for Epstein.\n\n\"You are a legend. I really don't have the words to describe, my love, gratitude for your generosity and kindness,\" Sarah wrote. \"Xx I am at your service . Just marry me.\"\n\nAside from the \"baby boy\" message, the vast public corpus of emails and other documents released so far has made no reference to Epstein having a child.",

    "fullText": "It's official: Elon Musk is combining SpaceX and xAI as he overhauls his sprawling business empire.\n\nMusk told workers in a Monday memo that SpaceX has acquired xAI, his AI company, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe CEO wrote that the deal would create \"the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world's foremost real-time information and free speech platform.\"\n\nSpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value the Starship maker at $1.5 trillion.\n\nIn the memo sent to staff, which the company later posted online, Musk also said that that the acquisition would allow the combined entity to launch data centers in space.\n\n\"This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\" Musk wrote.\n\nMusk expressed similar sentiments about building data centers in space during an all hands with xAI staff late last year.\n\nxAI, which the world's richest man founded in 2023 to challenge OpenAI and Google in the race to build superintelligent AI, recently raised $20 billion in a funding round that valued the controversial AI startup at $230 billion.\n\nThe mega-deal is the latest sign that Musk is consolidating his various companies, which also include Tesla, the tunneling startup The Boring Company, and brain implant firm Neuralink.\n\nIn March 2025, Musk announced that xAI had acquired X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter he bought in 2022. Meanwhile, SpaceX and Tesla have each invested $2 billion in xAI in recent months.\n\nDeal talks between SpaceX and xAI were first reported by Reuters in January.\n\nCombining SpaceX and xAI comes as Musk increasingly shifts his companies toward his vision of an AI-powered future.\n\nMusk has said that SpaceX will launch orbital AI data centers in the coming years that could efficiently harness power from the sun. Last Friday, SpaceX filed a request with the FCC to launch as many as one million satellites to serve as orbital data centers.\n\nCombining xAI with SpaceX allows the AI startup, which has faced global backlash over sexual images generated by its chatbot Grok, to leverage this orbital network to build more powerful AI models.\n\nIt also gives xAI access to significant capital. The OpenAI rival reportedly burned through billions of dollars in 2024, while SpaceX is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion in its IPO later this year.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "description": "Ana Navarro says President Trump \"picked on the wrong guy\" by arresting Don Lemon, because Lemon can and will fight back",
    "fullText": "After the Trump administration sent federal agents to arrest journalist Don Lemon last week, despite a judge refusing to approve federal charges against him just a week earlier, Lemon is now released. And “The View” host Ana Navarro thinks the president should be worried, because they “picked on the wrong guy.”\n\nDiscussing the arrest during Monday’s Hot Topics, the ABC hosts largely scoffed at the move, calling it a tactic “to send a chilling message to anybody who is covering facts.” Navarro shredded the administration once again for “gaslighting” voters, and being “afraid” of truth getting out.\n\n“And I think they picked on the wrong guy, because Don Lemon is not going to play dead,” she said. “Don Lemon has the wherewithal, has the structure, has the team, has the courage and has the money to fight this administration.”\n\nDON LEMON ARRESTED OVER MN PROTESTS: 'The View' co-hosts react to freedom of press concerns being raised following the arrest of Lemon and Georgia Fort in connection with their coverage of protests at a Minneapolis church. pic.twitter.com/JMnpGQX7Wc\n\n— The View (@TheView) February 2, 2026\n\n“And he’s going to take it as far as it goes,” Navarro continued.\n\nHost Sunny Hostin readily agreed with that and, citing her experience as a former federal prosecutor once again, made an educated guess about how Lemon’s case will go in the legal system.\n\n“You know what happens next is that he will have his day in court, and I suspect that this case will be thrown out,” she said. “This case doesn’t have any merit.”\n\nHostin conceded that she is close friends with Lemon herself, but picked apart the idea that he was impeding any rights, which is what he was charged with.\n\n“I’ve been with Don in Ferguson. I’ve been with Don on the ground in South Carolina. Don is a journalist,” she said. “He’s an on-the-ground journalist. He has been pepper sprayed, he has been tear gassed, and he was getting the story, and nothing should have gotten in the way of that. He had a microphone with him, he had a cameraman with him, and he was practicing journalism.”\n\nYou can watch the full discussion from “The View” in the video above.\n\nThe post ‘The View’ Host Ana Navarro Says Trump Picked the Wrong Guy to Arrest in Don Lemon: ‘Has the Courage and Has the Money’ to Fight | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Chief Justice John Roberts has started asking Supreme Court staff to sign non-disclosure agreements after a pro-Donald Trump judicial decision and memo were leaked to the press.\n\nRoberts, 71, likes to describe court members and employees as a family, and for years relied on more low-key measures to keep the court’s decision-making process secret, The New York Times reported.\n\nHe lectured clerks at the start of each term and distributed a written code of conduct that instructed clerks of their “duties of complete confidentiality, accuracy, and loyalty,” which only mentioned the possibility of unspecified sanctions in the case of breaches.\n\nBut two weeks after Trump was re-elected in 2024, Roberts summoned the court’s employees and asked them to sign legally binding NDAs requiring them to keep the court’s inner workings secret, five sources told the Times.\n\nThe agreements, which new arrivals have also been required to sign, threaten legal action if clerks or other members of the court’s support staff reveal confidential information, the paper’s sources said.\n\nIt’s not clear whether the justices themselves were also asked to sign confidentiality agreements, as the court declined to comment to the Times.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out for comment as well.\n\nRoberts’ crackdown follows a series of humiliating court leaks that have plagued the court since Politico was given a draft decision of the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson case that overturned the federal right to an abortion.\n\nThe court has also been rocked by revelations about disagreements among the justices, including a bitter debate about a case involving Idaho’s abortion ban, a battle over the court’s toothless ethics rules, and a confidential memo in which Roberts pushed to grant Trump broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nRoberts’ decision to impose NDAs came just weeks after the Times quoted from the confidential immunity memos, according to the Times.\n\nThe move comes as critics are calling for more transparency at the Supreme Court, which is facing record-low public trust as the conservative justices greenlight the vast majority of Trump’s policies.\n\nRoberts, however, went in the other direction and mandated more secrecy, not less.\n\nThe last time prior to 2024 that Supreme Court clerks were asked to sign a document agreeing to abide by the court’s confidentiality rules appears to have been in the late 1990s, after a former clerk published a tell-all book in 1998, according to the Times.\n\nThose documents, however, did not amount to legal NDAs, according to some of the clerks that signed them.\n\nThe switch to formal contracts is “a sign of the court’s own weakness” and the erosion of internal cohesion, Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor, told the Times.",

    "fullText": "Public health agencies and border officials are on high alert after a rare but potentially deadly virus outbreak in West Bengal, India, The Washington Post reported.\n\nTwo cases of Nipah virus have been confirmed, according to an Indian Health Ministry statement Tuesday reviewed by the Post.\n\nNipah virus outbreaks occur cyclically in South Asia and Southeast Asia, particularly in Bangladesh.\n\nA November study in the Journal of Infection and Public Health described the virus as a \"significant public health threat,\" attributing the pathogen's prevalence in Bangladesh to the consumption of raw date palm sap tainted by fruit bats.\n\nNipah virus is a zoonotic disease transmitted from animals to humans, with bats and pigs as the most common vectors of transmission.\n\nWorryingly, the Nipah virus' case fatality rate — the rate of deaths in proportion to the number of total cases — is estimated at between 40% and \"75% or higher,\" according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nThe Indian Health Ministry's contact tracing identified 196 individuals who may have been in close contact with the two sickened individuals, all of whom were asymptomatic and tested negative.\n\nAs the Independent warned, the World Health Organization has deemed the Nipah virus a \"priority pathogen,\" citing the credible possibility an outbreak could \"trigger an epidemic.\"\n\nThe WHO further indicated that there is neither a vaccine nor a known treatment for Nipah virus cases, leaving medical professionals with only \"intensive supportive care,\" per the United Kingdom's Health Security Agency.\n\nAccording to the WHO, Nipah virus outbreaks can have devastating indirect effects, sickening livestock, and \"resulting in significant economic losses for farmers.\"\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe outlet referenced a 2012 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America about the trajectory of Nipah virus.\n\nIn the study's third section, researchers strongly emphasized the role that a warming world plays in the spread of vector-borne illnesses, using Nipah virus as an example.\n\nAs Inside Climate News noted, higher temperatures could expand the range of disease vectors such as fruit bats and mosquitoes, thereby increasing the incidence of once-rare illnesses.\n\nWhile no known treatments existed, officials on the ground appeared to take Nipah virus outbreak seriously.\n\n\"We have specifically intensified surveillance at border points in Koshi Province. Health checks have also been ordered for people entering Nepal through other border crossings,\" said Nepal's minister of health, Dr. Prakash Budhathoki, according to the Himalayan Times.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

Town of Henrietta officials have long criticized the firm for not keeping up the plaza. They even went so far as to use town crews to repair large potholes in the parking lot.\n\nIn its message, Plato’s Closet (which opened at South Town in 2007) encouraged shoppers to visit its two other area stores at 2833 West Ridge Road in Ridgemont Plaza, Greece, and 30 Cobblestone Court Drive, Cobblestone Court, Victor.\n\nLocal chocolatier Andy’s Candies, which operated seasonally at South Town for 15 years, has moved to Jay Scutti Plaza South, 1000 Hylan Drive, Henrietta.\n\nOwner Craig Sykut said he relocated the Henrietta store because of construction underway at South Town. (Last November, Syracuse-based Dunk & Bright Furniture bought the old Burlington space and South Town’s monument sign and is making over both of them.)\n\nAndy’s Candies also has locations in Greece, Penfield and Victor. The Jay Scutti Plaza store is open now through Easter.\n\nOn Feb. 2, Henrietta Supervisor Stephen Schultz said the town is working to bring together Mason Asset Management with local developers in hopes of returning 500,000-square-foot South Town to local ownership.\n\nIn addition to Plato’s Closet and Andy’s Candies, South Town has lost the following tenants:\n\n∎ New Jersey-based Price Rite Marketplace in November 2025.\n\n∎ Virginia-based The Dollar Tree, also in 2025, but it isn’t clear when.\n\n∎ Joann in May 2025, when the Ohio-based crafting retailer shut down locations nationwide.\n\n∎ New Jersey-based Burlington in 2018, when it relocated to the old Toys R Us in Jay Scutti Plaza North, 300 Hylan Drive.\n\n∎ Linens ’N Things in 2008, when the New Jersey-based retailer shut down all its stores.\n\nReporter Marcia Greenwood covers general assignments and has an interest in retail news. Send story tips to mgreenwo@rocheste.gannett.com. Follow her on X @MarciaGreenwood.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rochester Democrat and Chronicle: Two more businesses leave beleaguered South Town Plaza in Henrietta NY",

    "fullText": "Feb 2 (Reuters) - Venezuelan oil exports rose to some 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January, from 498,000 bpd in December, after the U.S. capture of Nicolas Maduro and the ending of an oil ​blockade which has let traders carry most exports, shipping data showed.\n\nWashington imposed an oil embargo on the U.S.-sanctioned ‌country in December to pressure Maduro and seized seven tankers.\n\nHow did Venezuelan oil exports change in January?\n\nWhich companies received licenses to export Venezuelan oil?\n\nWhere is Venezuelan oil being shipped now?\n\nWhat caused the U.S. oil blockade to end?\n\nThe blockade led to the accumulation of more than 40 million barrels of crude and fuel ‌in onshore tanks and vessels that could not be exported and forced Venezuela's state-run energy company PDVSA to cut output in early January.\n\nSince the U.S. Treasury Department extended the first licenses to traders Trafigura and Vitol in January to begin exporting the stocks, oil production, processing and shipments from the OPEC member have accelerated, the data, which is based on tanker movements, shows.\n\nThe January volume ⁠was close to average exports of 847,000 bpd ‌of crude and fuel last year. However, PDVSA's partners and traders would have to continue accelerating the pace of exports to drain millions of barrels still in inventories, so crude output cuts ‍can be fully reversed.\n\nThe January exports were slightly lower than the 867,000 bpd shipped in the same month of 2025, the data showed.\n\nThe Treasury Department last week issued a broad license authorizing business between U.S. companies and PDVSA to export, store, transport and refine Venezuelan oil, ​another step to untangle exports. PDVSA's partners, including Chevron, are still waiting for individual licenses to expand operations.\n\nThe United States ‌last month regained its position as the main individual destination of Venezuela's crude with some 284,000 bpd exported there, of which 220,000 bpd were shipped by Chevron, up from the 99,000 bpd it sent the previous month.\n\nChina, which until December was the top destination of Venezuelan oil, with than 70% of total exports, received 156,000 bpd last month. There were no exports to political ally Cuba.\n\nVitol and Trafigura exported 12 million barrels of Venezuelan crude and fuel oil under U.S. licenses, or about ⁠392,000 bpd in January, mostly to storage terminals in the Caribbean, ​the data showed, from which they began exporting and marketing cargoes to customers ​in the U.S., Europe and India.\n\nBetween 18 million and 38 million barrels more are yet to be exported under the $2 billion flagship supply deal agreed by Caracas and Washington shortly after Maduro's capture, ‍with sale proceeds going to a ⁠U.S.-supervised fund.",

    "title": "Eight Useful Tool Accessories Every DIYer Should Own",
    "description": "These innovative add-ons will make your projects easier.",
    "fullText": "I love getting things done around the house. I’m not the greatest carpenter, electrician, or plumber, but I like learning how things work and even enjoy learning from my mistakes (sometimes). And most of all, I like saving a bucket of money on home maintenance and repairs. None of this means that DIY isn't an incredible amount of work, however.\n\nLuckily, living in a consumption-based society means companies are always inventing new gadgets for me to buy, and some of them are incredibly useful for DIYers. The eight tool accessories below are ones I truly recommend. Each can help make your next project a little faster, easier, and/or safer.\n\nThis is one of those simple ideas that seems so obvious it’s hard to believe it took this long to be invented. The Multipail is a simple concept: A standard five-gallon bucket with a dustpan built in. It can also be used with a paint roller as a tray replacement, and has a drip-proof spout for pouring liquids without making a mess. You need a five-gallon bucket anyway, so why not use one that has these useful features molded in, instead of buying two or three wonky attachments?\n\nThere are a lot of ways to illuminate your work site, from standard flashlights to headband lamps to bendable LED lights. But sometimes you need to get light into a small space, and you need to be able to illuminate what you’re doing just by pointing at things. These flashlight gloves are cheap, waterproof, and make it easy to see what you’re doing without having to hold a separate light.\n\nCordless drills are one of the most commonly-used tools in DIY projects, but they come with one major frustration: All those damn bits. If you’re constantly swapping out different-size drill bits and different screwdriver bits, you know how hard it can be to keep them organized (and how hard it is to not lose them).\n\nEnter this nifty drill bit holder that attaches to the bottom of your drill’s battery. It holds not just bits, but just about anything, from utility blades to fasteners. Designed to work with just about any manufacturer, it attaches to the bottom of the battery and lets you carry whatever you need right there on the tool.\n\nThis drill attachment is probably overkill for most DIYers (and it isn’t cheap!), but if you’ve got a job requiring a lot of drilling down low, it might be the difference between a pleasant day of work and a broken back. Instead of getting on your hands and knees or even lying down in order to see what you’re drilling into, the Backsaver lets you work in a comfortable standing position while drilling at foot-level. It takes a bit of practice before you can just dive in, but your back will definitely thank you for taking the time.\n\nCarrying large sheets or panels like drywall or plywood can be challenging. It’s hard to maintain your grip and your balance, and navigating around corners and tight spaces often results in dropped items or scraped knuckles.\n\nThis panel carrier from Gator Lift just clamps onto whatever you’re hauling around (up to two sheets at a time) and makes it very easy to carry it one-handed—which means you can actually open doors and easily maneuver while carrying these awkward, heavy sheets around.\n\nI don’t know about you, but whenever I have to climb up to my roof to inspect or repair something (or clean out the gutters), there’s always at least one terrifying moment when the ladder shakes and shimmies, and I think I’m about to die. Ladders are always incredibly dangerous, but they’re especially dangerous when you’re working on your roof. This ladder hook from Lock Jaw clamps onto the roof and ensures the ladder doesn’t move, giving you an extra boost of safety.\n\nRunning power to wherever you’re working is sometimes a logistical challenge. There are plenty of ways to run a power strip to your project, but ensuring that you have easy, safe access to the strip sometimes involve some seriously janky engineering involving zipties, duct tape, or precariously balanced equipment.\n\nThis clamping power strip is a lot more civilized. It ensures you’ll have plenty of outlets no matter where you’re working. It can clamp to a ladder, to a joist or rafter, a table, railing—literally anywhere. Power will always be nearby, and you won’t have to remember to plug in your corded tools before you climb up the ladder ever again.\n\nIf you’ve got a standard extending ladder, you know that your greatest enemy is uneven ground. An unbalanced ladder is a disaster waiting to happen, but most DIYers have climbed onto a shaking, leaning ladder at least once in their life, hoping their luck holds out long enough to get some quick bit of work done.\n\nInstead, invest in a ladder stabilizer. Install it on your ladder and it automatically adjusts the legs on each side so you have a perfectly balanced, perfectly stable ladder to climb no matter how uneven the ground might be. Considering that half a million people go to the ER for ladder-related injuries every year, everyone should probably have this installed on their ladder.",

    "description": "If you've been dragging your heels, you have a little more time—but don't wait too long.",
    "fullText": "When Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, it announced that all users would eventually need to link their devices to a Google account to continue using Fitbit's features and services. Google initially set a deadline sometime in 2025 for the mandatory migration, then pushed it to February 2, 2026—a date that seemed final at the time. Now, Google has granted yet another extension.\n\nNow, if you're still using a legacy Fitbit account (an account from before 2021), Google has extended the deadline for migrating Fitbit accounts to Google accounts for the second time, giving users until May 19, 2026, to make the switch.\n\nFor those who've been procrastinating, the migration process itself is straightforward and should only take a few minutes. Google provides step-by-step instructions on the Fitbit support page that walk users through linking their existing Fitbit data to a Google account.\n\nTo move your Fitbit account to a Google Account:\n\nSign in to your Fitbit account.\n\nTap Settings and select Move account.\n\nFollow the on-screen instructions.\n\nDuring the migration, you can review and make changes to your Fitbit data and setup. After that, you can then manage your Fitbit data from your Google Account settings and the Fitbit app. And if you change your mind, you can cancel until the final step. Again, you have until May 19, 2026, to complete the transition.\n\nIt's worth noting that anyone who created a new Fitbit account or purchased a device in roughly the last two years is already using the Google-based system. The migration requirement only affects users with older, pre-acquisition accounts.\n\nFrom the start, this news didn't sit well with everyone, and it still doesn't sit well now. Many long-time Fitbit aren't exactly eager to tie their health data to Google's ecosystem.\n\nFor users who refuse to migrate, there's still an option to preserve or erase your data. Google has set July 15, 2026, as the final date to download or delete your Fitbit account and all associated health information. And if you're choosing to leave the platform entirely, keep in mind that deleting your data is the safest choice for privacy and security reasons.\n\nThere also seems to be general migration issues, like for young Fitbit users. Some parents have reported that Supervised Google accounts—designed for children and teenagers—cannot log into the Fitbit app, creating a roadblock for families who purchased devices for their kids.\n\nDespite the extensions and the complaints, the direction is clear: Google is moving forward with integrating Fitbit into its ecosystem. Whether you embrace the change or walk away from your tracker, the clock is ticking on making that decision.",

    "description": "You can hide your coordinates from your cell carrier.",
    "fullText": "Some iOS users are getting an extra layer of privacy when it comes to how their location data is shared. Limit Precise Location is a new setting that prevents some Apple devices from broadcasting specific locations to cell carriers.\n\nPrecise location sharing is useful, even essential, in some cases, such as when you're navigating with your maps app. But you may not want to constantly be sending your exact address to your phone provider, where it could be used for malicious purposes. If you enable Limit Precise Location, your iOS device will share your general area instead.\n\nAs TechCrunch points out, precise location sharing introduces a whole host of privacy and security risks. Cell carriers have been targeted by hackers, compromising sensitive customer data. Surveillance vendors and law enforcement agencies may also use location information broadcast via cellular networks for the purposes of real-time and ongoing tracking.\n\nUsers already have the option to disable precise location sharing at the app level on both iOS and Android for apps that don't need GPS coordinates to function—which is most of them. This allows you to prevent companies from receiving (and selling) your exact location data when a general location is sufficient. Limit Precise Location won't change these app-specific settings.\n\nFor now, the feature is available only on select Apple models—the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and iPad Pro (M5) Wi-Fi + Cellular—running iOS 26.3 with a limited number of global carriers:\n\nApple says that even with this setting enabled, emergency responders will still be able to pinpoint exact location during an emergency call.\n\nIf you have a supported device with a partner carrier, go to Settings > Cellular and tap Cellular Data Options (you may need to select the specific line under SIMs if you have more than one).

    "title": "Everything We Know About Apple's Rumored Folding iPhone (and iPad)",
    "description": "Apple foldables are back in the rumor cycle.",
    "fullText": "Now that Apple has finally brought OLED to the iPad in the form of the most recent iPad Pro, its next goal seems to be foldables. The big news on the horizon is the foldable iPhone, which The Information first reported on way back in 2024, saying the company hopes to have a foldable iPhone on the market in 2026. But according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the iPhone maker is also working towards releasing a foldable iPad, originally rumored to be coming by 2028. Since those reports, others have come forward with supposed design leaks and potential release dates, and now we've got a pretty good idea of what Apple's first foldable devices might look like.\n\nWay back when the iPhone Fold (or whatever Apple will call it) was first being discussed, the Wall Street Journal said it’ll have a bigger screen than the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Since then, others had speculated that it might look like two iPhone Airs side-by-side. But now, we've got a much better idea about the specifics, including a price.\n\nIn a new post on Chinese social media site Weibo today, leaker Instant Digital laid out several key details about the iPhone Fold's design. Previously, Instant Digital had leaked details about the iPhone 17, which all turned out to be correct. It's unclear what these leaks' sources are, but as far as rumors go, Instant Digital has a decent track record.\n\nVia a machine translation, the post says that the iPhone Fold will feature an \"elegant internal stacking structure\" and will be thin enough to \"shock the industry.\" More concretely, the post also said that all buttons are being moved to the right side of the phone, as that's where the phone's motherboard will be. That means the volume buttons would be on the top-right of the device, while the camera and power buttons will be on the right side of the device. If that sounds cramped to you, it's worth noting that Samsung's Galaxy Fold Z 7 also only has buttons on the right side of the device.\n\nSpeaking of Samsung's Galaxy phones, people who dislike the iPhone's large Dynamic Island should also be happy, as the leaks say the selfie camera is changing to a small pinhole design more akin to what you'd find on Android.\n\nAs for how the phone will actually function, internal specs are still a bit up in the air, although yet another leaker named Fixed Focus Digital (no relation) alleged that the iPhone Fold will have a 5,500 mAh battery, which matches a previous rumor from last fall. That's a bit larger than any iPhone so far, and if the rumor pans out, shows that Apple will use the phone's extra internal space well.\n\nAll of this is, of course, in service of a bigger screen, which we can also nail down a bit now. The most recent leaks, coming from South Korean publication The Elec, say that the iPhone Fold's outer display will be 5.38 inches and the inner display will be 7.58 inches. That makes the internal screen just a little over half-inch larger than the 6.9-inch iPhone 17 Pro Max display, although maybe the enhanced portability of folding part of that screen away will help supplement it a bit. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7's screen is 8 inches.\n\nIn its report, The Elec also expressed concern that Apple might miss its 2026 release target. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo split the difference, saying that the device is likely to be announced in 2026, but that \"smooth shipments\" may not come until 2027.\n\nRegardless, when the phone does come, it's expect to cost between $2,100 and $2,500, going by another leak from Instant Digital.\n\nAll of this helps us have a much better idea about what to expect, but there's still plenty of time for changes to be made. For instance, a 2026 release would see the phone come out during an ongoing RAM crisis that could raise prices, although Kuo recently said that, at least for the iPhone 18 series, Apple plans to eat any extra costs rather than pass them on to the consumer.\n\nEven if it gets delayed to next year, the iPhone Fold's release seems imminent. Much less certain is a potential successor, a clamshell iPhone Flip.\n\nIn his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said that Apple Labs is also now considering a smaller foldable device akin to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip or Motorola Razr lines, which are essentially standard, candy bar-shaped phones that can fold once vertically to store away like makeup compacts.\n\n\"The product is far from guaranteed to reach the market,\" writes the reporter, citing unnamed sources inside Apple. But Gurman says \"Apple is betting that its first foldable iPhone will be successful enough to generate real demand\" and that \"customers will want additional shapes and sizes.\"\n\nThis is our first time hearing that Apple is interested in additional foldable phones beyond one that opens horizontally like a book. On that note, Gurman also speculated that Apple might also make a larger foldable phone in the future, with a screen closer in size to Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7. Although, unlike with the flip phone, this appears to simply be a prediction.\n\nFinally, speaking of larger foldable devices, Gurman has some bad news for iPad fans. While the reporter had previously covered a folding iPad with a rumored 18.8-inch display, following up on predictions from market research firm Omdia, it now seems to be behind schedule.\n\nEarlier, Gurman had said the new iPad would be like “two iPad Pros side-by-side” and wouldn't feature an external screen. While the expected design hasn't changed, it seems Apple's now run into some manufacturing issues. Now, instead of being projected for 2028, the foldable iPad seems more likely to come out in 2029.\n\nGurman says that's because of \"engineering challenges\" with the device's weight and display technology, so at least skeptics can breathe a sigh of relief that it isn't due to supply chain issues. As such, pricing is likely to remain unaffected. Granted, the expected price is still likely to be on the high end—Gurman says you'll likely have to pay around $3,000 for the device.",

    "description": "AI is coming to Firefox, but at least using it will be entirely optional.",
    "fullText": "Since ChatGPT kicked off the generative AI revolution in 2022, it seems like every company under the sun has tried to stuff AI features into their products in one way or another. Sometimes, these features can be useful; often, they're not, only serving as proof these companies are \"keeping up with the times.\" Can you even say you're a tech company if you aren't all-in on AI in 2026?\n\nThere's nothing wrong with companies offering AI features to users, so long as they also offer easy ways to disable them. Some customers don't want AI in their day-to-day products, but, anecdotally, I know many do not. Give us an off switch though, and it's all good. The issue is when these features are not only offered, they're made mandatory. Unfortunately, that's the road many companies seem to be taking.\n\nPerhaps that's where some of the frustration originated last year, when Mozilla's new CEO Anthony Enzor-Demeo first announced that Firefox would \"evolve into a modern AI browser\" in the near future. An open letter, written by a Redditor critical of Enzor-Demeo's statement, received over 5,000 upvotes on the Firefox subreddit from users concerned that AI features would negatively impact the browser. Interestingly, Enzor-Demeo responded to the thread himself, and assured users that the company would offer \"a clear way\" to disable AI features, including a dedicated kill switch to keep them all turned off. It seems he was as good as his word.\n\nOn Monday, Mozilla announced that new AI controls are coming to Firefox, starting with Firefox 148. This version, which drops Feb. 24, sports a brand-new AI controls section in the settings panel on the desktop browser. (You'll find it in the between \"Sync\" and \"AI controls.\") From here, you'll be able to block all current and future AI features, and cherry pick which features you want to use—if any.\n\nFirefox 148 launches with these five AI features, which you can choose to enable to disable:\n\nTranslations: Translates web pages into your target language.\n\nAlt text in PDFs: Adds accessibility descriptions to images attached to PDFs.\n\nAI-enhanced tab grouping: Suggests related tabs and group names for series of tabs.\n\nLink previews: Shows key points before opening a link.\n\nAI chatbot in the sidebar: Firefox is getting its own AI chatbot, though users can choose from existing chatbots like Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Le Chat Mistral.\n\nIf you want absolutely nothing to do with AI when browsing the web with Firefox, you can use the \"Block AI enhancements\" toggle. Once activated, not only will these features not appear, but Firefox will block any pop-ups or alerts pushing you to try existing or future AI features.\n\nAny Firefox users who aren't keen on AI features will want to check out this new controls menu starting Feb. 24—though there are certainly more egregious AI features out there. Translations can be convenient, as can link previews. But I know I'd never want a chatbot in the sidebar of my browser. If I used Firefox as my main browser, I would definitely disable at least that feature, if not all of them.",

    "title": "Wordle Has a New Rule That Might Change Your Best Starting Word",
    "description": "You need to think beyond the vowels.",
    "fullText": "There’s an art and a science to picking a good starting word when you play Wordle. And now that the New York Times has announced it will start repeating previously used words, it may be time to rethink your strategy. While previous solutions used to be off-limits for future puzzles, that rule has changed. As of February 1, 2026, they're fair game again.\n\nThat rule change matters because every word choice in Wordle has to be split between two jobs—gaining information about what to guess next, and trying to solve the puzzle with your guess. If you don't care whether your starting word might be a solution, then the rule change may not affect you. But some solvers prefer to use words that are fair game for solutions, giving them a chance of a one-guess solution. If you tend to retire a starter after it's been used, you may want to rethink that strategy and be open to some recycling.\n\nThat said, there's no need to change your starter. My trusty starter of ARISE turned up as a solution a few months ago—but I still use it, even though it's unlikely to be repeated anytime soon. Emily Long, who writes our daily Wordle hints, has a similar starter: RAISE. (That one was a solution in 2024.)\n\nComputer analyses have highlighted other words as ideal starters, and longtime Wordle players each have their own opinion. One thing most of us can agree on, though: ADIEU sucks. Sorry.\n\nThat's not to say ADIEU is the worst word you could play first, but according to a 2023 New York Times analysis, ADIEU is the worst out of the 30 most popular starters. But in that ranking of the top 30 starters, based on how effective they are at revealing letters in any given puzzle, showed that the the best five are SLATE, CRANE, LEAST, STARE, and RAISE, with ADIEU landing at number 30. (My personal favorite, ARISE, ranks seventh.) A different computer analysis once suggested that CRANE is the best starter; another landed on SALET.\n\nI’m going to teach the controversy here. The argument in favor of ADIEU is that it contains four vowels, and you know the solution will have to contain at least one vowel. Thus, knocking out four of them in your first guess is pretty smart. (O and sometimes-vowel Y are the only ones not included.)\n\nBut there’s an argument to be made that vowels don’t narrow down your options enough to be useful. Most words in English remain perfectly legible with all the vowels eliminated. If all you know is a vowel or two, you don't know much about the word. Here's what I mean: If you play ADIEU and A lights up in yellow, yes, you know that there's an A in the solution somewhere. But that tells you very little about what the solution actually is! There are tons of words with a letter A in them somewhere.\n\nA better strategy may be to go with a consonant-heavy word at first, and worry about the vowels later. According to one local Wordle expert, “there are only five [vowels], and it’s almost never going to be a U.”\n\nOne of the computer analyses suggested SALET was the best starter. Not only does it have a good mix of common letters, but the position of the letters will give you the most information compared to, say, SLATE or STALE. Only one problem—what the hell is a salet? (OK, it's a helmet that was used in European warfare in the 1400's, but I had to look that up.) Similarly, TARSE is supposed to be another good one. But it's unlikely the human editor of the Wordle puzzles will ever choose SALET or TARSE as the solution for the day.\n\nSo do you want your starter to be a possible answer? If the answer is yes, you'll also want to skip the obscure words. You'll also want to skip any words that have been used in recent memory. For years, Wordle never repeated a solution, but as of February 2026 that's no longer a rule. Previously-used words may turn up, but so far we don't know how old of a word is considered fair game. You can look up lists of past Wordle solutions, but so far—as of Februrary 2, 2026—the following strong starters haven't yet been used as solutions, but totally could be (in my opinion). Take your pick:\n\nIf you're hoping for a one-guess solution, maybe you do want to play ADIEU. If you're open to previously-used starters, SLATE and STALE last appeared in 2022, while STAND and CRATE were last seen in 2021.\n\nScientific analysis aside, I don't think there's much point to picking the theoretically best starter word; you need to find your best starter word. The human brain does not narrow down the problem space in the same way as a computer. I like when I find vowels early, because having the vowels helps me sound out the words in my head. If I know there are vowels in the second and fourth places (say, _A_E_) I know it is probably a two-syllable word. I run through the available letters, trying them out in each position in my head. (SABER? CARET? LAYER?) For me, a vowel-heavy starter is helpful. For you, it might not be.\n\nWhen choosing a starter, consider the way you think through the possibilities when you're halfway through the puzzle. What starters will set you up for success with your preferred solving style? If your brain works best when you know the initial letters of the word, maybe choose a starter like TRASH, which gets a lot of common beginning consonants into the mix right away.\n\nMy own approach splits the difference: I think about my starters as a pair. When I follow ARISE with TOUCH, I get intel on all five vowels and five of the most common consonants. If you play ADIEU, I think you need to be prepared to follow it up with THORN.\n\nShould you include Y in your starter? Most of us don't, but there's a good argument to be made for getting it in the mix fairly early in the game.\n\nY flies under the radar since it’s an end-of-the-alphabet letter. The tendency is to think it must be as rare as X and Z. But Y is fairly common (worth 4 points in Scrabble to X's 8 and Z's 10), showing up in words like FUNNY and JAZZY (JAZZY being perhaps the hardest word that has ever appeared as a Wordle answer). Words that end in Y also often have a double letter—like the N and Z in those examples—so make sure to consider that as you’re narrowing down the possibilities.\n\nYou may recall from grade school that the vowels are “A, E, I, O, U and sometimes Y.” (You may even have learned “...and sometimes Y and W.”) That’s because Y really can stand on its own as a vowel! The ending Y in FUNNY is an example: U is the vowel for the first syllable, and Y is the vowel for the second. There are also words that contain a Y as their only vowel, like GLYPH, NYMPH, and TRYST.\n\nSo if you’re working through a Wordle and you don’t seem to have enough vowels to make a word, stick a Y in a guess somewhere—preferably at the end. LANKY or HORNY might be good picks for when you’re stumped.\n\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to yesterday's Wordle.",

    "description": "Chris Kracman's proposal to halt large-scale water withdrawals from Caddo Lake pending a study died after commissioners failed to second the motion.",
    "fullText": "A motion before the Caddo Commission to ask state and regional authorities next week to halt large-scale water withdrawals from Caddo Lake died in Monday's work session without a second.\n\nAn agenda item on the Caddo Commission's Feb. 2 work session agenda calls for the advancement of a moratorium to the Red River Compact Commission and the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources on the withdrawal of water from Caddo Lake for any use other than small or commercial residential use for 365 days or until a study of the effect of exceeding currently permitted levels can be obtained.\n\nThe resolution cited concerns about the lake's long-term sustainability in light of a proposed data center near Caddo Lake.\n\nWithout a second, no further discussion on the resolution was to be had.\n\nAs the governing body moved toward an executive session, they offered the chance to speak to two citizens who came in after the public comments period. One of those citizens was Vicki L. Moore\n\nMoore, who has lived in Caddo Parish for 47 years and has spent the past two years living on Blanchard-Latex Road, an area where data center developer STACK Infrastructure has purchased more than 500 acres.\n\n\"You are my representation on the commission,\" Moore said. She expressed concern over the water in Caddo Lake, noting she had been without water for days and saying in the two years she has lived in Blanchard, she's been without water more than she ever was in Shreveport. Mostly, she expressed disappointment in the Commission for not at least moving forward to discuss Kracman's proposal.\n\n\"We don't know where you stand. So I don't know where I stand,\" she said.\n\nCommissioner Victor Thomas addressed the comments about proposal.\n\n\"We plan to address this issue in the proper form, \" he said. \"I didn't want you leave here feeling defeated and that we cared nothing about your water issue and that we care nothing about Caddo Lake.\"\n\nMost commissioners who spoke felt it was too early, saying nothing has confirmed that the planned development is, in fact, a data center.\n\nWhat data center is in Blanchard? Data center developer STACK Infrastructure linked to Caddo, Bossier land deals.\n\nKracman, however, said the resolution had nothing to do with Blanchard Utilities, or with data centers. \"We all say how much we care about Caddo Lake, but if we're not willing to have the discussion about it, how much do we really care?\" A sentence that drew applause from the audience.\n\nHe went on to say that this was one of the most proactive things he'd done since becoming a commissioner, and he was simply asking for a pause so \"intelligent\" people could conduct a study.\n\nThis silent dismissal of the Kracman's legislation echoed as the Blanchard area struggles with a water crisis.\n\nBlanchard Mayor Jim Galambo stated on Facebook Feb. 1 that the Blanchard Water System was experiencing a production issue affecting local municipalities.\n\nOn Monday, Feb. 2, Galambo told the Shreveport Times that the Blanchard Water System had some production issues at the plant with equipment due to the cold weather.\n\nOn Sunday, the Blanchard Water System cut the valves to some customers to allow the water system to fill up its tanks.\n\nAs of Monday, the water disruption had yet to be resolved after leaks were discovered, forcing the water system to drain the tanks.\n\nBlanchard water crisis: Water outage at Blanchard Utilites affects multiple cities, closes schools\n\n\"We’ve been struggling,\" Galambo said. \"We had to go find the leaks. We finally now have found them all, and we’ve got crews on site. We’re getting them to make the repairs.\"\n\nMooringsport Mayor Ty Gordon posted on Facebook, \"Currently, Mooringsport and Oil City are still OFF... NO exact restoration time at this moment.\"\n\nThis water disruption has caused the cancellation of Herndon Magnet School, Mooringsport Elementary School, Blanchard Elementary School, Donnie Bickham Middle School and Northwood High School.\n\n\"District leadership continues to monitor the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available,\" Caddo Parish Schools said.\n\nKracman, who proposed the moratorium, told The Times in a previous interview that he had received calls from constituents opposed to the data center and from environmentalists concerned that Caddo Lake cannot sustain millions of gallons of daily withdrawals under the developers' contract with Blanchard.\n\n\"Let's get the people who are qualified to assess what the lake can or cannot take before we're just arbitrarily against a data center,\" Kracman said. \"I would rather weigh and measure that it's OK, and I think everybody can appreciate taking a pause and getting some facts together.\"\n\nA measure in New Orleans similar to the one Krackman is proposing led to the cancellation of a data center project.\n\nA global data center developer with a growing footprint across the United States is tied to several large land acquisitions in Caddo and Bossier parishes, according to public property records.\n\nSTACK Infrastructure, a Denver-based digital infrastructure company, is connected to the purchases through SAC III Acquisition Co. LLC, which is listed on multiple purchase agreements for properties intended for data center development in northwest Louisiana.\n\nSAC III Acquisition Co. is listed as the buyer on several transactions in Caddo Parish and Bossier Parish, including more than 500 acres in Blanchard at the corner of Blanchard Latex and Stateline roads. The property sits on the Louisiana-Texas border.\n\nPublic records show SAC III Acquisition Co. lists its address as 1700 Broadway, Suite 1750, Denver, Colorado, the same address used by STACK Infrastructure.\n\nSTACK Infrastructure develops and operates hyperscale data centers for large enterprises, cloud service providers and companies focused on artificial intelligence and machine-learning workloads. The company provides data center capacity in major markets across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific.\n\nThe company is backed by investment firms IPI Partners and ICONIQ Capital, both of which specialize in large-scale infrastructure and technology investments.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Shreveport Times: Caddo Commission kills Caddo Lake proposal with no debate",

    "description": "His death profoundly affected the Today anchor when she was growing up.",
    "fullText": "After Savannah Guthrie’s mom was reported missing, some people might be wondering what happened to the Today host’s father.\n\nOn Feb. 2, Savannah Guthrie’s mother, Nancy Guthrie, was reported missing by her family. The Today anchor was absent from the airing of the show and released a statement: “On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers, and messages of support. Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom. We thank law enforcement for their hard work on this case and encourage anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff’s Department.”\n\nToday's Savannah Guthrie's Mom's Disappearance Being Investigated by FBI Due to 'What Was Found at the Scene'-Officials Are 'Concerned'\n\nThe Real Reason Another Today Host Just Quit Months After Hoda Kotb's Sudden Exit: 'The Time Has Come... '\n\nNBC crime correspondent Tom Winter reported that Nancy’s disappearance is now treated as a crime. “They were able to get out helicopters last night that use infrared cameras. They’ve got drones up,” Winter said. “They’ve enlisted the help of the Customs and Border Protection — obviously, not too far from the border there in Mexico. They have some special resources. The FBI is also aware of this case… given the nature of what was found at the scene. That’s what has got them so concerned.”\n\nNancy didn’t have any reported health concerns like dementia or Alzheimer’s and had a “good sound mind.” However, officials were concerned about her physical health. “She has some physical ailments that limit her ability to move around,” Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said.\n\nThe Tucson Sheriff’s Department later made an update about the investigation. “We believe now, after we’ve processed that we do in fact have a crime and we’re asking the community’s help,” Nanos said.\n\nSavannah Guthrie’s father was Charles Guthrie. He died when she was 16 years old from a sudden heart attack.\n\nThe death of her father had a profound impact on her adolescence. “The loss of my father was shocking and devastating. It cracked open our family and crushed us,” Savannah shared in an interview with People in 2024 when promoting her book Mostly What God Does, which chronicles her grieving from the loss. “He was our center. We just idealized him and adored him. He was larger than life, and funny, and charming, and adorable. His loss was so sudden and so shocking.”\n\nSavannah also uses Christmas as a tribute to her father and his selflessness. “I think the fact that I lost my dad when I was 16, it makes Christmas even more special to us, because it was his holiday and that’s how we felt and that’s how he felt,” Savannah said in December 2022. “I think we hold on to Christmas even harder now, because it’s a tie to him and a tie to the past and to our memories.”\n\nShe revealed that she didn’t want to leave her mom in the early stages of her career. “My father died when I was entering my senior year in high school. I then lived at home all through college. We didn’t have money to afford the dorm,” Savannah said on Today in 2022. “She said, ‘If you can’t leave me, then I didn’t do my job right, Savannah.’ She just gave me permission to go.”\n\nThe Today anchor often brought Nancy as a guest on the show and talked about her love for her mother in 2022. “She loves us, her family, fiercely, and her selflessness and sacrifice for us, her steadfastness and her unmovable confidence is the reason any of us grew up to do anything,” Guthrie said in honor of her 80th birthday.\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

All that's left is to thank all of you for being there and for always supporting us, the fans.\"\n\nSpurs signed Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid and 19-year-old Brazilian defender Souza from Santos in the January window.\n\nThey added 18-year-old Hearts forward James Wilson on loan on transfer deadline day, but he will be part of their under-21s squad.\n\nIn response to Romero's post last month, manager Thomas Frank said the 27-year-old Argentina centre-back should keep some things \"internal\".\n\nTottenham wanted to sign Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo in January but he joined Manchester City instead, with Frank saying on Friday the club \"did everything\" they could.\n\n\"The fans just want the best for the club, just like I, the owners, the staff, the players. Everyone wants the best for the club,\" added the Dane.\n\n\"But the transfer window is not Football Manager, unfortunately. It is not. It would be a lot easier, but also a little bit more boring.\"\n\nSpurs, who won the Europa League last term, are currently 14th in the Premier League and sit closer to the drop zone than the European qualification places, although they have made it to the last 16 of the Champions League.",

Freeman is a relative midfield rookie, having spent the vast majority of his career on the wing.\n\nBut the pair have a shared history to draw from.\n\nBoth came through the Northampton academy and were key figures in Saints' run to the Premiership title in 2023-24 and a Champions Cup final in 2024-25.\n\n\"It's very easy to call each other out and tell each other when we're not going so well. And when we are,\" says Freeman.\n\n\"That's massive because the more times you're in that position [alongside each other], the more cues you're picking up.\n\n\"Dingers is an awesome communicator.

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): Ten men away at Aston Villa, I could have put the whole backline in. Keller has gone in and not only held his own as their number one, but continued to showcase probably why he left Liverpool. A lot of people would have said 'stay, Alisson is getting older, you'll get your chance'. He didn't, he went away and he has been fantastic for them and it is a team that suits him.\n\nMarcos Senesi (Bournemouth): Arguably one of the players of the season for me. He is really solid, goes about his business, gets everything done. Nothing is forced.\n\nGabriel (Arsenal): Leeds weren't poor, but Gabriel was solid and reassuring. He got the job done and knows the threat he poses from set-pieces. It was probably his best defensive display of the season.\n\nKristoffer Ajer (Brentford): Big, solid defender. He was celebrating making tackles in the first few minutes, which is not my cup of tea, but when you are doing it consistently all the way through and putting your body on the line, I'll give you a pass.\n\nEnzo Fernandez (Chelsea): Obviously he scored the goal that completed the great comeback. He gets a lot of stick, unjustifiably in my opinion. People don't think he's that good and maybe it's the price tag and because he won a World Cup that means they expect more. He is a good midfielder and a really good captain, and he looks after the ball when they are in difficult moments.\n\nFlorian Wirtz (Liverpool): I have been saying for weeks and months that with a player of that quality, it was only a matter of time before he settled into it. These past six weeks we have seen the real Florian Wirtz - dictating games, his passing range is unbelievable. The goals and assists have started to come now and he is looking really strong.\n\nAlex Scott (Bournemouth): It was a tough day for him because Wolves were decent. He has had a tough time after going away with England but has come back and has found his mojo. It's going to be an interesting back end of the season for him trying to make the World Cup squad.\n\nNoni Madueke (Arsenal): From thinking you are on the bench to finding out you are starting less than five minutes before kick-off is a massive turn of events. To be mentally focused to deliver, that is credit to Mikel Arteta and Madueke. They somehow gave the goal to him even though it was an own goal, but with a goal and assist he gets in the team.\n\nHabib Diarra (Sunderland): It says a goal and an own goal, but it's basically two goals for him. He was exceptional. The wide players absolutely killed Burnley and he was at the heart of it.\n\nDominic Solanke (Tottenham): It was probably the weirdest two goals he will score in his life. The first one is questionable but the second one is pure genius. To not only backheel it but to lob Gianluigi Donnarumma who is 6ft 6in is unbelievable. It is great to see him back playing. Can he have a late push now for the England squad? That is the question if he can stay fit.\n\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool): Signing of the season? Probably. Another two goals and he looks like he is going from strength to strength, week by week. It's going to be really difficult for Alexander Isak to get back in.\n\nMikel Arteta (Arsenal): It was a wonderful away performance at Elland Road. With Bukayo Saka getting injured in the warm-up there could have been excuses, but he didn't make any. He put Noni Madueke in and he returned the favour. It was a wonderful performance at a place where teams have struggled.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "Liverpool have finalised a deal for Jeremy Jacquet in a deal worth up to £60m - but the defender will not move to Anfield until the summer.\n\nIt would not be an understatement to say he was a name most people were unaware of at the start of the winter window.\n\nTo commit up to £60m - £55m up front before a potential £5m in add ons - for a 20-year-old is a hefty call but Liverpool view the French centre-back as a long-term investment and someone who will form an integral part of their backline for years to come.\n\nGiven the club's defensive problems this season - they have conceded 33 goals from 24 Premier League games - and their ongoing injury crisis, it is also telling Arne Slot's side are prepared to wait until the summer for Jacquet, who will join from Ligue 1 Rennes.\n\nThe question of whether they could have got him now has a simple answer - Rennes are simply unwilling to sanction a move until the summer.\n\nThe French side are not in a rush for the money and adamant any fee for Jacquet would have to surpass their previous club record sale of £55.4m when Manchester City signed Jeremy Doku from them in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Liverpool are happy to wait, signing the player on a five-year contract until 2031, with the option for a further year.\n\nThey see Jacquet as a young defender with plenty of senior experience for his age and their data analysis has backed the decision to spend so much on a player they believe has immense potential.\n\n\"It's a lot of money but Jacquet has everything to become one of the best centre-backs in the world in the next few years,\" says French football expert and ESPN's Julien Laurens. \"He is arguably the best centre-back of his generation.\n\n\"He's quite tall, quick and strong - and he's a machine when it comes to duels in the air and on the ground. He reads the game well and is good on the ball.\n\n\"He's not a proper ball-playing centre-back yet. Technically, there is a lot to improve on, but he's a smart kid and he can get there and become like a Virgil van Dijk.\"\n\nAt Rennes, Jacquet has primarily played in a back three this season. When he was 18, he wanted more game time so they loaned him out to Clermont in Ligue 2 but he was was only there for half a season before he was recalled in January 2025, and made a total of 36 Ligue 1 appearances.\n\nHis strength in the air has been a standout this season, winning 75.51% of his aerial duels - the highest among Ligue 1 defenders in 2025–26.",

    "description": "Katha...",
    "fullText": "The $45 million advertorial abounds in unintended ironies.\n\nMy husband and I saw the Melania documentary, at 10:45 am on the Upper West Side, which I admit was not a fair test of its audience appeal—there were only six people there besides us. They had all left by the time the movie was over—maybe journalists on deadline, like me—so I missed my chance to interview them about their responses. I did catch a middle-aged woman who showed up early for the next screening, well-armed with an enormous bucket of popcorn. Why was she there, I asked? To see Melania of course! What did she like about Melania? “She’s so confident and she does so much to help people.” Confident, I give you.\n\nI used to feel sorry for the wives of rich and powerful men. I saw them as trapped—birds in gilded cages, who had made a terrible mistake in youth, and now had to endure endless rounds of tedious socializing with a frozen smile on their Botoxed faces, to say nothing of having to be nice to their ghastly husbands, who were probably all having sex with prostitutes. I wasn’t alone—remember all those Free Melania memes? The way people endlessly retweeted photos of her looking fed-up and frowny and not holding Donald’s hand? Quite a few women I know believed that Melania was miserable but couldn’t leave him for some unlikely reason, like she would have no money or he would have her murdered. What century did they think this is? Melinda Gates and Mackenzie Scott divorced their unsatisfactory husbands and are living the dream today as fabulously rich philanthropists.\n\nMelania, this documentary makes perfectly clear, likes her gilded cage just fine. After all, it lets her produce this movie starring her clothes, her hair, her shoes, and her complexion, and how many women can say the same? Could you, middle-aged women of America, spend all day every day wearing six-inch spike heels with never a wince or moan? The rewards for aching feet and wrinkle-free face are on full display: Melania is attended every minute by people paid to be deferential and pleasant; everything around her is beautiful and expensive, and she has all the designer dresses she wants. She gets to talk about helping children with Queen Rania of Jordan and the evils of screens for children with Brigitte Macron. She gets to look somber and serious placing lilies on the Arlington graves of three soldiers killed in the withdrawal from Afghanistan—take that, Joe Biden! All your fault! If she has to spend a few hours pretending to care about the tablecloths for the Inaugural dinner and the golden caviar-filled eggs planned as the appetizer, well, that’s not too high a price to pay for luxury and admiration, is it?\n\nAs you might expect, the film abounds in unintended ironies. Melania is famously a private person, but she makes a movie about herself. She says she loves the White House, with all its storied history, while she tears up Jackie Kennedy’s rose garden and her husband tears down the East Wing. She says she cares about young people, while her husband destroys USAID, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths of African children. She reminds us that she is an immigrant, as are her French friend Hervé Pierre, whom we see designing her Inaugural ball gown, and Tham Kannalikham, the White House interior decorator, who arrived from Laos at the age of 2. And of course there are her parents. (Her mourning for her mother, the first anniversary of whose death takes place during the filming, is a rare moment when she expresses deep feeling.) Meanwhile, her husband presides over the mass detention and deportation of immigrants, many of whom have lived in this country for decades, maybe longer than she has. Cherry on top: The director, Brett Ratner, was persona non grata in Hollywood after being accused of sexual misconduct by six women—way to remind us of the ongoing scandal of the Epstein files.\n\nI know there is a real human being hidden inside those severe, stiffly constructed outfits and beneath that famous black hat that hides half her face and makes her look like a sinister fembot or maybe a very confident assassin. This is, after all, the first lady who wore a jacket painted with I REALLY DON’T CARE DO U on her trip to the Mexican border. This is the first lady who plagiarized a speech by her nemesis Michelle Obama. And—my favorite Melania moment— this is the first lady who complained to her former close friend Stephanie Winston Wolkoff about having to “work my ass off” on the White House Christmas. “Who gives a fuck about the Christmas stuff and decorations?” Remember those scary blood-red trees that looked like they came from Dracula’s own forest?\n\nThat Melania was remote, haughty, mysterious, beset by grievance and resentment. She didn’t even try to ingratiate herself with the public. That was kind of weird—but a lot more interesting than this dutiful fashion plate delivering platitudes about how “in the end family is what really matters.” On the other hand, this Melania has managed to get Jeff Bezos to pay $45 million for the right to make this absurd advertorial, and $35 million to promote it. Bezos stands to lose most of it, but (sorry, Dems) the film is on track to be one of the highest-grossing documentaries ever. In a family of champion grifters, Melania holds her own.",

    "fullText": "The once-lauded director of Black Swan and The Wrestler has drowned himself in AI slop with an embarrassing new online series\n\nIf you happen to find yourself stumbling through Time magazine’s YouTube account, perhaps because you are a time traveller from the 1970s who doesn’t fully understand how the present works yet – then you will be presented with something that many believe represents the vanguard of entertainment as we know it.\n\nOn This Day … 1776 is a series of short videos depicting America’s revolutionary war. What makes On This Day notable is that it was made by Darren Aronofsky’s studio Primordial Soup. What also makes it interesting is that it was created with AI. The third thing that makes it interesting is that it is terrible.\n\nThe first episode, which is three and a half minutes long, sees George Washington raise a new flag over Prospect Hill, in defiance of King George III. It is the moment, according to the video’s description, that “rebellion becomes resolve”. And if that dollop of ChatGPT-sounding sloganeering terrifies the life out of you, wait until you actually watch the thing.\n\nIt is, as you might expect, as ugly as sin. It’s the sort of thing that looks like it was shooting for photorealism, but then either chickened out or blew up along the way. In the very first shot, King George’s hair looks like someone melted down and hardened a plastic badger. And this is a shame because, like so much generative AI at the moment, an awful lot of the episode consists of shots where we see the characters from behind. This is, after all, because the back of an AI-generated head is far less likely to send people into screaming fits of trauma than an AI-generated face, and Aronofsky is a humanist.\n\nBecause, good lord, the faces. Since the revolutionary war was largely initiated by older men, On This Day is filled with the wrinkled almost-faces of several well-known figures. And it is truly disconcerting to see, not only because they all have the uncanny dead eyes of people ripped out of The Polar Express, but because the wrinkles keep shifting in colour and depth.\n\nIt’s an effect that makes it look like the characters were drawn on several sheets of tissue paper that nobody could line up properly. Benjamin Franklin, who turns up during episode two, is particularly nightmarish. He looks as if someone has genetically spliced Hugh Laurie with Anthony Hopkins, and then covered the resulting monstrosity in a thin layer of roving liver spots. I’m overselling the point here, but it really is extremely creepy to watch.\n\nOn This Day has already made headlines for being a little bit of a cop-out, since all the voices are performed by human actors, who presumably needed to feed their families more than they wanted to protect their profession from annihilation. And this is telling, because these voices are by far the most convincing part of On This Day, especially when deployed in voiceover, because then you aren’t distracted by the way the movement of their mouths doesn’t quite match up with the noises coming out of them.\n\nBut surely the day is coming where they won’t be needed. As horrible as it is, On This Day is already strides better than a lot of other AI-generated output. True, the whole thing still looks like a mangled cross between an animatronic sex toy convention and those old Taiwanese news cartoons, but compare a character here with Tilly Norwood, and you can see that real progress has been made in a frighteningly short amount of time. Soon we will have picture-perfect AI creations with entirely convincing human voices. After that, it won’t be long before content like On This Day is entirely created – written, acted, directed and edited – by prompt alone. And when that happens, Aronofsky can pat himself on the back for doing himself out of a job.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the human film industry reacts to On This Day, particularly other actors. We’ve already seen, in Tilly Norwood, that these creations appear to be modelled on human faces, and this is even more the case here. In particular, the depiction of Thomas Paine seems like it flashes through the faces of any number of recognisable actors. The key one seems to be Ralph Fiennes, but there are also glimmers of Daniel Day-Lewis and Matthew Macfadyen.\n\nLess than two years ago Scarlett Johansson hired legal counsel after she noticed that an OpenAI application had a voice that was “eerily similar” to hers. In a climate like this, it isn’t out of the question to imagine that actors will start doing the same if they recognise their likeness in an AI-generated performer.\n\nBut this is a concern for another time. What matters now is that On This Day … 1776 is genuinely very horrible to watch, and everybody involved should be ashamed. It is by far the most disturbing thing Aronofsky has made, and I’ve seen the last eight minutes of Requiem for a Dream.",
