He was Portland's first-round draft pick in 2018 and played the first seven of his eight NBA seasons with the Trail Blazers before being traded to Boston for Jrue Holiday in July.\n\nThe Bulls entered Sunday on a season-worst eight-game losing streak.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

Bell was in the battle with Wallace, with Wallace taking the lead with 12 laps to go. As Wallace battled up front, his teammate Reddick, sans right front fender, made the run from 18th to fourth before a caution and red flag set up the first overtime finish.\n\nReddick, who rose through the Late Model ranks, won without a fender.\n\n\"That’s crazy isn’t its it,\" Reddick said on winning without a fender. \"This place over the years, man. It just puts on some amazing racing. Handling matters here, but I don't know, apparently determination outweighs handling.\"\n\nThe caution was called after William Byron had a tire go down, sending the Hendrick driver into the wall. He collected six cars with four laps remaining to set up an Overtime finish.\n\nCarson Hocevar, still chasing his first win, led last week on the white flag lap before crashing. He also matched performance this week, as a few aggressive moves in the closing laps nearly secured him the win. Known to make bold decisions and enemies, Hocevar and his spotter tried to negotiate with the leading Toyotas to push on the restart. Asking Wallace to 'Shake and Bake' and have the Reddick line up behind in the third row. Wallace instead opted to start on the bottom with Reddick lining up behind him, unsure if Reddick's damaged race car would be able to successfully push the teammates in tandem to the front.\n\nOn the overtime restart, Hocevar dove to a pocket in the middle of Bell, and Wallace bailed on pushing Bell when he got a major push from Ross Chastain. Hocevar crashed into Bell, and the Joe Gibbs Racing driver hit the wall, sustaining major front right damage.\n\nThe second overtime attempt saw Wallace and Reddick linked up again, now with JGR's Chase Briscoe behind for a three-car Toyota chain on the bottom against three Chevrolets on the top.\n\nIn the closing two laps, Wallace went high to block Hocevar and lost momentum, falling back through the field as his teammate passed on the bottom. In clean air, Reddick was able to hang on through the rough handling of his damaged race car to claim his second win ahead of Briscoe, Chastain, Hocevar, and Daniel Suarez.\n\nShane van Gisbergen, who was involved in two incidents in stage two, rebounded for a sixth-place finish, his best finish on an oval track.\n\nZane Smith, Wallace, Ryan Preece, and Ryan Blaney completed the top ten.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

Now, they need to find his replacement.\n\nFansided’s Zachary Rotman predicts the Twins could be a dark horse for a veteran All-Star in Lucas Giolito. He eats innings, and he had a pretty productive 2025.\n\nMORE: Padres predicted to be dark horse candidate for $9 million three-time Cy Young, two-time World Series champion ace to replace Dylan Cease\n\n“Another team that should be desperate for a starting pitcher is the Minnesota Twins, which just lost Pablo Lopez for the season. With Joe Ryan and Bailey Ober being their only semi-reliable starters, Giolito would be a valuable addition as an innings-eater. Worst case, he wouldn't cost much, and if the Twins are out of it at the trade deadline, he can fetch them a prospect or two in a deal,” Rotman wrote.\n\nGiolito finished 2025 with a 10-4 record, a 3.41 ERA, 121 Ks, and a WHIP of 1.290 over 145 innings pitched.

    "description": "On the day his statue was unveiled outside Crypto.com Arena, Showtime era coach Pat Riley urged the Lakers to fight to create legacies worth chasing.",
    "fullText": "The fans never got an opportunity to give a grateful goodbye, Pat Riley resigning on an early summer afternoon 36 years ago after the end of a lost season.\n\nEveryone will have that chance now.\n\nWhen Riley left town at the wrong end of grumblings from players and fans, he was the greatest coach not only in Lakers history but also in basketball history, his .730 winning percentage and 102 playoff victories both NBA records at the time.\n\nHe has been Showtime’s forgotten kingpin, its lost leader, its missing warrior, a stylishly distant legend who had been overshadowed by the seven Lakers whose statues stand watch over the plaza outside Crypto.com Arena.\n\nRiley finally is coming home, returning Sunday with the unveiling of a long overdue statue in whose bronze reflection a couple of wistful realizations can be found.\n\nRiles has been terribly, terribly missed.\n\nThe Showtime era seems terribly, terribly distant.\n\nRiley hasn’t been with the Lakers in 36 years. The Lakers haven’t won an asterisk-free NBA title in 16 years. Maybe because Shaquille O’Neal spoke only via video Sunday, the greatness of this organization never felt further away.\n\nMark Walter, were you watching?\n\nThe Dodgers group that now owns the Lakers was granted a compelling history lesson during an hourlong ceremony that culminated in a theatrical unveiling of a Riley statue smartly situated between the bronzes of Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nLike Riley himself, his statue looked darn near perfect. There was the raised fist that was once a signal for Magic to pass to Kareem for a sky hook. There was the neatly coiffed hair, the nicely fitting suit, the smartly positioned tie, even the painfully stern expression from a guy who left no doubt who was running the show.\n\n“When I was told that the kid from Schenectady, New York, would be honored with a statue here ... I fell to my knees, humbled. I sobbed. ... Tears of joy and gratitude,” Riley said during his acceptance speech, adding “That statue right there … is loaded up with all of us who took that magical journey.”\n\nIt was a Showtime magic born of a commitment found in one of the two inscriptions on the statue.\n\n“There will come a time when you are challenged, and when that time comes, you must plant your feet. You must stand firm. You must make a point. About who you are, what you do, and where you come from. When that time comes, you do it.”\n\nRiley used those words to earn six Laker championship rings, four as a coach, one as an assistant coach and one as a player.\n\nAfter leaving town in 1990 and making a stop in New York, Riley carried those words with him to Miami, where he led the Heat to one title as a coach and two more as an executive, and where he still serves as president at age 80.\n\n“There will come a time when you are challenged …”\n\nFor the new Laker bosses, that time is now, as they find themselves with a product that is light years from the teams that Riley referenced during what amounted to a 30-minute sermon/history lesson prior to the unveiling.\n\nThis Laker organization is a bit of a mess, as evidenced by the speakers who joined Riley on the stage.\n\nThere was Magic and Kareem and Jeanie Buss, who all gave compelling talks, very appropriate. But oddly also speaking was Dwyane Wade, who played for Riley in Miami but was never a Laker. The group was interestingly joined by Michael Douglas, who spoke as Riley’s friend, while several Lakers Showtime greats watched from the audience.\n\nIt was all a bit disjointed, which is similar to the Lakers' current situation. They’re so defensively challenged they’re surely headed for an early playoff exit even though they have the stunningly great scorer Luka Doncic, and what happens next?\n\nDo they keep LeBron James? (Say no!) Do they pay Austin Reaves (Say yes!) Do they try to trade for Giannis Antetokounmpo (Go for it!).\n\nAll these are questions not unlike the one faced by the late Jerry Buss in 1981 when pondering the notion of hiring a kid who had never coached at any level. Buss trusted his instincts and went for it, the enlistment of Riley fashioning a culture that remained strong until his death in 2013.\n\nIt is a culture that Riley described when he left in 1990, quoting the late author Ernest Becker.\n\n“Man's greatest fear — and you've probably heard this before — is his fear of extinction,” he said in his farewell news conference. “But what he fears more than that is to become extinct with insignificance.”\n\nThe Showtime Lakers faced those fears and overcame them.\n\n\"What we accomplished was not insignificant,” he added in his farewell address. “All anybody ever wants to do is have the feeling that what they do counts and matters. I've always told the players that they don't just want to be the best of the best. There's nothing wrong with being unique. We were unique.\"\n\nRiley repeated many of those same words Sunday, and added some more wisdom about life with the legends.\n\n“That’s where I learned about commitment … there are only two options” he said. “You’re in or you’re out. Either you’re with us or against us. There’s no other way, there’s no life in between.”\n\nRiley said that through that commitment, the Lakers legacy had been formed.\n\n“The biggest footprint in Laker history had been planted,” he said, later adding, “You begin by chasing footprints, you grow by honoring them. And if you’re committed enough, you leave giant steps of your own.”\n\nHe then challenged today’s NBA players, even the ones getting dressed down the hall.\n\n“I ask even the players who play for the Lakers today, I ask you, whose footprints are you chasing today?” he said. “More important, what footprints are you leaving?”\n\nHe continued, saying, “When it comes time to kick some ass, you do it. And one day someone will follow the path you left behind and say, ‘Those are footprints worth chasing.”’\n\nRiley ended his talk with what was essentially an inspirational pregame speech as the Lakers prepared to play the rival he finally conquered, those Boston Celtics.\n\n“As my father’s words to me, they ring out loud and clear today,” he said with the sort of verve that is rarely heard around the team these days. “The time has come to kick some ass. To kick some Boston ass.”\n\nMark Walter, were you listening?\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Tyreek Hill next team odds. Chiefs drawing shortest NFL odds to land All-Pro wide receiver after release from Dolphins.",
    "fullText": "Want to get more Covers content? Add us as a preferred source on your Google account here.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins released wide receiver Tyreek Hill on Monday, February 16, finally ending a union that seemed destined for a breakup sooner rather than later.\n\nThe eight-time Pro-Bowler played in just four games in 2025 before suffering a season-ending ACL injury. What began as a perfect match, and briefly looked like the best offense in football alongside Jayden Waddle as Tua Tagovailoa's primary weapons, Hill's time in Miami appeared to sour by the end of 2024.\n\nNow, the hapless Dolphins and the 31-year-old receiver are embarking on different paths. Below, we'll look at the latest NFL odds for Hill's next destination — and why a reunion with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs feels inevitable.\n\nFrom 2016-21, Tyreek Hill was a mainstay in the Kansas City Chiefs offense, racking up 6,630 receiving yards and 56 touchdowns over 91 games. He made the Pro Bowl every season in Kansas City and was one of quarterback Patrick Mahomes' favorite targets.\n\nA reunion would make a ton of sense, especially after the Chiefs just missed the postseason for the first time since before either Hill or Mahomes debuted. The Chiefs struggled to establish a deep-ball threat this season, and an ancient Travis Kelce led the team in receiving.\n\nBringing Hill back into the fold immediately gives Mahomes an established weapon who, if he's 100%, can burn defensive backs better than almost anyone. And their familiarity should help him, figuratively and literally, hit the ground running in September and beyond.\n\nWhile the Chiefs are the logical landing spot based on \"narrative,\" the Buffalo Bills need a big-time receiver just as much. Quarterback Josh Allen relied more heavily on his tight ends in 2025, and giving him another option alongside top WR Khalil Shakir (who led the team with 72 receptions, while Dalton Kincaid was next with 39) would solve a glaring issue and take some of the pressure off.\n\nThe Bills' window isn't closed, but they did move on from head coach Sean McDermott this offseason, showing a desperation to get over the hump from \"great regular season team\" to \"legitimate Super Bowl contender.\" Hill would be a major upgrade.\n\nFresh off a disappointing showing in the Super Bowl, could the New England Patriots target Hill? Stefon Diggs is a $26.5-million cap hit next season, and is already being bandied about as a potential cut candidate.\n\nIt's doubtful that the Pats would employ both Diggs and Hill for a variety of reasons — both have had character and legal issues in recent years — and it may not make a lot of sense to replace Diggs with Hill, especially if the latter has questions about his health in the wake of his ACL tear and dislocated knee.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens committed to quarterback Lamar Jackson in moving on from head coach John Harbaugh, and bolstering the wide receiver corps may be a way to kickstart a new era.\n\nHe would help form a formidable duo with Zay Flowers, who had nearly 800 more receiving yards than his closest teammate in 2025. Veteran DeAndre Hopkins is a free agent, and Hill would be a significant upgrade at their respective points in their careers.\n\nFinally, this is an interesting option after Hill's former Miami Dolphins head coach, Mike McDaniel, was hired to serve as Jim Harbaugh's offensive coordinator. When Miami's offense was at its best before Tua Tagovailoa's concussions, the Dolphins looked virtually unstoppable.\n\nAssuming there's no bad blood, giving Justin Herbert a target of this caliber may unlock another level for the Los Angeles Chargers quarterback.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here and view our best betting sites or check out our top sportsbook promos.",

    "title": "The quirk of fate that saw sluggish Liverpool beat Forest and close in on Champions League places",
    "description": "Nottingham Forest 0-1 Liverpool: Alexis Mac Allister’s late, late winner snatched all three points for the champions",
    "fullText": "Perhaps it was football at its most illogical. Liverpool were triumphant after a first-half performance Arne Slot felt was their worst in his time at the club. They got a goal from a player who may have only been in a goalscoring position because one of his teammates was injured and after he had struggled in his original role, amid a collective malaise.\n\nA team who have been aggrieved by refereeing decisions of late saw a seeming winner disallowed in contentious fashion and yet made off with three points. And Vitor Pereira, who seemed to have had an immediate impact with Nottingham Forest, reacted to his first home game in charge by saying: “I am frustrated, angry with football. Very, very unfair.”\n\nHe had a point in his argument, if not in the result. For Liverpool, Florian Wirtz’s back injury produced a benefit. Their supporters ended up celebrating just their second win at the City Ground in more than four decades by chorusing the name of their resident World Cup winner.\n\nAs his habit of scoring against Real Madrid shows, Alexis Mac Allister can supply major moments. Twice it seemed he had a decider against Forest. The first was disallowed and yet perhaps Liverpool’s sense of injustice provided the platform for the second.\n\nBut he did so twice from a position within the Forest penalty box. Which, when Slot drew up his plans, was not his. Wirtz should have been there. When he withdrew, Curtis Jones was the emergency No 10. He floundered there, as Mac Allister did in midfield. So Jones was redirected to right-back, Dominik Szoboszlai and Mac Allister given more advanced roles. And an hour later, the Argentinian, who had started as a passenger, ended as the match-winner.\n\nAnd so Slot, who believes that decisions and fortune have gone against Liverpool this season, instead argued his side got lucky. “We have been on the wrong side of the score after a good performance too many times,” he said. “Today we got more than we deserved. A draw would have been a fairer result. The first half was really poor, the worst we have played. We lost almost every ball we touched.” The second period was better and, eventually, Slot could say: “My emotions were emotions of happiness and relief.”\n\nWhich came from Mac Allister’s late show. He had the ball in the Forest net twice: once seemingly inadvertently, once deliberately. The first was chalked off. The second also went to VAR, but this time the replays could not quash Liverpool’s joy.\n\nPaul Tierney, long Jurgen Klopp’s least favourite official, disallowed what seemed the breakthrough goal. It went in off Mac Allister’s upper arm and back. Not that there was any sense the Argentinian knew anything about it. After Hugo Ekitike should have scored, but met Rio Ngumoha’s cross with a header that Stefan Ortega saved, Mac Allister’s back was turned as Ola Aina’s clearance struck him and rebounded into the Forest net. He knew it had hit his elbow. “I feel like it's a bit harsh,” he said. “It's a bit of both but I understand the rules.”\n\nWhen it was ruled out, it seemed to cement Forest’s status as Liverpool’s bogey team. Until Szoboszlai, the one man taking his time as the clock ticked down, jinked to make a yard of space, whipped in a lovely cross and Virgil van Dijk’s goalbound header was blocked by Murillo. Mac Allister was the predator in the box again. “It was not a surprise to me that Macca was both times the goalscorer, he played with the mentality you need in these games and he was twice in the situation to finish,” said Slot.\n\nMeanwhile, Wirtz was only visible beneath his hood in the stands. It was a game when Liverpool missed the German when they were shorn of creativity and chemistry. They looked a prosaic outfit with the £100m man and yet found a way to record just their second victory at the City Ground in more than four decades. The first required a 99th-minute decider by Darwin Nunez. This was only slightly earlier, similarly dramatic.\n\nIt was a remarkable end to a forgettable game. Seasons can turn on such moments. Liverpool are now level on points with Chelsea and Manchester United, their immediate rivals for a Champions League spot. Forest, meanwhile, were seemingly making an auspicious start to Pereira’s reign but were nudged closer to the Championship by Mac Allister. They started superbly yet fell apart at the last.\n\nForest had won 3-0 at Anfield under Sean Dyche; yet Liverpool began worse in the rematch, slow and sluggish, off the pace and out of sorts. Meanwhile, Forest looked liberated, a group of talented players freed from Dyche’s restrictive tactics. Omari Hutchinson was excellent. Callum Hudson-Odoi almost scored in the third minute, when Alisson denied him. Elliot Anderson drove a shot wide. “The first half was just missing the goals,” said Pereira, but that has been a theme of Forest’s campaign.\n\nLiverpool had threatened only when Stefan Ortega made a close-range block from Jones; but part of Slot’s half-time message was that Forest, who had beaten Fenerbahce in Istanbul three days earlier, might tire. They did. “Our capacity to press them was not the same and in the end, we conceded,” rued Pereira. “But if we keep this mentality and organisation, we will get points, for sure.”",

    "title": "Miami Dolphins Fans Weigh In On De’Von Achane’s Future",
    "description": "Miami Dolphins fans share what they think or want to happen with star running back De’Von Achane going forward.",
    "fullText": "Following the kick-off of our Miami Dolphins roster purge this past week, I pointed out that the team also had a decision to make on star running back De’Von Achane as he enters the final year of his rookie contract. I then asked the following question:\n\nWhat do you think that the new coaching staff and front office should do with De’Von Achane going forward? Should they extend him right now/before the season begins, should they allow him to play on the final year of his deal before deciding if they want to re-sign him to a new deal, or should they consider trading a player that they took in the third round who could now garner a first-round draft pick?\n\nBelow are some of your thougths and answers-\n\nNeenerWhacker wonders what a change in coaching and scheme will have on Achanes numbers in 2026.\n\nSide note on Achane: his stats and analytics are off the charts. How much credit are we going to give Mike McDaniel for Achane’s success?\n\nThere is a high probability that Achane regresses next year with a new play caller. McD had his flaws, but he knew how to scheme for Devon\n\nMiamiItaliano says trade him away if he doesn’t give the Dolphins a generous hometown discount on any extension.\n\nIf they get Malik Willis, that might take touches away from Achane since he’s a run first type of QB. Also, Achane might want too much money. Maybe trade him if he doesn’t agree to a team friendly contract. I don’t want him to go, but it’s better than him holding out throughout training camp.\n\nOldfinfan says he’s the best since Ricky and is a building block, not trade bait.\n\nBest Dolphins player we have seen since Ricky Williams. We do not trade him, we build around him. He has game breaking abilities you don’t just find every draft.\n\nkrammm is out on him, it seems.\n\nTrade him. He never wins the big game.\n\nFLexile seems to have two arguments for you.\n\nExtend him. If he is not the fastest guy in the NFL, he’s top 3. He can score ANY time he touches the ball.\n\nCome trade deadline, do the best thing for both parties and trade him. The Dolphins get a 1st rounder and Achane gets a ring and a Super Bowl MVP for whatever team is an electric RB away from a Lombardi trophy.\n\nSuperG! says extend him unless someone offers a first, and maybe more, for him.\n\nCould he garner a first-round pick? I’ve been told by super smart people on here that teams don’t offer a first round pick in a trade scenario for a running back. Especially a running back on the final year of his rookie contract. A first and a third would be considered a Godfather deal. Other than that, I wouldn’t trade him. I’d extend him instead.\n\ngo_canes who has a VERY solid screen name, says keep him because seeing him play is worth the admission!\n\nThe guy is one of those rare “worth the price of admission” players. I hope they keep him in a Dolphin uniform. It is worth the risk. There is also a risk to the complete tank approach – you could develop a loser mentality.\n\nUSMCFinzFreak lays out a 2-3 year plan for the team.\n\n1) Build the trenches through the draft.\n\n2) Obtain competent WRs and TEs.\n\n3) Get a bridge quarterback (I still have hope in Ewers).\n\nOnce those pieces are in place, go and get a young quarterback (if Ewers doesn’t cut the mustard).\n\nMIAMI235 believes it comes down to affordability.\n\nIf he stays healthy, a dynamic presence, when utilized properly. As others have stated, it may simply comedown too affordability.\n\ndavidson11 says if Tua’s gone, then just clean house.\n\nIf they’re not going to keep Tua, they might as well trade Achane and Waddle. Either tank or don’t.\n\nfinfanfromsiam believes in the build via the draft concept.\n\nVery good player that we drafted. Extend him to a decent contract. Keep our own when possible.\n\nMonix22 wants him traded based on an assumption of future injury.\n\nTrade him. Let him get hurt on another team.\n\nUpInPensacola wants to make it a package deal. Might be the only way to get a good package in return for Tua.\n\nIs it possible to trade him in a deal where Tua goes with him?\n\nPA phinphan say’s the idea of a team-friendly deal is unlikely, so maybe look for a first for him in trade.\n\nTo me this is tough decision. I would love to keep him on a team friendly deal but is that even a thing anymore? It seems like it’s all about making as much as you can with little loyalty. I get it. It’s like any other business.\n\nWith that said, if he could bring a first round pick maybe it’s best to trade him and give the new regime more picks to build their type of roster.\n\nThe Earl is a man of few words.\n\nWell, that’s our random 15 comments this evening. It seems there is no consensus on what should happen with Achane going forward, which means whatever happens with him will make some portion of the fan base unhappy. As always, thank you to each of you who took the time to join in on our question of the day and contribute to this and the prior post.

    "fullText": "The college football offseason overall is pretty quiet this time of year. In 2026, it has been a little bit louder with recent court rulings and ongoing battles.\n\nThis is also the time, however, that the NCAA works with college football programs to make changes to the game. Most recently, the running clock rule was changed, and a two-minute warning was also added.\n\nMORE: NCAA may appeal judge’s Trinidad Chambliss decision due to concerning details\n\nThe NCAA is looking to make a big change to a controversial college football rule: targeting. Targeting, of course, is when a player leads with the crown of their head for intentional contact with another player’s head or neck area.\n\nThe rule’s purpose is understandable. They want to protect all players from unnecessary hits and also protect those who tend to deliver those hits.\n\nWhat makes things controversial is the review, execution, and punishment of targeting. It can be difficult to determine if targeting in college football is malicious in nature or not intentional.\n\nMORE: Indiana gives head football coach Curt Cignetti a nice championship reward\n\nThe punishment is ejection and can also roll over into the next game for those penalized. The NCAA is reportedly aiming to change at least the rollover suspension aspect of targeting.\n\nThis is a relatively big step in addressing the difficult call to make in targeting. While some calls are very obvious–one way or another–it is still also difficult for other calls.\n\nCould the NCAA eventually change the punishment of targeting altogether? It’s a long shot at this moment, but it might be on its way to big changes.\n\nOLYMPICS: Team USA flag bearers revealed for 2026 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony\n\nNFL: Predicting the 2026 NFL free agent signings\n\nMLB: Detroit Tigers drop unreal alternate jerseys for 2026 MLB season\n\nNBA: Charlotte Hornets share update after LaMelo Ball’s car crash\n\nNHL: 2026 Winter Olympics men’s hockey, NHL payrolls for final four teams\nSPORTS MEDIA: Olympics reporter apologizes for drinking, slurring words during live segment\n\nThe post NCAA to review controversial college football rule for huge changes appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Your $1,000 laptop deserves a protective home on the road. A tech journalist and frequent traveler recommends his nine favorites\n\nThe four best personal-item backpacks that fit under US airline seats\n\nWhether you’re flying across the country on vacation, meeting with an important client downtown or just heading to your local coffee shop for work, there is a good chance you’re bringing a backpack along, with a laptop squirreled away inside.\n\nWhile you can toss a laptop into just about any bag, the best laptop backpacks are specially tailored to pamper what is probably one of your most expensive (and delicate) possessions. That means a padded pocket lined with soft non-scratch material, easy access to your computer without unpacking everything and lots of extra pockets for portable mice, chargers and other accessories. Add in all of the standard backpack considerations such as capacity, comfort and durability, and you have a lot of factors to consider.\n\nTo find the very best laptop backpack, I rounded up 11 of the top models and tested them over several months and many miles.\n\nBest overall: \n\n Mission Workshop Meridian backpack\n\nBest for travel:\n\n Peak Design Travel Backpack\n\nBest budget: \n\n The North Face Vault\n\nBest sling bag: \n\n Tomtoc Navigator – T24 Sling Bag (Small)\n\nBest rugged bag: \n\n Pelican PX25 Aegis Travel Pack\n\nI’ve been a tech journalist for 13 years, and a frequent traveler – in 2025 I flew more than 70,000 miles, across 41 flights and a total of seven days and six hours in the air. I visited 12 airports and six countries, to say nothing of countless steps, ride shares and hotels.\n\nAs someone who tends to pack more than I really need and has a bad back, I’m uniquely motivated to find the perfect backpack, and it’s been an obsessive quest of mine for years. Backpacks also speak to my love for planning and organization, which the testing process let me fully indulge.\n\nThe first thing I did to test these 11 backpacks was to pack for a trip. I put everything I typically carry for a work trip on to a table: a laptop that is anywhere from 13 to 16in, a tablet, several phones – because I have a weird job – multiple plugs, chargers, batteries and, of course, plenty of bungee cords. My loadout also includes three tech bags: one with video gear like a selfie stick and lav mics, one with flight essentials like snacks and battery packs and one with chargers, cables and adapters.\n\nThen, I packed up each backpack using the various compartments and pockets as designed, threw each backpack on to my back and I walked a half mile each. Since water is the mortal enemy of laptops, I also tested each backpack (empty – and thank goodness!) in my shower for one minute to simulate getting caught in the rain. I fully let out all the straps and donned the backpack to see how easily the straps adjusted. I zipped and unzipped each zipper 25 times to see how easy it was to use. Finally, I put a deck of playing cards in an easy-access pocket (if there was one) and timed how long it took for me to get it off my back and the cards in hand.\n\nMany manufacturers provided samples to test for this article, which I donated to my local library upon completion. It’d be a treat to see a school kid or even an adult strutting around town with one of these.\n\nMission Workshop’s Meridian backpack has pockets for days, a semi-modular design that lets you customize it with add-ons and tons of space.\n\nWhy we love it\nThis bag easily held everything I wanted to pack with room to spare, and a home for everything. All three of my tech bags fit in the main compartment, and everything else had its own pocket, making it very clear where everything lives. The sample I received included two add-ons: a slim side pouch that’s perfect for phones, battery packs or even a slim flashlight, and a bottle pouch. Laptop access on this bag is particularly nice because it has its own compartment, separate from the main compartment. It scored the highest on our waterproof testing, as well – everything inside was bone dry. The straps didn’t rest along my rib cage as well as I’d like, but it was definitely wearable.\n\nThis bag is probably overkill for a student just looking to tote a laptop and some books around campus, but it’s great for a professional who needs to schlep a bunch of gear comfortably and with easy access to everything.\n\nIt’s a shame that … It’s so big it might strain the personal item rules on most airlines. And there are no locks or hidden pockets if you’re worried about security. While it has a sleeve to slide over the handle on a roller bag, it’s situated sideways, which interferes with the side pouches and struck me as a silly design choice.\n\nMax laptop size: 17in\nCapacity: 28 litres\nEmpty weight: 2.74lbs\n\nThis bag has an unusual design: to pack it you need to rest it on its face and open the back, which hinges 180 degrees and gives you easy access to the whole main compartment.\n\nWhy we love it\nIf you’re headed out for a weekend, this is a lovely bag to comfortably bring a few changes of clothes, your laptop and all the goodies that go with it. Aside from the large main compartment, you’ll find a good amount of organization around the periphery of the main pouch, smaller zipped pockets along the side and two larger zipped pockets on the inside of the front of the bag.\n\nLoops along the periphery of the bag inside and out allow you strap even more gear to the bag, and Peak even includes tie-downs. With 30 litres of capacity, you probably won’t need to, though.\n\nIt’s a shame that … The unique design takes some getting used to. Adjusting the straps and fit is very difficult, and waterproofing was just OK. There was some water ingress, making the paper towels inside the bag damp, but not wet. The lining is also not absorbant, so it dries quickly.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 33 liters\nEmpty weight: 3.17lbs\n\nWhile it’s the most basic bag I tested, the North Face Vault is a perfectly competent laptop hauler at a fraction of the cost of most other bags on this list.\n\nWhy we love it\nBeing basic isn’t necessarily a bad thing – not every backpack needs 700 pockets for every little item. The Vault has a generous main compartment and a smaller top compartment with a few pouches and pockets for very small items, such as pencils and thumb drives. The top pouch takes away a bit of room into the main pouch, but the latter opens wide enough to easily work around it if you’re digging around for something.\n\nThis bag is deceptively deep, and it holds a lot, if pressed into service. I found it very serviceable for most tasks – the Toyota Corolla of backpacks. It will get you from A to B with no complaints. Just please don’t get caught out in the rain.\n\nIt’s a shame that … It’s not waterproof at all – water quickly works its way inside. It’s also not terribly comfortable for extended periods due to thin straps and little padding on the shoulder straps and back.\n\nMax laptop size: 15in \nCapacity: 27 liters\nEmpty weight: 1.68lbs\n\nThis isn’t technically a backpack – it’s a sling bag, but it’s delightfully small, it holds a ton of gear, and yet has enough space for a 14in laptop.\n\nWhy we love it\nThis is a great day pack, if you’re heading out for a day on the town. It only holds 7 liters, but those 7 liters are impeccably organized: there are pockets for your laptop, tablet and e-reader, plus smaller pockets for additional organization. An outer pocket is perfect for things you need to grab on the go, and a security pocket facing your back lets you safely stow your wallet, keys or passport in a tough-to-swipe location.\n\nIt’s a shame that … Adjusting the strap is very hard with the overengineered buckle. This is also the smallest bag on the list by a lot, and probably won’t hold everything you’ll want for plane rides.\n\nMax laptop size: 14in\nCapacity: 7 liters\nEmpty weight: 1.23lbs\n\nPelican is perhaps best known for its hardened cases used to carry delicate equipment, and the Aegis stays true to its roots with a super tough hard-shell design.\n\nWhy we love it\nUnlike all the soft options on our list, this model has a rigid exterior built to shrug off impact and general roughhousing. I didn’t drop the bag from my roof or anything, but if you find yourself in a harsh environment with gear that doesn’t take kindly to impact, this should be your first choice.\n\nThe backpack is essentially one large compartment, except for one small compartment at the top for odds and ends, and a laptop sleeve. If you want to more, Pelican sells stick-on Velcro “ModPaks” that add various pockets. Personally, I would need three or more, but if you want a lot of open space to work with, this is a good bag to consider. Like the Peak Design bag, it has tie-down loops inside to ratchet down your gear with cord or bungees.\n\nIt’s a shame that … There is virtually no organization in the bag – plan to use packing cubes. It also has almost no water resistance. Also, if you have a dog with not-black fur, carry a lint roller with you!\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 25 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.9lbs\n\nI prefer a messenger bag (AKA sling bag) when I need to dig into it frequently, like at a trade show, but a backpack is more comfortable for extended wear. Since I switch between them frequently, this convertible bag piqued my interest. It offers the best of both worlds: when you want to convert it, the backpack straps zip up into their own pocket, and you attach the shoulder strap to two loops and just like that, you have a messenger bag.\n\nThe main pocket is surprisingly large, and the two auxiliary pockets also hold a lot. When I was done packing in the items I used to test these bags, this one had a lot of space left over. But it didn’t reign in any one category, which knocked it down a few pegs from its competitors.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … There is no organization nor security in the bag.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 25 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.09lbs\n\nThe Knack Medium Backpack has a highly unusual design that expands out to leap from 24 to 35 litres. You actually access the laptop sleeve from the side, rather than the top, which is a novel approach. While there are some smaller pockets around the periphery of the bag, the main pocket is just one big open space with a divider, which is designed to separate clothes from other gear.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … It felt like the designers had a few clever ideas, but couldn’t quite bring them together coherently. It’s also not water-resistant at all.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in \nCapacity: 35 liters \nEmpty weight: 3lbs\n\nIf you’ve ever found yourself with the unexpected need to check a bag for a flight as I have, a lockable backpack provides welcome piece of mind. This Tomtoc has lock latches – holes where you can insert a lock to attach the zippers to each other – on both of its sets of zippers. You can’t lock up the front pockets, which is unfortunate, but you can secure the main pouch, which is probably where your most expensive goodies live.\n\nTwo zippers access the main pocket: one in the back that facilitates slipping a laptop into the sleeve, and a second one at the front that gives you a wide mouth to put other items in. They both open to the same space, which seemed a bit redundant.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … It has terrible water resistance, and it’s not terribly comfortable to carry.\n\nMax laptop size: 17.3in\nCapacity: 24 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.2lbs\n\nIf you’re a new parent, this bag is a no-brainer, but it’s also great for travelers. I’ve taken it on several trips with no screaming babies in tow and I really dig it. It offers tons of places to stick items like phones, a top pocket for quick-access items and a large stretchy pocket on the front of random odds and ends. If you’re using it as intended, there’s a space at the bottom designed to hold dirty diapers and one pocket designed for baby wipes.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … There’s no security in the bag at all, and the baby features waste a bit of space for non-parents.\n\nMax laptop size: 17in\nCapacity: 20 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.1lbs\n\nPeak Design Everyday Backpack 20L\n\nThink about capacity, organization, security, waterproofing and comfort. To prioritize, consider what you’ll be carrying and in what circumstances. A bag for day tripping to the coffee shop requires less capacity than a weekend travel bag, for instance.\n\nObviously, nothing beats trying it on. Fully extend out the straps, put it on your back and then adjust the straps to fit. If you can, toss in some dummy weight.\n\nIf you’re shopping online, examine how the straps are sewn to the backpack. If they attach vertically, they’ll run along your torso more comfortably than those attached horizontally. Also, consider the zipper pulls. As you get older, zippers with fabric or cord loops can be much easier to pull than bare metal tabs. Also look for retailers with a good return policy in case reality doesn’t match expectations.\n\nBottom padding matters more than anything. Backpacks will be slung down off your back and on to the floor hundreds, if not thousands, of times, and bottom padding is the only thing between your $2,000 laptop and a concrete floor. Also consider waterproofing – if the bag isn’t very waterproof and you get stuck out in the rain, the padding of the sleeve might absorb water and take a long time to dry out.\n\nWhile I prefer a backpack with a pocket for everything, others prefer the versatility of an open compartment. To prevent all your gear from mixing together, use packing cubes and specialized tech bags, like the Peak Design Tech Pouch I use, to hold cables and chargers. Many companies offering backpacks with open compartments also sell organizational packs to go inside.\n\nSome high-end backpacks shed water like ducks; others may as well be made of gauze. If you’re stuck in the rain with the latter, find a garbage bag to put over the backpack, making a slit for the straps if necessary (or just carry it by the handle if it has one, and most all of the bags in this list do). A friendly business may even let you have one if you ask nicely.\n\nWhen you get home, empty the backpack completely, place it in a room with a lot of air circulation and place something inside the laptop sleeve to prop it open so it can dry out. If you don’t, water can get trapped in there for days.\n\nAdam Doud is a freelance product journalist and frequent traveler who carries a ton of tech with him wherever he goes. He’s been on a low-key quest to find the perfect bag/backpack since 2020, and he has strapped more gear to his back than Hannibal’s elephants – though not all at one time. He is also a compulsive organizer, so the more pockets the better",

    "description": "A mom explains why she pulled her high school son out of school for a three-week trip to Antarctica to ease college anxiety and gain perspective.",
    "fullText": "My high school son, Jack, was overwhelmed with college anxiety — SAT prep, AP classes, acceptance rates, and all the pressure that comes with being a New York student.\n\nIt was hard to quiet the noise, so I decided to make a radical — and unconventional decision: I pulled him out of school and took him to Antarctica for three weeks over winter break.\n\nEveryone told me it was a terrible idea, but I thought it was exactly what he needed.\n\nJack and I have been traveling together since he was 3 months old. I'm a huge traveler, and when I had my first son, I decided to take him along for the ride.\n\nIn elementary school, I didn't think twice about pulling him out in order to explore the world (Costa Rica, Mexico, Nevis, Finland). Against the judgment of some parents (and some school officials), I thought it was important to expose him to travel — different cultures, different ways of doing things, different ways of thinking. He quickly became my favorite travel companion, and I often thought travel Jack was the best version of himself.\n\nIt became more difficult to pull him out in middle school (but I still did — he missed eighth-grade graduation — to go on a trip to Sri Lanka). Once he entered high school (where, according to him, grades matter), it became really difficult to make up the work if I pulled him out.\n\nThen came junior year and all the stress that comes with college prep settled upon us. Not only was he balancing a bunch of AP classes, but he was also studying for the SAT and doing all the college prep work. Basically, he (and therefore I) became slightly unhinged.\n\nSo when I floated the idea of going on a trip — just the two of us — Jack was instantly in, but I got tons of pushback from everyone else. Junior year is the most important year for college prep; he's in AP classes, and it's super hard to make up the work. Did I have my priorities straight? Now is the time to lock in, not travel.\n\nBut I ignored the noise and booked us on a three-week cruise to Antarctica — he had two weeks off for the holiday break and would miss one week of school. I had him talk to all his teachers about missed work and make-up, and, surprisingly, while a lot of parents thought I was nuts, the teachers were supportive of this once-in-a-lifetime trip.\n\nAnd off we went on a three-week trip to Antarctica, South Georgia, and the Falkland Islands. I purposefully chose this cruise itinerary because it included South Georgia, which everyone says is a must if going to the white continent. It definitely made the trip long (by a week), but it turned out South Georgia was both Jack and my favorite part of the cruise (we saw thousands of king penguins in their beautiful orange plumage, alongside their baby chicks, which looked like they were wearing lush fur coats).\n\nEvery day was a different adventure: hiking up snow-capped peaks; kayaking among icebergs looking for whales and seals; getting face-to-face with several types of penguins (we quickly learned the difference between rockhopper, macaroni, gentoo, Adelie, and chinstrap varieties).\n\nFar from GPAs and college chatter, surrounded instead by penguins, elephant seals, and endless ice, Jack's perspective started to shift. College stopped feeling like the entire world — and started looking like just one chapter.\n\nOne night we had dinner with Rich Pagen a naturalist and Kristen Wornson the Young Explorers guide. When Jack asked them how they knew what they wanted to do with their lives, they shared their experience of trying to find the right college and then moving into different career circles. It was great for Jack to hear that their path wasn't always straightforward, but they ultimately found jobs they loved.\n\nFor Jack to see people loving their jobs — and to realize that no one thought they'd end up where they did, leading expeditions in Antarctica — was a great wake-up call.\n\nAlso, because this was the family holiday cruise, several other families with teens were on board. It was great for Jack to get out of his comfort zone and talk to teens from all over the world. One was taking a gap year before college, and it really got him realizing that there are so many paths out there.\n\nThe trip also brought Jack and me closer together; away from the distractions of everyday life, we connected in a way that's rare during the teenage years.\n\nOn this trip, Jack and I always did the excursions together, and we ate dinner together every night. But on sea days, I attended every lecture, and he opted to go to the gym or sleep. By giving each other space, we really enjoyed the time we did spend together. I didn't nag him, and he, in turn, didn't give me an attitude.\n\nIt was one of our favorite trips together.",

It's not like that in the United States, where it costs money to go to the doctor,\" he wrote. \"We are always open to dialogue and collaboration. Also with the U.S. But talk to us now instead of just coming up with more or less random outbursts on social media.\"\n\nTrump has had his sights set on the Arctic island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory, since his first term in office. Trump has suggested the US could buy Greenland or even take it by force.\n\nThe president says Greenland's location makes it strategically important as the melting of Arctic ice opens up new shipping routes and intensifies competition with Russia and China.\n\nThe island is also rich in critical minerals and already hosts a key US military base, which American officials say is vital to missile defense and Arctic security.\n\nMajor European leaders, including those from France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Denmark, released a joint statement last month defending Greenland.\n\n\"Greenland belongs to its people,\" the statement said. \"It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",

    "description": "The president now routinely tells companies how to run their businesses and threatens them if they don't comply.",
    "fullText": "Netflix wants President Donald Trump's stamp of approval as it maneuvers to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNow, Trump has a demand for Netflix: unseat board member Susan Rice.\n\nIn normal times, we would all be marveling at the spectacle of the US president telling a company in the midst of a merger fight (Paramount also wants to buy Warner Bros. Discovery) how to structure its board. During Trump 2.0, though, this has become standard stuff. Trump routinely tells companies to fire someone he doesn't like or do something he does like.\n\nThat doesn't mean Trump always gets what he wants. The demands alone, however, are an extraordinary use of power. We should make sure we don't become inured to it.\n\nTrump's Truth Social post is a reminder that the future of Warner Bros. Discovery will run through the White House, no matter what Trump says at any given moment. (Refresher: In December, Trump said, \"I'll be involved\" in the fight between Netflix and Paramount. Earlier this month, he announced that \"I've decided I shouldn't be involved.\" Now he's telling Netflix it will \"pay the consequences\" if it doesn't fire Rice, which sure seems like he's involved again.)\n\nTrump himself doesn't have the authority to stop Warner Bros. Discovery from selling itself to Netflix or Paramount, which is controlled by David Ellison and his father, the prominent Trump supporter, Larry Ellison. He can, however, instruct Attorney General Pam Bondi to sue to stop a deal on antitrust grounds.\n\nModern presidents have traditionally assumed an arm's-length distance from federal law enforcement. And it's entirely possible that any other president's Department of Justice would also look into an antitrust case against Netflix, given its enormous market power.\n\nTrump, however, has made it clear that he expects Bondi to act on his behalf. So if he doesn't want Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, he can certainly make it more difficult for them.\n\nWhich makes it puzzling that Rice, who held senior roles in the Clinton, Obama, and Biden administrations, would sound off on a podcast, announcing that \"elites\" and \"corporate interests\" who accommodated Trump would one day \"be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\"\n\nThis wasn't a mere gaffe or misstatement. She went on at length. It was, regardless of how she intended it, a provocation aimed at the Trump White House — at the exact moment the company she's supposed to help govern is seeking Trump's approval.\n\nI've asked Netflix for comment on Rice's comments and Trump's response.\n\nWe should also note that Trump's most consistent trait is his inconsistency and that he frequently reverses himself. Last summer, for instance, he announced that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was \"highly CONFLICTED\" and must resign. Days later, Trump met with Tan and described him as a \"success.\" Weeks after that, the US government acquired 10% of Intel.\n\nNor does Trump always follow through. Last fall, he demanded that Microsoft fire Lisa Monaco, an executive who had also worked for Clinton, Obama, and Biden. Monaco still works for Microsoft.\n\nHowever, just because we don't know how serious Trump is about pushing Rice out of Netflix — or how his administration will ultimately rule on the Netflix/Paramount race — doesn't mean we should shrug this off.\n\nWe're in a place where the president routinely tells companies how to run their businesses and threatens them if they don't comply. If we get used to that, we shouldn't be surprised when future presidents decide they can do it, too.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "The Monday morning commute won't be messy in New York City. It will be nonexistent.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declared a state of emergency and a travel ban during a press conference on Sunday as a giant winter storm bore down on much of the Northeast.\n\nThe National Weather Service said to expect blizzard conditions and up to 20 inches of snow over the next 24 hours. Parts of New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts could get up to 25 inches.\n\n\"The state of emergency closes the streets, highways, and bridges of New York City for all traffic,\" Mamdani said. The travel ban begins at 9 p.m. Sunday and lasts until 12 p.m. on Monday. DoorDash, notably, also said it was suspending deliveries Sunday night.\n\nUS airlines, meanwhile, are canceling and delaying thousands of flights. As of Sunday afternoon, airlines had canceled over 3,000 flights and delayed over 2,900, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nNew York City's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports have the highest number of cancellations, followed by Newark Liberty International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and Boston Logan International Airport.\n\nAnyone hoping to catch a flight in the region on Monday can also expect major disruptions, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. At LaGuardia Airport, for example, 82% of flights scheduled for Monday have been canceled.\n\nAdding to what will likely be a chaotic 48 hours for travelers, the Department of Homeland Security announced Saturday night that it was suspending TSA PreCheck and Global Entry due to the partial government shutdown.\n\nDespite the announcement, however, TSA Precheck and Global Entry lanes remained open at major airports on Sunday. In a statement, the Transportation Security Administration said it is evaluating the situation \"case-by-case.\"\n\n\"At this time, TSA PreCheck remains operational with no change for the traveling public,\" a spokesperson said. \"As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case-by-case basis and adjust operations accordingly.\"\n\nThe federal government entered a partial shutdown earlier this month, delaying funding for some agencies, like DHS. TSA agents are essential workers, so they're still working — for now. During the full government shutdown earlier this year, TSA agents and air traffic controllers went 43 days without a paycheck.",

The area gained fame from the 70s and 80s show \"The Love Boat,\" which was often set there.\n\nThe Mexican government said the retaliatory violence came after it killed Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes, the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, on Sunday.\n\nThe State Department announced last week that it had sanctioned Kovay Gardens — a Mexican timeshare resort — and 17 other companies and five individuals linked to \"timeshare fraud schemes\" organized by the Jalisco cartel.\n\n\"Many of these individuals and entities are based in or near Puerto Vallarta, a popular tourist destination that also serves as a strategic stronghold for CJNG,\" a press release from the Treasury Department said.\n\nIn 2024, the US State Department said it would pay a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Cervantes.

Imageless electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) provides a non invasive alternative to electrical mapping from body surface potentials, but conventional ECGI is confined to epicardial reconstructions and can miss arrhythmias originating in deeper myocardium. We address this by reconstructing three dimensional cardiac activity with a volumetric formulation that solves an inverse source problem via Green's functions, enabling full volume activation mapping and improved localization in anatomically complex regions. We evaluate the approach on simulated premature ventricular beats and on four challenging patient cases, a right ventricular outflow tract premature ventricular contraction, a left bundle branch block, a ventricular tachycardia, and Wolff Parkinson White, and additionally assess performance on an open source myocardial infarction dataset. Results show that volumetric ECGI recovers 3D activation and sharpens arrhythmia origin localization, achieving a 59.",

    "fullText": "Oliver Glasner says it is \"absolutely OK\" to \"face criticism\" after some Crystal Palace fans again questioned his immediate future as manager.\n\nGlasner, who led the Eagles to their first major honour last May, said last month that he will leave the club when his contract expires in the summer.\n\nSome fans called for him to leave now during their Europa Conference League draw at Zrinjski Mostar in midweek, and a banner held during Sunday's Premier League win over bottom club Wolves said he is \"finished\".\n\nThat was the Eagles' first home win since early November and just their second overall since early December.\n\nAnother banner called the club's board \"inept\" as there had been \"opportunities missed\" since last season's FA Cup triumph.\n\nGlasner told Sky Sports after Sunday's 1-0 victory that he saw the banners and said: \"It's OK. The fans are as disappointed as we are and they can't talk to us directly, so it's their opportunity to express their mood.\n\n\"That's what we have to accept. On the other side, they supported the team right until the end and that's why I think they helped [us] to win the game. But when we face criticism, it's absolutely OK.\"\n\nAlthough Palace claimed their first win in 13 at Brighton two weeks ago, they then let a 2-0 lead slip to lose 3-2 at home to second-bottom Burnley.\n\nIn a news conference after Thursday's 1-1 draw in Bosnia, Glasner told disgruntled fans to \"stay humble\" and was far from convincing when asked whether he wants to stay at Selhurst Park until the summer, saying \"let's see what the future brings, you never know.\"\n\nOn if he has the drive to continue leading the club, he replied \"yes, I think so\" before adding \"I'm just not good enough to replace the players we sold. I'm just not good enough to integrate the new players to play the same way like we did, and I'm not good enough that we can cope with the schedule we had.\"\n\nBut Glasner provided more clarity after Sunday's game, stressing he remains committed to the club.\n\n\"For me, Oliver Glasner is not important,\" he told the BBC's Match of the Day. \"If the club had thought they need a change, then I don't want to be in the way. That is what I meant.\n\n\"I spoke to the board, to the chairman, to the sporting director and they said 'no, we think you are the right one'.\"\n\n'Stay humble' - Glasner reacts to fan backlash as future in doubt\n\nThe Austrian added: \"The most important thing is Crystal Palace, and I am here 100% to be successful for Crystal Palace.\n\n\"I need the players. It's important that the players are believing in what we are telling them - I and the staff. It's important that the club is believing in us, that we can get this turnaround and end this season successfully.\"\n\nThe Eagles were fortunate to beat Wolves, with Evann Guessand scoring a 90th-minute winner after the visitors missed a first-half penalty and spent more than 30 minutes with 10 men.\n\n\"Of course, the fans are like us all, disappointed with some results and some parts of the game. That's normal,\" said Glasner.\n\n\"I don't expect them to celebrate us when we don't win, when we don't perform right, but on the other side, since I was here, I felt support from the first day.\n\n\"Hopefully we face more wins and the mood around the club will be better and we will enjoy our life much more.\"\n\nLatest Crystal Palace news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Crystal Palace - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "For those who have followed Eberechi Eze's career, the sight of him wheeling away to celebrate an important goal towards the end of the season will not come as a surprise.\n\nTottenham Hotspur fans, though, will be happy not to come up against the Arsenal forward again until next season.\n\nEze has scored 40 Premier League goals in his six league seasons, with 19 coming from the 30th game onwards.\n\nBasically, the England international has a record of netting goals late in the campaign, when it matters most.\n\nEze, who scored the winning goal for Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final last season against Manchester City, has tormented Spurs since turning them down last summer to sign for the Gunners.\n\nHaving netted a hat-trick in the 4-1 north London derby win back in November, another two followed in Sunday's crucial encounter at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\n\"He had that belief and I'm really happy with him. He's really trying to mould and adapt into what we want from him,\" said boss Mikel Arteta.\n\nIronically, Eze's other league goal this season came against his former side Palace in a 1-0 win in October, which means all his league goals this term have come against those two teams.\n\nAnd after his brace in Arsenal's latest thumping of their rivals, only Robert Pires (seven) and Emmanuel Adebayor (six) have more Premier League goals for the Gunners against Tottenham than Eze's five.\n\nHe is also the first Arsenal player to score five or more goals against an opponent in the same top-flight season since Adebayor against Derby in 2007-08 (six).\n\nSupporters had already taken to the 27-year-old because of the way he signed for the club, turning down Spurs to join them instead in a £60m deal, but the goals he has scored are the icing on the cake.\n\nArsenal pass derby test of nerve as title race looks set to go to wire\n\nEze Arsenal's derby hero again as leaders sink Tudor's Spurs\n\n'Who's going to get this fine?' - Arteta on derby technology delays\n\nIt's been a difficult period for Eze, who has found minutes in the league hard to come by and this was was only his second start in the league since December.\n\nHe has a tough route into the team with captain Martin Odegaard a key part of Arteta's first-choice midfield when he is fit and Leandro Trossard being in good form on the left wing, which is the other position Eze might feature.\n\nThe Arsenal boss did trial Eze on the left, but he switched off when Matty Cash scored Aston Villa's opener in their 2-1 defeat in December and, despite starting the following game, he was left on the substitute's bench for the next four league matches.\n\nArteta opted to play England winger Bukayo Saka from the start in the disappointing 2-2 draw with Wolves in midweek as a number 10 - ahead of Eze, who started on the bench.\n\nAnd the Spaniard admitted: \"He was upset, even with me, because I didn't play him the other day from the beginning, and some of the decisions that I made. And I just have to understand how we're going to get the best out of him now.\"\n\nArteta was asked by BBC Sport whether Eze's record of producing goals at the end of the season was one of the reasons they signed him.\n\n\"We looked at every stat, but that one, to be very honest, no,\" he added while laughing.\n\n\"He scored five goals in the last few games against them, which is extremely difficult to do. But I could see that he wanted to prove something.\"\n\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel was in attendance at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Eze will have hoped to have caught his eye after a recent lack of game time to boost his World Cup hopes this summer.\n\n\"Today it's worked out, we thank God for it,\" Eze told Sky Sports. \"We put in a good performance. We did what we needed to do, which was the main thing.\n\n\"I'm always trying to get in those positions to be ready and to find the space and to work hard to get those opportunities. It takes a lot to get there and it's worked out today.\"\n\nIt was also an important day for Eze's team-mate Viktor Gyokeres.\n\nThe Swedish international has been criticised at times this season for his performances but since the turn of the year has started to find some form.\n\nAnd after a double himself at Spurs, no Premier League player has scored more goals in 2026 across all competitions than Gyokeres with eight of his 15 for his club coming in this calendar year.\n\nThe 27-year-old linked up with Eze and played a big part in Arsenal's third goal, while he seemed to visibly grow in confidence after scoring.\n\n\"For me, the best, the most complete, and especially when we need him most and that is when big players and big clubs have to stand up when you are needed,\" added Arteta when asked about his £64m summer signing from Sporting.\n\nArsenal are now five points clear of Manchester City, although they have played one more game and visit Pep Guardiola's men at Etihad Stadium in April - and Eze and Gyokeres look like they are starting to find the net at just the right time.\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, launching a book tour widely seen as a prelude to a presidential run, discussed with CNN the possibility of running against former Vice President Kamala Harris, another longtime figure in California politics.\n\n“What happens if and when those parallel careers intersect and collide?” CNN’s Dana Bash asked Newsom in an interview that aired Sunday.\n\n“Well, I’m San Francisco now, she’s LA,” Newsom said at first. “So there’s a little distance between the two of us. You know, fate will determine that.”\n\n“I’ve never gotten in the way of her ambition, ever,” he added. “I haven’t. And I don’t imagine I would in the future.”\n\n“But if you run against each other for president,” Bash followed up. Newsom responded, “Yeah I just – that’s fate. I don’t – you know, you can only control what you can control.”\n\nNewsom has been forthright about his interest in the 2028 presidential race. Harris opted out of running to succeed Newsom as California governor but has left open the possibility of a third presidential bid.\n\nHarris served as district attorney in San Francisco before being elected the California attorney general and then a US senator before serving as vice president. Newsom was San Francisco’s mayor prior to becoming lieutenant governor and then governor.\n\nThe two have collided at times – Harris wrote in her most recent book, “107 Days,” that when she called Newsom to ask for his support after former President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid, Newsom texted back, “Hiking. Will call back,” and never did. (Newsom, who did endorse Harris quickly, later told reporters the call came from an unknown number.)\n\nSpeaking to Bash, Newsom emphasized that he would carefully weigh the decision with his family. Asked if his family was on board, Newsom responded, “I don’t know. It depends on the day.”\n\nAnd he shared concerns from one of his sons about a potential presidential bid.\n\n“My son … it was very powerful, texted me a few months ago when there was some headline that suggested that I made some decision, and he goes, ‘Dad, are you running (for) president?” Newsom said.\n\nHe continued, “I said, no, we’ll make this decision as a family. And he goes, you can’t. And I said, why? He goes, ‘I’m too young. You need to spend more time with us.’\n\n“I mean, how do you deal with that one?” he said.\n\n“How do you deal with that one?” Bash responded.\n\n“Exactly – I’m asking you,” Newsom replied with a smile.",

    "fullText": "People use artificial intelligence (AI) for many things: meal planning, budgeting and interior design. But can you use a platform like ChatGPT for tasks that normally require a professional, like financial planning? \n\nI chose a hypothetical scenario and asked ChatGPT to construct a retirement plan that would allow a retiree to live on $100,000 a year. I assumed an annual income of $125,000 for a 40-year-old who wants to retire in a fully paid-off home in Tennessee at age 65. After setting the parameters (and asking ChatGPT if they were realistic) I asked the generative AI to create a retirement plan.\n\nThen, I asked Eric Franklin, CFP, managing principal at Prospero Wealth to review and assess it.\n\nWhen I first reached out, Franklin said it sounded interesting; he’d never been enlisted to critique an AI system before. With 23 years of tech experience, he was the perfect choice.\n\n“I had no idea what I was going to get,” he said.\n\nThe results were alarming. Not because ChatGPT’s output was immediately, obviously awful or right on the money.  It was scary because it fell into a gray area that artists call “the uncanny valley.”\n\nAt first glance, ChatGPT didn’t seem to be completely wrong.\n\nFind Out: Here’s How Much You Need To Retire With a $100K Lifestyle\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\n“I read it through and, at first, at the top level, it passed the sniff test. It looked fairly realistic,” Franklin said. “If I weren’t pushing on it too hard, I’d probably feel like it was somewhat accurate. Those were my first impressions.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the plan I presented was only one aspect of what financial advisors at Prospero Wealth offer clients. “It doesn’t include a lot of the things we’d normally include, like stress tests, accounting for changes in your career, changes in your family or possible relocations.”\n\nBut as Franklin dove deeper, he realized something that could be dangerous for anyone trying to use ChatGPT as a retirement planning tool without knowledge and experience to back it up.\n\nIt started with false premises, failed to adjust for inflation and created an unrealistic scenario. Granted, there were limitations in the exercise because the prompt was designed to be broad and concise. It was written by someone who is not a financial planner and intentionally didn’t flag anything that seemed off throughout the process. This prompt was designed for someone who thinks they can use ChatGPT to help them plan for retirement, plugging in basic information and expecting actionable insights. That probably describes a lot of people using ChatGPT.",

    "description": "General Caine warned Trump an attack on Iran would be \"far more difficult\" than the operation that captured Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is weighing options to avoid a major military conflict with Iran if the country does not ditch its nuclear program after General Dan “Raizin” Caine told him an attack would be “far more difficult” than the operation that captured Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, The New York Times reported on Sunday evening.\n\nThe report said Trump and key members of his administration are heading to Geneva on Thursday to meet with Iranian negotiators; the meeting appears to be a “last-ditch” effort to avoid a military conflict.\n\n“President Trump has told advisers that if diplomacy or any initial targeted U.S. attack does not lead Iran to give in to his demands that it give up its nuclear program, he will consider a much bigger attack in coming months intended to drive that country’s leaders from power,” the report said, based on “people briefed on internal administration deliberations.”\n\nThe Times story has four reporters on the byline — Julian E. Barnes, David E. Sanger, Tyler Pager, and Eric Schmitt.\n\nMembers of Trump’s team and on the Iranian side are both considering an “off-ramp to military conflict,” which would include a “very limited nuclear enrichment program” that would only be used for medical research, the report said. That is because some members of the administration have expressed “doubts” a full dismantling of Iran’s nuclear program occur, if the U.S. only conducts airstrikes.\n\nHere is a key section on Caine warning Trump that attacking Iran could be harder than first expected:\n\nDuring the discussions of the operation last month to seize President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, General Caine told Mr. Trump there was a high likelihood of success. But General Caine has not been able to deliver the same reassurances to Mr. Trump during the Iran discussions, in large measure because it is a far more difficult target.\n\n[Vice President JD] Vance, who has long called for more restraint in overseas military action, did not oppose a strike, but he intensely questioned General Caine and Mr. Ratcliffe in the meeting. He pressed them to share their opinions of the options and wanted more of a discussion of the risks and complexity of carrying out a strike against Iran.\n\nThe report comes a few days after CBS senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs reported top military officials told Trump the military is ready for a potential strike as soon as this weekend. And Axios’s Barak Ravid reported on February 18 that “a U.S. military operation in Iran would likely be a massive, weeks-long campaign that would look more like full-fledged war than last month’s pinpoint operation in Venezuela, sources say.”\n\nAll of this comes amid months of protests against Iran’s theocratic regime inside the country.\n\nThe Times report added Trump is leaving open the possibility for a “military assault later this year intended to help topple Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It appears this could go a number of ways heading into the big summit this Thursday.\n\nThe post US Mulling an ‘Off Ramp’ On Iran As Top General Advises Trump Iran Attack Would Be ‘Far More Difficult’ Than Venezuela: NYT first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Arsenal passed the north London derby test with flying colours as Premier League title race looks likely to go to the wire, says chief football writer Phil McNulty",
    "fullText": "Arsenal answered questions posed about their nerve under pressure in the most emphatic fashion in the north London derby to suggest this is a Premier League race that will go down to the wire.\n\nThe manner in which Mikel Arteta's side collapsed in losing a two-goal lead at doomed Wolverhampton Wanderers saw old uncertainties and past pain resurface as hunters Manchester City scented blood.\n\nIt made the meeting with arch-rivals Spurs even more hazardous, especially with the toxic air around this dysfunctional club partly cleared by the sacking of unpopular head coach Thomas Frank and his replacement by Igor Tudor.\n\nArsenal need not have worried as, even with the imposing figure of the giant Croatian prowling his technical area clad in black, they were the beneficiaries of the latest cure prescribed by \"Dr. Tottenham\", always on hand to provide help to any opponent in times of strife.\n\nThe Spurs stadium announcer attempted to rally the crowd with a growled pre-match message delivered at ear-splitting volume, bellowing: \"They are worried. They are nervous as hell. We are calm. We are ready. The fire is ready to be lit.\"\n\nSadly for Spurs, the final score on that one was zero out of five.\n\nArsenal were the furthest thing from \"nervous as hell.\" Spurs were the furthest thing from calm and ready. No fires lit here.\n\nSpurs were almost cruelly outclassed as Arsenal's advantage at the top of the table returned to five points, although Pep Guardiola's City have a game in hand.\n\nEze 'wanted to prove something' as he torments Spurs again\n\nEze Arsenal's derby hero again as leaders sink Tudor's Spurs\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nTo sum up this latest Premier League weekend, Manchester City threw down the gauntlet by closing the gap to two points with a tension-filled win against Newcastle United. Arsenal picked it up with relish in this thumping 4-1 win.\n\nIt means that even before the end of February, sights are starting to turn to what might just be a title decider between City and Arsenal at Etihad Stadium on 18 April.\n\nIn the interim, Arsenal have home games against Chelsea, Everton and Bournemouth, along with a visit to Brighton. City travel to Leeds United, West Ham and Chelsea, with relegation strugglers Nottingham Forest to come to the Etihad.\n\nAnd, of course, there might just be a psychological blow to be struck when Arsenal and City meet in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on Sunday 22 March.\n\nArsenal are now 10 games from the glory that has eluded them since Arsene Wenger's \"Invincibles\" in 2003-04. Destiny is their hands. The twist in the tale is that the same applies to Manchester City.\n\nFor all Arsenal might have wished to play down the significance of this single game in the title context, it was a win and performance they needed desperately to calm concerns on and off the pitch.\n\nAnd this was a consummate display, cool and measured with a ruthless edge, even if it came against this dreadfully poor Spurs side.\n\nEberechi Eze picked the perfect time to return to his best, playing his part as derby tormentor again with two goals to add to the three he got in the 4-1 win at Emirates Stadium in December.\n\nSince that hat-trick, Eze had featured in all 15 of Arsenal's subsequent league games, but had made only four starts and played just 360 minutes before this derby.\n\nIn his last start he was substituted at half-time against Brentford, so credit to Arteta for having the instinct to feel that this was the sort of occasion to suit him, deploying him in the \"number 10\" role against the club who thought they had signed him until Arsenal stepped in to clinch a £60m deal with Crystal Palace.\n\nAnd there was more good news with much-criticised striker Viktor Gyokeres also scoring two fine goals on a perfect day for the Gunners and their ecstatic fanbase.\n\nArsenal were not knocked out of their stride, even after Randal Kolo Muani's bustling equaliser for Spurs two minutes after Eze struck the first blow. This was a confident, reassuring performance.\n\nArteta told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"This was outstanding. I think you have to bring context to the situation and this is the beauty of football.\n\n\"You go to Wolves and you drop two points in the last kick of the match. Watching it back, there is no understanding from my perception how the hell that happened.\n\n\"It feels like the end of the world, but then you have another opportunity and that is the beauty of it. In a difficult stadium, against our rivals, and seeing how much it means to us in the league and all our supporters.\"\n\nHe added: \"This chapter we wanted to write. We have managed it.\"\n\nBBC Sport pundit Danny Murphy expects the race between the two to go right to the finishing line.\n\nHe said: \"The title race is still on massively for both. It's in both their hands, that's unusual. Normally it's in one team's hands and you are just waiting for them to slip up.\n\n\"I have been very much in the Arsenal camp in terms of my eyes telling me they are the best team. The last couple of results have given Man City that little bit of hope. They have a lot of players in the squad who have been there and done it.\n\n\"Speaking from experience, when you have got over the line, the next couple feel easier. Every time Arsenal go on the pitch the pressure is on at the minute. It's great for us and I hope it goes to the wire. I don't see any winning all games from now until the end of the season.\"\n\nArsenal's nerve was put the test. They passed - and more tests will come for the Gunners and Manchester City as the Premier League pursuit reaches its climax.\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team",

    "description": "Liverpool's late 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest puts the Reds firmly in the Champions League hunt after a \"robbery\" of a victory at the City Ground.",
    "fullText": "Carnage would be an understatement to describe the closing moments of Liverpool's victory at the City Ground, but it would not be over the top to call the win a heist - one that puts Arne Slot's side firmly in the Champions League hunt.\n\nThe fact that Nottingham Forest boss Vitor Pereira said he was \"angry with football\" summed it up. Forest did not deserve to lose.\n\nFor large parts of the afternoon, the home fans chanted \"In your head, Arne, Arne, Arne\" to the tune of Zombie by The Cranberries as Pereira's side dominated the defending champions.\n\nBefore today, Slot had failed to beat Forest in any of his previous three attempts as Liverpool boss.\n\nYet as the Liverpool players made their way to the away end after snatching a remarkable victory through Alexis Mac Allister, the same chant came from the travelling support, who could hardly believe their luck.\n\nLiverpool were dull for most parts but deserve praise for their resilience and the importance of Mac Allister's 97th-minute winner cannot be underestimated in the sense that it took Liverpool level on points with Chelsea and Manchester United, in fourth and fifth.\n\n\"It's one of the biggest robberies I've seen in the Premier League this season,\" said Jamie Carragher on Sky Sports.\n\nFor Slot, who has regularly insisted that Liverpool have been unfortunate on many an occasion this season, there was an acceptable that his side had finally got the rub of the green.\n\n\"My emotions were emotions of happiness and relief because this is the first time I have to do a different post match press conference,\" said Slot.\n\n\"We did not play a good game. We have been on the wrong side of the score after a good performance too many times.\n\n\"We got more than we deserved. A draw would have been a fair result. We needed to be on the right side of things once in a while. It felt we have been lucky.\"\n\nThe first was his disallowed goal that came after Stefan Ortega had made a great save to deny Hugo Ekitike. As Ola Aina tried to clear the ball, it hit Mac Allister and flew into the net. But what would have been a fortuitous goal was chalked off because the ball was deemed to have hit his elbow, which was tight to his body.\n\n\"It hit my back and my elbow. I understand the rule but if you understand football, that goal should have stood,\" Mac Allister told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The first half wasn't good at all; positioning, pressing, intensity. It was not our standard. The second half, I wouldn't say it was good but it was better,\" he added.\n\nMac Allister scores late winner in frantic finish at Forest\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nFor Liverpool, the journey back to Merseyside will be sweet. There really is nothing like a late winner, particularly in extra time of extra time as Slot stated, but the Dutchman will know that his team must improve.\n\nMohamed Salah had an off day and though he has upped his workrate off the ball since returning from the Africa Cup of Nations, he has now gone nine Premier League games without a goal.\n\nAgainst Forest he was replaced by Rio Ngumoha, who put in the cross that led to Mac Allister's disallowed goal, and once again showed exactly why he's so highly rated with an energetic performance.\n\n\"Ngumoha came on and had a bigger impact than Salah,\" was the verdict of BBC pundit Pat Nevin on Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"He absolutely changed the game, this kid,\" said Carragher.\n\nSlot added: \"He has incredible potential, otherwise, at 17 years of age, you don't play as many minutes as he does in the Premier League, let alone at Liverpool.\n\n\"I don't think there is any other 17-year-old who has played as many minutes in the Premier League.\n\n\"That tells you how much of a talent we think he is. He is making progress and that's why you see him playing more and more.\"\n\nNgumoha is yet to start a Premier League game for Liverpool but surely the wait won't be long now.\n\n\"He gets stronger and stronger,\" added Slot. \"Apart from his moment when he had his one-v-one, there were also one or two other moments where he stood his ground.\n\n\"For him to show this already at 17 years of age, it says something about his talent.\n\n\"But as we all know, talent is only the start of his career, you need so many other things. Macca is a great example of mentality and that is something you need to have a career at this level.\"\n\nLiverpool certainly didn't scintillate with their display in the Midlands but they showed the resilience of champions.\n\nAnd there is still plenty of life in their season yet.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Grounded until at least April, NASA’s giant moon rocket is headed back to the hangar this week for more repairs before astronauts climb aboard.\n\nThe space agency said Sunday it’s targeting Tuesday for the slow, four-mile (6.4-kilometer) trek across Kennedy Space Center, weather permitting.\n\nNASA had barely finished a repeat fueling test Thursday, to ensure dangerous hydrogen fuel leaks were plugged, when another problem cropped up.\n\nThis time, the rocket’s helium system malfunctioned, further delaying astronauts’ first trip to the moon in more than half a century.\n\nEngineers had just tamed the hydrogen leaks and settled on a March 6 launch date — already a month late — when the helium issue arose. The helium flow to the rocket's upper stage was disrupted; helium is needed to purge the engines and pressurize the fuel tanks.\n\n“Returning to the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy is required to determine the cause of the issue and fix it,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\nNASA said the quick rollback preps preserve an April launch attempt, but stressed that will depend on how the repairs go. The space agency has only a handful of days any given month to launch the crew of four around the moon and back.\n\nThe three Americans and one Canadian assigned to the Artemis II mission remain on standby in Houston. They will become the first people to fly to the moon since NASA's Apollo program that sent 24 astronauts there from 1968 through 1972.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "Wayne Gretzky is on hand for the men's gold medal game between the United States and Canada on Sunday.\n\nYou would think that it would be obvious that Gretzky, the Chosen One, would be rooting for Canada. Gretzky was born and raised in Canada. He's widely considered the greatest hockey player of all-time. But in recent years, Gretzky has been friendly with President Trump, who has threatened Canada and suggested that it could become America's 51st state.\n\nGretzky was asked who he'll be rooting for on Sunday. He's making it clear he's rooting for Canada.\n\n“I’m a hockey player. I’m a Canadian, a true Canadian. I want Canada 🇨🇦 to win a gold medal. I’ve never wavered from that. I’ve been friends with prime minsters and presidents. Somehow there’s been a little bit more tension than normal. At the end of the day, Canada and the US are like brothers and sisters, they’re gonna fight and argue but eventually they’ll come together. That’s the way I see it,\" he said.\n\nGretzky has faced criticism for his friendship and relationship with President Trump, amid the ongoing U.S.-Canada tensions.\n\nBut while Gretzky has faced criticism, he hasn't backed down.\n\n“People are going to say and believe what they want,” Gretzky said on an episode of the “100% Hockey” podcast co-hosted by Darren Millard and John Shannon. “The bottom line is, I know in my heart I’m Canadian, I’ve stayed Canadian and I’m a Canadian for life.”\n\nGretzky has been booed by some Canadians, which he's glad his late father hasn't been around to see.\n\n“You’ve got to take the good with the bad,” Gretzky said. “I’m glad he didn’t have to see it.”\n\nWhile Gretzky has been friendly with President Trump, he claims he's not really into politics.\n\n“I’m Canadian,” Gretzky said. “I can’t vote in the U.S. because I live in the U.S. and I’m Canadian. I can’t vote in Canada because I don’t live in Canada.\n\n“I’m not into politics. And so I can’t stop the prime minister from saying something. I can’t stop the president from saying something. I just kind of like, well, I’m just a hockey player, simple as that.”",

    "description": "Over and over, the Republicans and former Republicans who gathered just outside Washington this weekend warned that President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress are tearing at the very fabric of ...",
    "fullText": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. (AP) — Over and over, the Republicans and former Republicans who gathered just outside Washington this weekend warned that President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress are tearing at the very fabric of American democracy.\n\nA former congressman described the president's party as an “authoritarian-embracing cult.” A prominent conservative writer said Trumpism is an \"existential threat.\" And a retired Army general, his voice shaking with emotion, cited post-Nazi Germany as a roadmap for the nation's post-Trump recovery.\n\nIt's unclear how many people are listening.\n\nThe main convention hall at the sixth annual Principles First summit on Saturday and Sunday was half empty. About 750 chairs were set up in a room that could have fit thousands, and many were unfilled. Not a single current Republican elected official participated in the two-day program.\n\nThis is what remains of the Grand Old Party’s Never Trump movement, a coalition of Republicans, former Republicans and independents who banded together as Trump consolidated power. They largely remain political exiles — not quite at home among Democrats yet disgusted by how the president has abandoned Republicans' longstanding commitments to free trade and limited government.\n\nJohn McDowell, 69, who was a lifelong Republican before Trump’s emergence, acknowledged that the diminished group had virtually “zero” political clout within his former party.\n\n“It’s just a fact. We’re losing good people,” said McDowell, a former Capitol Hill staffer and county Republican official from San Carlos, California. “The party is becoming more and more MAGA-fied.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson dismissed all the criticism from what she called “a bunch of deranged has-been politicians.”\n\n“The only people who will pay attention to this event are the journalists who are forced to cover it,” she said.\n\nVirtually everyone who gathered at the hotel in National Harbor, Maryland, said they are rooting for Democratic victories in this fall's midterm elections. One of the only Democrats there was Conor Lamb, a former congressman from Pennsylvania who lost his party's primary to John Fetterman four years ago.\n\nDespite dire concerns, there was a slight sense of optimism among the half-empty convention hall and quiet hotel hallways.\n\nSeveral people cheered last week’s Supreme Court decision to strike down Trump’s tariffs, the economic tool he has wielded without congressional approval in his attempt to force friends and foes around the globe to bend to his will. Trump insisted he would implement a new round of tariffs despite the ruling.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a former Trump adviser, highlighted recent AP-NORC polling showing that 1 in 4 Republicans nationwide do not approve of Trump's job performance.\n\n“It’s like any show that’s on TV for a long time — the ratings start to go down. And the ratings are going down,” Christie said. “I am willing to bet you that by next February, this room is going to be twice the size of what it is now. After the midterms, you watch.”\n\nEx-MAGA diehard Rich Logis, wearing a red “I left MAGA hat,” hopes to see “an electoral revolt against MAGA” in the midterms.\n\n“I think there’s a shift in our country right now,\" he said. \"It happens slowly.\"\n\nLogis was promoting support groups for friends and family of Trump loyalists at a table outside the convention hall. Nearby, someone was selling books about how to escape cults.\n\nAt the podium, former Republican Rep. Joe Walsh implored Trump's critics not to downplay the seriousness of the threat the president poses to the nation.\n\n“He’s everything our founders feared. Say it. Believe it,” Walsh said. He said his former party is “an authoritarian-embracing cult\" and \"a threat to everything I love.”\n\nRetired Gen. Mark Hertling, who once commanded the U.S. Army's European forces, said he's “haunted” by allies who ask him “whether American institutions ever can be trusted again.”\n\n“Our nation's institutions have been shaken. Our alliances have been strained. Our credibility has been damaged. And our nation’s values have been cast aside,” Hertling said. He suggested the U.S. should look to the reconstruction of Germany after the defeat of Nazism if it hoped to to restore the damage caused by Trump and his allies.\n\nThe nation's recovery, he said as his voiced cracked, would be something people have to earn over many years.\n\nBill Kristol, who worked in previous Republican administrations and helped found the Weekly Standard magazine, described Trump and his Republican supporters in Congress as “an existential threat” to the nation. But he was also optimistic about the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nKristol said Democrats are “almost certain to win the House,” “could possibly win the Senate,” and have “a good chance to win the presidency” in 2028.\n\nBrittany Martinez, executive director of the host organization Principles First, also tried to cast an optimistic tone, even after describing the many reasons why she couldn't bear to continue her career as a Republican staffer on Capitol Hill.\n\n“I hope that Republicans continue to wake up,” she said. “I do think that those folks exist. And I hope that they exist in greater numbers.”",

    "description": "MOTD pundit Danny Murphy explains why, as well as Arsenal's superior quality in Sunday's north London derby, they exploited Tottenham's tactical weakness too.",
    "fullText": "Arsenal's superior quality ultimately showed in their 4-1 north London derby win, but they were also very clever with the way they exposed Tottenham's tactical weaknesses too.\n\nSpurs' 3-5-2 shape under new boss Igor Tudor, and the fact they did not just sit in, left space for Arsenal to exploit in forward areas on Sunday.\n\nThe Gunners ran away with the game in the end but, in the first half, when it was still in the balance, the area where they had the most attacking edge was down their right-hand side, where Bukayo Saka and Jurrien Timber were dominant.\n\nIt's never easy to stop a team like Arsenal when so many of their players are playing well, but what the Gunners did really well was produce moments of quality or skill in attack when it mattered.\n\nThey looked back to the levels we have seen them perform at for so long this season - this was a great performance by them, not just a brilliant result.\n\nArsenal pass derby test of nerve as title race looks set to go to wire\n\n'Who's going to get this fine?' - Arteta on derby technology delays\n\nEze 'wanted to prove something' as he torments Spurs again\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nTimber is one of the best attacking right-backs in the Premier League, if not the world, and I have seen him cause many teams problems with the way he mixes his runs up - sometimes he supports, sometimes he overlaps and he can make runs inside too. He is an intelligent footballer.\n\nSaka has had a few people question him recently, but against Spurs he was back on it and back to his confident best.\n\nWith the understanding those two have got, it was always going to be difficult to stop them down Arsenal's right but it was even harder for Spurs because they were reactive rather than proactive in dealing with the danger.\n\nAt times Xavi Simons, who was playing as a second striker, was having to run back to the left-back position to help. On other occasions it was Pape Matar Sarr coming over from midfield, or Mickey van de Ven covering from centre-half.\n\nSpurs' system saw Simons and Sarr left to cover long distances to get back and it also meant there was often a mixture of someone who is not used to defending in those areas - as Sarr was when he was left one-on-one with Saka for Arsenal's first goal - and also not being sure who was doing what, and when.\n\nThat's not ideal against any team, let alone one as good as Arsenal, and Mikel Arteta's side started getting more and more joy down that flank, with Timber often having time on the ball to pick his passes - like he did to find Viktor Gyokeres for their second goal.\n\nTottenham battled really well in the first half and, although the game got away from them after the break, it wasn't through any lack of effort.\n\nThey were set up okay too, but I think it did help Arsenal that Spurs were at home and under a new manager because they were expected to have a go rather than just park the bus.\n\nSpurs tried to press Arsenal at times which leaves you open to counter-attacks and also leaves space in behind, which the Gunners are good at exploiting.\n\nIn the second half, Arsenal's quality shone through and Tottenham looked tired - their lack of numbers because of injuries began to show.\n\nStill, what was impressive from Arsenal when they were 2-1 up is that they did not sit back and try to see out time.\n\nInstead, they were quite ruthless and kept coming forward. That's understandable when you think about what happened to them on Wednesday when they were pegged back by Wolves after leading 2-0.\n\nI wondered what would happen if they got in front this time, and they had obviously talked about what they would do differently.\n\nSo, from that point of view, because of the doubts over their mentality after their past couple of results, it was important to see them play so positively.\n\nThe same applies for some of their individual players, as well as the whole team.\n\nAs well as his two goals, Eberechi Eze had a great game overall. I was pleased for him because he has had a few question marks over his form recently, and we know he is a super talent.\n\nWith him playing so well in the central areas as a number 10, Tottenham's midfielders had something else to worry about - and being busy there meant they could not easily help deal with Saka and Timber out wide.\n\nDeclan Rice was making all these runs too, bursting forward to try to make amends for his mistake for Tottenham's equaliser, so there was all sorts going on.\n\nRice is always influential, of course, but he was especially impressive here. Instead of dwelling on his mistake, he used it to focus and bring more energy and clarity to what he was doing.\n\nWhen he dropped into defence after that, he played it simple and quick with his goalkeeper or centre-half - he didn't risk anything again.\n\nBut when he was going the other way, he was trying everything - making runs, getting on the end of knockdowns, bombing forward and occupying defenders.\n\nHe is always totally focused anyway so it is hard to judge exactly how much difference that mistake made to his performance but it felt to me like he actually upped his game, which takes great mental strength.\n\nThere have been times in the past where, when you are playing Arsenal, Saka and Odegaard are the two players you know you need to stop.\n\nTeams would think, if you can condense play in their areas, you can control them - and if it goes over to another part of the pitch, you can cope with it.\n\nOn Sunday, however, it felt like Arsenal were coming from every angle in the end. Eze, especially, was getting on the ball in these pockets of space in front of the Spurs defence.\n\nThat helped Gyokeres too, because it meant there was more room for him as well.\n\nGyokeres had started well anyway, and had a great early chance which he made himself, but this ended up being one of his best games in an Arsenal shirt.\n\nIt probably helped that he had a yard of pace on Radu Dragusin, who is not the quickest defender, but he played on him nicely and it was clever of him to stay on the left side.\n\nI remember watching a lot of Gyokeres' goals for Sporting and he liked to come off that flank a lot, and we have not seen him do it enough this season.\n\nThat might change now and, when he got his first goal, it was like the weight had been lifted off his shoulders.\n\nSome of the Arsenal fans who are not convinced by him are going to be more on his side now he has scored twice against Tottenham, and his goals were top quality too.\n\nI'd say that was one of his best games in an Arsenal shirt and to do it in a north London derby will do him the world of good.\n\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "fullText": "Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare and Sunderland winger Romaine Mundle have become the latest Premier League players to be sent racist abuse on social media on an \"appalling weekend\" when four footballers from the top tier of the English game were targeted.\n\nArokodare and Mundle detailed their experiences on Sunday, a day after Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri and Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana both received racist abuse on Instagram after their sides drew 1-1 at Stamford Bridge.\n\n\"This has been an appalling weekend after four players called out the racist abuse they've received on social media,\" anti-discrimination group Kick It Out said on Sunday evening. \"But the sad fact is, we know it happens regularly.\n\n\"The message from them is loud and clear: action must follow. Players cannot be expected to tolerate this behaviour, and nor should anyone else.\"\n\nWolves said they were \"disgusted\" after Arokodare was sent abuse by \"multiple perpetrators\" following his side's 1-0 loss at Crystal Palace and they condemned the \"abhorrent and unlawful behaviour in the strongest possible terms\".\n\nBoth the Nigeria international and Wolves shared a number of screenshots of private messages the 25-year-old received after the game in which he had a first-half penalty saved, before Evann Guessand scored an injury-time Palace winner.\n\n\"It's still unbelievable to me that we're playing in a time where people have so much freedom to communicate such racism without any consequences,\" wrote Arokodare on his Instagram story.\n\n\"These individuals should have no place in our game and collectively we have to take action to punish everyone who taints the sport like this, no matter who they are.\"\n\nIn a statement, Wolves added: \"Tolu has our full and unwavering support. No player should be subjected to such hatred simply for doing their job.\n\n\"We stand firmly alongside him, and alongside all footballers who are forced to endure this abuse from anonymous accounts acting with apparent impunity.\n\nSunderland said they are \"appalled by the vile\" abuse Mundle received after his substitute appearance in the 3-1 home defeat by Fulham.\n\nThey said: \"The abhorrent behaviour displayed by multiple individuals is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the club under any circumstances.\n\n\"These individuals do not represent Sunderland AFC, our values, or our community - and they are not welcome on Wearside.\"\n\nThe Sunderland Echo reported the 22-year-old English forward has since deleted his Instagram account.\n\nIn February 2025 while playing in the Championship for the Black Cats, Mundle shared a discriminatory post sent to him on his Instagram account.\n\nWolves and Sunderland said they are working with the relevant authorities and online platforms to identify those responsible.\n\nThe Premier League condemned the abuse and said there are \"serious consequences for anybody found guilty of discrimination and we will offer our full support with their investigations\", which can include club bans and legal prosecution.\n\nOn Saturday, Frenchman Fofana wrote: \"2026, it's still the same thing, nothing changes. These people are never punished.\n\n\"You create big campaigns against racism, but nobody actually does anything.\"\n\nTunisia international Mejbri, 23, called on people to \"educate yourself and your kids\".\n\nThese latest incidences of racist abuse towards players follow the alleged racial abuse of Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr during last week's Champions League knockout round play-off tie at Benfica, which Uefa is investigating.\n\nIn a statement earlier on Sunday, Kick It Out said: \"Players are standing up to discrimination, and we've had record reports to Kick It Out from across football this season, but we recognise the frustration in how it continues to fester online.\n\n\"Words matter, but actions are more important. Football is working together to tackle this issue alongside the UK Football Policing Unit and Ofcom, but social media companies must do more to offer protections to players and help improve accountability when incidents occur.\n\n\"Those who face this disgusting abuse must always be the priority.\"\n\nResponding to the Fofana and Mejbri abuse, a spokesperson for Meta told BBC Sport: \"No-one should be subjected to racist abuse, and we remove this content when we find it.\n\n\"No one thing will stop racist behaviour overnight, but we'll continue working to protect our community from abuse and co-operate with police investigations.\"\n\nLast November, a BBC investigation found more than 2,000 extremely abusive social media posts - including death and rape threats - were sent about managers and players in the Premier League and Women's Super League in a single weekend.\n\nThe season-opening Premier League game between Liverpool and Bournemouth last August was stopped in the first half after then-Cherries forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by someone in the Anfield crowd.\n\nA Liverpool man has denied the abuse and his trial is scheduled to take place in April.\n\nIn January, Newcastle United said they had contacted the police after midfielder Joe Willock was the subject of \"disgusting\" racial abuse and \"deeply disturbing threats\" on social media.\n\nTottenham forward Mathys Tel was also the subject of racist abuse on social media after being one of two Spurs players to miss in their Super Cup penalty shootout defeat by Paris St-Germain in August.\n\nEngland defender Jess Carter was another target of racist abuse during Euro 2025 in July.\n\nAnd England internationals Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were all subjected to racism in the aftermath of the Euro 2020 final, which the Three Lions lost to Italy in a penalty shootout.\n\nLatest Wolves news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Wolves - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "IOC president Kirsty Coventry says the athletes \"showed us that the Olympic Games are a place for everyone\" as she closes this year's Winter Games.",
    "fullText": "The Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics have officially ended following the closing ceremony in northern Italy.\n\nIt took place at Verona Olympic Arena, despite none of the sporting events happening in the city, which is 75 miles from Milan.\n\nAfter beginning with a tribute to classic Italian opera, flagbearers representing the 92 competing nations entered the stadium through large props from Aida and accompanied by a tribute to Italian film music.\n\nThe 'Drop of Fire' – the Olympic flame carried in a small glass vessel – was brought into the ancient arena to light up the rings before the parade of athletes.\n\nWhile athletes are supposed to come in all mixed together, here they were still largely in national groups.\n\nThe final medals from Milan-Cortina 2026 were awarded in the women's and men's 50km mass start cross-country skiing events, before a tribute to the Games volunteers.\n\nThe ceremony finished with performances from popular Italian musicians Major Lazer and singer-songwriter Achille Lauro.\n\nIn her speech to close the Games, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Kirsty Coventry said: \"You have been incredible – every one of you. Brave. Fearless. Full of heart and passion. You left it all on the snow and ice.\n\n\"Two unforgettable weeks, living every moment to the fullest. You gave everything – and you shared it with all of us.\n\n\"This is the true Olympic spirit: competing, embracing, lifting each other up, whatever the result. You showed us what excellence, respect, and friendship look like in a world that sometimes forgets these values.\n\n\"You showed us that the Olympic Games are a place for everyone. A place where sport brings us together.\"\n\nIt ended a Games which saw 116 medal events, and historic sporting success for several of the competing nations – including Great Britain.\n\nTeam GB won five medals, including three golds, to finish 15th in the table. Britain has never previously won more than one gold at a Games before.\n\nMatt Weston, the male flagbearer, won two golds in skeleton – the men's event and the team competition with Tabby Stoeker.\n\nThe female GB flagbearer was Charlotte Bankes, who won gold in the team snowboard cross with Huw Nightingale; it was the first Olympic event on snow won by British athletes.\n\nTeam GB also won silver in the men's curling, while Zoe Atkin claimed bronze in women's ski halfpipe on the final day.\n\nBrazil's Lucas Pinheiro Braathen took the men's giant slalom title to register a first Winter Olympic gold won by a South American nation.\n\nWhy 2026 marks a Winter Olympic turning point for Team GB\n\nWeird and wonderful stories from the Winter Olympics\n\nUSA win men's Olympic ice hockey gold for first time in 46 years\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nGeorgia earned their first Winter Olympic medal with silver in pairs figure skating, while Spain collected their first gold medal for 54 years in the men's ski mountaineering. Benin, Guinea-Bissau and United Arab Emirates competed in their first Winter Games.\n\nFor hosts Italy, Milan-Cortina marked their best Winter Games with 10 golds among 30 medals to put them fourth in the table.\n\nNorway topped the medals table for the fourth successive Games. They collected 18 medals, including six for Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo, the king of cross-country skiing.\n\nHad Klaebo, who set a record for the most golds won by an individual athlete at a single Games, competed as a nation on his own, he would have been ninth in the medal table. Fittingly, his sixth gold - in the men's 50km cross-country skiing - was presented at the closing ceremony as the final medal awarded at the Games.\n\nThe oldest individual medallist was Elana Meyers Taylor of the United States, who broke the Games record by winning monobob gold, aged 41.\n\nSkiing great Lindsey Vonn saw her Olympic career end with a broken leg.\n\nThe Games also had controversial moments.\n\nUkraine's Vladyslav Heraskevych wished to compete in the men's skeleton while wearing a remembrance helmet featuring artwork depicting athletes killed during the Russian invasion of his country.\n\nBut the IOC said this contravened Games rules and, after Heraskevych refused to back down, disqualified him from competing.\n\nThere was also a silver medal, in men's ski mountaineering, for Russian athlete Nikita Filippov. He competed as an Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) because Russia were banned from the Games because of their aggression in Ukraine.\n\nFilippov, along with other AIN competitors, was allowed to take part in the closing ceremony having been banned from the opening event.\n\nMen's curling gold medallists Canada had their campaign dogged by allegations of cheating.\n\nThe ceremony included the handover of the Olympic flag to the delegation representing the French Alps, which will host the next Winter Games in 2030.\n\nThe presidents of the two French regions to host the Games, Renaud Muselier and Fabrice Pannekoucke, enthusiastically accepted the flag from Coventry.\n\nThere was a performance of the sixth verse of La Marseillaise, the French national anthem, as it was deemed to be more universal and less patriotic. The arrangement changed throughout into a more contemporary style with an electronic base.\n\nAs well as a video showcasing the Alps, there was also a performance by 25 musicians and 24 athletes – the first time Olympians have featured in the artistic elements of the closing ceremony.\n\nRelive the 2026 Winter Olympics on BBC iPlayer (UK only)",

    "description": "After a defeat for Celtic and surprise draw for Rangers, where does the latest weekend of drama leave the Scottish Premiership title race?",
    "fullText": "\"The two teams from Glasgow have buckled under the pressure.\"\n\nThat was the assessment of former Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart after the Scottish Premiership title race delivered yet another weekend of high drama.\n\nWith Rangers held to a 2-2 draw at bottom club Livingston and defending champions Celtic beaten at home by Hibernian on Sunday, Hearts boss Derek McInnes must have been watching on with a big grin.\n\nHaving eked out a narrow win over Falkirk 24 hours earlier his side now lead Rangers by four points and Celtic - who have played a game fewer than the teams above them - by six with 10 matches left.\n\nThe other big winners over the weekend were fourth-placed Motherwell, with their 5-0 thumping of St Mirren.\n\nJens Berthel Askou's side also have a game in hand on the top two, trailing Hearts by 10 points.\n\nThey have only conceded three goals in their past 15 matches and lost once in 19, all while playing the most expansive football in the top flight.\n\n\"Motherwell win emphatically, Hearts win as well and that applies pressure,\" Stewart said.\n\n\"The two teams from Glasgow have buckled under the pressure.\n\n\"It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Motherwell could finish above Celtic or Rangers, maybe both of them.\n\n\"Celtic and Rangers could be third and fourth in the table.\"\n\nNext weekend follows a similar pattern as Hearts and Motherwell play at home on Saturday - against Aberdeen and Dundee United respectively - before Rangers host Celtic in the derby on Sunday.\n\nMotherwell could be just one point behind Celtic by then, while Hearts could be seven clear of Rangers and nine above Martin O'Neill's side.\n\n\"It looks like Hearts are the team that can only throw it away,\" former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner said. \"They are in an unbelievable position.\"\n\nStewart added: \"Everything is on the line. The permutations from all these games are incredible. That's what makes this season so exciting.\"\n\nPodcast: Reaction to day of title drama as Celtic lose & Rangers draw\n\nRangers scramble draw at 10-man Livingston\n\nHibs stun Celtic with late Andrews winner\n\nIt is no secret things are far from rosy at Parkhead, with fan protests during almost every home match.\n\nO'Neill is in charge until the end of the season - his second interim spell in this chaotic campaign - and cracks are starting to appear despite the Northern Irishman's legendary status at the club.\n\nSupporters continue to demand boardroom change, there are obvious holes in O'Neill's squad and they have now lost seven league matches. That's as many as they lost in the previous two seasons combined.\n\nCeltic fell behind to Felix Passlack's header and rallied to equalise through Benjamin Nygren's 18th goal of the season, but went down to 10 men when centre-back Auston Trusty was sent off for violent conduct.\n\nKai Andrews fired in a late winner for Hibs, making it successive defeats for Celtic after Thursday's Europa League reverse against Stuttgart.\n\n\"It's a setback, that's all it is,\" O'Neill said. \"We're still in the race.\n\n\"I thought we were absolutely terrific. The players put heart and soul into the game. No complaints on that side whatsoever.\n\n\"We've been chasing for months now. There's not much room for error but we can still fight back. The players are disappointed but it's not over.\"\n\nDespite O'Neill's defence of his players, others were less complimentary.\n\n\"It all changed with Trusty's sending off,\" Bonner said. \"Hibs handled the game very well after that.\n\n\"Celtic couldn't get any momentum and it's a brilliant goal from Kai Andrews. Celtic didn't create anything. They ran out of luck.\"\n\nO'Neill brought in Tomas Cvancara, Junior Adamu and Joel Mvuka to bolster his attacking options in January, but Adamu was an unused substitute against Hibs and Mvuka wasn't in the matchday squad.\n\n\"Without doubt, there is a lack of cutting edge at Celtic,\" Stewart said.\n\n\"What's up with Adamu? They need a goal and they put on [Daizen] Maeda, who is nowhere near the levels he was at before.\"\n\nWhile some would have tipped Hibs to get a result at Celtic Park, Rangers were expected to continue their excellent recent form at Livingston, who have won only once in the Premiership all season.\n\nHowever, Marvin Bartley's side profited from two set-pieces to take a two-goal lead.\n\nGoalkeeper Jerome Prior made a string of superb saves and there were several last-ditch challenges as the West Lothian outfit kept Rangers at bay.\n\nBut Cristian Montano's sending off on the hour mark sparked a Rangers onslaught and they drew level through Emmanuel Fernandez's strike and Mikey Moore's header.\n\nThere was late controversy too as Moore was wiped out by Cammy Kerr when through on goal.\n\nReferee Ryan Lee gave no foul and video assistant referee David Dickinson ruled the incident to be outside the box and not denying a goalscoring opportunity.\n\n\"It had a bit of everything,\" former Rangers midfielder Kevin Thomson said.\n\n\"Livingston were terrific. Marvin Bartley will be delighted - he would have taken a point before the game.\n\n\"For Rangers - too much huffing and puffing, they lacked a little bit in the final third.\"\n\nHead coach Danny Rohl was baffled his side were not given the chance to take all three points from the penalty spot.\n\n\"I can't understand when you see the replay and it's a clear foul, then the decision. In my view it was on the line and it's a penalty,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a clear foul. Mikey said to me and you see on the replay. It's a pen but we have to move forward.\"\n\nWith next Sunday's Old Firm derby looming large, Rohl is relishing the run-in.\n\n\"We showed again our comeback character,\" he said. \"Ten games to go and it is an exciting race.\n\n\"We are disappointed but we go again. We have to carry on. We cannot think too much about the past and I totally believe, the players believe, the club believe and the supporters believe we can do it.\n\n\"We showed against Hearts that we can beat top of the league. Next week we have the next challenge. We will hunt again and again.\"",

    "fullText": "McDonald’s Big Arch burger is rumored to finally make its way to the U.S. after appearing on overseas menus.\n\nThe burger is described as two Quarter Pounder patties, three slices of white cheddar, two types of onions, and a new Big Arch sauce.\n\nFans in the comments are hyped to try it, with reports pointing to an early March rollout.\n\nSomething very large may be heading to McDonald's menus in the U.S., and the internet has already started planning accordingly.\n\nFood blogger Snackolator recently posted about a rumored new burger called the Big Arch, describing it as a stacked situation with two Quarter Pounder patties, slivered onions, crispy onions, three slices of white cheddar, and an all-new Big Arch sauce. The comment section is already sold (and likely drooling on their screens). \"I've been eyeing this one! Happy is finally coming!\" one person wrote, while another skipped straight to logistics with a simple \"Let's go.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time the Big Arch has popped up, though. McDonald's had already been testing a larger-format burger in three international markets as far back as 2024, including Portugal and Canada. Since then, it's shown up on menus overseas—and in the U.K., it's not even a test anymore. It's a permanent item.\n\nWhich might explain why some people seem a little too ready for it to land here. \"Just what I been waiting for!! 😋” one commenter said, while someone else admitted, \"I'm embarrassed by how excited I am.\"\n\nAs for whether it's actually headed stateside soon, Snackolator claims a March 3 drop. And judging by the replies, at least a few people already know exactly what they're doing if it shows up. My advice? Wear a dark shirt and maybe bring some extra napkins from home.\n\nInsanely Easy Weeknight Dinners To Try This Week\n\n29 Insanely Delicious Vodka Cocktails",

Earlier this month, Eddie Bauer LLC voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement with secured lenders.\n\nA press release about the development said the company planned to “conduct liquidation sales at its stores while continuing to pursue an ongoing sale process.” Storefronts in the United States and Canada will continue operating for now, and the company said it may “depart from a full wind down of operations” if there is a sale.\n\nCatalyst Brands CEO Marc Rosen said the company has faced supply chain issues, declining sales and other challenges.\n\n“Over the past year, these challenges have been exacerbated by various headwinds, including increased costs of doing business due to inflation, ongoing tariff uncertainty, and other factors,” Rosen said. “While the leadership team at Catalyst was able to make significant strides in the brand, including rapid improvements in product development and marketing, those changes could not be implemented fast enough to fully address the challenges created over several years.”\n\nOnline operations and wholesale will continue, the press release said, as it is handled by a separate LLC.

    "description": "Mexican drug lord Nemesio Oseguera, commonly known as 'El Mencho,' infamous for the bloody trail of bodies he left behind in battles with government",
    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Mexican drug lord Nemesio Oseguera, commonly known as 'El Mencho,' infamous for the bloody trail of bodies he left behind in battles with government forces and rival gangs, died in a military raid on Sunday.\n\nAn ex-police officer, Oseguera, 60, was the shadowy leader ‌of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), an international criminal enterprise widely viewed as one of Mexico's most powerful.\n\nOver a relatively short period of time, Oseguera masterminded ‌the CJNG's emergence as a criminal empire rivaling his former allies in the Sinaloa Cartel. He managed to evade arrest for years despite a $15 million bounty from the U.S. for information leading to his arrest or ​capture.\n\nCJNG has been blamed for smuggling vast quantities of drugs into the U.S., including the synthetic opioid fentanyl, which has been linked to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths in recent years.\n\n\"Apart from the heads of the Sinaloa cartel, 'El Mencho' has been the biggest prize for many, many years,\" said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a security expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"And it’s really stunning, just like the heads of the Sinaloa cartel, how long he managed to evade U.S. and Mexican law enforcement gunning for him.”\n\nArguably Mexico's most influential crime boss after captured ‌kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, now in a U.S. prison, Oseguera diversified ⁠into rackets such as stolen fuel, forced labor and human trafficking.\n\nBut unlike Guzman, who became a media celebrity, El Mencho preferred to remain in relative obscurity. He achieved notoriety for expletive-laden recordings leaked on social media in which he threatened enemies and officials.\n\nOseguera was also known ⁠for evading capture in spectacular fashion. In May 2015, as Mexican forces closed in on him, his tipped-off henchmen shot down a military helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade to give their boss time to escape.\n\nTargets of his hit men were rarely so lucky. His gang routinely employed beheadings and other gory means of intimidation.\n\nIn one six-week period in 2015, the gang killed two dozen police in ​western ​Mexico as a warning to authorities.\n\nIn 2020, Mexico City's then chief of police Omar Garcia Harfuch survived ​an assassination attempt that killed two of his bodyguards in an ‌attack authorities blamed on the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Harfuch is now the country's security chief and helped oversee the operation against Oseguera.\n\nOseguera was born in 1966 in a poor village in the mountains of the rugged and notoriously lawless western state of Michoacan. There, cultivation of opium poppies and marijuana have competed with avocado production for decades.\n\nAs a boy, he worked the fields, and later went to seek his fortune in the U.S., where prosecutors said he got into the heroin trade. After a few years, he was arrested and served time in a U.S. prison.\n\nHe was deported back to Mexico, where he joined the police before entering the Milenio Cartel, a satellite of the Sinaloa Cartel. Eventually, he ‌became a top enforcer after stints as a sicario, or cartel assassin.\n\nAfter a failed attempt at taking ​over the Milenio Cartel, he struck out alone, declared war on Sinaloa, and founded the CJNG in alliance ​with a local gang of money launderers.\n\nThe cartel is named for the western ​state of Jalisco, home to one of Mexico's largest cities, Guadalajara.\n\nThe CJNG mixed Sinaloa-style drug trafficking and community outreach with the ultra-violent methods ‌of the Zetas Cartel, a gang that used paramilitary tactics to diversify ​into criminal enterprises such as extortion and ​kidnapping.\n\nFor years, Oseguera paid off police to cover his back as he operated with near-total impunity inside Jalisco. He also sought political protection.\n\n\"El Mencho's Jalisco New Generation Cartel was one of the biggest buyers of politicians and political campaigns, which has given it an enormous social base,\" said Edgardo Buscaglia, an organized crime expert at ​Columbia University.\n\nNoting El Mencho's ability to win public support, ‌Buscaglia pointed to footage broadcast during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic of people lining up for CJNG-stamped food packages handed out by cartel gunmen, not government ​workers, to help cushion the economic blow of lockdowns.\n\n\"Compared to the Mexican government,\" said Buscaglia, \"he was the least bad option.\"",
