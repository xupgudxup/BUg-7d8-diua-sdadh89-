    "fullText": "Matchday 10 is a key stage of the competition where everything becomes more serious. Teams are either trying to protect their advantage from the first leg or fighting hard to recover after going behind.\n\nAt this point, every goal and every mistake can change the final result.\n\nThis round feels like a tough contest. Some teams must attack from the first minute to turn things around.\n\nClubs like Juventus are looking to bounce back after losing 5-2 to Galatasaray, while clubs like Inter Milan need to overturn a 3-1 loss against Bodo/Glimt.\n\nOther teams are in a strong position and just need to complete the job. Clubs like Newcastle carry a big 6-1 lead into their second leg, and clubs like Bayer Leverkusen hold a comfortable 2-0 advantage over Olympiacos.\n\nThese teams can play with more control as they try to secure their place in the next round.\n\nWith some clubs coming to attack and others trying to protect their lead, this matchday is hard to predict.\n\nPicking players from teams that are more likely to win or control their games can give you UCL Managers better chance of getting strong returns.\n\nMatchday 9 was a strong week for my team as they collected a total of 82 points in the first leg of the play-offs. The squad delivered solid returns across all positions, and several players stepped up at important moments.\n\nCaptain Kylian Mbappe returned 10 points after his score was doubled from a 5-point haul. Even though he did not score, he played a key role against a strong Benfica defense and created space for teammates.\n\nOne of those players was Vinicius Junior, who scored the winning goal and earned 7 points, helping the Real Madrid double up pay off.\n\nIn attack, Julian Alvarez and Ademola Lookman also contributed well in a high-scoring game.\n\nAlvarez scored from the penalty spot to finish with 7 points, while Lookman also found the net and added another 7 points. Both players rewarded the trust placed in them.\n\nIn midfield, Anthony Gordon delivered the standout performance with a massive 27-point haul after scoring four goals in one half. His performance almost decided the tie on his own.\n\nThe midfield duo of Vitinha and Kvaratskhelia combined for 5 points in the match between PSG and Monaco.\n\nVitinha missed a penalty, but Kvaratskhelia remained active and involved throughout the game.\n\nAt the back, Malick Thiaw stood out with 9 points after a strong defensive display and an attacking contribution.\n\nAchraf Hakimi added 7 points, proving that attack-minded defenders can still bring good returns. In goal, Marco Carnesecchi provided steady saves.\n\nOverall, Matchday 9 was a strong performance. Now the focus shifts to the second leg and making smart transfer decisions based on the upcoming fixtures.\n\nHeading into Matchday 10, my team needed adjustments. Lautaro Martínez is injured and Malick Thiaw is suspended, so I used my two free transfers to strengthen the squad and prepare for the second leg.\n\nI brought in Serhou Guirassy to replace Lautaro. He is in strong form with four goals and three assists so far this season, he also contributed in the first leg.\n\nWith Dortmund holding a 2-0 lead at home, he has a strong chance to add more points.\n\nIn defence, I replaced Thiaw with Dan Burn. He brings stability and plays for Newcastle, who carry a big 6-1 advantage into the second leg. He also offers clean sheet potential and can contribute going forward.\n\nWith these changes, my squad is balanced and ready for the decisive games. Julian Alvarez will be holding my armband as captain for this matchday.\n\nHow is your team set up for the second leg? Drop your transfers, captain pick, and any big moves you made ahead of Matchday 10. Let’s discuss and see who made the best decisions.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants have added some experienced pitching depth to their roster.\n\nOn Monday, the Giants reached a deal with free agent right-hander Brent Honeywell, according to MassLive's Chris Cotillo.\n\nThe most notable part of Honeywell's recent past is that he was a part of the Dodgers when they won the 2024 World Series title.\n\nHoneywell was originally a second-round pick by the Tampa Bay Rays in the 2014 MLB Draft out of Walters State Community College.\n\nHe rose through the minors as a highly touted prospect with one quirk: He throws a screwball.\n\nMORE: Yankees making history not done since 1889 Chicago White Stockings\n\nHoneywell only pitched in three games in his career for the Rays, though, not making his talent work at the highest level.\n\nIn 2023, he split the season between the Padres and White Sox.\n\nThen in 2024, it was the Pirates for two games and the Dodgers for 18.\n\nThat 2024 season was encouraging, as Honeywell had a 2.62 ERA for the Dodgers.\n\nThe most fascinating number on his board, though, is that Honeywell struck out only 4.5 batters per nine innings that year, which is like the mark from a long bygone era.\n\nHoneywell missed the entire 2025 season, and now he's trying to build a comeback.\n\nThe Giants have a bunch of quality arms, but there's no such thing as too much pitching.\n\nIf Honeywell pitches well in the spring, he can put himself into the picture to make the roster on Opening Day or sometime during the campaign when extra arms are needed.\n\nTeam USA has a finalized WBC roster and an awesome lineup\n\nDominican Republic WBC roster is loaded with stars\n\nAn Edwin Diaz nightmare looms for the Mets\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nHow Jose Ramirez is on pace to become Cleveland's Derek Jeter\n\nYankees have signed a catcher from the country of Hungary",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nKansas star Darryn Peterson is expected to play Monday night when the No. 8 Jayhawks host No. 2 Houston in a Big 12 matchup at Allen Fieldhouse.\n\nThis comes after Peterson has faced heavy criticism for \"ducking\" out of game or missing some entirely. The high-profile freshman guard and presumptive top pick for the 2026 NBA Draft wasn't listed on Kansas’ latest injury report and appears likely to take the floor after logging significant minutes in Saturday’s 84-68 loss to Cincinnati.\n\nPeterson’s availability has been one of the season’s most picked apart storylines of the college basketball season. The 6-foot-6 phenom has missed multiple games this year due to a combination of cramping issues, illness and minor injuries, including a notable absence with flu-like symptoms in a win over then undefeated Arizona earlier this month.\n\nDespite that history, Kansas coach Bill Self has indicated Peterson’s current status is sound enough for Monday’s Big 12 “Big Monday” contest.\n\nWhen active, Peterson has been a key offensive catalyst for the Jayhawks, averaging near 20 points per game with strong shooting splits. His presence will be critical against a Houston team coming off consecutive losses that has dropped to second in the conference standings, including a tough defeat to Arizona at home.\n\nMore: Michigan-Duke ticket prices set a Washington DC record for sporting event\n\nKansas and Houston tip off at 9 p.m ET on ESPN in what could be a pivotal game in the race for Big 12 positioning towards March.\n\nAdrian Autry buyout, contract details as Syracuse Orange coach\n\n'Basketball Saved My Life': Why Master P came home to rebuild New Orleans\n\nBruce Pearl sends warning to NBA teams about Kansas' Darryn Peterson\n\nWhy FOX blocked St. John’s from participating in a major college basketball event\n\nJohn Calipari says college athletics is broken — Here’s his plan to fix",

    "fullText": "Two Manchester United transfer targets, Yan Diomande and Elliot Anderson, are showcasing a shared dominant strength in the Bundesliga and the Premier League, respectively.\n\nManchester United’s top priority for midfield in 2026 is now clear, with Elliot Anderson taking the lead ahead of summer. His recent performance against Liverpool has only increased that focus.\n\nMeanwhile, Ineos are also searching for a left-sided winger, and there is growing interest in Yan Diomande.\n\nThe 19-year-old has been turning heads at RB Leipzig, and Amad Diallo’s relationship with him – built during their time together with Ivory Coast at AFCON – could play a role in any future move.\n\nUnited consider Diomande to be a player of rare potential, with his numbers from the Bundesliga supporting that view.\n\nDiomande has been a reliable playmaker for Leipzig this season, with eight goals and six assists in 22 league matches.\n\nBut it is his work without the ball that stands out even more. According to league data, no one in Germany’s top division has won more duels than the 19-year-old winger, who leads the way with 279 this campaign.\n\nDespite playing on the wing, he is ahead of Kaishu Sano by 28 duels. This highlights just how much he impacts games beyond his attacking numbers.\n\nHe is also one of the quickest players in the league, having clocked a top speed of 36.3km/h.\n\nGiven the current state of the Premier League, being able to handle the physical side of the game is a big deal for any new signings.\n\nDiomande’s ability to win duels, combined with his physical skills, shows he is more than ready to handle top-flight football in England.\n\nAnderson, United’s main midfield target, also stands out in this area. He leads the Premier League with 223 duels won so far in 2025/26.\n\nEverton’s James Tarkowski comes next with 177. For United, Patrick Dorgu leads their players with 140 duels won this season.\n\nIneos seem focused on adding players who can raise the team’s overall physical presence, and few fit that description better right now than Anderson and Diomande.\n\nMichael Carrick shares honest thoughts on Marcus Rashford leaving Man Utd for Barcelona\n\nWhy Man United legend Patrice Evra brutally slammed ‘delusional’ Arsenal fans",

    "fullText": "Happy Monday, everybody. Hope your week has gotten off to a great start.\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes had some notable happenings in the sports world since the last time I touched base, so let’s get right to them.\n\n1) Holy moly. What a night it was in Coral Gables last Tuesday night.\n\nI had my phone and tables set up side by side and was watching the dramatics unfold in both Canes baseball and Canes hoops at the same time.\n\nMiami baseball found themselves down 5-0 going into the eighth inning against UCF, and while it felt over, I figured I’d watched it this far and would stick with it. And boy, I’m glad I did. With two outs, Jake Ogden clubbed one out to left to get back inside slam range and make it 5-2 going to the ninth.\n\nMeanwhile, Miami kept seesawing back and forth with the Virginia Tech Hokies on the hardwood. The stubborn Hokies continued to hold a slim lead that Miami would quickly erase, only to see VT jump back again. It felt like a game that, in the stars, was supposed to go Tech’s way. At least those were the vibes.\n\nBut then, UCF’s pitcher got wiiiiiiiild and plunked three Canes in the bottom of the ninth. Michael Torres got a ball past the infield for a single to plate two and tie the game. Suddenly, it felt like it could be Miami’s night.\n\nMARK LIGHT MAGIC!!!! pic.twitter.com/93Htyjuf5S\n\n— Miami Hurricanes Baseball (@CanesBaseball) February 18, 2026\n\nNext door, up 67-66 with 3.6 seconds left, Tech drove the ball to the hoop. Except their man fell down and half-stumble/threw up a shot that missed. Tech missed the offensive rebound, and time expired on a crucial win at Watsco Center.\n\nThe Canes survive! They beat Virginia Tech 67-66 to improve to 21-5 overall! 10-3 in the ACC. Another late comeback win for Miami. pic.twitter.com/5wiXzHBzPR\n\n— Will Manso (@WillManso) February 18, 2026\n\nAmusingly enough, the baseball broadcast caught the fans making their way from the Wat over to Mark Light for the conclusion of the baseball game.\n\nAnd then Vance Sheehan sent everybody home in elated fashion with a two-run bomba off the scoreboard in left for a walk off 8-7 win in 13 innings.\n\nAdversity shaped him. Clutch defined him.\n\nNearly seven years removed from undergoing surgery for a brain tumor, Vance Sheahan (@SheahanVance) delivered a signature win for @CanesBaseball on Tuesday.\n\n🔗 https://t.co/ss5iB6WnBr pic.twitter.com/AToe04oV0U\n\n— D1Baseball (@d1baseball) February 19, 2026\n\nNights like this don’t come around often, and for those who got to go to one (or both), man, I am envious. A tremendous night for Miami athletics.\n\n2) Saturday night was, unfortunately, tough for the Hurricanes on the hardwood in Charlottesville .\n\nBut they gave the Wahoos everything they had and took that game right to the wire. Miami tied it up at 83 on a driving basket by Malike Renau with seven seconds left. Unfortunately, what happened in the Canes’ favor the Saturday before burned them against Virginia. With under four seconds left, Tre Donaldson fouled Jake Mallory on a three, and Mallory sank all three free throws for the winning margin.\n\nStill, that’s not a game you expect to win, although it would have been basically a tourney clincher if they’d gotten it.\n\nNext up is at FSU on Tuesday night. The Seminoles have been playing well lately, and Miami, well, almost never seems to beat them in basketball. This team needs to get this one in Tallahassee after coming up short in Coral Gables against them earlier in the year. A loss could push Miami back towards the bubble after working hard to get off it.\n\n3) Boy, how the Canes are crushing the baseball right now.\n\nI’ll just leave this here for you.\n\nCuvet's grand slam is Miami's 21st HR this season in their 9th game\n\nCanes hit their 21st HR in game 18 last year. They had 8 HR after their 9th game#GoCanes\n\n— Canes Research (@CanesResearch) February 22, 2026\n\nI was doing some stuff around the house yesterday, so I just caught bits and pieces, but holy Cannoli, did the Canes’ offense go nuclear. 30-5 over Lafayette.\n\nWe’ve seen Daniel Cuvet, Alex Sosa, Torres, Sheahan, and others come through at the plate this year so far, but boy, there’s one particular Cane to keep a close eye on as you go forward.

    "description": "Vermont’s secret sauce isn’t maple syrup.",
    "fullText": "This essay was reprinted from Peggy Shinn’s website. Read more of Slate’s 2026 Olympics coverage here.\n\nThe United States hauled in 33 medals at the 2026 Winter Olympics, its most ever at a Games outside North America. If you think that’s impressive, consider that more than 20 percent of those went to athletes who grew up or trained in Vermont, a state with fewer residents than many midsized cities. That list includes Mikaela Shiffrin, Ryan Cochran-Siegle, and Paula Moltzan, who won gold, silver, and bronze medals respectively in Alpine skiing; Mac Forehand, who got silver in free-skiing big air; and Ben Ogden (two silvers) and Jessie Diggins (a bronze) in cross-country.\n\nNaturally, the national media went looking for a simple, pithy explanation. The New York Times wondered if there was something in the water (or fine, the snow). The Associated Press floated maple syrup as the secret sauce. That theory gets a boost from the fact that Cochran-Siegle’s clan owns Slopeside Syrup, which sells single-serve packets of syrup marketed as “all natural athletic fuel.”\n\nBut the real explanation is rooted deeper than tree sap and snow. It is based on the old-fashioned concepts of family and community, and a culture that treats winter not as an inconvenience but as infrastructure. Vermont doesn’t send more Olympians to the Winter Games per capita than any other state because the state is buried in snow. (Yes, it often is, though less reliably than it used to be.) It’s because when winter lasts half the year, you either resent it or organize around it. Similar to the Norwegians and their “joy for all” concept of athlete development, we Vermonters choose the latter.\n\nTo fend off cabin fever, we have a long tradition of getting outdoors and making the best of the cold and snow: ice fishing, snowmobiling, skiing in all forms, and snowboarding, too. (The first ski lift in the United States was built here.)\n\nI’m an eighth-generation Vermonter, which is to say I was basically issued a pair of skis at birth. My mom had my sister and me wobbling around the backyard as toddlers, skis clipped on over snow boots. Our dad added figure skates to the mix. When we weren’t carving up ice, we were outside engineering questionable sled jumps and hurling ourselves off them with the confidence of children who assume snowbanks are soft.\n\nMy daughter came up through the Pico Ski Club program, where we volunteered with the cheerful masochism that defines winter parenting. (Gatekeeping in minus-15-degree windchill, anyone?) The friendships we made there have outlasted seasons, gear swaps, and growing pains. Around here, winter sports aren’t boutique hobbies or résumé padding for Olympic dreams. They’re what you do on a Saturday. Or a Tuesday after school.\n\nFor homegrown Olympic silver medalists like Cochran-Siegle and Ogden, their routes to the Olympics began not with corporate sponsorships but with parents in puffy jackets running youth programs on volunteer time. And those parents might just be NCAA champions and/or Olympic medalists themselves. In a small state like Vermont, with a limited tax base for public programs and few deep pockets, volunteer-run kid programs mean parents don’t have to have hedge-fund incomes to afford registration fees. At least not when kids are young.\n\nOgden grew up in Landgrove—a hamlet with more porcupines than residents—and started in the Bill Koch League, an all-volunteer cross-country ski program founded in 1977 after Vermonter Bill Koch became America’s first Olympic medalist in the sport. The goal there isn’t to mint Olympians. It’s to create lifelong skiers. Kids play games and race for lollipops. Parents treat Saturday practice as a social event and a chance to enjoy skiing themselves, ending with hot chocolate at the touring center.\n\nIt may take a village to raise a ski racer. In Vermont, it also creates one.\n\nTalented athletes can graduate to one of the state’s ski academies, which function as finishing schools for skiing and snowboarding. Burke Mountain Academy, founded in 1970, has produced dozens of Olympians, Shiffrin among them. It was founded to meet a couple of needs: sell some midweek lift tickets and give kids who want to keep skiing through high school a place to both study and train. Other ski academies have popped up around the state. Stratton Mountain School counts Ogden among its alumni. Killington Mountain School recently sent snowboarder Jess Perlmutter to her first Olympics, where she finished sixth in slopestyle at age 16.\n\nThese academies draw ambitious teenagers from around the country. Shiffrin followed her older brother to Burke, and their mom moved to the village near the school. Forehand commuted from Connecticut every weekend before his family relocated full time. Vermont is happy to claim them all.\n\nSome of these transplants never leave. Moltzan rediscovered her love of skiing after attending the University of Vermont. She stayed and bought a house in Waitsfield. “The Green Mountain State is the best state in the whole 50 states,” she said after winning the second run of the women’s slalom at the 2026 Games.\n\nOgden, a proud lifelong Vermonter, also stayed after graduating from UVM. He now skis professionally with Stratton’s SMS T2 team and often trains alongside current students. In Vermont, Olympians aren’t distant legends; they’re older teammates.\n\nDiggins, now a four-time Olympic medalist, has long called the Stratton program home. She credits team dinners, send-off parties, and the feeling that entire towns are tracking her splits for helping to fuel her success. Ogden says he feels a “mental boost” from knowing his state is watching. In a small place, support isn’t abstract. After he won his second silver medal at the Milan Cortina Games, he said, “Vermonters have been such a huge part of my success this week and honestly, every other aspect of me.”\n\nCochran-Siegle’s pathway to success started way back with his grandparents. In 1960, Mickey and Ginny Cochran built a backyard rope tow on the hill behind their house in Richmond so their kids could ski after school without needing to drive an hour to one of the state’s larger ski areas. Over the next decade and a half, all four of their children would make the Olympics. Barbara Ann Cochran—Cochran-Siegle’s mother—won gold in slalom at the 1972 Olympics.\n\nThe Cochrans did not keep their ski hill to themselves. They opened it to the community. Lift tickets cost 25 cents. If a kid lacked proper gear, Ginny found it. If they were hungry, she fed them. In 1998, Cochran’s became a nonprofit. No child is turned away for lack of money. Families who can pay more do.\n\nTo keep things affordable, Cochran’s—and many of Vermont’s youth ski programs—runs on the backs of volunteers. That volunteerism isn’t incidental. Vermont consistently ranks at the top nationally for civic participation, with more than 40 percent of residents volunteering in some capacity. At a typical youth race, parents might be course marshals, timing officials, or simply extra eyes on the hill.\n\nAt Cochran’s, the family’s legacy still anchors the place. Barbara Ann, her siblings Marilyn and Lindy, and their extended families have coached there for decades. Two-time Olympian Jimmy Cochran now manages the hill. Their stated goal remains disarmingly modest: foster fun, not necessarily champions.\n\nAsked what advice his mother gave him before winning both of his Olympic silver medals, at the 2022 and 2026 Games, Cochran-Siegle said it was very simple: “She just tells me to go out and have fun.” And what’s more fun than a tiny state dominating the world’s preeminent sporting event?",

    "fullText": "Here’s a recap of Monday’s 2A quarterfinals at UVU, with No. 4 South Sevier advancing. This story will be updated.\n\nMuch of Monday’s quarterfinal between South Sevier and Rowland Hall came down to the simple fact that nobody on the floor could stop Raidon Barney.\n\nRowland Hall struggled to handle the size of the 6-foot-8 Rams junior. Barney ended with a dominant 27-point, 12-rebound double-double in a convincing 65-48 quarterfinal win.\n\nWhether it was on the perimeter or in the paint, Barney took advantage of mismatches.\n\n“He’s so good with handling the ball, and he just creates mismatches everywhere he goes,” said South Sevier head coach Carson Christensen. “What I really love about him is he’s willing to find his players, his teammates, to get them open looks. They’re gonna send two guys every time, and he’s been so good at trying to find them. It just shows because he’s our leading assist guy as well.”\n\nThe Rams came out of the gate a little slow, which showed in a quick six-point lead for Rowland Hall in the first quarter.\n\nThings quickly changed once South Sevier started to more handily win the rebounding battle and got Barney going.\n\n“Rebounding was one thing we really hit on,” Christensen said. “The way Rowland Hall was going to beat us is they would have to outrebound us, and at the beginning, it was a little touch-and-go at first because they got four or five offensive putbacks down there.\n\n“But, once they got that mentality that we’re going to rebound, that was the game changer right there.”\n\nOnce South Sevier started to pile on the points, Rowland Hall never recovered. Barney had a monster first half with 15 points and eight rebounds for a 33-18 lead.\n\nThe second half was much of the same. The Rams outscored the Winged Lions 22-12 in the third quarter and led by as much as 25 points.\n\nThe defense was also solid for South Sevier. Rowland Hall finally managed to put up an 18-point quarter in the fourth, but it was after the Rams sat some of their starters and the game was already put away.\n\nWinged Lions’ leading scorer Jrue Miller was held to just eight points in the quarterfinal.\n\n“Our defense was solid,” Christensen said. “We kept the Miller boys from scoring. It was from getting those rebounds and keeping them from getting the second chances.”",

    "description": "The Saints are in prime position at eighth overall. NFL draft expert Daniel Jeremiah says 'I don't know that there's a wrong answer' for New Orleans.",
    "fullText": "Whoever they pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, the New Orleans Saints have a great opportunity to make life easier for Tyler Shough. The second-year quarterback impressed across nine starts as a rookie but the team still owns a top-10 pick. Some great prospects are expected to be available when they go on the clock at eighth overall. NFL Media draft expert Daniel Jeremiah linked the Saints to Notre Dame star running back Jeremiyah Love in his first mock draft. He had them going with playmaking USC wideout Makai Lemon in his second projection.\n\n\"That would be a great decision to have if you have a guy like Makai Lemon there and then Jeremiyah Love,\" Jeremiah said on a pre-combine conference call. \"So I wanted to see what it would look like there and try and find a compliment to Chris Olave. I think (Lemon) would catch a bazillion balls in that offense from that quarterback with Kellen calling plays. ... So that was, you know, that was kind of looking at a different option there. I don't know that there's a wrong answer.\"\n\nWhat is it about these two prospects that is so appealing? Lemon has been surging to the forefront of Saints mock drafts in recent weeks, and for his part, Jeremiah is a big fan: \"Think (Moore) would know exactly how to use Makai Lemon and he'll give you easy completions for a young quarterback. He can work in the middle of the field. He's tough. He can help you out if you need him to dig out a linebacker in the run game as well.\"\n\nBut if he likes Love so much, why did Jeremiah pivot from the running back to the wide receiver? He explained: \"There is something to, okay, when the team is ready to really take off, then you drop in the running back. You utilize all of his carries. They all matter and they're helping you, you know, get in the playoffs and chase the championship. I think there's some other pieces to fill before you say that, you know, rocket's ready to take off there in New Orleans. So I kind of like the idea of letting Makai Lemon grow with a young quarterback and they can play together for seven, ten years or so. I just thought that would be a fun fit.\"\n\nWhether they go with a receiver or a rusher, the goal is the same -- get another weapon for Shough to lean on. Depending on the team's moves in free agency (bolstering the offensive line and signing other pass-catchers, or another running back) they could be set up to comfortably take Love and chase a playoff berth in the weak NFC South. Alvin Kamara isn't getting younger and he's playing in the last year of their contract. No team has had a less explosive run game over the last five years than New Orleans. Lemon could be a fun compliment to Olave, but at some point the Saints must inject real game-changing talent to their backfield. Maybe they'll find a way to do that before the draft gets here in late April.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: Daniel Jeremiah: Saints don't have a 'wrong answer' in 2026 NFL Draft",

    "description": "Having scored 220 runs already, Sahibzada Farhan has emerged as Pakistan’s batting constant in a turbulent T20 World Cup. As questions swirl around strike rates, collapses, and pressure on senior players, Sahibzada Farhan remains unmoved. Even with Virat Kohli’s iconic tournament run record in view. For him, the focus is simple: to score runs and not think about the milestones.",
    "fullText": "TimesofIndia.com in Kandy: In a T20 World Cup where Pakistan’s campaign has lurched between frustration and uncertainty, Sahibzada Farhan has quietly become their most reliable presence. With 220 runs to his name and at least two matches still to come, Farhan finds himself in rare territory, one that inevitably invites comparisons, records, and pressure.\n\nAt the pre-match press conference, he was asked a million dollar question on whether he is aiming to take down Virat Kohli's 12-year-old record as leading run-getter in the T20 World Cup. Kohli amassed 319 runs in the 2014 edition and 296 runs in 2022. His 319-run tally is still the highest by any batter in a single T20 World Cup.\n\n“I don’t look at stats. Even when I perform, people tell me how many runs I’ve scored,” he told reporters. “If you start thinking about records, it becomes an added burden. I want to finish well. I want Pakistan to be proud.”\n\nThat philosophy has shaped Farhan’s T20 World Cup so far. In a tournament where rain washed away momentum and Pakistan’s batting order repeatedly collapsed under pressure, Farhan has provided something invaluable: time at the crease. While critics have questioned strike rates and tempo, a conversation that has followed Pakistan’s top order for years, Farhan pushed back gently but firmly. “This is international cricket. You can’t start hitting from ball one every time. You have to read the pitch,” he explained. “If the ball is in my range, I attack. Once I get momentum, I try to take it long so the team can benefit.”\n\nThose words also reflect Pakistan’s broader dilemma. The bowlers, especially the spinners, have largely delivered. The batting, however, has struggled to keep pace, particularly against top opposition. Farhan did not shy away from acknowledging that reality. “Yes, we have collapsed in batting,” he admitted. “In T20 cricket, your top three or four have to score runs. We haven’t done that consistently. But the boys are working hard, and they are focused.”\n\nDespite the scrutiny, Farhan spoke with notable calm about the pressure surrounding senior players and teammates. Whether it was Saim Ayub’s lean run or the criticism aimed at experienced campaigners, Farhan stressed belief and roles over panic. “Not every player can perform in every match. Everyone has their own role,” he said. “Saim is an impact player. He believes in himself, and that belief matters in T20 cricket.”\n\nAttention also turned to upcoming challenges, including facing elite pacers. Asked about squaring up against England's Jofra Archer, Farhan was refreshingly blunt. “It’s not a big deal,” he shrugged. “We’ve faced him before. He will plan for me, but I have planned for him too. That’s international cricket.”\n\nWhat perhaps stood out most was Farhan’s clarity amid chaos. Rain delays, points-table permutations, decisions at the toss, none seemed to interest him. “Those calls are for the captain and coach,” he said. “Our job is to prepare and play according to the conditions.”\n\nAs Pakistan head deeper into the Super Eight phase, Farhan’s runs carry added weight. Each innings inches him closer to Kohli’s historic World Cup tally, even if he insists that the numbers mean little. Yet records means a lot to the players, especially in the subcontinent. \n\nWhether he reaches the mark or not, one thing is clear. In a T20 World Cup filled with noise around Pakistan’s batting, Sahibzada Farhan has chosen the quietest route, scoring runs, absorbing pressure, and letting his bat talk.",

I think that’s what I feel.\n\n“Obviously, the fame comes with it, the money comes with it, but for me the most important thing is that I’m just living the life that I just love.”\n\nAs ever, it was a mature and measured response from Alcaraz, who at 22 continues to show maturity beyond his years on and off the court.\n\nDespite his youth, Alcaraz has already achieved so much in tennis, including the career Grand Slam.\n\nHe became the youngest man to achieve the feat when he added the Australian Open title to his six other Grand Slam titles.\n\nThe Spaniard boasts two titles at each of the other three major tournaments, while he also has an Olympic silver medal to his name.\n\nThe 22-year-old just added more history to his career in Doha, winning the Qatar Open for the very first time.\n\nReacting to the accomplishment, he said: “Well, it feels great.\n\n“It feels like the job is finished right now, which is great.\n\n“It was a great week, on and off the court.\n\n“Seeing myself accomplish all the goals that I set up for myself at the beginning of the week, it makes me really proud of myself and about my team.\n\n“Yeah, lifting the trophy in Doha for the first time, it feels amazing.”\n\nHe now boasts ATP titles in 14 different countries, which is a record he can’t build upon when he takes on Indian Wells next.\n\nBut success is very much on the cards considering the world number one’s form and the fact that he won Indian Wells in 2023 and 2024.",

    "fullText": "A famous source in the Turkish media reported a spat between Luciano Spalletti and Juventus star Kenan Yildiz. So is there any truth behind this story?\n\nThe Bianconeri have been enduring a woeful slump, suffering four defeats and a draw in their latest five appearances across all competitions.\n\nCuriously, this skid coincided with Yildiz’s physical struggles. The 20-year-old was replaced at the interval during the 4-1 win in Parma, and then missed the Coppa Italia defeat to Atalanta.\n\nThe youngster returned to the fold afterwards, but he looked far from his best.\n\nOn Saturday, Yildiz was in the starting lineup against Como. But aside from a few flashes, he failed to inspire, as the Bianconeri went on to suffer a 0-2 defeat to Cesc Fabregas’ men.\n\nKenan Yildiz and Luciano Spalletti (Photo by Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images)\n\nThe two men exchanged a few words, as the forward was apparently unhappy with his exit. For his part, the manager downplayed the whole episode while praising the player for his relentless desire to contribute on the pitch, even when he was struggling with a calf issue.\n\nAfterwards, Turkish portal Fanatik reported that Yildiz had an angry outburst, as he was furious with the coach’s decision.\n\nAs Tuttosport explains, the sensationalised version reported in Turkiye falls in the ‘fake news’ category, as the two men never had any spat.\n\nThe duo have swiftly built a great rapport, with Spalletti insisting that he cares for Yildiz ‘like a son’.\n\nThe Turin-based newspaper describes it as a Turkish attempt to further destabilise Juventus ahead of Wednesday’s decisive second leg against Galatasaray in the Champions League play-off round.\n\nThat being said, the Istanbul-based giants already have a massive advantage, having won 5-2 in the first leg, so they only need to avoid a collapse at the Allianz Stadium to book their place in the Round of 16.",

In the middle are two guys likely to figure into the Brewers’ plans as bench players this season, Brandon Lockridge and David Hamilton. The Padres also have a couple of established big leaguers at the top of their lineup, most notably Fernando Tatís Jr., who will bat third as the designated hitter.\n\nPlenty of guys in the major league bullpen conversation will appear today, as Easton McGee is today’s listed starting pitcher with Abner Uribe, Craig Yoho, Drew Rom, and Jacob Waguespack scheduled to follow.

Genesis marked his first top 10 finish in two years.\n\nScott will be replaced by Chan Kim.\n\nThe Cognizant also lost its two highest ranked players.

Already suffering because it follows the Pebble Beach Pro-Am and Genesis Invitational and comes before the Arnold Palmer Invitational and The Players Championship, the Cognizant field will include eight of the world's top 50.\n\nThat, though, does not include Jupiter's Brooks Koepka, Billy Horschel and Delray Beach's Gary Woodland.

The problem kept him sidelined for nine months, only returning in November.\n\nHe was a key player under now-sacked head coach Ruben Amorim – a trend that has carried forward since Michael Carrick’s arrival as interim head coach.\n\nMartinez has started all five games Carrick has taken charge of, forming a solid defensive partnership with Harry Maguire. The pair have kept two clean sheets during that run and helped the club to memorable triumphs over Manchester City, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Fulham.\n\nThe Argentina international played the entirety of United’s last outing as they were held to a 1-1 draw by West Ham at the London Stadium.\n\nNow, The Athletic’s Laurie Whitwell reports, “Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez will miss his side’s game against Everton due to a suspected calf injury.”\n\n“United say they hope this latest problem will only keep him out for one to two weeks.”\n\nThis information has been corroborated by transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.\n\nAs per journalist Gaston Edul, a reliable source for news involving Argentine players, Martinez won’t feature against Everton but will return to training this week and will likely be available for United’s upcoming fixtures.\n\nLuckily for the Red Devils, it doesn’t appear like Martinez’s issue is too serious, despite the fact that he will be a big miss at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nEverton vs. United kicks off at 8pm.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

[Trump] called. Just congratulated us … It’s an honor to wear this jersey and represent the U.S. To go home with a gold medal, you know how much that means to guys in this room, to people watching and rooting us on, too,” Matthews continued, according to Breitbart News.\n\nBut he stopped short of saying that the whole team would make the trip to D.C.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of moving parts as far as our travels back home. We’ll kind of see what happens, but obviously it’s an honor to wear this jersey and to represent the U.S.,” Matthews said. “To go home with a gold medal, I mean, you know how much that means to the guys in this room and how much it means to all the people watching and rooting us on, too.”\n\nNH lawmakers back bill to curb Trump‑backed ICE detention centers, like one near Mass.\n\nTrump calls Team USA men’s hockey team, invites them to State of the Union\n\nTaking to Fox News, Mass.

    "fullText": "Another year, another wait as Aaron Rodgers' decision on whether he plans to retire lingers.\n\nDepending on whom you listen to, Rodgers is either returning or he is gone. ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler says Rodgers’ decision could take months. CBS Sports’ Aditi Kinkhabwala said she was told that the chances for a Rodgers return were “minuscule.”\n\nBut Sunday night, ESPN’s Tom Pelissero says the odds are he will be returning.\n\n“The odds are rising that he comes back. I don’t see it being any place else. If he is going to play, I believe it’s going to be for the Pittsburgh Steelers.”\n\nRodgers enjoyed his time with the Steelers last year, and the team may have increased his chances of returning by hiring his former Green Bay Packers head coach, Mike McCarthy.\n\nOne thing is certain: the Steelers, like the New York Jets and the Packers before them, seem to be willing to wait on Rodgers.\n\nPittsburgh talk show host Mark Madden believes the team may be willing to wait on the future Hall of Fame QB.\n\n“They’re going to feel that they can wait because they’re in love with his name. Not the Aaron Rodgers of now, but just having Aaron Rodgers,” Madden said. “\n\n“Their plan B is either (Will) Howard or (Mason) Rudolph. Or, more likely, just going on and getting a Kirk Cousins or — because he wants to come out of retirement— Derek Carr. You don’t have to do that right away. Nobody’s beating down a path to the doors of those guys. You can get them anytime you want. So they’re going to feel they can wait.”\n\nThey might be willing to wait, but for how long before they are forced to make a decision?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Steelers willing to wait on Aaron Rodgers retirement decision",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals have a big decision to make this offseason, as Trey Hendrickson's future with the team is in question.\n\nHe's set to be a free agent, but the Bengals could try to extend him, franchise tag him, or even trade him as opposed to simply letting him walk. For now, the Bengals have some time to make a decision.\n\nAnd with the NFL Scouting Combine getting underway, the Bengals might be getting a good idea of what they'll do this offseason. Paul Dehner Jr. of The Athletic notes that the Bengals might be able to gauge interest in Hendrickson at the Combine this week.\n\n\"The team is open to all options,\" Dehner writes, \"but how likely executing a trade would be based on his market and cooperation from Hendrickson's agent can be determined in Indianapolis.\"\n\nThe Bengals moving on from Hendrickson in a tag-and-trade is the most ideal path forward for Cincinnati this offseason.\n\nLetting him walk doesn't guarantee the compensatory pick hits, and even if it does, it might not be a third-rounder that the Bengals are looking for.\n\nIn a perfect world, the Bengals tag-and-trade Hendrickson this offseason, landing guaranteed value for their All-Pro pass rusher.\n\nMore: Why Bengals should prioritize Joe Flacco over Trey Hendrickson in free agency\n\nAt the NFL Combine, the Bengals will be able to gauge interest in Hendrickson from interested teams showing up to watch the top prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThis will be a big chance for the Bengals to figure out what their best path forward with Hendrickson will be. If they get interest from teams, executing a tag-and-trade with Hendrickson could be in the cards.\n\nFans should keep an eye out for any rumors with Hendrickson at the NFL Scouting Combine. Hendrickson is one of the best pass rushers available this offseason, and what the Bengals do with him this offseason might become clear at the NFL Combine.\n\nBengals announce re-signing of CB, RB to one-year deals before free agency\n\nBengals linked to free agent All-Pro Bears safety who led NFL in interceptions in 2025\n\nBengals are best landing spot for Jaguars LB who had 99-yard pick-six off Patrick Mahomes\n\nBengals are best fit for Chiefs' free agent 250-pound, 218-tackle linebacker\n\nBengals expected to make interesting Trey Hendrickson trade decision\n\nBengals could upgrade safety room amid strong fit with Chiefs' Super Bowl champion\n\nBengals trade idea lands Cowboys DT recently acquired in blockbuster trade for cheap",

We'll take the best player. When you draft that high, you take the best player. It's not a need pick, it's a best player pick because you're going for the guy that's going to be that kind of player. You're talking about a player that you would like to see someday wearing a gold jacket if possible.\"\n\nOne could get cynical and say this is just Harbaugh trying to coachspeak and not give anything away to other teams about the draft strategy in New York.\n\nBut by now, everyone knows better. Downs isn’t a secret as an elite prospect.

At designated hitter, Moisés Ballesteros (.309/.387/.491) is probably the preferred choice, though Conforto could provide more power.\n\nAdditionally, Conforto hasn't regularly played center field since 2019 so he likely wouldn't be a defensive replacement or substitute when Pete Crow-Armstrong needs a day off.\n\nThe hope is that Conforto could find something close to his 2019 form when he hit 33 homers and 29 doubles for the New York Mets. But the 10-year MLB veteran hasn't approached those numbers since, failing to register an OPS above .759 in four of his five seasons since then. (He missed the entire 2022 campaign with a shoulder injury.)\n\nOtherwise, if the expectation is for a left-handed bat who can play both corner outfield positions (and maybe center field) and provide depth to the lineup, Conforto could be a nice addition. Cubs manager Craig Counsell said as much to reporters.\n\n“At this point, we’re looking to bring in candidates to just strengthen the roster,” Counsell said, via the Chicago Sun-Times. “And it’s a sign of just continuing to do that. Michael had a down year last year, but has been a good player in this league for quite a while.”",

    "title": "Ranji Trophy final | 'Bowled 1000 balls in a year': The making of J&K speedgun Auqib Nabi",
    "description": "Jammu and Kashmir's fast-bowling spearhead Auqib Nabi has been the driving force behind their maiden Ranji Trophy final appearance, taking 55 wickets this season. His remarkable rise, fueled by relentless effort and a perfect bowling action, has seen him claim 99 wickets in the last two seasons. Coach Krishnakumar believes Nabi's calm demeanor and consistent performance warrant national recognition.",
    "fullText": "When J&K step onto the field on Tuesday, expectations will once again rest on Nabi’s shoulders. He has taken 55 wickets from nine matches this season — the second-highest tally — at a remarkable average of 12.72. Bowling coach P. Krishnakumar reflected on the shy pacer’s rise into a dominant force.\n\n\"If you look at his record, he has got 199 wickets in 40 games. I have been with him for the last three years and he has taken 99 wickets in the last two seasons. In this season, he's taken 50-plus wickets so far and that shows his skill level has gone to a different level now because he knows how to move the ball, bowl on different pitches and against different batters. So it's not a one-day process - it took almost one year to develop it and it began in the first year when I came into the Jammu & Kashmir team,\" said Krishnakumar to IANS.\n\nA fan of Dale Steyn, Nabi made his Ranji debut in 2020 but has flourished in the past two seasons. Krishnakumar credited his bowling action as the foundation of his success.\n\n\"You see, he has a very, very good action... If you compare and look at it from a biomechanical perspective, his action is perfect... With the swing and seam he has, it becomes very difficult for the batters to get runs against Auqib.\"\n\nThe transformation required relentless effort.\n\n\"The first year of me being with him, it was all about the process... He bowled a thousand balls in the first year to develop his skills, master his wrist position, and his backspin... it took almost one year to change him,\" he said.\n\nNabi’s nine-wicket haul against Bengal in the semi-final, alongside a crucial 42 with the bat, underlined his all-round impact. He also produced career-best figures of 7-24 against Rajasthan and played key roles against Delhi.\n\n\"Auqib has been fantastic because taking 99 wickets in the last two seasons is unbelievable... I am sure that he will definitely get a nod in some upcoming Test series,\" Krishnakumar said.\n\nCalling for national recognition, he added, \"As a coach, I feel that he should be given a chance when he is performing... Taking almost 100 wickets in two years - what do you want as a player?... If somebody is performing there, I think they should definitely get into the team.\"\n\nWith Karnataka’s star-studded batting line-up awaiting in the final, Krishnakumar believes the occasion will not change Nabi.\n\n\"The best part about Nabi is, he's very calm in his mind... If he takes a six-wicket haul, he's still the same and that is very important,\" he said.\n\nFor Nabi, who once trained without proper facilities, the final is another step in an extraordinary journey — but his focus remains firmly on delivering glory for Jammu and Kashmir.",

    "description": "In nearly sixty years of nonfiction filmmaking, Wiseman passionately probed the nodal points of political and social power and connected them in a cinematic universe of his own.",
    "fullText": "In 1963, Wiseman, a law professor at Boston University with an interest in movies, produced “The Cool World,” an independent feature directed by Shirley Clarke. He was so dissatisfied with the process that he realized that he, too, could—and, indeed, should—direct. (One of the marks of greatness is to take only what one needs; Clarke’s film is actually original and engrossing, but Wiseman needed to push it aside in order to clear his own path.) He wanted his law students to learn experientially, to visit places and witness activities related to the legal process. So that his students could observe the consequences of law enforcement and the ways that it might affect their future clients, he brought them to the Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane; then he filmed a documentary there. That film, “Titicut Follies,” completed in 1967, reveals the harsh conditions that patients endured, and holds up the state’s medical and legal complex to scrutiny. It was banned by a Massachusetts judge on grounds that Wiseman considered a pretext for censorship.\n\nWiseman’s response was to dig ever deeper into coercive social forces. He planned a series of films on institutions and their official exertion of power—whether by law or knowledge, by physical discipline or administrative abstractions. The distinctive scope and focus of his rapidly growing œuvre can be seen in these films’ titles, which, by 1971, included “High School,” “Hospital,” “Law and Order,” and “Basic Training.”\n\nThe story of Wiseman’s filmmaking career is itself a Wiseman-like subject, a story of a sort that he could have told on film (and which he freely discussed in interviews, including with me). Quantity, of course, matters less than quality; Wiseman’s universe is one of the most distinctively personal ones that the American cinema has to offer, and it’s unified by a tightly bound set of ideas, styles, and methods. That fact is all the more extraordinary because all but three of his films are—may he forgive me, I was about to use the word “documentaries,” which he disliked—works of nonfiction, which he managed to turn into a form of quasi-literary exploration. Quantity and quality are connected nonetheless: the very extensiveness of Wiseman’s cinematic world (along with its intensiveness) is one of the most personal aspects of his work. Wiseman came to view the concept of an institution broadly—not only the closed spaces, early in his career, of a research facility (“Primate”), a military facility (“Missile”), and a city office (“Welfare”) but also a series of interlocking institutions unified by a theme (“Domestic Violence”), a neighborhood (“In Jackson Heights”), a town (“Monrovia, Indiana”).",

    "description": "US Army drone school leaders want companies to make gear that can be used in a host of ways and that actively listen to soldier feedback.",
    "fullText": "US Army drone school leaders said quickly changing battlefields mean the kind of companies the Army wants to work with are the ones making plug-and-play gear that's easily upgraded.\n\nThe Army is training soldiers for rapidly changing drone warfare. Leaders say keeping pace — and gaining an edge — requires weapons and systems that can evolve just as quickly.\n\nMaj. Wolf Amacker, who leads the Army's Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Tactics Branch at the Aviation Center of Excellence, told Business Insider that when it comes to defense companies, \"if whatever they're building isn't modular with other industry partners to work together, then I'm going to go with another industry partner that is.\"\n\nHe said that he wants to work with companies that, for example, can build a single arming tool compatible with multiple drone types, instead of requiring a separate tool for each platform.\n\nHe said ideally the companies are \"modular with how you can make that drop or that charge lethal through things that are already available and on hand.\"\n\nIn practice, modularity means designing systems with interchangeable parts — hardware and software that can be swapped or upgraded without replacing the entire system. That modularity, Amacker said, gives soldiers more flexibility in what weapons they field and how they employ them.\n\nHe said he wants companies that prioritize modularity, are willing to think outside the box, and avoid being stovepiped — instead of taking the approach of, \"This is my equipment, and if you want to use it, you just have to use what I give you.\"\n\nHe wants to work with companies that ask, \"Hey, how can we help you make your equipment even more useful and make those modifications with you?\"\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the director of the Army's Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course, a drone course designed to improve soldiers' lethal skills with small drones, agreed. She described drone warfare as a space where tactics and technology are shifting quickly.\n\nShe said that having industry working closely with the Army and making more adaptable gear is \"something that is happening at a faster pace than ever before in the military,\" particularly in the last two years.\n\nMartin said that industry partners have \"really risen to the challenge,\" but made clear that companies that aren't modular and adaptable will \"fall off our programs of record\" because \"we're not going to use something that doesn't work for us.\"\n\nShe said the best industry partners so far are ones that \"actively listen to soldiers.\" They observe training, absorb lessons, and adjust their systems to support what soldiers actually need \"instead of saying: 'Here, this is it, take it or leave it.'\"\n\nThey engage in real time, overnighting fixes and make big updates in a matter of weeks, rather than months or years.\n\nMartin said that if companies want soldiers to succeed, employ a system and \"feel like it works for them,\" then \"having that interface and that real-time conversation as we train is critical.\"\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has accelerated this shift, pushing many weapons makers to design systems that can be easily upgraded quickly based on soldier feedback and battlefield developments.\n\nThe tactics and technology in Ukraine are changing so rapidly that multiple arms, drone, and robot makers who have gear there previously told BI they've had to redesign their processes to keep up.\n\nThey are making weapons and combat system that can be updated far more easily by making them software-first and more modular, so only some parts need to be upgraded, or soldiers can swap parts themselves for different missions.\n\nUkrainian soldiers say they need flexible weapons systems that can be easily modified — even by troops at the front. Oleksandr Yabchanka, the head of robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told BI that the ground robots his unit uses function like Lego sets: They can be reconfigured for different missions, whether evacuating wounded soldiers or attacking Russian positions.\n\nTo stay relevant, unmanned-systems makers say they cannot rely solely on building entirely new platforms to upgrade capability. It takes too long to develop, manufacture, and deliver gear like that.\n\nGediminas Guoba, CEO of Lithuanian drone company Granta Autonomy, which has drones in Ukraine, told Business Insider that his company can't just make systems that are simply ready for this year or the next; instead, they're building easily updated and upgraded systems to stay relevant further into the future.\n\nThe software inside its systems \"is changing every month\" and can be pushed to systems in Ukraine. It's very different from hardware changes made in factories and shipped to the battlefield.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of the US arm of counter-drone technology company DroneShield, told BI that the drone and counter-drone fight has sped up so much around the world since Russia's invasion of Ukraine that development cycles have been reduced to weeks, instead of the previous months or years. And the company has put more emphasis on modular and adaptable designs to be able to iterate quickly, he said.\n\nPatrick Shepherd, chief sales officer for Milrem Robotics, an Estonian company that makes autonomous ground robots that are used by Ukrainian soldiers, said the company deliberately does not design robots for single missions.\n\nInstead, it makes them so soldiers can customize them based on what they want to do, like evacuation, explosive disposal, intelligence gathering, or weaponized roles. That approach allows for much faster adaptation than what \"traditional, monolithic designs\" permit.",

    "fullText": "The Supreme Court blocked a significant chunk of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy on Friday. But instead of closing the chapter, it's opened an entirely new book that no one seems to understand.\n\nReturn of the tariffs. Despite the setback, the president isn't backing down. This weekend, he announced plans to impose a 15% \"worldwide\" tariff. That's thanks to Section 122, which allows him to briefly implement tariffs broadly. However, they can only remain in place for up to 150 days. Ultimately, he'll likely need to work with Congress for something more permanent.\n\nThe refund issue. One of the biggest questions is what happens to the $133 billion in taxes collected from the struck-down tariffs. More than a thousand companies preemptively filed lawsuits to claw back that money.\n\nThe process isn't as simple as the US government cutting a check. It's bound to get messy and involve lots of lawyers. Companies will also need to weigh the benefits of fighting for a refund against the risks of angering the current administration.\n\nSome Democrats are calling on the administration to issue $1,700 refunds directly to Americans. Shoppers shouldn't expect the ruling to mean prices are coming down soon, Goldman Sachs says.\n\nMarket reaction. It's a double-edged sword for investors. The ruling is likely to set a legal precedent that'll make it harder for the administration to impose larger tariffs than before. That's good for most businesses. Companies hit with tariffs could also get refunds, which would serve as a nice cash infusion.\n\nOn the other hand, lowering tariffs and the revenue they generate puts the spotlight firmly on the federal government's growing pile of debt. That could push bond yields higher and weigh on stocks.\n\nJefferies mapped out some consumer stocks that could benefit.\n\nThe broader economic impact. Since tariffs will remain in some form, it's tough to make a definitive statement. However, the most recent data from the past year shows a clear trend: The economy is growing, but not everyone is benefiting.\n\nIt's worth considering that a lot of the dire economic predictions people had about Trump's policies haven't materialized. A think tank offered reasons that's the case.\n\nSo who comes out on top? Even with so much still up in the air, we identified some potential winners and losers from the latest shake-up. (Hint: Lawyers are going to be just fine.) Meanwhile, many COOs are likely pulling out their hair from the tariff whiplash affecting their supply chains.\n\nWe'll get more clarity on Tuesday night during Trump's first State of the Union of his second term. Just don't expect a warm welcome for some of the Supreme Court justices.",

    "fullText": "The head of Netflix has responded publicly for the first time to President Donald Trump's calls for it to remove Susan Rice from its board.\n\n\"This is a business deal. It's not a political deal,\" Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, told the BBC's Today program on Monday, referring to the company's bid to buy Warner Bros. \"This deal is run by the Department of Justice in the US, and regulators throughout Europe and around the world.\"\n\nIn a Saturday Truth Social post, Trump called on Netflix to fire Rice, a former US ambassador and national security advisor in the Obama and Biden administrations, from its board of directors.\n\nTrump was responding to comments Rice made in a podcast about corporations that \"take a knee to Trump,\" warning that they could face retribution from a future Democratic administration.\n\nWhen asked by the BBC how big a deal it was for the president to weigh in on Rice, Sarandos said: \"He likes to do a lot of things on social media.\"\n\nIt comes at a delicate time for Netflix, which is battling Paramount to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. A deal would require approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump had said he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the deal. But that changed over the weekend, with the president writing that Netflix should remove Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Peter Kafka called Trump's demands an \"extraordinary use of power\" and said it's a reminder that the White House would be involved in the future of Warner Bros., regardless of what Trump is saying at any given moment.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Sarandos said his pitch to Trump for Netflix's Warner Bros. bid is \"growth in the economy.\"\n\nHe said that Netflix's deal is a \"vertical merger\" in which the company is buying assets it doesn't already have, and so it will be \"adding to the market.\"\n\nWhile Netflix is seeking to buy Warner Bros. streaming and studio assets, Paramount is looking to buy all of the company.\n\nThe board of Warner Bros. Discovery earlier gave Paramount a seven-day window to submit a new offer, which expires at the end of Monday.\n\nOn February 17, WBD told shareholders that \"a senior representative\" from Paramount said the company would pay at least $31 per share for WBD, and that the bid wasn't the company's \"best and final\" proposal. The company's previous bid in December was for $30 per share.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "description": "My dad died young at 56 and never got to retire. The lessons he taught me changed my views on retirement and how I'm planning for my financial future.",
    "fullText": "In 2023, my dad called to tell me he'd dropped down to four days a week at work.\n\nHe'd had a long career as an insurance underwriter, though it didn't define him. At one point, he even left the profession to become a plasterer for a decade to better balance out his schedule. Still, it served him well enough.\n\n\"You really are getting old, then,\" I joked. Dad laughed — he was only in his 50s.\n\nWe talked about his retirement and how he planned to wind down gradually over the next few years, before pulling the trigger and paying a full-time job's worth of attention to the golf course.\n\nThat step was the first, and last dad took toward retiring. A year later, he told me he had cancer.\n\nHis diagnosis marked the beginning of a period in which I spent every day with him. He had been exceptionally fit, competing in triathlons, marathons, and Ironman races, but went from Hyrox to hospice care in just eight weeks.\n\nThen on June 19, 2024, at the age of 56, Dad's oesophageal cancer snatched away his future, and any prospect of a retirement.\n\nI later realized our conversations during his illness were a textbook of the values by which he had lived his life. I'd heard him talk along similar lines in the past, but it wasn't until I was lucky enough to spend each day for two months with him as his peer that I was able to distill them into three lessons.\n\nNow, at the age of 32, these guide me in my career and life, and frame the way I think about retirement.\n\nIt may sound a morbid start, but I see this principle as both pragmatic and a call to action.\n\nI see it as pragmatic because, of course, it is true: You might very well not make it to your retirement. And thinking about death in this way can help you take important practical steps, like ensuring you have an updated will and, at the very least, start thinking about granting powers of attorney.\n\nAnd I see it as a call to action because, when loss helps you understand that life is precarious, it shines a light on how we often live without confronting the inevitability of death.\n\nWith that understanding, a more fulfilling life can emerge years earlier than it might otherwise have; one that, perhaps, you dreamed might come in retirement.\n\nThis principle led my dad to travel widely, a habit he passed to me. I'm due to visit New Zealand soon, the place he unknowingly took his final big trip. It also led him to take up the sports that piqued his interest over the years, and achieve a genuine sense of contentment.\n\nIt took me a lesson in the brutality of life, and the illuminating chaos of grief, to truly understand the importance of living it.\n\nOne of the pitfalls of the first lesson is that, if taken literally, it could lead to financial ruin.\n\nIf it were a certainty I'd never make it to retirement, I'd spend everything I had now. However, in a classic catch-22, living life like I'd never make it there would delay my retirement in perpetuity.\n\nSo instead, I keep an eye on the future and try to resist the urge to part with all my money in exchange for experiences now, so that I can have some freedom of choice when I retire.\n\nFor Dad, working hard and getting an education meant having choices, and that influenced many of my decisions in life, including the one to pursue a career in corporate law.\n\nIn the end, that didn't align with the life I wanted, but the experience gave me the skills and financial backing to choose a different legal career for myself.\n\nBecause of my job and savings I've built up from it, I had choices when Dad died. I was able to pause, reassess my life, and temporarily step away from my busy career.\n\nDuring that time, I thought about how he used to ask me about work and I'd sometimes tell him how I wished I could just retire now to travel the world and write. He'd remind me I had a long way to go.\n\nBut now, those passions I always thought I'd save for later, like planning a trip to New Zealand or getting my master's in creative writing, have become present pursuits.\n\nSoon enough, though, I'll pick up some legal work again. Why? Because unless I write a bestselling novel by the end of the year, I still want choices in retirement, should I make it there.\n\nDad took a keen interest in all aspects of life, and didn't take much of it seriously — because of that, not in spite of it, he was still successful in much of what he did.\n\nThis lesson applies to every aspect of life, including retirement, which I'm viewing as simply another opportunity to experience a new pocket of life.\n\nIt even applies to terminal illness. When my dad was nearing the end of his life, he said something in an attempt to comfort me, which has ended up being the most transformative lesson of the three.\n\n\"Life is one series of adventures. This is just another one.\"\n\nThat impacted me profoundly, and taught me to seek joy even in life's darkest corners.\n\nLosing Dad changed how I think about my life, career, and the very concept of retirement.\n\nMost of all, it prompted me to stop deferring what I truly wanted to my final years while still setting myself up to have choices in the future.\n\nNow that I'm taking incremental steps towards something I'd be happy to do well into my old age, the dream of retirement crosses my mind less often.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Steven Polito, 49, a drag performer from New York with the stage name Hedda Lettuce. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI am a native New Yorker who lives in Puerto Vallarta during the winter.\n\nAs a drag performer, it's a great place to be — it's a very LGBTQ+ friendly community here. There's a lot of theater, a lot of cabaret, and great restaurants. It's also walkable, which I love.\n\nThe moment you leave the house here, it's like one big \"hello.\" That's what's really special about this place.\n\nIt's why I come here — and why I'm still going to come back. Being part of a community means staying when things are tough.\n\nI went to the gym at 8:30 a.m., and I was struck by how unusually quiet it was. Then, my friend at the gym told me the city is under attack by a cartel, and I had to stay put.\n\nWhen I left around 10 a.m., it was a very different scene.\n\nEveryday life was juxtaposed against horrendous property damage. There was an older woman sweeping leaves in the street, while burned-out car after burned-out car was in flames.\n\nMy neighborhood was particularly hard-hit. One neighbor pointed out a burned-out car that belonged to another neighbor who's an Uber driver with two young children. That was the bulk of his income.\n\nMy nerves are shot a bit from the sensory overload of all of it. I've had some tough experiences, but never anything like this.\n\nAs I walked home from the gym, I saw a restaurant that I go to three, four times a week. They offered me coffee. Despite everything, they were trying to be good neighbors.\n\nI saw people were cleaning up the burned out cars: it's neighbors taking care of neighbors.\n\nI could go back to New York City, but we have to think in a less cavalier way. People who live here don't have the luxury of getting up and going.\n\nDuring COVID, I stayed in Puerto Vallarta the entire time instead of going back to the States. We all thought it was going to just crumble around us. But somehow, everyone found their way and part of that was through the community.\n\nThe strength of the community, that's what's so great about Puerto Vallarta.\n\nI've experienced it firsthand and that's what keeps it going. People persevere here.",

    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with John Fleming, 56, the owner of a commercial cleaning company from Raleigh, North Carolina. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIt's difficult to find a photograph of me taken over the past 10 years or so.\n\nI was usually the one behind the lens or, more commonly, hiding from it. I avoided catching sight of myself in a mirror and switched off the camera during virtual meetings.\n\nIt was because I didn't like the way my face looked. All I could see were the dark circles and bags under my eyes. If I could, I would try to wear glasses to draw attention away from them.\n\nMy family and I believe the characteristic is genetic, and the problem was really affecting my life.\n\nI wouldn't say that people have been ageist toward me, but I meet a lot of clients in my business. I knew I'd feel more confident if I looked energetic rather than tired and stressed.\n\nIn November 2025, I accompanied my wife, Raquel, to the opening of a cosmetic surgery office near our home. The surgeon, Dr. Heather Levites, was giving free consultations, and I thought, \"Why not?\"\n\nI know it's not seen as particularly manly to consider plastic surgery, but I was surprised when she explained my options.\n\nRaquel and I are great believers in self-care, and if the procedure made me feel better about myself, we agreed that a lower blepharoplasty was worth the $5,000 expense.\n\nIt wasn't as if I needed it; I just wanted it.\n\nI was keen to get it done sooner rather than later and underwent the operation as soon as I could take some time off work.\n\nI confided in one friend beforehand. He looked concerned when I said I was having eye surgery. He thought I was talking about something like cataract removal.\n\nThe process took around an hour under general anaesthesia. I've had a number of knee surgeries in the past, so it was no way near as big a deal.\n\nIt wasn't painful when I woke up, but you have to be careful to follow the regimen of putting a mask over your eyes from the freezer and using eye drops.\n\nThere was no way of disguising the swelling and bruising from my immediate family. My two sons and three grandchildren seemed tickled, but said they didn't quite know what to think or how to react.\n\n\"Poppa, what's happened to your face?\" my 5-year-old granddaughter, Leila, asked. I wore dark glasses while the area healed.\n\nNow, just over two months later, a lot of people say I look fresher and well-rested. It's a subtle change, and most of them can't put their finger on what's caused the difference.\n\nBut that's how I want it. I don't want to look \"fixed\" or \"done.\" Nobody has called me vain to my face, but, as a man, I feel a bit judged.\n\nStill, the procedure has given me a lot more self-confidence and self-worth. I'm no longer shy about having my photo taken. I'm ditching glasses and getting fitted with contact lenses next month.\n\nThe new John is happy to show a whole lot more of my features.",

    "fullText": "You can call me a dork, but working in public radio was my dream as a teenager — and the hours I spent mapping out my career path and building up my résumé paid off by the time I was an adult.\n\nAfter graduating from college in 2019, I interned at NPR, then landed a job at my local public radio station. Within a few years, I'd worked my way up to being a beat reporter, the role I'd always wanted.\n\nOnce I'd hit this big goal so early in my career, in my early 20s, I didn't know what to do next. Then, a vacation abroad gave me my answer.\n\nLess than a year after becoming a beat reporter, I traveled to Spain with my partner and friends.\n\nWe visited Málaga, where I'd spent a semester in university. I loved slipping back into the slower pace of life, embracing the city's walkability, and taking in the vibrant bougainvillea and beauty around every corner.\n\nI felt myself decoupling my identity from my job, and briefly letting go of the anxiety I usually tow behind me. I didn't want to leave.\n\nFor the first time, I started seriously considering leaving my job, moving to Spain, and freelancing from abroad. Once my partner agreed to give it a try, I went all-in.\n\nWithin a year, I'd figured out how to get us across the pond and found a place in Seville.\n\nThen came the hard part: telling my beloved bosses and coworkers at the station that I was leaving. They were sad but incredibly supportive, and even granted me my dream send-off: a slumber party at the radio station, complete with karaoke and a screening of \"Shrek 2.\"\n\nMy partner and I officially moved to Spain in the fall of 2024, and the transition has been tough.\n\nI came on a teaching program, making a paltry 800 euros a month, and my visa didn't allow me to take on any other part-time job.\n\nI hadn't realized before how much I tied my self-worth to my earnings and productivity. I hated how dependent I felt on my partner, the breadwinner, who was working full-time as an engineer.\n\nAfter a while, I was able to switch my visa and even start working with my old station again as a fill-in editor, but it's a pay cut and far cry from the stability I used to take for granted. I'm still blowing through my savings.\n\nSometimes I worry the experiences and skills I've cultivated here won't come through on a résumé if I decide to return to traditional employment.\n\nI miss living close to family and friends, and little things, like a 20-ounce cloyingly sweet iced coffee from Dunkin'. I miss living in a culture that I know and understand innately, and the ease of striking up a conversation with total strangers.\n\nEven though my Spanish is quite good, every once in a while, I still miss a subtle social cue or can't discern a thick accent. I find myself keeping quiet sometimes to avoid embarrassment.\n\nI'd also never realized how accustomed I was to the conveniences of American life. It took me a while to get used to not being able to grocery shop on Sundays or go out to dinner until 8 p.m.\n\nAt the same time, living here allows me to better avoid some things that paralyzed me with fear in the States. I feel safer now as gun violence is relatively rare in this country compared to the US.\n\nSince Seville's public transportation system is so robust, I've been able to give up driving, which had made me uneasy after multiple car accidents.\n\nWe've also been able to fulfill more of our travel dreams that would not have been feasible if we still lived across the Atlantic.\n\nThis month, we're even visiting Egypt. Our flights are way shorter and less than one-third of the price they would've been had we been flying from the US.\n\nTogether, my partner and I have built our own little life here. We know our neighbors. We're joining clubs. We have our favorite local bars and cafés.\n\nSo far, we've decided that staying in Spain is worthwhile. I'll soon be filling out applications for my third residency card in two years.\n\nEven so, I'm still not sure if moving here was the \"right\" call. I don't think I'll ever know for sure. However, this move has taught me a really important lesson: It's OK to change my mind.\n\nWhether it's in a year or a decade, returning to the States will not be an admission of failure. The only way to know for sure if we liked living here was to try it.\n\nAnd even if we decide we don't want this for the long haul, this experience has enriched our lives in ways we didn't know were possible — and that's something I'll never regret.",

    "description": "After burning out, I left medical school to live in a van and travel full-time. RV life isn't always easy, but it's worth the incredible perks.",
    "fullText": "At 24, I was living the life I thought I wanted. Surrounded by anatomy notes, six cups of coffee, and a stack of certifications and academic achievements, I was in my first year of med school and on my way to becoming a doctor.\n\nMy life had become a revolving door of lectures, cadavers, and exams that brought me to tears. I worked 12 to 16 hours a day, barely took any breaks, and felt guilty for spending even 30 minutes cooking dinner.\n\nAt first, this all felt worth it for the title, eventual paycheck, and comforting belief that I was helping people. But something inside me whispered: \"This isn't where you're meant to be.\"\n\nBefore starting medical school, I had been working as a first responder during the COVID-19 pandemic. While transporting patients, I'd often strike up conversations to pass the time.\n\nInspired by my own love for travel, I'd ask them about their favorite destinations, and occasionally, I'd get some inspiring stories. More often than not, though, they'd tell me they'd had an entire bucket list planned before they realized how easily life can slip by.\n\nAs I worked tirelessly in school, I realized my patients were right about how terrifyingly easy it is to get sucked into the never-ending cycles of life.\n\nWithin a single year, it felt like I had completely forgotten who I was. The things that once brought me joy — photography, travel, and creativity — were gone. I wasn't living. I was surviving.\n\nSo, after many tears, sleepless nights, and conversations with myself I didn't want to have, I quit school. The decision wasn't easy, and I worried about what my family and friends would think. Most importantly, though, I was scared I'd be letting myself down.\n\nHowever, I knew the lifestyle wasn't sustainable for me, and deep down, I knew I needed a change.\n\nGrowing up in Colorado, I always loved camping. As a kid, I would geek out seeing all the fancy RVs, and I loved speaking with full-time travelers.\n\nI always dreamed about traveling full-time, and living in a van seemed like the most convenient way to do it. After all, your house literally moves with you.\n\nUnfortunately, I labeled that lifestyle a fantasy because of the demanding hours and location-dependent nature of working in healthcare. Once med school was off the table, however, I decided to follow my heart and purchase an RV from a local dealership.\n\nAt first, I didn't have a perfect plan in place for what I'd do next — just a deep craving for adventure and a willingness to figure things out as I went.\n\nWhat I didn't anticipate, however, was how steep the learning curve would be or how deeply it would test me in many ways.\n\nFinancially, the transition was brutal. I juggled multiple remote jobs, freelance contracts, and odd side hustles just to stay afloat while slowly building my own blogging and photography business. Even now, my income comes from multiple streams, and adaptability isn't optional.\n\nPhysically, RV life demanded even more. RVs break all the time. There's no landlord to call, and insurance is frustrating to coordinate because I'm never in the same location for too long.\n\nI've spent nights screaming into my pillow while navigating fixes that cost thousands of dollars, but those instances are balanced by the mornings I practice yoga outside the RV to gorgeous backdrops.\n\nRV life and solo entrepreneurship aren't easy. They require humility, grit, and constant problem-solving. But they've also given me access to over 15 national parks, hundreds of miles of trails, thousands of photographs, and a life that finally feels like my own.\n\nThere are times when I've questioned myself, especially when things go wrong, but I've never questioned my decision to pursue what I love. If anything, I mostly regret losing the financial stability I could've had as a healthcare provider — especially when I'm shelling out money to fix my RV.\n\nWhenever that happens, though, I remind myself that life is hard no matter what path you choose. The beauty is that you get to choose your \"hard.\"\n\nPlus, I take solace in knowing I'm still helping others, just in a different way. These days, healing might look like standing on top of my RV with a cup of tea, watching the sun set over the mountains, and reminding others that they can do the same.\n\nI may not be treating cancer, but through my work, I can help people reconnect with curiosity, creativity, and a sense of aliveness they may have lost. This gives me more purpose than medical school ever did.",

    "description": "Do you miss \"Heated Rivalry\"? Us too, which is why we combed through the first season to find any details you missed on your first (or seventh) watch.",
    "fullText": "Just when you thought you were out, we're pulling you back in.\n\n\"Heated Rivalry\" may have completed its six-episode run in December, but it's never a bad time to, well, \"reheat.\"\n\nIf you've somehow missed out on \"Heated Rivalry\" mania, here's a crash course. The Canadian series stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie as Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov, two rival hockey players with a big secret: They've been hooking up on the down-low for their entire careers.\n\nIt's based on a series of hockey romance novels by Rachel Reid called \"Game Changers,\" named for the first book (\"Game Changer\"), which focuses on the love story between New York hockey star Scott Hunter (François Arnaud) and Kip Grady (Robbie G.K.), a smoothie shop worker with dreams of attending grad school.\n\nAfter \"Game Changer\" came \"Heated Rivalry\" — the main source material for the show — then \"Tough Guy,\" \"Common Goal,\" \"Role Model,\" \"The Long Game,\" and the upcoming \"Unrivaled,\" which will be released in the fall.\n\nIn the agonizingly long wait for season two, we've combed through the first season's six episodes to find Easter eggs, fun details, and more that were scattered throughout the show.\n\nHere are 15 details you might've missed in season one of \"Heated Rivalry.\"\n\nHe's the guy wearing the beanie behind the monitor.\n\nThis isn't the first hockey series Tierney has been involved with — he co-created \"Letterkenny\" (which he also sporadically appeared in) and was a director and executive producer on its spinoff \"Shoresy.\"\n\nIf you're a fan of Montreal hockey, you might recognize the hosts of \"The Morning Show with Conor McKenna and Shaun Starr\" as the two voices behind the fictional \"Man in the Crease\" podcast, a pretty consistent provider of hockey exposition throughout the season.\n\nThe Kingfisher is an important location throughout the \"Game Changers\" book series, as the favored hangout of Kip and his friends, including its bartender, Kyle, who is named in episode three.\n\nKyle is one of the two protagonists of \"Common Goal,\" which is about his relationship with New York Admirals goalie Eric Bennett.\n\nThis could be a reach, a happy accident, or a really subtle Easter egg, so walk with us here.\n\nThe spiral print, seen hanging in the smoothie shop, is the exact same shape as some of the set decoration of a game show on Dropout.\n\nWhy is this significant? Because the name of the show is \"Game Changer\" — also the name of the novel focused on Scott and Kip that the third episode is based on, and the inspiration for \"Game Changers,\" the title of the overarching book series.\n\nTo the left of Kip's head, you can see a poster for \"Under Dark,\" an apparently bad film starring Rose Landry, the movie star whom Shane briefly dates in the next episode.\n\nRose herself calls it a \"horrible FBI movie.\"\n\nAt the beginning of episode four, we see a montage of Shane and Ilya's relationship over a couple of years, as they stay in contact during the offseason.\n\nBrady, one of three credited executive producers on \"Heated Rivalry,\" plays a director of one of the commercials Shane shoots — he does one for an underwear brand, and another for cologne.\n\nRyan, in both the books and the show, is what's known in hockey as an enforcer. Basically, his unofficial job is to protect his teammates by intimidating the other team (and sometimes by getting into fights) — but he doesn't enjoy it.\n\nIn \"Heated Rivalry\" (the book), readers meet Ryan while he's on the Raiders with Ilya, and the two connect during a flight.\n\nThat scene didn't make the show, but Ilya does tell Shane during a conversation that Ryan \"is not what you would think\" and calls him quiet but \"not [a] bad guy.\"\n\nIt's unclear if Ryan will be introduced in season two (or three) of \"Heated Rivalry,\" but if you're interested, you can learn more about him by reading \"Tough Guy.\"\n\nSensing that Shane is in a funk, his parents (Yuna and David) tell him that Rolex wants him to attend Wimbledon and sit in their box, and sit next to a \"Swedish princess.\"\n\nHowever, Shane rebuffs them, saying he \"only gets like, two weeks off a year\" and doesn't want to spend them \"next to someone he doesn't know.\"\n\nThat's because, of course, he wants to spend them with someone he does know. In the next episode, Shane invites Ilya to his cottage and says that they \"could have a week or even two\" together.\n\nIt's mentioned in the previous episode that Rose is in Montreal filming the new \"X-Squad\" movie, a clear reference to the \"X-Men,\" but it doesn't click into place that she's basically the Jennifer Lawrence of this universe until we see her getting painted blue and fitted with a red wig, just like Lawrence did when she played Mystique in four \"X-Men\" movies.\n\nFor fans of the book, the cottage episode was always going to be a big deal, and they could breathe a sigh of relief when they heard a bird call over the title card for episode six, \"The Cottage.\"\n\nIt meant that Tierney and the rest of the producers knew how important every little detail was, including a loon call, which Ilya would later mistake for a wolf (much to Shane's amusement).\n\nThis little moment is so important to Ilya that, in \"Role Model\" and \"The Long Game,\" it's revealed he's even gotten a little loon tattooed on his arm.\n\nThe song is called \"L'anarchie des jours heureux,\" and is performed by La Bronze. It translates to \"the anarchy of happy days\" — a sentiment that Shane and Ilya can certainly relate to during their secret getaway to Shane's cottage.\n\nIt's right up there on the ledge, on top of the blue book.\n\nWe saw Shane win the award in the second episode, and we saw him mistake Ilya's stress about returning to Russia for jealousy about losing the award to Shane.\n\nWe first see Shane wearing the brown flannel when he's grilling burgers for the two of them (and getting teased by Ilya for not halving the recipe).\n\nThe next night, Ilya rocks the same flannel when he tells Shane that he's got \"a problem\": He can't stop thinking about another hockey player with \"beautiful freckles.\"\n\nThis one's confirmed by Jacob Tierney: Almost all of the MHL logos in the show are either, for lack of a better word, phallic — or look like a butt.\n\n\"I'm not trying to be subtle,\" Tierney said on an episode of the hockey podcast \"What Chaos!\"",

    "fullText": "Weather, violence, and political quarrelling have combined to make a real headache for American travelers this week.\n\nNearly 9,000 flights were canceled within, into, or out of the US on Sunday and Monday, according to data from FlightAware.\n\nThe vast majority of those came as a winter storm pummeled the northeast. More than 90% of flights out of Newark Liberty, Boston Logan, and LaGuardia Airports were canceled on Monday, with 89% canceled at JFK, per FlightAware.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declared a state of emergency and issued a travel ban. It was also the city's first blizzard warning for nine years.\n\nWith huge amounts of snow falling and bad weather expected to continue until at least Wednesday, disruptions are likely to be ongoing.\n\nMeanwhile, anybody hoping to find some winter sun in Mexico may have had their hopes dashed.\n\nCartel violence erupted in parts of the country on Sunday after its military killed \"El Mencho,\" the leader of the Jalisco New Generation drug cartel.\n\nPuerto Vallarta, in Jalisco, is a particularly popular destination for US and Canadian tourists. Cars and stores were set on fire there, while airlines canceled 139 flights in and out of the resort town.\n\nOn Monday morning, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a press conference that the situation had de-escalated, saying that an extra 2,500 armed personnel had been sent to the state since the violence began.\n\nWith US citizens in Jalisco and other parts of Mexico advised to shelter in place, many tourists may be rethinking their plans. Some airlines waived change fees for flights to Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara through Wednesday.\n\nIf your flight isn't canceled this week, it's possible that getting to your gate could be more difficult than normal.\n\nThe partial government shutdown is also causing delays and confusion at airport security. Trouble began on February 14 after Democrats and the White House reached a stalemate over funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nFederal officials said both TSA PreCheck and Global Entry would be suspended starting Sunday morning.\n\nHowever, the Transportation Security Administration then said PreCheck — which lets travelers move through security faster — would actually still be available.\n\nLos Angeles International Airport had posted on social media that it was diverting all PreCheck customers to general screening lanes, but later removed the post.\n\n\"As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case-by-case basis and adjust operations accordingly,\" the DHS said in a statement.\n\nGlobal Entry, which speeds up customs screening for fliers entering the US, is still suspended. DHS said officers assigned to process these travelers will be reassigned to process others.\n\nThe shutdown looks set to last longer still.\n\nRepublicans want an extra $64.4 billion in funding for DHS — including $10 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But Democrats want reforms in the wake of the turmoil in Minneapolis, as two people there were killed by ICE last month.",

    "title": "Tariff turmoil is back. Here's the investing playbook for the latest chapter in Trump's trade war.",
    "description": "New tariffs chaos means investor should focus on AI and sectors of the S&P 500 that have outperformed this year, investing experts told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's trade war has entered a new, chaotic chapter that's raised uncertainty for investors.\n\nMarkets are going through a fresh bout of volatility after the Supreme Court struck down the majority of Trump's tariffs — a move that seems to have marked the start of a new, confusing chapter in the trade saga.\n\nUS stocks initially rose after the tariff ruling was announced on Friday, even as Trump threatened to impose a fresh 10% global tariff. Indexes tumbled on Monday, however, as traders reacted to Trump's follow-up announcement that he would hike global tariffs to 15%, adding to the mayhem.\n\nUncertainty over tariffs has long hung over the market, and it's unclear how the new changes to tariffs will play out, particularly since it's unclear how the fight over tariff refunds might end, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I just don't think we've removed much of the uncertainty around tariffs by the Supreme Court ruling and quick pivot to Plan B,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I think that remains a headwind.\"\n\nHere's how market pros think investors should position as the trade war takes its latest turn.\n\nThe tariffs story is largely a distraction from the market's overarching focus on AI, according to Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research.\n\n\"I think the tariffs have become a bit of a sideshow at this point,\" Berezin said. \"I think it's really just an AI story at this point for the market.\"\n\nBerezin said Trump is unlikely to raise tariffs beyond what he announced on Saturday. The president also looks like he's laser-focused on his affordability push ahead of he midterm elections.\n\nFurthermore, Trump likely knows that tariffs are inflationary and is looking to avoid that, as much as members of his team have downplayed price increases from tariffs, Berezin said. He pointed to a recent Financial Times report that Trump was planning to roll back some tariffs on steel and aluminum goods, which the White House later denied.\n\nHogan said he thinks the recent tariff ruling doesn't change the status quo in markets. Even with Trump's 15% global tariff, the US's new trade policy doesn't look like it will change the investing landscape much from before, he said.\n\nSome nations, like China and Brazil, were facing much larger tariffs prior to the Supreme Court ruling, and have come out as \"winners\" under the new tariff scheme, Berezin said, though he didn't believe it changed the investing outlook from a sectoral perspective.\n\nHogan advised investors to stick to sectors that have recently outperformed after lagging the broader market for several years, including materials, industrials, and energy stocks. Those areas have made up the best-performing sectors of the S&P 500 so far this year.\n\nBest-performing sectors of the S&P 500, year-to-date\n\nPrecious metals and commodities also look like they could become winners from the new trade chaos, according to David Morrison, a senior market strategist at Trade Nation. That's because investors flock to hard assets and other safe havens when they see \"tariff-driven market stress,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nDespite enduring a historic sell-off in late January, precious metals and commodities have also posted strong gains so far this year.\n\nHogan pointed to Friday's short-lived pop in shares of consumer-facing companies that are major importers of foreign goods, such as furniture and apparel retailers.\n\nSome investors may be feeling optimistic about corporate stimulus if the US refunds tariff payments. But refunds are uncertain, and should they come, it's likely that the government will drag out the process, Hogan said.\n\n\"I just don't know how resilient that will be in the face of ongoing litigation about the government paying this back,\" he added of the recent rebound in the consumer sector.\n\nJeff Buchbinder, the chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, added that the firm wouldn't chase stock jumps in import-heavy consumer retailers.\n\n\"We would fade the stock market bounce in tariff losers,\" Buchbinder wrote. \"Among tariff losers, our preference would be to play homebuilders, industrials, and technology hardware/semiconductors over apparel retailers and automakers.\"",

Space heaters in particular should be placed on a flat, hard surface at least 3 feet from anything flammable. And never use your oven to heat your home.\n\nCrumple the papers and stuff them under clothes to keep warm, de Vulpillieres said.\n\nSand can help the tires move on slippery ice and snow. Salt can also help prevent the resulting slush from freezing again.\n\nIf you happen to have some in your car, it's worth using to get unstuck.\n\nThe mats can be placed under the tires to keep them from slipping.\n\nIn a pinch, pine needles and sticks can increase traction.\n\nAdding weight to a car by pushing down on the hood or placing rocks on top of it can help increase traction when attempting to drive out of snow.\n\nPulling a car out of a ditch is the most effective way to move it.\n\n\"In snow, it's better to pull than to push,\" de Vulpillieres said.\n\nCooking spray can be used to keep car doors from freezing shut by spraying the corners. Spraying your snow shovel can also keep snow from sticking to it.\n\nIf you don't have a snow brush or an ice scraper in your car, the edges of a credit card can get the job done.",

    "description": "Linda Armijo has been spending time in Puerto Vallarta for the past 25 years. She's never felt afraid, even with what's happening now in Mexico.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Linda Armijo, a 70-year-old who lives in Carson City, Nevada. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy husband and I have been visiting Puerto Vallarta regularly for about twenty-five years. We used to go to Cabo, but after taking a cruise that landed in Puerto Vallarta, we realized it's a better place to come.\n\nWe really enjoy the city, its atmosphere, its people, its things to do, and especially its food.\n\nWe arrived on January 1st for a three-month stay. We used to own a timeshare here, but now we stay in AirBnbs. This year, we're in an eight-story condo building in the city's Marina Vallarta district. Many of our neighbors are Canadians doing extended stays, with some Americans who come for a week or two at a time.\n\nMy husband, Anthony, has a standing massage appointment on Sunday mornings at 10. While he's there, I go shopping — my favorite thing to do here — and then we meet for lunch.\n\nYesterday (Feb. 22), his massage therapist texted him that roads downtown were blocked. She didn't provide any more information, so I went to the rooftop of our building to look out over the city. I could see about five to six plumes of smoke. Smoke is not entirely unusual because controlled burns are common, but this was more than I would typically see.\n\nI came down to our condo and told Anthony, \"There's something going on, there are fires everywhere.\" We started to go outside, but instead turned to a social media group run by a longtime expat in Puerto Vallarta. That's when I learned that cartels were blocking transportation in the city.\n\nThroughout the day yesterday, we could occasionally hear the pop of an engine exploding when a car was set on fire. My neighbors and I were watching from the rooftop. There weren't too many fires around us — the closest was about eight blocks away.\n\nA worker for our apartment building came to lock the doors. Other than that, there hasn't been much communication from the building. Yesterday, our water was interrupted occasionally. We have bottled drinking water on hand, but I filled pots and pans for washing and cleaning.\n\nI met two girls from L.A. who are renting a condo upstairs. They were meant to fly out yesterday, and threw away all their food and supplies before learning their flight was canceled. I shared some water with them. A building worker said she wasn't concerned about people who needed to stay longer in their accommodation.\n\nI've never, ever felt scared or anxious in Puerto Vallarta. Some of that might be the way I look — like I could belong here — and the fact that I speak Spanish.\n\nStill, that hasn't changed, even today. I really don't think fear is necessary. I feel safe in my building, and we have plenty of food and water. It's a minor inconvenience not being able to leave, but my biggest emotions are sadness and concern for the people of Puerto Vallarta.\n\nThe public bus system is one of the reasons I love this city. We use the buses to get everywhere, but getting the system back up and running will take time because many of them have been burned. I know of at least two cruise ships that were supposed to arrive in port early this week but aren't. It will likely be weeks before they're comfortable coming here again. Our favorite restaurant is closed until further notice, and I feel for the workers who aren't being paid.\n\nAt one point yesterday, a neighbor showed me a picture of a burned church. I was so sad for the city and the people who go to services there. But later that afternoon, when I looked closer, I realized the photo was clearly AI-generated.\n\nThere's a lot of confusion and misinformation out there, so people — myself included — need to be cautious about where they're seeing, watching, and listening to.\n\nFrom my understanding, the cartels weren't targeting people, but destroying property as a show of retaliation. For the most part, people are safe.",

    "description": "A research report framed as a hypothetical look back from 2028 was making the rounds online and adding to fresh jitters in software stocks.",
    "fullText": "The AI trade has boosted the market for years now, with its rapid growth being felt by the broader economy as companies keep spending. However, one research firm thinks the AI story will not end well for investors or everyday Americans.\n\nStocks tumbled on Monday after a report circulating online from Citrini Research raised fresh fears about the impact of AI. The Dow was down by more than 800 points around midday, and the Nasdaq fell more than 1%. Software stocks were among the biggest losers, with names including AppLovin, Asana, DocuSign, and Zscaler down sharply.\n\nCitrini, a firm focused on thematic equity investing, theorized about the long-term impact of the AI boom, laying out a predictive scenario in which the technology continues to expand but ultimately proves detrimental to the broader economy.\n\nIn Citrini's hypothetical scenario, written as a look back from 2028, the AI explosion leads to a plunge in white-collar employment and ultimately to a stock market crash.\n\nThe scenario begins with a question:\n\n\"What if our AI bullishness continues to be right...and what if that's actually bearish?\"\n\nThe answer is different from many other bearish AI takes. When finance or economics pros express concern about the stability of the AI boom, they typically focus on problems with infrastructure and the stability of the AI buildout.\n\nBut Citrini's analysis assumes that the AI boom will continue, just not in a way that helps transform the economy, nor in the positive way AI bulls like Elon Musk have touted. In their scenario, the rise of AI continues driving white-collar layoffs, severely reducing the spending power of those workers and lowering economic growth in the process.\n\n\"This would have been manageable if the disruption remained contained to software, but it didn't,\" Citrini stated. \"By the end of 2027, it threatened every business model predicated on intermediation. Swaths of companies built on monetizing friction for humans disintegrated.\"\n\nIn this scenario, AI progress is quickly felt in the housing market, as white-collar workers in expensive metro areas are no longer able to afford homes, which has a knock-on effect in the mortgage market.\n\nAll these negative events ultimately lead, in Citrini's imagined scenario, to a stock market crash, with the S&P 500 cratering by 38% from its October 2026 peak.\n\n\"The system turned out to be one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth,\" the note said. \"The November 2027 crash only served to accelerate all of the negative feedback loops already in place.\"\n\nA core takeaway from the note is the importance of differentiating between the market and the economy, particularly when the market is booming. Markets applaud productivity and growing margins, the things we see when companies announce large-scale job cuts.\n\nThe broader economy, though, depends on consumer spending, which depends on wage growth keeping pace with rising prices. When these two become disconnected, even a booming stock market driven by a force like AI can't hide the negative impact that comes from diminished white-collar spending power.\n\nCitrini frames its scenario as a warning, implying that investors should take action now and not be lulled into a sense of security by the strength of the AI trade.\n\n\"As investors, we still have time to assess how much of our portfolios are built upon assumptions that won't survive the decade,\" it concludes. \"As a society, we still have time to be proactive.\"",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tom Landry. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIt was during the pandemic that my daughter Maddie's creativity really started to blossom. She loved doodling in particular, giving each of the characters she created back stories.\n\nWhen she was 7, she asked me if she could create stickers featuring her characters, for herself and to give to her friends.\n\nMy wife and I could have just done this for her, but we decided to involve Maddie in the process. We all researched sticker companies to find the ones that could help us get the job done. Once we decided on a company to use, we filled out the interest forms and learned to scan the characters together to send to the company.\n\nAt the beginning, it was purely about having fun. None of us were thinking about this as a business opportunity.\n\nWhen Maddie took the stickers into school, her friends loved them, asked her how she had done it, and gravitated toward the characters on the stickers and their corresponding stories.\n\nWhen she was 8, Maddie said she wanted to have a lemonade stand and sell some of her stickers at the same time. People bought them, which launched Maddie's business selling her sticker creations.\n\nFrom the lemonade stand, she donated a portion of her profits to a local charity, setting a precedent for her future business growth.\n\nGiving back to the community has always been a priority in our family, something Maddie has grown up with, so it was no surprise that she wanted to do the same with her own business.\n\nWe often say, \"Do well, but do good.\" Maddie clearly took this on board. She had internalized behaviors she's seen at home for years.\n\nThe initial interest sparked by her stickers led Maddie to work with her mom and me to learn how to set up a business.\n\nHow do you set up a website? How do people order online? Where can you sell your products? What do you do with the profit?\n\nWe answered all of these questions, and more, together.\n\nEven though I'm an entrepreneur, it was fun to just play again and be creative with my daughter. It's been incredibly energizing for me.\n\nI think that as adults who are often busy, our innate artist can disappear, and that attitude of \"anything is possible\" dissipates. It's kind of sad.\n\nI've been working for 35 years, and it's easy — almost subconscious — to assume that because something has been done a certain way for a long time, that's the way it must continue to be done. Watching Maddie approach her work with curiosity, optimism, and a willingness to try things without overthinking them pushed me to look at my own business through a much fresher lens.\n\nEven more importantly, I've had the chance to nurture Maddie's creativity, empower her to take control of what she wants, and help her learn about her agency. These are such great life skills.\n\nHer business, Maddie Moo Designs. has continued to grow. She has sold stickers online, in local souvenir shops, and at events. She's learned so much about business along the way.\n\nSince starting, Maddie has generated more than $5,000 in sales and has already donated over $500 of her earnings to Maine charities.\n\nWe've encouraged her to think about how she'll use the money she's made, suggesting four \"buckets\" — the fun bucket, the giving back bucket, the investing in the business bucket, and the savings bucket.\n\nOne of Maddie's favorite purchases with the money she has made is a black North Face coat that is fluffy and warm on the inside. She's also bought squishies and books.\n\nMaddie didn't need pressure from me or perfectionism to succeed; she just needed exposure, possibly, and look where that has taken her. Kids are capable of so much more than we assume.",

    "title": "The best and worst looks celebrities wore to the 2026 BAFTAs",
    "description": "Celebrities attended the BAFTA Film Awards at the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday. Chase Infiniti looked stylish, but Kirsten Dunst missed the mark.",
    "fullText": "The Prince and Princess of Wales attended the BAFTAs together, as they do most years, and Kate chose to recycle a Gucci dress she was first spotted wearing in 2019.\n\nThe bodice of the dress was fitted, had an off-the-shoulder neckline, and featured a striped pattern of blush and deeper pink. It was belted at the waist, while the skirt featured layers of tulle in the same shades as the bodice.\n\nShe paired the gown with sparkly jewelry, making the look perfect for the red carpet. It was also fun that Prince William's maroon jacket coordinated with her ensemble.\n\nThe \"KPop Demon Hunters\" singer attended the BAFTAs in a pink and maroon Jasmin Erbas dress.\n\nThe gown featured plenty of architectural detailing, from the cups on the corset bodice to a ruffle at the waist. Stripes covered the skirt, which had a thigh-high slit and flowed into fabric that floated around Ami's ankles.\n\nThe look was stunning, but it didn't quite suit the formal feel of the BAFTAs. The dress would be a great choice for a Met Gala red carpet.\n\nKate Hudson, nominated for her performance in \"Song Sung Blue,\" chose a bright-red Prada gown for the event.\n\nIt featured a fitted bodice, an off-the-shoulder neckline, and a column skirt. A train flowed out from behind to add drama, which was amplified by a cutout on the back of the dress.\n\nHudson played up the outfit's classic Hollywood feel with an updo and sparkly jewelry.\n\nMosaku won best supporting actress for \"Sinners\" at the BAFTAs in a custom Ahluwalia gown.\n\nThe bright-blue dress had a one-shoulder neckline, while the gown was covered in a geometric pattern that created a mosaic effect. Tassels flowed from the skirt at the knee, complementing the scarf that wrapped around her neck and trailed down the side of the gown.\n\nMoussaieff jewelry and Stuart Weitzman shoes tied her bold look together.\n\nNominated for best director for \"Hamnet,\" Zhao walked the BAFTAs red carpet in a gold Gabriela Hearst gown.\n\nThe dress was beautiful, with a scooped bodice that pointed at the waist and a ball-gown skirt covered in three-dimensional gold leaves. However, Zhao's styling felt more casual than the gown.\n\nShe wore her hair loose and paired the dress with black shoes that contrasted too much. A dramatic hairstyle, bold jewelry, and sparkly shoes could have helped the look feel more cohesive.\n\nBlyth's Saint Laurent suit included an oversize jacket and wide-legged pants. He paired it with a white blouse and a slim tie, which provided a nice contrast to the rest of the outfit's wider silhouette.\n\nA shiny brooch on his lapel completed the elegant look.\n\nThe \"One Battle After Another\" nominee made her BAFTA debut in a maroon Louis Vuitton gown.\n\nThe strapless dress hugged her figure before flaring at the knee, creating the illusion that her skirt was floating around her ankles.\n\nCoordinating pumps and De Beers jewelry, including bejeweled dangly earrings, completed her avant-garde ensemble.\n\nBuckley, who won a BAFTA for her performance in \"Hamnet,\" walked the red carpet in a bright-blue Chanel gown that was custom-designed by Matthieu Blazy.\n\nThe gown cinched at Buckley's waist and dipped in the back, flowing into a column-style, floor-length skirt. Silver brooches sat on each of her shoulders for a touch of glamour.\n\nThe silhouette was pretty and evoked a Grecian feel, but the dress was made of heavy velvet. The silhouette and fabric didn't look right together, and the dress may have popped more on the red carpet if it had been made of something like chiffon instead.\n\nMescal and Abrams made their red-carpet debut as a couple in style at the BAFTAs.\n\nMescal, who was nominated for best supporting actor for \"Hamnet,\" wore a Prada suit. His jacket was unbuttoned, he wore no tie, and his shirt cuffs were folded over for a relaxed look.\n\nAbrams also wore black, choosing a Chanel gown. Her dress was adorned with sparkly embellishments, with the neckline trimmed with green beading and the gown itself adorned with fish.\n\nTheir stylish outfits went well together, but didn't feel too matchy-matchy.\n\nNominated for his performance in \"Sinners,\" Jordan wore a Prada suit to the BAFTAs.\n\nHis double-breasted, charcoal jacket had padded, pointed shoulders. Jordan paired it with a black blouse, black tie, and slim-fitting black pants.\n\nA silver brooch brought a touch of glamour to the tailored suit.\n\nDunst arrived at the awards show in a Valentino ensemble. The look included a white blouse, a black skirt with a cutout on the waist, strappy black heels, and a pink jacket.\n\nHer jacket featured voluminous, bubbled sleeves and thick lapels on either side of its opening for a dramatic look.\n\nThere were pretty elements to the outfit, but the jacket distracted from them. She may have looked more stylish on the red carpet if she had just left the jacket at home.\n\nReinsve attended the BAFTAs in a Louis Vuitton gown.\n\nThe strapless, black gown had a cutout on one side of the bodice, leaving her torso exposed in a triangle shape. The skirt flowed to the ground and into a subtle train. A silver choker sat on her neck, completing the simple but beautiful outfit.\n\nThe actor, who was nominated for her performance in \"Sentimental Value,\" wore one of the most fashionable looks of the night.",

    "description": "I traveled to Africa and South America after high school. The gap year taught me more about adulthood than college ever did.",
    "fullText": "After spending two months watching women and girls fetch water from the village tap and then walk home with the enormous containers balanced on their heads, I had become increasingly determined to try to help with this daily task. I had admired the women's strength before, but as my neck muscles ached and my scalp bruised under the weight, my admiration had only grown.\n\nGambian women's lives were very different from my life in Long Island, New York — and that was exactly the point of my gap year between high school and college.\n\nThe trip consisted of teaching English in Gambia, exercising and caring for the resident horses on a private wildlife reserve in Namibia's Kalahari Region, teaching English in Patate, Ecuador, volunteering at both an elderly care center and an animal rescue in Quito, Ecuador, and exploring the Galápagos Islands.\n\nEighteen years later, I can confidently say that my gap year played a significant role in shaping the person I have become, and that's why I am encouraging my little sisters, who are 18 and 13, to take a gap year after high school as well.\n\nStarting my trip in the Gambia was like being thrown into the deep end of the adulting pool. The only ATM in the country that accepted my debit cards was a six-hour round-trip from the village where I was staying, and it had a daily withdrawal limit.\n\nOvernight, I went from being a financially clueless teenager who asked my parents for a top-up when I needed it, to getting a crash course on setting and sticking to a budget. I quickly learned the value of money.\n\nMy relationship with time was as lackadaisical as my relationship with money. But having people and animals relying on me forced me to develop a sense of time management. This was especially true in the Kalahari Desert, where it was imperative that every worker, visitor, volunteer, and domesticated animal be inside before the sun was directly overhead to avoid heat stroke.\n\nLearning budgeting and time management served me well in college and my career. But these were small nuggets of wisdom compared to the bigger lessons I learned about racism, privilege, and the freedom of life lived offline.\n\nAs a white-presenting Colombian American living in the Gambia, it was only the second time in my life when I looked different from everyone else around me. People stared when I walked through Serrekunda Market, and kids would excitedly yell \"toubab\" (the Mandinkan word for \"white person\").\n\nI did not fault them for their reactions; instead, I did my best to absorb the experience of being treated differently because of the color of my skin. It has since helped me better identify when my unconscious biases arise.\n\nI stepped into my freshman year calm, confident, technologically detoxed, and refreshed after my academically rigorous high school experience.\n\nWhere some of my peers self-medicated their separation anxiety, social anxiety, or overwhelm with binge drinking, I had already had a year to process these emotions and learned to adapt. The result was a smoother transition into academic life, a high GPA at the end of my freshman year, and a maturity that caught the attention of internship hiring managers.\n\nMore importantly, though, it gave me freedom, awareness, compassion, and a global lens through which I still process life.\n\nThis is what I really want for my sisters. I want them to know a life away from the noise and pressure of the digital world. I want them to have the space to learn from and be shaped by different people and cultures. I want them to have a year where they are not pushing themselves to excel academically or professionally, but instead can just learn who they are and what they want to do with their lives.\n\nCollege has become an oppressive financial burden. If they pursue it, I hope they are as mentally and emotionally prepared as possible so they get the most out of their financial investment.\n\nMy sisters would undoubtedly have their own experiences that leave unique imprints on their minds. If that helps them collect themselves before journeying into the messy, confusing world of adulthood, that sounds like a year well spent.",

    "fullText": "Fears of a software apocalypse are pummeling markets again to start the week.\n\nUS stocks dropped on Monday as traders reacted to new tariff uncertainty, while software in particular was pummeled by renewed fears of AI disruption prompted by a downgrade of Salesforce stock and a note making the rounds that theorized the AI boom could ultimately lead to a white-collar recession and a stock crash.\n\nMajor indexes lost more than 1% as investors continued to digest recent trade policy changes, including President Donald Trump's announcement over the weekend that he would hike global tariffs to 15%. The announcement came a day after the Supreme Court knocked down most of his earlier tariffs.\n\nThe Dow lost more than 800 points as selling ramped up around midday.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood around noon ET on Monday:\n\n\"Tariff uncertainty reigned this morning, pushing stocks to early losses and raising volatility on Wall Street,\" Joe Mazzola, the head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nInvestors also turned a more critical eye toward the software sector. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, which tumbled into a bear market earlier this year, was down another 5%. The fund is now down nearly 30% in 2026.\n\nHere were some of the notable moves on Monday:\n\nChatter about an AI-fueled meltdown picked up on Monday after the firm Citrini Research published a report outlining a hypothetical 2028 scenario in which the AI boom could trigger a recession and a stock market crash in the next couple of years.\n\n\"The system turned out to be one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth,\" the note said. \"The November 2027 crash only served to accelerate all of the negative feedback loops already in place.\"\n\nThe fresh AI jitters also brought capex spending back into the spotlight, with investors awaiting a key update this week in the form of Nvidia's coming earnings report due out on Wednesday.\n\n\"I think it's really just an AI story at this point for the market,\" Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, told Business Insider, referring to concerns about large capex spending despite unclear monetization plans at some firms. \"It's a question of whether investors are going to revolt against all the massive spending on AI data centers that we're having now.\"\n\nMark Hackett, the chief markets strategist at Nationwide, attributed much of the volatility to \"continued skepticism\" over AI and fresh tariff uncertainty.\n\n\"Hedge funds have aggressively moved to the sidelines, with net sales of US equities at the fastest pace since last March this month, and net leverage tracking to be the second largest sharpest monthly decline in a decade,\" he wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors will likely turn their attention to key tech earnings this week, with Nvidia and Salesforce reporting their results on Wednesday, Schwab's Mazzola said.",

    "fullText": "A data center executive said the recent backlash against the AI boom, led by the likes of Michael Burry and Jim Chanos, reminded him of Lex Luthor's army of keyboard-bashing monkeys in the newest \"Superman\" movie.\n\nFrank Holmes, the executive chairman of HIVE Digital Technologies, played a GIF from the movie during the company's earnings webcast last week. It showed one of the monkeys furiously typing the message: \"ONLY AN IDIOT WOULD BACK SUPERMAN.\"\n\nLuthor, Superman's archnemesis, memorably uses the monkeys to flood social media with hateful memes, hashtags, and vitriol. Mimicking real-life troll farms, the disinformation campaign succeeds in turning the world against the hero.\n\nHolmes also flashed up a slide with pictures of Burry and Chanos, followed by another filled with recent news headlines about their warnings.\n\n\"Jim Chanos comes out and: 'Short the bitcoin miners, short Nvidia, short the [high-performance computing], the hyperscalers, there's too much debt,'\" Holmes said.\n\n\"And Michael Burry is coming out,\" he continued. \"He came out a couple weeks ago. Again, he's short this market. And it really starts to grow, this negativity on the ecosystem.\"\n\nCommenting as the GIF played, Holmes said it was \"about Superman's credibility being destroyed.\"\n\n\"Well, the same thing happened out of nowhere, all this negativity was showing up on Instagram, and YouTube, and X,\" he added.\n\nHIVE builds and runs data centers powered by clean energy in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay. Holmes dismissed negative news about Big Tech companies spending too much on data centers, saying the \"backup demand is just immense,\" and short-term traders were stirring the pot to help their short bets.\n\nBurry, the fund manager-turned-writer of \"The Big Short\" fame, reiterated his concerns about AI overinvestment in X posts over the weekend.\n\nA question I have for $ORCL, $GOOG, $META, $MSFT, $AMZN, $NVDA, $CAT, and all the rest, “When does the spending for AI data center buildout actually end?”\nIt is consuming all your cash flow, you are borrowing, you are financing in ways you never have, apparently because it is so… pic.twitter.com/fytMYDH942\n\n\"A question I have for $ORCL, $GOOG, $META, $MSFT, $AMZN, $NVDA, $CAT, and all the rest, \"When does the spending for AI data center buildout actually end?\" he queried.\n\n\"It is consuming all your cash flow, you are borrowing, you are financing in ways you never have, apparently because it is so urgent, because it scales? But if it scales, when does it end?\" he added.\n\nChanos also took to X over the weekend to question whether tech giants would see returns on their huge outlays.\n\n\"But are they ALL going to be extremely profitable?\" he asked. \"Because each one of the AI companies and hyperscalers is spending money like they will be. They are betting that it won't be \"winner take all\" like search. We'll see.\"",

    "fullText": "Here's a detailed analysis by GPT 5.3 Codex of the problems with the benchmark. It read the original paper and ran real tests, so this isn't just a hallucination.\n\nThe README states results used -ffast-math (README.md:20). The benchmark warms up and then times repeated runs on the same graph/source (src/benchmark.c:166, src/benchmark.c:184).\n\nssp_duan is stateful across calls and only partially resets via dirty_d (src/dmmsy_opt.c:201, src/dmmsy_opt.c:209), relying on WEIGHT_MAX = inf checks (src/dmmsy_opt.c:108, include/common.h:10). Under -ffast-math, I consistently observed stale-state reuse after warmup, causing near no-op timed trials.\n\nI observed and reproduced both regimes locally:\n\nTo test correctness, I wrote a custom cross-source check (separate from the repo's built-in test harness): warm up ssp_duan on source 0 several times, then switch to source 1 and compare its distance array against a reference Dijkstra run on source 1. Under -ffast-math, this produced 3,068 differing distances; without -ffast-math, there were no mismatches. The repo's own correctness checks (src/benchmark.c:76-77, src/benchmark.c:103-104) only compare at source 0 and do not exercise the warmup-then-different-source scenario, and the timing loop passes NULL outputs without re-verifying correctness during benchmarking.\n\nThis code does not implement Algorithm 3 (BMSSP) as described in the paper's top-level recursion. With S = {s} and len_src = 1 (src/dmmsy_opt.c:224), it enters its base branch immediately via the condition len_src <= p.k (src/dmmsy_opt.c:70) and behaves like a full Dijkstra-style relaxation. The paper's base case is a mini-Dijkstra that stops after finding k + 1 vertices; this code's base case runs full SSSP.\n\nThis is not the BMSSP algorithm from the paper — it is a different, stateful heuristic implementation.\n\nBaseline Dijkstra allocates/frees its heap every call (src/dijkstra.c:18, src/dijkstra.c:48), while ssp_duan reuses thread-local workspace (src/dmmsy_opt.c:18), giving a structural benchmarking bias.\n\nI'm myself not smart enough to point out the problems\n\nI'm myself not smart enough to point out the problems",

    "description": "\"Dance Moms\" star JoJo Siwa opens up about growing up in the industry and reclaiming the multimillion-dollar bow empire she built as a child star.",
    "fullText": "When I first wrote about YouTube megastar JoJo Siwa, she was 16 and had just bought a house in Los Angeles, complete with a rainbow-colored bed and a duvet cover with her face on it.\n\nHer technicolor world looks very different now. So do the questions.\n\nWhen Siwa joins our Zoom call, I hardly recognize her. Gone are the bright rainbow clothes and the side ponytail anchored by the trademark bow that defined her. They're replaced by a more understated denim V-neck top and a slicked-back hairstyle.\n\nStill, one thing remains: her bow. Granted, her sartorial signature is now in a muted palette, but it's still there, decorating her long blonde hair. Siwa still has that million-dollar smile that made over 12 million people \n\nAfter all, the 22-year-old has already lived many lives. At 9 years old, she competed on season two of \"Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition,\" placing 5th for showcasing her high-energy dance techniques.\n\nAfter becoming a staple on Lifetime's reality show \"Dance Moms,\" she signed an exclusive licensing deal with Nickelodeon at 13 that helped turn her personality into a global brand.\n\nShe appeared on TV shows and in movies, performed live music, and had her namesake and face on bows sold worldwide. Her only concert tour, which ran from 2019 to 2022, brought in over $26.9 million in ticket sales alone in its first year, according to Billboard.\n\nEach milestone expanded her reach, but not necessarily her control. \"I basically had control over 0% of my IP back when I was with Nickelodeon,\" Siwa told Business Insider.\n\nThough her image powered a business that would sell over 80 million of those bows — whose sales have generated over $400 million, according to Forbes' conservative estimate — she wasn't calling the shots. A decade later, after years of waiting out contracts, Siwa is reclaiming the business she helped build by launching her own bow line.\n\n\"It's been a long time since I've personally made a JoJo Bow myself. It's been about 12 years,\" she said, referencing the company she started with her mom, JoJo Bows. Now, she said, \"Every single bow, I'm hands-on, designing, picking the color, every single thing is my choice.\"\n\n\"The biggest lesson that I learned is when it's your brand, when it's your IP, stick to what you believe,\" she said. \"Don't let people sway you. Don't let people change you.\"\n\nSiwa didn't chase fame necessarily. As a child, it felt like an extracurricular activity.\n\n\"My mom used to be like, 'Honey, let's go hang out with your friends that are your age,'\" she said. \"And I'd be like, 'No, I want to film a YouTube video.'\"\n\nSiwa's first video, posted almost exactly 11 years ago, was a simple Q&A in which she answered questions from \"Dance Mons\" fans who became invested in her. (It has since amassed over 1.2 million views.)\n\nOther early videos included YouTube staples at the time: unboxing fan gifts, room tours, a \"baby food challenge,\" and vlogs. Then, in 2016, she released her debut single, \"Boomerang,\" which has since amassed over a billion views on YouTube.\n\nNickelodeon was paying attention and signed Siwa to a multi-year talent and licensing deal in 2017, catapulting her from reality-show fame to the mainstream limelight at just 13 years old. Through her deal with Nickelodeon, Siwa not only co-hosted \"Lip Sync Battle Shorties\" alongside Nick Cannon but also leveraged the company's global licensing apparatus, scaling her company, JoJo Bows, into a multimillion-dollar merchandising operation.\n\nWithin a few years, Siwa was at the center of a full-scale empire: She became one of the network's flagship stars, launched merchandise lines with major retailers like Claire's and JCPenney, toured arenas, and built a fan base of over 12 million YouTube subscribers.\n\nAnd many of them weren't just buying into Siwa — they were buying bows.\n\nShe'd always been a little bit of a contradiction, though. She grew up quickly in the limelight yet struggled to shake off the child-star label.\n\n\"I remember being 20, and people were like, 'She's the little girl from \"Dance Moms,\"' Siwa recalled. \"It was never like, 'She's a 20-year-old who built this incredible empire.'\"\n\nBack then, success for Siwa meant scale: follower counts, view counts, sold-out arenas. Now, \"if I get through a day without crying, that's success,\" she said. Her goal for 2026 is to simply cry less. So far this year, she estimates she's cried three times — \"exceptional work on my behalf,\" she quipped.\n\nThe JoJo Siwa brand was now instantly recognizable. And the child star, still not 18, understood that her image was inseparable from her success. She felt compelled to protect it.\n\nSiwa eventually pushed for more creative control, a tug-of-war that eventually spilled out into the public when she criticized Nickelodeon in 2021, writing on Twitter (now X): \"Working for a company as a real human being treated as only a brand is fun until it's not.\" The post appears to have been deleted since then.\n\nFor Siwa, though, the fight over control started long before that tweet.\n\nA couple of years earlier, when she was 15, Siwa said Nickelodeon tried to produce a JoJo doll sporting two buns without running it past her. The collectible dolls, part of her licensing deal, were originally conceptualized to bring Siwa to life — colorful, with a side ponytail, and, yes, that bow.\n\n\"I freaked out,\" Siwa said. \"As a kid, the side ponytail and bow was who I was. That was my complete identity. And so for them to just change it felt like they were trying to change me.\"\n\nSiwa said she texted the president of consumer products the moment she saw it. \"I said, 'No. 1, I hate it, but No. 2, I'm really hurt that people would do this without talking to me,'\" she recalled. \"'I'm really hurt that no one would consider talking to JoJo about JoJo.'\"\n\nBusiness Insider reached out to Pam Kaufman, Nickelodeon's president of consumer products at that time, but did not receive a response.\n\nA similar conflict played out, she said, when she starred in the Nickelodeon-produced musical drama film \"The J Team\" in 2021, directed by Michael Lembeck. In it, she plays a young dancer — a fictionalized version of herself — whose world is upended when her longtime coach retires. Siwa said she clashed with Lembeck because he wanted her to dress and style her hair differently from her signature.\n\n\"He said, 'Well, this is my movie,'\" Siwa said. \"I remember saying to him, 'Well, you can call Nickelodeon and tell him you're going to have to do 'The J Team' without the 'J.''\"\n\nIt worked. Siwa kept her signature look in the film.\n\nLembeck's representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"The best thing I ever did was put my foot down when I needed to and say, 'This isn't happening,'\" Siwa said.\n\nEven though Siwa was dealing with much behind the scenes, her public criticism of the company occurred the same year that she came out as queer at 17 in a series of Instagram and TikTok posts.\n\nAlthough the initial public response was largely positive, she said there wasn't the same level of support behind the scenes.\n\nIn the 2024 documentary \"Child Star,\" Siwa recalled how the president of Nickelodeon asked her: \"What are we going to tell the kids?\" She said he then had her call every retailer selling her merchandise, from Claire's to Walmart, to assure them she wasn't \"going crazy.\"\n\nSiwa did as she was told, but her relationship with Nickelodeon was never the same, she said. In the documentary, she said she \"basically got blackballed\" by the company.\n\nA spokesperson for Nickelodeon told The Hollywood Reporter that they were \"unaware\" of the incident she referenced and that she \"was certainly not blackballed by Nickelodeon.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Nickelodeon declined to comment.\n\nJoJo's signature bows didn't start with Nickelodeon, though. They date back to when she and her mom, Jessalynn Siwa, started selling them to local hair salons when Siwa was around 4 years old. They were her signature throughout her run on \"Dance Moms,\" before she and her mom left the show in 2016.\n\nAt its peak, JoJo's bows, backed by the Nick licensing deal, expanded into major retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, and Target, sold around 35 million units, and generated millions in revenue. Some schools in the UK even banned them because kids couldn't handle the excitement over who nabbed the latest designs.\n\nEventually, though, they also stopped feeling like hers.\n\n\"It really got out of my control,\" Siwa said. \"It kind of just became like, 'Oh, JoJo, here's your bow.' And it's like, wait, but I didn't really have anything to do with this bow.\"\n\nSiwa said she understood why Nickelodeon stepped in to scale the bow business. As a teenager, she thought it made sense for professionals with more experience to take the reins of a company that grew so quickly.\n\nStill, there were times when decisions were being made without her that felt uncomfortable.\n\n\"The company president changed, and then the rest of the team changed, and that's when it started to kind of change,\" she said. \"I was a bit like, 'Hey, can I get the rights to that back? I don't really like where this is headed right now.'\"\n\nSiwa waited years until her contract expired to regain the rights to how portions of her brand and content could be used. After starting 2026 by changing her social media moniker to Joelle Siwa and teasing plans for the year, fans now know what Siwa is up to.\n\nShe announced a partnership with Royal Caribbean's Utopia of the Seas, inviting fans to have the \"ultimate JoJo Siwa fan adventure\" in the Caribbean, and now she's also launched two new bow collections.\n\nOne is for kids with designs inspired by candy and songs, and the other, Joelle bows, feature more grown-up styles. Siwa's latest collections revisit her signature accessory with a new level of oversight. This time, she's picking the color and detail of every single design, including a special line of 23 bows for her 23rd birthday coming up in May.\n\nWhen it comes to doing business, Siwa told me she still has just one non-negotiable: Anyone who works with her must also work with her mom.\n\n\"She is Superwoman — a partner in crime, and we make every choice together,\" Siwa said. \"If it's a bad one, we're in it together. And if it's a good one, we celebrate together.\"\n\n\"Dance Mom\" fans are already familiar with Jessalynn Siwa, who appeared on the series regularly alongside Siwa, often butting heads with instructors and other parents while advocating for her daughter.\n\nThe 51-year-old mother of two ran a dance studio in Omaha, Nebraska, that closed in 2016 after two decades. She then dedicated most of her time to managing Siwa's career.\n\n\"My job is to tell her the truth,\" Jessalynn said. \"We're like a two-person team: A pitcher and a catcher.\"\n\nWho's who depends on the day, but Jessalynn said they \"only throw strikes.\"\n\nOf course, like any mother and daughter, they butt heads. \"We have the 'I'm her mom' relationship, and then we have the working relationship,\" Jessalynn said, explaining their dynamic. \"As a working relationship, we go around and round — in a good way.\"\n\nFor Jessalynn, seeing Siwa take control of her bow company feels both meaningful and \"surreal.\" After all, it was Siwa's mother who first started putting the accessory in the star's hair.\n\n\"Every mom, when they have a baby girl, they put a bow on their head,\" she said. \"To have her be the queen of the bows … and have people loving them because they love your daughter and they want to be like her, it's so crazy. It's unreal.\"\n\nAt 22, Siwa wants to tell herself to slow down and enjoy the ride a bit more. Her message to rising stars is more pointed: Think carefully about whether fame is a life you truly want, not just a moment you're chasing.\n\n\"I remember, at 18, feeling like I didn't have a choice — people were always going to know who I am,\" she said. \"It worked out great for me … it has given me literally everything, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.\"",

    "description": "\"It takes, like, 20 years of life, and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart,\" Sam Altman said.",
    "fullText": "Sam Altman is pushing back on the idea that ChatGPT consumes too much energy.\n\n\"One of the things that is always unfair in this comparison is people talk about how much energy it takes to train an AI model relative to how much it costs a human to do one inference query,\" Altman told The Indian Express last week on the sidelines of a major AI summit. \"But it also takes a lot of energy to train a human.\"\n\nAltman suggested it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, arguing that it's unfair to discount the years spent nurturing and educating someone to be capable of making their own inquiries.\n\n\"It takes a lot of energy to train a human,\" he said, prompting some laughter in the crowd. \"It takes, like, 20 years of life, and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart.\"\n\nAltman said the clock really began thousands of years ago.\n\n\"It took, like, the very widespread evolution of the 100 billion people that have ever lived and learned not to get eaten by predators and learned how to, like, figure out science or whatever,\" he said.\n\nAltman also called out what he said were \"totally insane\" claims on the internet that OpenAI is guzzling down water to power ChatGPT.\n\n\"Water is totally fake,\" Altman said, when asked about concerns AI companies use too much water. \"It used to be true, we used to do evaporative cooling in data centers, but now that we don't do that, you know, you see these like things on the internet where, 'Don't use ChatGPT, it's 17 gallons of water for each query' or whatever.\"\n\nIn June, Altman said that the average ChatGPT query consumes roughly the amount of energy needed to power a lightbulb for a few minutes.\n\n\"People are often curious about how much energy a ChatGPT query uses; the average query uses about 0.34 watt-hours, about what an oven would use in a little over one second, or a high-efficiency lightbulb would use in a couple of minutes,\" he wrote on X.\n\nAltman said it is fair as a whole to point out the AI industry's overall energy consumption because of the large growth in usage. He said it's why he and other AI CEOs have pushed alternative energy sources like solar, wind, and nuclear.\n\nUnlike other CEOs, namely xAI's Elon Musk, Altman is dismissive of the idea that space-based data centers are realistic in the next decade, a concept that some companies have floated as a way to reduce energy consumption.\n\nOutside of OpenAI, Altman is a major investor in nuclear energy. He previously served as chairman of Oklo, a nuclear energy startup, and has been a major backer of Helion, which plans to build what it calls \"the world's first fusion power plant\" in Washington state.\n\nIn the US, data center energy consumption is becoming a major topic. Last month, President Donald Trump said he was working with tech companies on \"a commitment to the American people\" to ensure that citizens don't pay higher energy bills because of a nearby data center.\n\nConsulting firm McKinsey & Company estimated last year that data centers could account for 14% of total power demand in the US by 2050.",

    "description": "I traveled comfortably on Amtrak's California Zephyr in a private bedroom for $2,200. It was worth the price for the longest train ride in the US.",
    "fullText": "When I decided to take the longest train ride in the US, I splurged on comfort.\n\nThe 53-hour journey on Amtrak's California Zephyr took me from snowy Chicago to sunny Emeryville, California, in February.\n\nIt was my first time spending two consecutive nights on the same sleeper train, so I wanted a private space with a full bathroom to ensure a pleasant trip. That's why I spent $2,200 on a bedroom accommodation.\n\nWhile I was excited to stay in the tiny, moving hotel room, I wondered whether I'd regret spending so much. In the end, it didn't disappoint, and I'm so glad I booked it.\n\nHere's a look inside the 50-square-foot bedroom.\n\nThe California Zephyr is an Amtrak Superliner — a two-story train with coach seating, bedrooms, roomettes (a private cabin that's about half the size of a bedroom), a dining car, and a lounge car. There are also larger, family-sized bedrooms and accessible bedrooms.\n\nI'd ridden the California Zephyr a year earlier, but I took a shorter trip in a roomette. This was my first time riding the entire route and booking a bedroom on the train.\n\nThe couch folded out to form the bottom bunk, and the top bunk pulled down from the ceiling.\n\nThe Amtrak bedroom sleeps up to two passengers, though I traveled solo.\n\nPerks of the booking also included a first-class attendant, priority boarding, lounge access at some stations, and complimentary meals on board.\n\nDuring the day, the lower bunk was set up as a couch, and the upper bunk was folded up. A single seat faced the couch with a pullout table in between.\n\nThe table also had two foldout leaves for more space. I thought this was a smart space-saving hack.\n\nThe closet had two hangers inside. I used it to store my coat, sweater, and winter boots.\n\nThe sink and vanity had two power outlets and an overhead light. Although the cabinets were stocked with extra hand towels, tissues, and soap, there was still enough space for me to store my own toiletries.\n\nOnly bedrooms on Amtrak Superliner trains have private bathrooms.\n\nShowering next to the toilet felt odd, but I can't deny that it was a clever use of a limited space. And I certainly preferred it over having just a toilet or just a shower.\n\nThere was a two-step system to use the shower. First, I set the temperature. Then I pushed a button to get the water flowing. There was another button on the showerhead itself to turn the water on and off. On the wall above the toilet, I spotted shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.\n\nThe mirror was not only useful for getting ready — it also made the tight space feel larger.\n\nWhen I changed my clothes each morning and evening, I pulled my suitcase down to the single seat.\n\nBoth sets of controls had a reading light. One had a power outlet and a temperature dial, and the other had an attendant call button and lighting options.\n\nThe night setting was a dim blue light, which I thought added a dreamy glow to the space before bed.\n\nWhen I pulled the top bunk down from the ceiling, I found a ladder on the cot, which I attached to the far side of the bunk. There were safety straps that I hooked onto the ceiling.\n\nThere was also a mattress topper, soft bedding, and pillows. I used a pouch on the wall to store a water bottle and my phone.\n\nI liked sleeping on the top bunk — despite hitting my head on the low ceiling — because I could store my backpack and other belongings on the couch below, which kept the room neat. I got seven hours of sleep that first night.\n\nI pulled a lever beneath each couch cushion to form the lower bunk.\n\nAlthough the room wasn't as tidy, since I didn't have as much space to store my belongings, I appreciated that the lower bunk was slightly larger than the top cot.\n\nI also liked being right next to the window when I woke up in the morning. I got eight hours of sleep in this bunk.\n\nUnlike most overnight trains I've taken, the bedroom was comfortable enough to actually enjoy spending 53 hours in a confined space. I arrived in California feeling well-rested and squeaky clean.\n\nI'd book the accommodation again for any overnight Amtrak ride.",

    "description": "Critics worry about what forgiveness and repayment options borrowers may have if federal student loans are sold to private lenders.",
    "fullText": "The future ownership of the federal student-loan portfolio is up in the air.\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a response she received in early February from Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent regarding the potential sale of federal student loans to private companies. Kent wrote in his letter that the administration has \"met with a variety of stakeholders to discuss ideas to reform the student loan portfolio\" with the goal of reducing the $1.7 trillion burden on borrowers.\n\n\"The Department has not taken any final actions or made final decisions regarding selling all or part of the student loan portfolio,\" Kent said. \"We continue to explore all viable options to reduce the burden on taxpayers by restoring the health of the portfolio.\"\n\nThis is the first time that the Department of Education has publicly acknowledged any discussions to sell off federal student loans. Politico first reported in October that the administration was discussing selling off federal student loans with finance executives.\n\nWhile it's unclear when, or if, a sale would occur, Warren and education policy experts have previously expressed concerns about handing student loan servicing over to private companies. Federal student loans tend to offer more generous forgiveness and repayment plans than private lenders, and it's unclear which plans borrowers would have access to should their loans be sold.\n\n\"Instead of helping Americans drowning with student loan debt, Trump is thinking up ways to make life worse for borrowers,\" Warren said in a statement. \"If the Trump administration cared about working-class families, it would stop its ridiculous plan to sell out families to Wall Street.\"\n\nWith major changes coming for student-loan repayment, private lenders are gearing up for a big year. Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for new repayment plans and borrowing caps for advanced degrees, and the leaders of major private lenders previously said they're preparing for an influx of borrowers seeking additional financing that the federal system would no longer cover.\n\nThose lenders wrote to Warren and some of her Democratic colleagues that they're equipped to handle the influx, but the lawmakers said they're concerned that \"lenders have far less of an incentive to provide borrowers with loans on terms that are commensurate to those of federal loans.\"\n\nKent maintained in his letter that the department is committed to improving federal student aid programs and helping borrowers pay back their loans.\n\n\"The Department remains focused on helping borrowers return to repayment and escape the albatross of delinquency and default,\" he wrote.",

    "fullText": "Social media has been ripe for exploitation since its invention, but GenAI has significantly lowered the price of entry.\n\nWe are rapidly careening to a world where we are going to be talking with bots online and we won’t be able to avoid it. Whether it’s sharing our dreams online, getting health advice or arguing about politics¹. Everything we say or read online, we increasingly have no ability to avoid a soup of words spewed out by an LLM, when we would rather focus our attentions on words typed by a uniquely human person.\n\nI don’t want to live in that world. I don’t think anyone does.\n\nWhat has made the internet wonderful: meeting real people, without the anxiety of the real world. This is being taken away from us.\n\nPowerful and rich people have been using social media to divide us for a long time. It has been extremely easy to create an abundance of social media accounts, not just to spam advertising, but to genuinely push political opinions on the masses.\n\nWe are all susceptible to the illusory truth effect- the tendency to believe false information to be correct after it has been repeated to us multiple times.\n\nState governments know this and they have the money to fund such propaganda campaigns. How much damage to the social psyche do you think 100 full-time humans controlling thousands accounts can do? What about thousands such employees?\n\nThese tactics are well documented, sometimes referred to as the Firehose of Falsehood or “flooding the zone”. They impact us every day, even if we avoid the internet in all its forms.\n\nWhat would have been a full-time job of reading and posting online for a hundred humans can now be automated away completely by an LLM. Whatever form of bot detection the social media companies have can be resolved by the few humans that remain employed for this enterprise.\n\nThe Firehose of Falsehood can now reach superhuman proportions. After all, even humans working full-time have to eat and sleep. But LLMs can write enough plausible sounding bullshit at an unlimited pace.\n\nWe cannot continue participating in social media platforms which do nothing to stop us being tricked by GenAI and the powerful people/governments that control them.\n\nThis doesn’t just apply to ordinary citizens, but our lawmakers are duped by this plague too. If you’re a politician then surely you can see the value in engaging with real and authentic people online.\n\nSo how do we solve this challenge? I believe that it’s time we build a social network which only allows human accounts. I believe this so much that I decided to build one, and you can find it at onlyhumanhub.com.\n\nA human social network does not mean sacrificing anonymity. What it does mean is enforcing one account per human.\n\nNo more alt accounts, no more ban evasion, and no more sock puppet accounts.\n\nSo how can this possibly work? How can I verify you’re human? or for that matter that you’re a unique human?\n\nThis is where things get tricky and where I will lose most of you. But before you go. Please consider what I have written above. Your very psyche is in danger if you continue frequenting platforms filled with bots, paid actors and bored humans trying to trick you. I believe that human social networks are going to be the only ways for us to form human communities online with confidence.\n\n… we can solve this using the existing government documents that we are already using to prove who we are. Passports, IDs, and other documents. Yes, they contain sensitive information, but currently there is no other way, really.\n\nI’m losing you because your immediate feeling is disgust about the thought of sharing your ID documents with a random website. Yes, I’ve seen how this ended up for some apps. Know that my number one priority is to store as little data from your ID as possible and to reduce the risk of any of your ID data being leaked as a result of using this service.\n\nIs the risk zero? Of course not. Nothing in this life is risk-free. But I hope, with your support, that I can get it as close to zero as possible.\n\nIn the meantime, the risk is already very close to zero and I will be completely transparent about how the system works. In the future, some governments may provide anonymous systems to prove humanity, and I sincerely hope this will happen soon. But for now, passports in particular, offer the most universal way to prove your humanity.\n\nJust to be clear. At time of writing I don’t make any money from this. I know that for some this may be strange. But I genuinely want to create an online community of humans. The scale at which this website is at right now, the costs for running it are small enough that I can cover them. In the future, with enough users there are options for funding, from donations from members to advertising. I hope that we can come to a decision together when it comes to it.\n\nBut as far as my intentions, I have no ulterior motive for collecting this data. I only do it to provide a safe space for humans to communicate anonymously. Yes, you remain completely anonymous on the website. You just know that every account you speak with and interact with is human. How amazing is that in this day and age?\n\nAlright. So what is actually stored from your passport? Why does anything need to be stored? The reason is to ensure each ID can only be used to create one account. What is stored is your full name, date of birth, the last 4 digits of your ID’s number (e.g. passport number) and the country that issued your ID.\n\nBut the great thing is that your name and ID number are stored in such a way that even someone with access to the database (and our encryption keys) wouldn’t be able to read them!\n\nDon’t believe me? Here is that data from my passport in the database:\n\nI challenge anyone to decipher it. Though I expect it is impossible, hence why I am comfortable in displaying it in public here.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the amount of data we store is the absolute minimum. The 4 digits of your ID number are only there to ensure two John Smiths (or Zhang Weis²) born on the same day don’t clash.\n\nAll this to say, you remain completely anonymous. I even cannot decipher what your full name is from the data stored in the Only Human Hub database. Furthermore, there is no requirement to display your full name on Only Human Hub, you may choose to use a nickname or pseudonym that has no link to your real identity.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far and you want to join us, then head over to https://onlyhumanhub.com\n\nOur ambition is to create a social network filled with human users, with no access given to AI bots nor crawlers used for AI training. So you can write to other humans and be confident that not only are you speaking with other humans, but that your words will not be used to train AI models.\n\nRight now, we have a prototype social media app that isn’t ready for release yet, but our registration and verification process is. You can verify that you are a human, link this status with a Bluesky account and get a link to prove to others that you are human. As an example, here is my proof: https://onlyhumanhub.com/profile/dom96.picheta.me. You can place this in your preferred social network’s bio, or share it with people when they ask for it.\n\nIn addition to linking your Verified Human status with a Bluesky account, you will also become verified by @OnlyHumanHub.com on Bluesky and gain the Verified Human label in our labeller available at @label.onlyhumanhub.com. We also have a feed which contains all verified humans, so you can see what they are posting and engage with them.\n\nYou do not need to provide your passport to register. Just getting registered is a good way to stay up to date on developments, you can also follow @OnlyHumanHub.com on Bluesky for the same. Eventually the hope is to enable early access to the social media app and if you’re registered you will be one of the first to gain access.\n\nIf you enjoy tech deep dives then this is for you. I didn’t want to go into too much technical details above, as the target audience I am targeting would have required more extensive explanation than I have room for here. My assumption if you’re reading this section is that you are aware of what hashes are and how websites usually use them to protect your login passwords.\n\nSo how does the verification process work? You take a photo of your passport using passportreader.app which then enables it to read the NFC chip of your passport. The data from the NFC chip is temporarily stored on passportreader.app’s servers together with a flag signifying whether the passport is valid. The Only Human Hub verifier reads this data, if it finds that the passport is valid it captures the following data from the passport:\n\nLast 4 digits of the passport number\n\nThe date of birth and issuing country are stored in separate SQLite/D1 database columns. They are encrypted with a private key.\n\nA concatenation of the full name, date of birth, issuing country and last 4 digits of the passport number are encrypted and hashed. This means that each unique passport ends up hashing to the same bytes. It enables the verification process to reject a passport that has already been used for verification previously. This hash is stored alongside the encrypted DoB and Issuing Country. This data entry is linked to your account.\n\nThe original raw data read from the NFC chip is stored on passportreader.app’s servers for at most 24 hours. I have set up a cron job to verify this and will be alerted if this does not happen. So far, from what I’ve seen, the data is usually removed within an hour.\n\nIf you are someone who is at risk of prosecution by a rogue state government, then there is a risk that the data stored about your passport may be successfuly linked with your real-life identity. While the hashing described above will effectively prevent any non-state actor from identifying you, even if our database and encryption keys are leaked, this cannot be said of a state government.\n\nThis is because the ID document you have used may have been issued by that state government. In that case, that government may be able to go through all the ID documents they have ever issued and hash them in the same manner that we have. In that case they may be able to identify a particular hash as belonging to a particular ID document and thus identify you and the account that this ID document is linked to. Due to this, using Only Human Hub for acts such as whistleblowing or other acts that may warrant prosecution is not recommended.\n\nOf course, at any point you can choose to delete your Only Human Hub account and the associated passport data.\n\n¹ Yes, I am using the Rule of Three here. No, this was not written by GenAI.\n\n² Zhang Wei is possibly the most common full name in the World",

It requires leaders who deliberately manage conflict as a source of insight, broaden director recruitment beyond traditional profiles, set the tone through facilitation and coaching, design onboarding and mentoring for new members, and dismantle “boards-within-the-board” that create damaging insider-outsider hierarchies.",

This transition—from search engine optimization to generative engine optimization—favors brands whose information is structured, trusted, and easy for AI systems to synthesize. Second, AI agents are beginning to act as buyers, making purchasing decisions on behalf of humans.

    "description": "These collapsible versions of tools and DIY items are easy to store and still get the job done.",
    "fullText": "An immutable law of the universe is that no matter how big your house is, you eventually fill it up with stuff. And if you’re starting off with a small house to begin with, you hit maximum storage pretty quickly. That can make DIY home maintenance and other projects a challenge, because so many of the tools you need are kind of enormous and awkwardly-shaped, making their storage problematic even in spacious homes.\n\nWhile hand tools like hammers and screwdrivers can usually be stashed creatively, larger items eat up your spare room pretty quickly—unless you opt for a folding or collapsible version. These tools do the same job, but shrink down when not in use so they can squeeze into tight spots or unexpected locations, solving your storage problems.\n\nLadders can be some of the biggest storage challenges because they are, by their very nature, extremely large and rigid. If you don’t have enough vertical or horizontal space to store a ladder, it can wind up just sort of standing in an odd place, collecting dust in between uses and making your home look like a perpetual job site.\n\nYou have two small-space options to solve for this, though. The most common is a telescoping ladder, which collapses down to a portion of its height when not in use. This can make it a lot easier to find storage space in a closet or other location, and it can even be hidden behind furniture. Another option is a folding ladder like this one from DuoSaftey, which folds into a stick-like form when not in use, minimizing its horizontal footprint instead of its vertical footprint.\n\nA sturdy, wheeled cart is incredibly useful in a lot of maintenance and repair jobs, making it easy to transport tools and materials around the area. But who has the space to have a whole cart just sitting around until it’s needed? A folding cart is the answer: It folds flat for easy storage, but snaps into a sturdy full-sized cart that can handle up to 300 pounds of weight when it’s needed.\n\nA bubble level is a necessity if you want your home projects to look like a sane, rational person performed the work. But a full-size level is often difficult to find space for, and smaller levels aren’t as useful for larger projects.\n\nThis folding level not only collapses into a tiny form factor for storage, it can be bent and used to check level around corners, which is one of those DIY superpowers you don’t realize you need until you learn about its existence.\n\nSaws are another rigid tool that can be problematic to store. Hanging them on a wall is a good solution that gets them out of the way, but if you need to pack your tools out of sight, you need to consider a folding saw like this one. If you saw wood every day of your life, you might not want this, but if you need a saw for the occasional quick project around the house and don’t have storage space to spare, this will get the job done and fold up and away when not needed.\n\nLike rolling carts, workbenches are incredibly useful when you need a flat surface to work on, but become a real pain when it’s time to store them away. Luckily, you can pick up a folding workbench like this one from DeWalt. It’s a sturdy work surface that can support up to 1,000 pounds, but when the job is done, it folds up to be slid into the tightest spot you have available.\n\nEveryone needs a job bucket in the house, but the traditional five-gallon bucket not only takes up more space than you realize, it also becomes a place to store stuff in, making it a chore to unpack every time you need to use it. A folding bucket like this one isn’t quite as large (it’s only three gallons), but it collapses into an easily-stored flat configuration when you’re not using it, preventing it from tempting you with all that empty space.\n\nFor years, I had a hand truck stored in my crawl space, because a hand truck was an incredibly useful thing. Any time I had to move bags of cement or large items around, I’d have to climb down into that nightmarish crawl space and retrieve the hand truck, which was a pain in the butt. Now I have this folding handtruck, which does the same job (it can handle more than 300 pounds) but can be tucked away in a closet when not in use.\n\nEvery house needs a shovel. You either have a garden or backyard where digging will occasionally be needed, or you’ll need to clear snow from your sidewalks and driveway. Or both! Shovels tend to be left in garages or outside when not in use, but if you need to store yours in a small space inside, a folding option is a real space-saver. It collapses into a compact square that will squeeze into any space, but it’s sturdy enough for the toughest jobs you can throw at it.",

    "description": "Scientists say that eating more cruciferous vegetables lowers colon cancer risk. Here's how it works, plus tasty ways to prepare and enjoy the veggies.",
    "fullText": "Eating more cruciferous vegetables may lower your risk of colon cancer by 20%, according to one study.\n\nScientists say these veggies contain powerful plant compounds that may actively fight cancer in the body.\n\nExperts explain how eating more of this food supports your gut health.\n\nColon cancer is highly treatable if caught early, so it's crucial to get the recommended screenings and watch for the possible signs of colon cancer. But in the meantime, choosing the right foods can go far towards supporting your gut health and potentially lowering your risk. In fact, a study published in BMC Gastroenterology found that one particular food group, cruciferous vegetables, lowers colon cancer risk. Read on to discover what the researchers found, how these veggies boost your gut health overall, and some easy and tasty ways to prepare and enjoy them.\n\nMeet the Experts: Elizabeth Harris, M.S., R.D.N., owner of Elizabeth Harris Nutrition and Wellness, Jennifer Pallian, B.S.C., R.D., food scientist and recipe developer at Foodess Creative Inc., and Supriya Rao, M.D., a quadruple board-certified gastroenterologist with Integrated Gastroenterology Consultants.\n\nThe large meta-analysis reviewed data from 17 different studies and 97,595 participants who self-reported their intakes of cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, and Brussels sprouts. Incidence of colon cancer was then measured, comparing those with the highest versus the lowest consumption of the vegetable. It was deduced that consuming 40 to 60 grams of cruciferous vegetables per day—which amounts to about ½ cup of broccoli or two to three cups of raw kale—could lower your risk of developing colon cancer by nearly 20%.\n\n“These results strengthen the evidence that diet, particularly vegetable intake, plays an important role in colon cancer prevention,” said Jennifer Pallian, B.S.C., R.D., food scientist and recipe developer at Foodess Creative Inc.\n\nSupriya Rao, M.D., a quadruple board-certified gastroenterologist with Integrated Gastroenterology Consultants added: “The protective effect seems to level off when you reach about 40 to 60 grams per day, so consistency really matters more than anything.”\n\nSo, what's so special about these vegetables in particular? “Cruciferous vegetables are plants in the Brassicaceae family, recognizable by their cross-shaped flowers,” said Pallian. In addition to those mentioned above, other cruciferous veggies include collard greens, kohlrabi, mustard greens, rutabaga, turnips, Bok choy, Chinese cabbage, arugula, radish, horseradish, watercress, and wasabi, Pallian added.\n\nIn general, a plant-forward, fiber-rich diet is known to help reduce risk of colon cancer, said Dr. Rao. But cruciferous vegetables contain glucosinolates, which are sulfur-containing chemicals that break down into bioactive products called isothiocyanates (ITCs), she explained. These are known to help detoxify the body of cancer-causing carcinogens, promote healthy cell turnover, and reduce inflammation.\n\nPallian added that ITCs have also demonstrated aid in cancer cell death, the blocking of new blood vessels that feed tumors, and cell cycle arrest to prevent uncontrolled cell multiplication. Ultimately, these bioactive compounds are believed to destroy or slow the growth of cancer cells, explained Elizabeth Harris, M.S., R.D.N., owner of Elizabeth Harris Nutrition and Wellness.\n\nOn top of their cancer-fighting properties, cruciferous veggies are generally nutritious. They’re fiber-packed and also contain vitamin C, carotenoids, and flavonoids, “which may contribute to enhanced gut health, reduced inflammation, and antioxidant protection,” said Pallian.\n\n“Adding cruciferous veggies to your meals doesn’t have to be complicated and can be downright delicious,” said Pallian. “For a quick and crispy side, toss some broccoli in the air fryer with olive oil and spices. If you’re craving takeout vibes, a simple beef and broccoli stir-fry comes together in minutes and makes a balanced dinner. Roasted cauliflower and kale with chickpeas and a tangy yogurt dressing is hearty enough to stand on its own as lunch, while classic cabbage coleslaw, whether you go creamy or lighter with yogurt, always hits the spot.”\n\nPallian also recommended hiding a handful of kale in a banana smoothie or blending broccoli or kale into a creamy pasta sauce for all the flavor with a little extra nutrition. There is one caveat to note, though: “Cruciferous vegetables can cause uncomfortable gas or bloating in some,” said Harris. “To minimize this potential effect, add them to your diet gradually and be sure to drink plenty of water to aid digestion.”\n\nIn addition to eating plenty of cruciferous veggies, Dr. Rao noted that it’s still important to fill your plate with a variety of different fruits and vegetables. “Try to eat the rainbow and eat 30-plus different plants per week,” she said. “Small changes add up over time!”\n\nCan Apple Cider Vinegar Lead to Weight Loss?\n\nBobbi Brown Shares Her Top Face-Transforming Makeup Tips for Women Over 50",

    "description": "Plus, the truth behind Punch-kun the monkey.",
    "fullText": "If you want to understand a generation, look at the athletes they revere. The post-war generation's suburban conformity found a hero in baseball's ultimate company man—Stan Musial—and his 22 seasons on the Cardinals. Boomers were drawn to Broadway Joe Namath, a self-important celebrity who wasn't even a good quarterback. Gen X saw itself in Tiger Woods' stoic, lone-grinder-in-a-high-stakes-vacuum style. This year's Winter Olympics introduced the world to the first iconic athletes that express Gen Z's vibe, and they're amazing. But first, let's talk about Baby Boo Syndrome.\n\nIt seems like everyone on TikTok has come down with Baby Boo Syndrome this week. The trend started with a short dance video from @selenaaa.dta using a particularly snippet of YoungBoy Never Broke Again's \"What You Is.\" The rapper saying \"She gon call me baby boo\" is both really catchy and really annoying, in other words, a perfect ear-worm.\n\n@selenaaa.dta's unique style earned their video over 10 million views, but it took more than a year for everyone else to catch up and start posting their own choreography to the music. Then things got weird.\n\nBaby Boo variations and remixes started appearing, like this operatic cover:\n\nAnd this mash-up with \"Baby Shark\"\n\nThe rapid spread of the trend and the catchiness of the song soon led to people diagnosing cases of \"Baby Boo Syndrome\" in videos like this:\n\nI am getting definite 6-7 vibes with this one.\n\nOlympic gold medalist figure skater Alysa Liu is that rare athlete that kids should consider a role model. Liu embodies everything that makes people between of 14 and 29, and America itself, so uniquely awesome. First there's the look. Liu's blonde halo highlight and frenulum piercing is fully in tune with Gen Z's aesthetic, but it's deeper than style.\n\nLike roughly 22% of Generation Z, Liu is from an immigrant family—her parents are Chinese dissidents who fled after Tiananmen Square. Liu was a skating prodigy, then, like everyone of her age, COVID shaped her destiny. She retired from skating at 16 when her local rink's closure gave her time to consider the strain skating was taking on her mental health. After attending UCLA for two years, Liu came back to the ice, but on her own, very Gen Z, terms: She would be in charge of her training schedule, costumes, and diet. Maybe more importantly, she rejected the competitiveness of her sport in favor of viewing figure skating as an act of self-expression, something fun.\n\nMany in the conservative world of figure skating thought she was finished—you don't succeed as a world class athlete while without sacrificing everything in your life for it, and it's definitely not fun. But Liu made it to the Olympics and murdered her individual routine like it was no big deal, then walked off the ice giving NBC's camera a hearty, \"That's what I'm fucking talking about.\" So punk rock. Just as iconic: Liu sharing victory with silver medal winner Kaori Sakamoto of Japan.\n\nMaybe she's not as fierce and in-your-face as Liu, but Team USA figure skater Amber Glenn is quietly becoming a Gen Z icon as well. The 26-year-old figure skater is open about her mental health struggles and being queer, and she's also a passionate Magic: The Gathering player. A recent interview reveals that Glenn carries her Magic cards with her, but leaves the \"super fancy\" ones at home because they're her prized possessions, and she doesn't want to lose them.\n\nThe main character of the internet this week is a baby macaque from the in Japan. Punch-kun was introduced to the world on the Ichikawa City Zoo's twitter account.\n\nPunch was born on July 26, 2025, but was rejected by his stressed-out mother. Zookeepers raised him, giving him an orangutan plush toy to replace mom. He drags it everywhere, which is cute, but things got a lot less adorable when the zoo introduced the little guy to other monkeys. It seems to not go well at all.\n\nEveryone spread the video above because how could you not? It's so poignant. Many were moved, and others angered by the seeming mistreatment of Punch by the other macaques, or angry at the zoo for putting him in that position.\n\nWeirdly enough, it turns out the internet got it totally wrong. The controversy lead to the zoo explaining that the macaque dragging him around in the video isn't bullying Punch; it's an older member of the troop teaching him how to fit in. It's monkey business. They are wild animals, and they don't do things like humans do.\n\nThe saga of Punch is ongoing. Sometimes he seems to be getting along with the troop better, sometimes he still seems like an outsider. Keep checking every social media site for updates.",

    "title": "The 25 Best Movies Streaming on Tubi Right Now",
    "description": "Whether you're \"Feeling Randy\" or hoping to find some \"Women Talking,\" Tubi is here for you.",
    "fullText": "While other streaming services thrive on carefully selected and endlessly curated (meaning: limited) selections of movies, Tubi's a bit different: It feels like the Wild West, with everything from originals to popular hits, to critically acclaimed favorites, to the lowest of low-brow, low-budget movies you'll find this side of an abandoned Blockbuster.\n\nIn that spirit, here's a sampling of some of the best stuff currently streaming on Tubi. It's a wide variety—the streamer refuses to be pinned down. (If you're unfamiliar, Tubi is a free, ad-based streaming service—possibly the best streaming service of them all.)\n\nThe controversial last film from Stanley Kubrick sends Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman on a long, dark night of the soul. After Alice Hartford confesses to vivid sexual fantasies involving another man, husband Bill goes on a psychosexual odyssey that takes him deep into his own neuroses (and to a masked orgy). Kubrick resurrects the dreamlike tone of The Shining but adds a life-threatening kinky sex cult, just for fun. Stream Eyes Wide Shut.\n\nThe title promises a bit of raunchy irreverence—and there is a fair bit of boner talk—but this one is also pretty charming for a movie about four friends in the '70s who set out to lose their virginities at the fun-sounding Kitty Ranch Brothel. It's as much a coming-of-age story as it is a sex comedy, especially as the title's Randy (Reid Miller) begins to question his commitment to the adventure, as well as his own sexuality. Stream Feeling Randy.\n\nSarah Polley wrote and directed this Best Picture Oscar nominee, loosely based on (horrific) real events. The women and girls of an isolated Mennonite colony discover that they've been drugged and raped on a regular basis by several of the men—when the perpetrators are arrested, and most of the rest of the colony's men leave to bail them out, the victims and other women are left to decide what to do next. Torn between the conflicting demands of their faith, their loyalty to home and family, and the terrible revelations, they must choose whether to stay, to fight, or to flee. Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley, Judith Ivey, Ben Whishaw, and Frances McDormand make up the impressive ensemble cast. Stream Women Talking.\n\nYou like James Cameron's Titanic, right? Then you're gonna love (maybe?) this non-sequel from The Asylum, purveyors of fine cinematic schlock such as the immortal classic Sharknado. Here, a perfect replica of the Titanic sets sail exactly 100 years after the original disaster, this time beset by the man-made disaster that is global climate change. Goofier, a million times cheaper, but with 100% more Bruce Davison, this gives you some sense of Tubi's sublime-to-ridiculous range. Stream Titanic II, and toss in supernatural shocker and Tubi original Titanic 666 for one wild movie marathon.\n\nThis Tubi original (It's a foreign film! From Canada!) stars Drag Race alumni Trinity the Tuck, Heidi N Closet, Crystal Methyd, and Cara Melle as—you guessed it—drag queens who stop off in a middle-of-nowhere biker bar while on tour. Things are dodgy, and only get dodgier when the bar is overrun by vampires, forcing the queens and the bikers to team up and fight for survival. It's good, campy fun with a heartfelt message, and a marvel of high-energy, low-budget filmmaking. Stream Slay.\n\nAfter witnessing a mass shooting as a child, Luke (Miles Robbins) develops an imaginary friend, Daniel (played by White Lotus' Patrick Schwarzenegger). Years later, Luke's a shy college student struggling with his mental health, and Daniel returns. Before long, though, he's asserting his will and taking over fully to engage in behavior that's increasingly erratic and sometimes violent. Or maybe this is all just Luke's subconscious acting out and...Daniel isn't real? Stream Daniel Isn't Real.\n\nLuca Guadagnino (Call Me by Your Name, Challengers) directs this delightful romance—well, OK, maybe delightful isn't the word, given that we're talking about a couple of cannibals in love. Taylor Russell is Maren, a young \"eater\" who, after being abandoned by her father, sets off on a cross-country quest to find her mother. She meets up with Timothée Chalamet's Lee, who has imilar urges, and is similarly lonely. Stream Bones and All.\n\nThis Barbershop spin-off follows widowed hairstylist Gina Norris as she starts her life over in Atlanta with her daughter. When a job offer doesn't pan out, she decides to open her own shop. Queen Latifah is as delightful as ever, and is joined by a great cast, including Alfre Woodard, Della Reese, Alicia Silverstone, Andie MacDowell, Kevin Bacon, and Djimon Hounsou. Stream Beauty Shop.\n\nThe movie that put Mel brooks on the map and made Gene Wilder a star finds con artist Max Bialystock scheming to strike it rich by overselling a musical designed to fail so he can cash in on the insurance settlement. The resulting show, \"Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden,\" is as hilariously offensive as anything in the Mel Brooks oeuvre. Stream The Producers.\n\nAnaconda knows just how ridiculous it is, employing over-the-top acting and dodgy special effects to sell the sweaty, silly horror of it all. Jennifer Lopez is definitely having a lot of fun in the lead and, sorry for the spoiler, but watching Jon Voight get eaten by a giant CGI snake is a pleasure all its own. Stream Anaconda.\n\nNot shy about breaking genre rules, Bong Joon Ho (Parasite) followed up the smart monster movie/family drama The Host with this dystopian sci-fi thriller, which offers lots of action and plenty of commentary about the state of modern, class-based capitalism. In a frozen near-future, the remnants of humanity survive on a tremendously long, never-stopping train. The rich elite of the old world live in relative luxury toward the front, while the poor survive on scraps to the rear. Chris Evans leads the inevitable uprising. Stream Snowpiercer.\n\nIt's certainly not for everyone, not even for every slasher fan—but, in Jason X, we have a movie that does exactly what it says on the tin and sends Jason into space. Having been captured, Jason is being contained and studied at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. He's placed into cryogenic suspension where he remains until 2455, when a group of mostly horny young scientists accidentally release him onto their spaceship following a field trip to the dead planet Earth. As if plain old Jason wasn't bad enough, he gets some badass cyborg upgrades that really do not bode well for our hapless crew. Stream Jason X.\n\nThe boozy chemistry between all-time greats Myrna Loy and William Powell gives The Thin Man the kind of loose energy that makes it not only easy to watch, but a real joy, whether or not you’re paying any attention to the central murder mystery. Nick and Nora are always a good hang. Stream The Thin Man.\n\nA fun, high-concept sci-fi adventure that kicked-off an impressive TV franchise. An archaeologist discovers a portal (a.k.a. stargate) in the Egyptian desert that connects to a distant point in space—one which happens to be the home of ancient Egyptian Gods. James Spader is the linguist called in to help figure things out, while Kurt Russell is the military guy ready to blow things up. On the other side, they meet Jaye Davidson's memorably sexy, though hardly benevolent, Ra. Stream Stargate.\n\nA fictionalized reaction to the 2007 police raids against the Ngāi Tūhoe community in the small town of Rūātoki, this Tubi original is saddled with a generic title that makes it sound disposable (internationally, the title is Muru). A two-day raid costing millions led to few arrests and only a couple of convictions on minor gun charges, all because New Zealand authorities were convinced that Māori were preparing some kind of uprising. Here, Cliff Curtis (Whale Rider) plays local cop Taffy Tāwharau, who becomes caught between following the law and the dictates of his conscience as the danger and violence escalates. Stream The Raid.\n\nNicolas Cage is at his Nic Cage-iest in this H. P. Lovecraft adaptation about a family's descent into madness. A beautiful, horrifying, utterly unique sensory experience. Stream Color Out of Space.\n\nTubi offers up a better assortment of classics than many of the other streamers, most of which have shifted to a newer-is-better focus. Hot stars Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis as a couple of jazz-age musicians who run afoul of a mob boss, deciding to escape by posing as members of an all-female band (one that, memorably, includes Marilyn Monroe). Director Billy Wilder pitches the farce just right, at the intersection between smart and silly. Stream Some Like It Hot.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal stars in this memorable emo mind-bender about a troubled teenager who dodges disaster thanks to a bit of sleepwalking. An instant cult classic, it's the movie all the cool kids were talking about back in the day. Stream Donnie Darko (director's cut), or the theatrical version.\n\nJosh O’Connor (The Crown’s Prince Charles) and Alec Secăreanu play Yorkshire farmer Johnny and Romanian migrant worker Gheorghe. The initially tempestuous relationship that develops really does feel like it’s headed for tragedy (à la Brokeback Mountain), which makes the film’s unexpected turn in the direction of a happier ending particularly thrilling. Stream God's Own Country.\n\nRobert Townsend directs himself as Bobby Taylor, in a satire about the perils of navigating the Hollywood system for an actor simultaneously too Black and not Black enough for the tastes of studio bosses. Through elaborate fantasy sequences and parodies of popular movies, Townsend creates a sharp and often extremely funny sendup that’s (sadly) still relevant. Stream Hollywood Shuffle.\n\nJack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine star in this searing, bittersweet, but ultimately humane comedy. MacLaine's Fran Kubelik is an elevator operator having an affair with the big boss at an insurance company, while Lemmon's Bud Baxter gets ahead by loaning out his apartment to upper management for various extramarital assignations. The budding friendship between the two threatens both of their careers. Stream The Apartment.\n\nPai is a 12-year-old Māori girl and the direct descendant of their tribe’s traditional notable ancestor, the Whale Rider—except that, traditionally, women can’t lead. Star Keisha Castle-Hughes became the youngest nominee for a Best Actress Oscar for her open, genuine performance. Stream Whale Rider.\n\nThis horror comedy with punk style is both a knowing parody of zombie movies while also managing to be an impressively gory thriller in its own right that moves the whole genre forward. Plus, it’s got a great death-rock soundtrack. Stream Return of the Living Dead.\n\nOne of the best anime films of all time, at least when it comes to sci-fi and cyberpunk, Ghost in the Shell boasts impeccable style in addition to the thoughtfulness and complexity of its story. Major Motoko Kusanagi is a cyborg security agent hunting an enigmatic hacker known only as \"the Puppet Master\" in the rapidly approaching year 2029, a time when the rise of AI threatens even the idea of individual existence. Stream Ghost in the Shell.\n\nThe template for a million romantic comedies to come, It Happened One Night, despite appearing during the awkward early years of sound, remains unsurpassed in its charm and sexiness. Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable have terrific chemistry, and their relationship is one of near-equals—something that would grow increasingly rare in the succeeding decades. It’s one of only three films to have won an Academy Award in every major category, and deservedly so. Stream It Happened One Night.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every YouTube User Should Know",
    "description": "There are plenty of hidden tricks to get the most out of YouTube.",
    "fullText": "For all its faults as a platform, YouTube’s video player functionality is easily among the best online. It streams reliably to almost every device you can think of, in your choice of both video quality and playback speed. But it’s the array of hidden features and interface tricks that push it over the edge for me. (Other video players, take note.) Here are 10 of my favorite hacks that make YouTube easier to use.\n\nAlmost every video on YouTube either has an official or auto-generated subtitled track. While these are mainly used for captioning, you can also pull up this transcript on the web and use Ctrl-F (or Cmd-F on Macs) to search for keywords in a video and jump straight to the part you want to see.\n\nThis feature has been around for a while, but YouTube has shuffled around where to find the transcript from time to time. As of this writing, the most reliable way to find it is to open the video’s description, scroll to the bottom, and click Show transcript to open it up in a side bar.\n\nFour hour video essays and ASMR streams can be great background noise to help you fall asleep. However, if you want to avoid getting jolted awake by that one really loud joke you forgot about, you can set a sleep timer to pause any video after a certain amount of time.\n\nOn web or mobile, click the Settings icon on any given video and choose Sleep timer (on mobile, it may be under Settings > More). You can choose a timer ranging from 10 to 60 minutes. You can also automatically pause once the current video is over, which is helpful if you usually have auto-play enabled.\n\nOne of YouTube’s handiest features is the ability to deep-link to a specific second of any video, like I did in the last section. There are several ways to get a precise timestamp link. If you’re on the web, you can right click a video and choose “Copy video URL at current time.” And on mobile, when you click the Share icon, you can tap the toggle next to the timestamp to add the precise link.\n\nIf none of those are options, you can even create your own timestamp link. At the end of any video URL, add “&t=01h05m47s”, replacing the numbers with the specific time you want to link to. You can use any combination of hours, minutes, and seconds to specify the point in the video you want.\n\nMost video players at this point have some kind of “Hang on, what did they just say?” button that lets you skip 5-10 seconds backward or forward. YouTube has several. The most straightforward, on mobile, is the double-tap. Tap twice on the left side of the screen to go backwards 10 seconds, and on the right to go forward. Keep tapping to move forward or back by further increments of 10 seconds.\n\nOn the web, you have even finer grain control. You can use the left and right arrow keys to move 5 seconds back and forth. Alternatively, you can use the J-K-L keys to move in 10 second increments (with K being used to pause the video). This latter method is borrowed from video editors, making it a handy way to keep your muscle memory consistent if you do a lot of editing.\n\nYouTubers love putting walls of text in a single frame of a video that you have to pause to be able to read. On mobile, the only way to read these–or examine any specific frame–is to back up and try to time your pause perfectly. On the web, however, there’s a better way. While paused on a video, you can press the , (comma) or . (period) keys to move back or forward exactly one frame at a time. You can hold these keys down to slowly move through frames as well.\n\nIt’s pretty common knowledge at this point that you can play YouTube videos at 2x (or higher) speed, but what if you only want to rush through a small part of a video, like an ad read? On the mobile version of YouTube, there’s a handy gesture to do just that, without changing your default playback speed.\n\nSimply long-press and hold anywhere on the video while it’s playing. This will temporarily cause the video to play back at 2x speed, until you lift your finger. If you’re already watching at 2x or higher, it won’t play any faster (or slower) than your current speed, though.\n\nYouTube generally does a pretty good job of automatically deciding what video quality to stream at, balancing fidelity with bandwidth demands. You can manually override this on a per-video basis, but on mobile, you have a few more options to get broader control.\n\nIn the YouTube mobile app, head to Settings > Quality. Here, you can set separate quality defaults for video when you’re streaming over mobile networks or wifi, as well as audio quality. The latter is particularly helpful if you use YouTube for listening to music or podcasts. If your wifi is reliably fast, it can be worth it to set higher quality defaults, rather than manually change each video’s resolution whenever you notice the quality looks degraded.\n\nYouTube can get overly eager to show you videos even vaguely similar to one you watched before. If you’d rather not get a feed full of videos on how to fix a door, you can use an incognito tab to browse without contributing to your algorithm’s history. It’s a little tougher on mobile, but fortunately the YouTube app has an option for that.\n\nIn the mobile YouTube app, navigate to the You tab. Along the top of the screen, tap “Turn on incognito.” This will let you search and browse without any algorithmic recommendations or contributing to your history. You can manually turn off incognito mode, or it will automatically turn off after 90 minutes of inactivity. Note, if you’re a YouTube Premium subscriber, none of your benefits will apply while you’re browsing incognito.\n\nIf you forget to turn on incognito mode, you can still remove videos from your browsing history so they won’t muck up your recommendations. To do this, head to your YouTube history on mobile or the web, tap the three-dot menu next to the video in question, and choose “Remove from watch history.”\n\nThis is usually enough to prevent a video from becoming the algorithm’s latest fixation, but it also means you won’t be able to find the video in your history again. If you want provide any kind of direct feedback, like a thumbs down or a report, make sure to do that first. Otherwise, if you navigate to the video again, it will be re-added to your history.\n\nBeyond basic navigation, YouTube on the web has a plethora of helpful keyboard shortcuts that you might never encounter that are worth knowing about. Some of them are pretty niche, but you never know when they can come in handy:\n\nUp and Down arrows: Turn the volume on a video up or down in 5% increments.\n\nShift+> and Shift+<:> Speed up or slow down the current video playback speed</:>\n\nShift+N: Play the next video in your queue or playlist.\n\nShift+P: Play the previous video in your queue or playlist.\n\nCtrl/Cmd+Left or Right arrow keys: Navigate to the next or previous chapter in a video.",

    "description": "Don't trust that strange Google Forms link.",
    "fullText": "If you receive a text from a random number offering you a job, it's almost certainly a scam, and you likely know to ignore and delete the message and move on with your life. But a message from a recruiter with a link to an employment application may give you pause—and fraudsters are hoping that you'll believe it just enough to hand over your personal information. Malwarebytes recently identified a phishing scam that uses fake Google Forms posing as job applications to harvest user account credentials.\n\nThis specific campaign involves a fake Google Forms site that impersonates the real thing. Links sent to scam targets—likely via email or LinkedIn—direct to forms.google.ss-o[.]com, which looks like a subdomain of the legitimate forms.google.com. (It isn't.) The \"ss-o\" may be a trust signal for \"single sign-on\" and fail to raise red flags for many users. Each target receives a personalized URL, which leads to a (fake) Google Form inviting the user to apply for a job.\n\nAs Malwarebytes found, the fake page uses the standard Google Forms colors, header, and disclaimers. The form itself is greyed out behind a pop-up prompting users to \"sign in to continue.\" Again, this doesn't look particularly suspicious for a typical Google flow. But the sign-in button redirects to another domain that has been used in multiple phishing attacks to harvest credentials.\n\nFraudsters have long used Google apps to perpetuate phishing schemes. A 2025 campaign targeting students, faculty, and staff at U.S. colleges and universities used Google Forms that mimicked legitimate school communications to collect login credentials entered directly into the form itself. (Google warns you to never, ever do this.) And numerous attacks on Gmail users have leveraged shared Google Docs to direct victims to a fake sign-in page.\n\nAs always, your first red flag for a scam is a link sent via an unsolicited job offer—even if that link goes to a seemingly legitimate site. Scammers have all kinds of tricks for spoofing URLs and using recognizable domains to gain your trust. Always hover over hyperlinks to see the actual destination before clicking, and look carefully for additions or misspellings in the URL.\n\nPlus, you should probably be wary of any job application submitted via Google Forms. Do your due diligence in speaking with an actual human, and do not send sensitive personal information through Google Forms.\n\nThis is also a good reason to use a password manager, which won't allow you to fill login credentials on a fake site. If your password manager gives you a warning or prevents you from using autofill, don't override it.",

    "description": "From Oscar faves \"Sinners\" and \"One Battle After Another,\" to action fare like \"Superman\" and \"Dead of Winter,\" to fresh horrors (\"Weapons\") and dark thrillers (\"Eddington\").",
    "fullText": "HBO was, for at least a couple of generations, the home of movies on cable—no one else could compete. For a while, it seemed like HBO Max could well be the ultimate streaming destination for movie lovers, but the jury is still out.\n\nEven so, HBO Max maintains a collaboration with TCM, giving it a broad range of classic American and foreign films. It's also the primary streaming home for Studio Ghibli and A24, so even though the streamer hasn't been making as many original films as it did a few years ago, it still has a solid assortment of movies you won't find anywhere else.\n\nHere are 25 of the best of HBO Max's recent and/or exclusive offerings.\n\nPerennial awards-season darling Paul Thomas Anderson is back, the director's dark comedy/action thriller scoring an impressive 13 Oscar nominations. Leo DiCaprio is Bob, a retired and consistently stoned former revolutionary living off the grid with his daughter, Charlene. It's all going—well, pretty terribly, actually—when the shoe drops and Sean Penn's Col. Steven J. Lockjaw (Sean Penn) shows up. Charlene's mom humiliated him when their group liberated an immigrant mass detention center, and the corrupt and generally nuts officer has been hunting members ever since. Teyana Taylor, Benicio Del Toro, and Leo all earned acting nominations. Stream One Battle After Another.\n\nRose Byrne earned a Best Actress nomination here playing Linda, a woman who is going through it. With a tone that's nearly that of a darkly comedic fever dream, Linda is raising a daughter with a rare disorder requiring nearly around-the-clock care while dealing with extremely dramatic and demanding clients in her day job as a psychotherapist. That's all before when her apartment floods, forcing her and her daughter into a cheap hotel while her husband remains wildly unsupportive. Think Beau is Afraid, but with a working mom. Stream If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.\n\nRyan Coogler's dusty, sweaty supernatural horror movie became the year's crossover hit, defying expectations for an R-rated horror movie—particularly when that movie is also a Depression-era period drama with an almost entirely Black cast. Michael B. Jordan plays a dual role as Smoke and Stack Moore, returning to rural Mississippi after having made names for themselves in Chicago. They intend to open a juke joint with some help from their cousin Sammie (Miles Caton), an up-and-coming blues singer whose music has the power to bust down barriers—between the local Black and immigrant communities, and between our world and a darker one. Beautifully unclassifiable, and an increasingly rare example of a major studio movie with an original concept—it's already one of the year's best. Stream Sinners.\n\nLove him or hate him (and, let's be honest, there are at least as many in the latter camp as the former these days), there's no question that Chevy Chase had an outsized impact on American comedy in the late 1970s and early '80s. Filmmaker Marina Zenovich explores that career in this documentary, Chase here himself to offer up commentary on his career and current life. It's neither hagiography nor hit piece, but the subject himself is fascinating (which is often here another way of saying: kind of a jerk). While looking back, the movie hunts for the bits of humanity within a subject who seems absolutely determined to come off like a giant asshole—your take on that, the extent to which he's a broken genius, a self-satisfied has-been, or something more complicated entirely, may well serve as a kind of Rorschach test. Stream I'm Chevy Chase and You're Not.\n\nDavid Corenswet dons the cape in this James Gunn-led reboot that brings a light touch back to the DC movie universe. While the plot turns on Superman's dive into international power politics and unexpected betrayals, the pulpy also brings us old-school robots, flying cars, and a thoroughly ill-behaved superdog. Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane is as tough as she is big-hearted, Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor is a perfectly punchable billionaire, and Edi Gathegi steals every scene as Mister Terrific. It's a ton of fun, which is a nice change of pace after a decade of far more dour Superman flicks. Stream Superman.\n\nAri Aster, who brought us such divisive \"delights\" as Hereditary, Midsommar, and Beau is Afraid, is back with a new film which has, surprise!, divided both audiences and critics. Aster takes us back to 2020, to the New Mexico town of the title. Eddington mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal) institute a COVID-19-related mask mandate that divides the town and puts him at odds with the local sheriff, Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix). Also in the mix are the sheriff's volatile wife (Emma Stone) and conspiracy-loving mother-in-law, as well a cult leader, various social-justice warriors, and a couple of terrorists. The questions the film grapples with are less about who's right and who's wrong, and more about whether any of us can accomplish anything good given the chaos, confusion, and division that has become the normal way of doing things in modern America. Stream Eddington.\n\nBetween this and the series Down Cemetery Road, Emma Thompson may well be entering her Liam Neeson-esque action star era—and I am 100% here for it. Here she plays Barb, a widow traveling to the site of her first date with her late husband, where she'll scatter his ashes (the northern Minnesota setting, equally ominous and polite, can't help but evoke a bit of that Fargo feeling). Stopping at a cabin for directions, she encounters a shifty guy and some blood in the snow, which seems like it might be from a deer, until she sees a bound woman that she definitely was not meant to see. Barb is extremely capable, we discover and, unlike many of our male action heroes, she has a big heart—her compassion only making her that much more formidable when she sets out to help. Judy Greer also stars. Stream Dead of Winter.\n\nThough this Oscar-nominated documentary started out as a film about prison religious revival, filmmakers Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman were approached quietly approached by inmates with inside information about failures within the complex (not the American prison system, surely?). They spent the subsequent six years documenting abuse and even murder within Alabama prisons, always from the perspective of the incarcerated individuals, and subsequently documenting the resulting movement for change. Stream The Alabama Solution.\n\nBenny Safdie (Uncut Gems) wrote and directed this genre-defying sports biopic, depicting the rise of real-life MMA star Mark Kerr, played by Dwayne Johnson under plenty of makeup, along with the rise of the sport itself. The movie's unconventional structure, at least for a sports movie, has divided audiences—even if critics have been more positive. Dodging and weaving cliches, the movie focuses more on the central relationship between Kerr and his troubled girlfriend Dawn Staples (Emily Blunt), with Johnson and Blunt both offering up impressively grounded performances. Stream The Smashing Machine.\n\nPatrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are back as paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. In the 1980s, they're investigating a cursed mirror that has ties to one of their first cases from 1964; that demon-possessed home furnishing threatens our heroes alongside their now-grown daughter. There aren't a ton of surprises but still a bit of spooky fun in this, the \"last\" Conjuring film (until the already-announced next one). Bonus points for casting actual actors (Orion Smith and Madison Lawlor) as young Ed and Lorraine, rather than doing the creepy CGI de-aging that other franchises have toyed with. Stream Conjuring: Last Rites.\n\nPlaywright and filmmaker Celine Song follows up the acclaimed Past Lives with this rom-com (-ish) love triangle involving matchmaker Lucy (Dakota Fanning), actor/cater-waiter John (Chris Evans), and millionaire Harry (Pedro Pascal). Like Past Lives, the deliberate pacing and subdued tone might put off viewers looking for something brighter and bubblier, but a bit of patience will be rewarded if you can settle in for a mature and thoughtful story of complicated lives and tentative relationships. Stream Materialists.\n\nThe latest from Bong Joon Ho (Parasite, Snowpiercer), Mickey 17 didn't do terribly well at the box office, but that's not entirely the movie's fault. It's a broad but clever and timely satire starring Robert Pattinson as Mickey Barnes, a well-meaning dimwit who signs on with a spaceship crew on its way to colonize the ice world Niflheim. Because of his general lack of skills, he's deemed an Expendable—his memories and DNA are kept on file so that when he, inevitably, dies (often in horrific ways), he'll be reprinted and restored to live and work and die again. Things get complicated when a new Mickey is accidentally printed before the old one has died—a huge taboo among religious types who can handle one body/one soul, but panic at the implications of two identical people walking around. It's also confusing, and eventually intriguing, for Mickey's girlfriend, Nasha (Naomi Ackie). Soon, both Mickey's are on the run from pretty much everyone, including the new colony's MAGA-esque leader (Mark Ruffalo). Stream Mickey 17.\n\nAre we a little exhausted with all the nostalgic legacy sequels? We are. Does that mean there aren't some pretty damn good examples of the form floating around out there? It does not. Bloodlines picks up the franchise last seen in 2009 with an appropriately lean, mean, and bloody sequel that doesn't reinvent the Final Destination wheel, but that does everything these movies are supposed to do, and better than most. The opening sequence alone, set in 1969 at a high-rise restaurant tower, is a series best, rivaling even the log truck of part two for white-knuckle ingenuity. The movie also bids a lovely, spooky farewell to William Bludworth, played for the last time by the late, great Tony Todd. Stream Final Destination Bloodlines.\n\nPaul Reubens participated in dozens of hours worth of interviews for this two-part documentary, directed by filmmaker Matt Worth, but from the opening moments, the erstwhile Pee-Wee Herman makes clear that he is struggling with the notion of giving up control of his life story to someone else. That's a through line in the film and, as we learn, in the performer's life, as he spent decades struggling with his public profile while maintaining intense privacy in his personal life. Reubens' posthumous coming out as gay is the headline story, but the whole thing provides a fascinating look at an artist who it seems we barely knew. Stream Pee-Wee as Himself.\n\nIn an age of encroaching AI, it's always encouraging to find that there are filmmakers still doing things the old-fashioned way—even more so with Ochi, which mostly forgoes even CGI in favor of actual puppetry and animatronics for anything other than wide shots. There's nothing inherently wrong with digital imagery, but our brains still kinda know when something has weight and presence in the real world, and the work that went into this fantasy pays off beautifully. Helena Zengel plays Yuri, a young girl growing up on the remote island of Carpathia. Her father, Maxim (Willem Dafoe) leads teams of (mostly) boy soldiers to hunt the island's wild Ochi—vaguely simian creatures that they've been trained to fear. Yuri discovers an injured infant Ochi and, rather than kill or capture it, she sets out to return it to its family. A rare family film from A24. Stream The Legend of Ochi.\n\nBrady Corbet's epic period drama, which earned 10 Oscar nominations and won Adrian Brody his second Academy Award for Best Actor, follows László Tóth (Adrien Brody), a Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor who emigrates to the United States following the war. His course as a refugee follows highs and devastating lows—he's barely able to find work at first, despite his past as an accomplished Bauhaus-trained architect in Europe. A wealthy benefactor (Guy Pearce) seems like a godsend when he offers László a high-profile project, but discovers the limitations of his talent in the face of American-style antisemitism and boorishness. Stream The Brutalist.\n\nNicole Kidman stars in this modern erotic thriller as CEO Romy Mathis, who begins a dangerous (i.e. naughty) affair with her much younger intern (Harris Dickinson). After an opening scene involving some deeply unfulfilling lovemaking with her spouse (we'll have to suspend disbelief on the topic of Antonio Banderas as a schlubby, sexually disappointing husband), Romy runs into Samuel (Dickinson), who saves her from a runaway dog before taking her on as his mentor at work. She teaches him about process automation while he teaches her about BDSM, but his sexy, dorky charm soon gives way to something darker. For all the online chatter (Nicole Kidman on all fours lapping up milk!), the captivating performances and the chilly direction from Halina Reijn elevate it above more prurient erotic thrillers. Stream Babygirl.\n\nPaul Rudd and Jenna Ortega, playing father and daughter Elliot and Ridley, accidentally kill a unicorn whose parents go on a blood-soaked rampage by way of avenging their offspring. And if that isn't the platonic ideal of a plot for an A24 horror movie, I don't know what is. There are some themes here about class and the dangers of big pharma that don't entirely work, but there's still a well-acted family drama here with plenty of unicorn action—so it's certainly unique. Stream Death of a Unicorn.\n\nA fun and wildly successful (third-highest grossing movie of the year, so far) live-action take on the popular sandbox video game, Minecraft stars Jack Black as Steve, a doorknob salesman who first discovers the Overworld, a world of easy-to-manipulate cubes (a la the game), and then is kidnapped and taken to the hellish Nether. Following in his wake are four normal people: Garrett “The Garbage Man” (Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers), and Dawn (Danielle Brooks) who are pulled into the Overworld and have to learn to work together to master the rules of the game/world. The mythology is surprisingly complicated, but the leads have great chemistry, which is where the movie's charm lies. Stream A Minecraft Movie.\n\nIf you saw Danny and Michael Philippou's previous feature, Talk to Me, then you have some idea what you're in for here, though this one goes even deeper and darker. Siblings Andy (Billy Barratt) and Piper (Sora Wong) discover their father dead on the floor in the shower; Andy is almost 18, a difficult age for foster care, but he begs to stay with his sister until he can formally take custody. The two are placed with former social worker Laura (Sally Hawkins), who is herself recovering from the tragic death of her daughter, and whose son is clearly struggling. Things get strange (and terrifying) very quickly as one of these grieving souls attempts to, well, consider the title. This is a horror film that speaks to the shattering power of grief. Stream Bring Her Back.\n\nInspired by Chris Marker's 1962 featurette La Jetée, which itself inspired the feature 12 Monkeys, docudrama 2073 considers the state of our world in the present through the framing device of a woman (Samantha Morton) gazing back from the titular year and meditating on the road that led to an apocalypse of sorts. Her reverie considers, via real-life, current news footage, the rise of modern popular authoritarianism in the modes of Orbán, Trump, Putin, Modi, and Xi, and their alignment with tech bros in such a way as to accelerate a coming climate catastrophe. It's not terribly subtle, but neither is the daily news. Stream 2073.\n\nOne night, 17 kids get out of their beds at exactly 2:17 a.m. and run off down the street with their arms held out in a bizarre manner, never to be seen again. That's the unsettling start to writer/director Zach Cregger's followup to the similarly batshit Barbarian. In school the next day, only one kid remains in the class of teacher Justine Gandy (Julia Garner), and the town soon comes to wonder what she could have had to do with the disappearances, and what's different about the remaining child. Everyone, it seems, has a story and a secret to hide, and there are no easy answers to what happened. It's a truly wild ride that introduces a new horror icon: Amy Madigan's Aunt Gladys. Stream Weapons.\n\nMixed reviews for this thriller from debut director Mark Anthony Green, but a stellar cast (lead by Ayo Edebiri and John Malkovich) and plenty of outright weirdness lend the movie some spooky watchability. Edebiri plays rookie journalist Ariel Ecton, on assignment with her boss (Murray Bartlett) to cover the forthcoming return of a '90s rock icon (Malkovich). Ariel is meant to be, largely, a note-taker, but she's the first one to see through the glitz and glamour of this king of rock and roll and understand that there's more to the bizarre goings-on at his compound than mere eccentricity. Stream Opus.\n\nDirector Luca Guadagnino followed up his vaguely bisexual tennis movie Challengers with this less-subtle William S. Burroughs adaptation. Daniel Craig plays William Lee (a fictionalized version of Burroughs himself), a drug-addicted American expat living in Mexico City during the 1950s. He soon becomes infatuated with Drew Starkey's Eugene Allerton, and the two take a gorgeous journey through Mexico, through ayahuasca, and through their own sexualities. Stream Queer.\n\nRohan (Nik Dodani) and Josh (Brandon Flynn) invite both their sets of parents to a remote country rental so that everyone can meet, which sounds like plenty of horror for this horror-comedy. But wait! There's more: A demon conjured from the wifi router enters the body of Rohan's dad (Brian Cox), an event further complicated by the arrival of the house's owner (Parker Posey). It's wildly uneven but a lot of fun. The supporting cast includes Edie Falco, Lisa Kudrow, and Dean Norris. Stream The Parenting.\n\nAn anime-infused take on Tolkien's world, The War of the Rohirrim boats the return of co-writer Philippa Boyens, who helped to write each of the six previous LOTR movies. In this animated installment, we're taken back 200 years before Peter Jackson's films, to when the king of Rohan (Brian Cox) accidentally kills the leader of the neighboring Dunlendings during marriage negotiations, kicking off a full-scale war. Miranda Otto reprises her role of Éowyn, who narrates. Stream War of the Rohirrim.",

    "title": "All the Ways You Can Customize Notifications on Android Auto",
    "description": "Google has tweaked the way Android Auto and Do Not Disturb work together.",
    "fullText": "If you're an Android Auto user, you may already know that setting up phone notifications while you're driving isn't as straightforward as it could be—though Google has recently made a settings tweak that should simplify things. On the one hand, you don't want to miss important messages or calls, but on the other you definitely don't want to put yourself and other road users at risk by getting distracted while driving. A careful balance is needed, and it's important to know what options are available on your phone.\n\nIf you're a Pixel user, Do Not Disturb is handled by Modes, which you can find by tapping Modes in Settings. Pick Driving, and if you enable the While driving toggle switch, this mode is automatically enabled when you're in your car.\n\nTap the While driving text (not the toggle switch), and you can tell Android how it should determine whether or not you're driving. This is the setting that Google recently tweaked: You can now choose Use Bluetooth (so the mode is enabled when a car dashboard is detected), or Use motion and Bluetooth (which also takes readings from your phone's accelerometer into consideration). Previously, you had to rely solely on motion, which led to problems with automatic activation for both drivers and passengers—the addition of Bluetooth should mean a more reliable experience.\n\nIt's slightly different on Samsung Galaxy phones: You need to tap Modes and Routines from Settings, then you can access the Driving mode. Here, you can specifically set a connection to an Android Auto dashboard as the trigger for enabling the mode, rather than just any Bluetooth device—something Google should really add to standard Android.\n\nOn both Pixel and Galaxy phones, you can tweak the driving mode to allow notifications from certain apps or from certain people, but again be wary of making your vehicle too distracting with pop-ups and pings.\n\nAs well as setting which apps and contacts can trigger phone notifications while you're driving, you can customize these modes further. From the Driving mode screen on a Pixel, tap Display settings to control whether or not the phone lights up when you get a notification. You can also dim the wallpaper, and switch to a grayscale look.\n\nWhen you're editing your Driving mode on a Galaxy phone, you'll see you can tap either Lock screen or Home screen to change the wallpaper and color palette specifically for this mode. Again, the idea is that your phone is a little less distracting visually.\n\nThere are more notification options on the main Android Auto settings page: From Android Settings, tap Connected devices > Connection preferences > Android Auto (Pixel) or Connected devices > Android Auto (Galaxy).\n\nUnder the Messaging header, you can turn off alerts for group conversations, or for messaging apps entirely. There's also a toggle switch here for showing or hiding the first line of the incoming message—you probably want to disable this if you want to spend more time with your eyes on the road.\n\nFinally, there's the option for having your incoming messages read out loud to you, which is another way you can reduce the temptation to stare at your vehicle's dashboard for an extended period of time, or to pick up and unlock your phone.\n\nIt's worth reviewing all the other Android Auto settings here as well, to make sure your driving experience is set up exactly the way you want: You can reduce the number of apps available in Android Auto, for example, and enable taskbar widgets for easier app control, which can also make a difference to how distracted you are on the road.\n\nYou should end up with an Android Auto notification system that's not going to overwhelm you with alerts while you're driving, but which also won't hide important messages from you by automatically enabling notification filters without you being aware.",

    "title": "Not California, Not Florida: This State Has The Deadliest 10-Mile Stretch In The US",
    "description": "The U.S. has its fair share of deadly roads, but this 10-mile stretch has seen more fatalities than even the most dangerous roads in Florida and California.",
    "fullText": "The United States is chock full of dangerous highways and scary roads with macabre names like Dead Man's Curve, Tail of the Dragon, Shades of Death Road, and Blood Alley. Any one of these roads might be a good candidate for the deadliest 10-mile stretch in the United States. Yet, none of them are. In fact, that distinction belongs to a much longer stretch of highway with a reputation for being a so-called death trap.\n\nIt's not that these roads aren't deadly, mind you: Dead Man's Curve is two miles of the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, where at least 60 people died between 2010 and 2024. Tail of the Dragon is an 11-mile section of U.S. 129 with 318 curves that runs along the border of North Carolina and Tennessee. Labeled as the scariest drive in America, it killed five people and injured another 47 in 2024. A one-mile stretch of I-95 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida (dubbed \"Cocaine Lane\") has a fatal crash rate 50 times that of the average highway mile. Twenty-four people died there between 2000 and 2019, earning it the title of the single deadliest mile in the entire country.\n\nHowever, according to the personal injury lawyers at Elk & Elk, the deadliest 10-mile stretch in the U.S. is on I-45 between exits 49B and 60A, which cuts straight through the heart of Houston, Texas. In 2023, Elk & Elk teamed up with data visualization agency 1Point21 Interactive to analyze 20 years' worth of data from across the country. They found this particular segment of I-45 had 7.7 fatal crashes per year up to that point, with the worst being 15 fatalities in 2006.\n\nThe Elk and Elk study found that seven of the 10 deadliest 10-mile segments were in Texas (five in Dallas alone), while the other three were in Florida. Over 1,000 deaths occurred across the 20 years that the study analyzed, and the 10-mile stretch of I-45 between exits 49B and 60A in Houston saw 142 crashes and 148 deaths during that period.\n\nU.S. Interstate 45 starts in Dallas, runs through Houston, and ends in Galveston, covering around 286 miles. A 2023 study by insurance agency Budget Direct found that the highway had 56.5 fatal accidents per 100 miles. As far as the 10-mile stretch goes, there were 73 deaths on it in 2019, according to KHOU, while the Texas Department of Transportation (via KPRC 2) claimed that another 105 people died there in 2023. The stretch of this road running south out of Houston to Galveston also has a far more sinister aspect, with more than 30 women (most between the ages of 10 and 25) mysteriously vanishing in the area since the 1970s. This has given rise to nicknames such as \"America's Highway to Hell\" and \"The Killing Fields.\"\n\nKnowing full well how bad this all looks, Houston has been trying to fix the 50-plus-year-old highway via the North Houston Highway Improvement Project (NHHIP), an estimated $9 billion project that started in 2002. It will (among other things) expand express-lane capacity, reroute it closer to downtown, and accommodate high-occupancy, electric, and self-driving vehicles, all in an effort to decrease traffic congestion. However, the project is only expected to finish in 2038.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "title": "10 Hacks Every PS5 Gamer Should Know",
    "description": "How to mute the PS5 beep on startup, get help with your games, disable the trigger haptics, and more.",
    "fullText": "Sony’s PlayStation 5 is a powerful machine, but if you just plugged it right into your TV and never bothered to go into the settings, there’s a chance you’re not seeing its full potential. From enabling 120 fps gameplay to customizing your Welcome hub, there’s a lot you can do with the PS5, if you’re willing to tinker a little bit. Here are the 10 best tips and tricks to getting the most out of Sony’s current gaming console.\n\nJust because you bought a fancy new PS5 doesn’t automatically mean you’re getting the best performance out of it possible. If you have a 4K TV or a monitor that can support a 120Hz refresh rate or above, you’ll want to double check your video output settings to ensure your console is taking advantage of it.\n\nFirst, before even turning on your device, make sure it’s connected via an HDMI 2.1 cable. This is necessary for frame rates above 60 at 4K. Your PS5 should have come with one, and you’ll know if it’s the right one if it has a boxy rectangle on either side of the cable. Also ensure that you’re plugging your cable into a port that can accept HDMI 2.1, which will look different based on your screen. On my LG C1 TV, this port says “4K @ 120Hz” above it.\n\nNext, while your console may detect what your screen can handle and adjust its settings accordingly, head to Settings > Screen and Video to manually check them and make some adjustments that need some human fine tuning. I like to leave most of the settings on this page to Automatic to allow the PS5 to pick the best choices for the wide variety of content it can play, but you can select any of the settings on this page to see your options and force an output. If you don’t see 4K (labeled as 2160p) or 120Hz as options here, this is your sign you might need to swap your HDMI cable.\n\nTo see what settings your PS5 is using at any particular moment, select “Current Video Output Signal” at the top of this page to check your work. While I mostly like to rely on the PS5’s Automatic settings, one specific change you might want to make would be applying VRR to unsupported games, which could improve fidelity at the cost of introducing instability. If you scroll down far enough on this page, you can also adjust when your console displays HDR, and go through an HDR setup wizard by selecting “Adjust HDR.”\n\nYou can also customize your console’s display area by selecting Screen from the sidebar on the left, which is handy if your display has an unusual aspect ratio. While you’re here, you can adjust how long you need to be away from your controller before the console dims your screen.\n\nFinally, if you have a PS5 Pro, you can up the graphics quality on some supported PS4 games. This is under Settings > Screen and Video > Video Output > Enhance Image Quality for PS4 games.\n\nLet’s say you’re having trouble sleeping, and instead of rolling around in bed, you decide to sneak out to the PS5 for a secret gaming session. Except, uh-oh, the nasty beep that the console plays at startup alerts your partner, and now you have some explaining to do. To keep this from happening, let’s turn off that beep ahead of time.\n\nUnder Settings > System > Beep and Light, toggle on Mute Beep Sound to get rid of the sound your PS5 plays at startup. Or, if you just want to make it quieter, you can do that under Volume.\n\nWhile you’re here, you can also customize how bright the LED strip on the front of the console gets, under Power indicator > Brightness. Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to turn it off entirely.\n\nSee all those widgets at the bottom of the Welcome Hub when you turn your PS5 on? Did you know that you can actually customize them? It’s especially handy if you’re like me and can’t stand seeing what are essentially ads taking up more than half of your display.\n\nTo adjust your PS5 Welcome Hub widgets, simply press X while hovering over the Welcome Hub tile, then navigate to the controls in the top-right corner. Here, you can select Presets to choose from various options set up by Sony, or select Edit Widgets to toggle specific widgets on and off. Personally, I disabled the News, PlayStation Plus, Wishlist, and PlayStation Store widgets, since they’re pretty much only there to sell you things.\n\nOnce you’re done selecting the widgets you want to see, before leaving Welcome Hub setup, navigate to the Settings cog and choose if you want to enable the carousel-like Large Layout, where you want notifications (Temporary Widgets) to show up, and if you want your widgets to match your broader System Appearance settings (more on that later). If you have the News widget active, you can also customize which games show news here.\n\nFinally, to the left of the Settings cog, you can choose a background for the Welcome Hub, picking from options either prepared by Sony, bundled with certain games you own, or pulled from your Media Gallery.\n\nYour PS5 can do more than basic stereo sound, even if you don’t own a physical surround sound setup. That’s thanks to the power of various virtual surround sound codecs, which come baked into the console. To turn these on, head over to Settings > Sound > Audio Output > Audio Format (Priority). Here, you can choose between Linear PCM, Dolby Atmos, Dolby Audio, and DTS. Not all of these options support virtual surround sound, and I’ll admit I’m not enough of an audiophile to know the best one for every setup, but because it supports height data, Dolby Atmos has been the most versatile pick for my soundbar.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use Sony’s own 3D Audio technology by selecting 3D Audio (TV) or 3D Audio (Headphones) from the sidebar. Personally, I haven’t found the results here to be as rich as Dolby Atmos, but that makes sense. These are built for gamers using TV speakers or headphones, so they aren’t the best option if you’ve got a soundbar or external speaker setup. Still, they’re worth trying out if you listen over your TV’s internal speakers or via a headset. Note that only Sony’s own headsets will connect to the console wirelessly by themselves, but there are ways around that, which my colleague Jake Peterson has written about here.\n\nSony’s so proud of the rumble and haptics in the PS5 controller that it updated its classic DualShock branding to DualSense alongside the controller’s launch. But weirdly, the haptics aren’t as strong as they could be out of the box. That’s because the PS5 controller has a microphone built-in, and Sony has intentionally weakened its haptics to prevent interference from being picked up on the mic.\n\nIf you’re like me, and you barely use the microphone in your controller, there are two ways to fix that. The first is more temporary, and simply involves pressing the clear button above the microphone icon on your controller to mute it, which will strengthen the haptics until you turn it back on. It’ll also display an orange light while the mic is off.\n\nThe second doesn’t require you to manually flip your mic on and off, and will get rid of that orange light. You can enable it by toggling on Mute under Settings > Sound > Microphone > Microphone Status When Logged In, but know that you’ll need to toggle this back to On if you need to use the microphone again.\n\nSony might be proud of the haptics in its brand new controller, but personally, I think they’re a little bit too strong, especially when it comes to the triggers. With the PS5, Sony introduced its new adaptive triggers, which add resistance to trigger pulls in certain games for heightened realism. But while having the controller fight back against you the first time you try to tighten a bowstring in a Horizon game might be a fun novelty, it gets tiring pretty quick.\n\nLuckily, you can customize this, as well as fine tune any of the other haptics. Under Settings > Accessories > Controller (General), select Trigger Effect Intensity to choose how strong the adaptive trigger resistance should be, and select Vibration Intensity to set the strength for more general rumble. Personally, I have Vibration Intensity set to Strong, and Trigger Effect Intensity turned off.\n\nThe PS5 comes with a good amount of storage by default, and while amounts differ depending on your model, it’s usually enough for five to seven AAA games. But if you want more storage, you can actually install a supported M.2 SSD into your PS5 without much hassle. Sony has exact installation instructions here, plus a guide on determining if an SSD is supported. While specific steps will vary depending on your PS5 model and which SSD you get, you generally only need a screwdriver to complete installation. Even better? The new SSD won’t replace your existing internal storage, so you can use them in tandem.\n\nTo install games to your SSD once it’s installed, you’ll first need to change your Installation Location to M.2 SSD under Settings > Storage. Then, simply install a game as usual. If you want to move games that are already installed on your PS5’s internal storage to your SSD, head to your Game Library, highlight the games you want to move, press the Options button, and select Move Games and Apps. If you’re also using expanded USB storage, select Movable to M.2 SSD Storage after this step.\n\nSpeaking of USB storage, the PS5 also supports external USB drives. You can see requirements here—not every device is guaranteed to work. Also note that while you can play PS4 games directly off USB storage, PS5 games need to be installed to an SSD to work. However, you can keep a PS5 game offloaded to USB storage and then load it onto either your console’s SSD or your custom M.2 SSD when you’re ready to play, bypassing the need for a download.\n\nThe first thing I do whenever I boot up a new game isn’t start my adventure, but dive deep into the settings to see what I can customize. It’s not the best first impression, but there’s usually a switch I can flip that will make the game play much better for me, especially if it ups the frame rate. Luckily, Sony’s aware of this optimization sickness I suffer from, and is doing its best to help.\n\nUnder Settings > Saved Data and Game/App Settings > Game Presets, you can set a number of preferences for how your games should play ahead of time, and your PS5 will automatically configure them for you when you boot up a supported game. It’s not a fully robust selection, since Sony can’t predict every game’s needs, but you can choose a preferred difficulty here, whether the game should be played in first-person or third-person (if both are available), which language you’d like to play in, whether subtitles should be turned on, your online multiplayer permissions, and most crucially for me, whether your games prefer Performance Mode or Quality Mode (called Resolution Mode here). Finally, I can set my PS5 games to default to smooth performance over the prettiest visuals.\n\nLet’s say you’re struggling in a game, but you don’t want to bother to pull up an internet browser and look up a walkthrough. This is where the PS5’s Game Help feature comes in. It’s not available for every game, but if you’re stuck, it’s worth looking for. Just press the PlayStation logo button on your controller, and if it’s there, select the Game Help card. From here, your PS5 will suggest hints towards specific goals based on where you are in your game, and might even show you videos from other players. It’ll also warn you if you’re about to see spoilers, so you can back out before looking at a hint.\n\nIt’s fairly self explanatory, and while the hints aren’t always detailed enough for my needs, I do appreciate that Game Help also estimates how long it’ll take you to complete certain goals, as well as show you your progress towards them. As a busy 30-something, it’s a great way to know how long my play sessions might be ahead of time.\n\nAs for where Game Help gets its gameplay videos, it’s from players who’ve opted in to share them. To start sending videos to Game Help, head to Settings > Captures and Broadcasts > Auto-captures > Community Game Help. Select On next to Participate, and Sony may occasionally look at your gameplay and upload select sections from it to its servers to serve as a guide towards other players. Voice or party chat audio won’t be recorded and uploaded videos won’t take up space on your console, but depending on the game, usernames or text-based chat messages shown in gameplay footage might be shared.\n\nFinally, this one’s just for fun. Back in 2024, Sony introduced themes to the PS5 home screen that mimicked the look of the PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4. These left the system shortly afterwards, but came back for good in April of last year. To try them out, head to Settings > System > Appearance > Appearance and Sound and choose a console you’d like to mimic. Personally, I like the PS2 theme, but I’ve gone for the PS3 look for now, because my husband has a lot of fondness for that console’s XMB menu. Now, if only Sony would add even more themes to the list. Maybe an Astro Bot look?",

    "description": "The Supreme Court faced criticism from President Donald Trump after striking his tariff agenda this week, as the president looks towards an upcoming ruling.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump lashed out at the Supreme Court for striking most of his tariff agenda this week, going on to warn that a similar ruling against his birthright citizenship order would be a benefit to China.\n\nTrump made the statement in a post to his Truth Social account on Monday, clarifying that he was not frustrated with the \"Great Three,\" or the justices who sided with his administration in the tariff ruling. The Supreme Court is set to consider Trump's executive order banning birthright citizenship in the coming months.\n\n\"The supreme court (will be using lower case letters for a while based on a complete lack of respect!) of the United States accidentally and unwittingly gave me, as President of the United States, far more powers and strength than I had prior to their ridiculous, dumb, and very internationally divisive ruling,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Our incompetent supreme court did a great job for the wrong people, and for that they should be ashamed of themselves (but not the Great Three!). The next thing you know they will rule in favor of China and others, who are making an absolute fortune on Birthright Citizenship, by saying the 14th Amendment was NOT written to take care of the 'babies of slaves,' which it was as proven by the EXACT TIMING of its construction, filing, and ratification, which perfectly coincided with the END OF THE CIVIL WAR,\" Trump continued.\n\nTrump Reveals His 'New Hero' Supreme Court Justice After Tariffs Ruling\n\n\"How much better can you do than that? But this supreme court will find a way to come to the wrong conclusion, one that again will make China, and various other Nations, happy and rich. Let our supreme court keep making decisions that are so bad and deleterious to the future of our Nation - I have a job to do,\" he added.\n\nTrump signed his birthright citizenship order on his first day back in office last year. The order seeks to end birthright citizenship for nearly all persons born in the U.S. to undocumented parents, or parents with lawful temporary status in the country — a seismic shift that critics note would break with some 150 years of legal precedent.\n\nTrump's order would reinterpret the 14th Amendment, which states, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside\" — a provision that administration officials argue has been misinterpreted.\n\nTrump's Tariff Revenues Hit Record Highs As Supreme Court Deals Major Blow\n\nThe language put forth by the Trump administration seeks to clarify that individuals born to illegal immigrant parents, or those who were here legally but on temporary non-immigrant visas, are not citizens by birthright.\n\nA Supreme Court ruling on the issue could have sweeping national implications for an issue Trump officials argue is a crucial component of his hard-line immigration agenda, which has become a defining feature of his second White House term.\n\nMeanwhile, opponents argue that the effort is an unconstitutional and \"unprecedented\" effort that would threaten some 150,000 children in the U.S. born annually to parents of non-citizens, and an estimated 4.4 million American-born children under 18 who are living with an illegal immigrant parent, according to data from the Pew Research Center.\n\nFox News' Breanne Deppisch contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every WhatsApp User Should Know",
    "description": "Boost your privacy with a few quick steps.",
    "fullText": "WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in most parts of the world, and in my decade or so of using it, I've learned a few important tips that make it a much more convenient and secure experience. I use the following WhatsApp hacks to keep my account safe, stop the app from overloading my notifications and storage, and save myself a lot of time. If you're like me, and your entire social circle is on WhatsApp, then you're absolutely going to need tips like these to stop from feeling overwhelmed.\n\nWhatsApp has end-to-end encryption, which means that the company itself cannot read the contents of your messages, but that doesn't stop recipients from easily exporting your conversations. If you don't want anyone to export your message history, make sure to enable Advanced Chat Privacy in WhatsApp. This feature needs to be enabled individually for each chat (including group chats).\n\nWith Advanced Chat Privacy enabled, photos won't be automatically saved to recipients' phones, AI features will be disabled, and no one will be able to export that chat's history to their devices. Note that people can still forward your messages and take screenshots or screen recordings of them, but every little bit helps. You can enable Advanced Chat Privacy by opening any chat in WhatsApp, tapping the name of the contact or group, and going to Advanced Chat Privacy.\n\nEveryone knows that you can put an app lock on WhatsApp, which means that you'll need a passcode (or biometric authentication) to view your messages whenever you open the app. A lesser known feature is that you can lock individual chats, too. This allows you to put chats with certain people or groups into a hidden folder. These hidden chats won't show up in your list of WhatsApp conversations and can only be found by searching for the name of the contact or group. Even if someone else gains access to your WhatsApp, they also won't be able to open these chats without an additional passcode or biometric authentication.\n\nTo use this, open any chat in WhatsApp, tap the name of the contact or group, and enable Lock chat.\n\nThere are a few easy steps you can take in the WhatsApp settings to reduce the chances of unauthorized access to your WhatsApp account. Get started by going to WhatsApp Settings > Account. First, tap on Two-step verification and enable it. WhatsApp will ask you to create a 6-digit PIN, and the next time you log in to the app on a different device, you'll be prompted to enter this PIN in addition to your other credentials.\n\nWhen you set up two-step verification, the app will also ask you to add an email address to help recover the PIN in case you forget it. Once you've done that, feel free to add a passkey via the same account settings page, if you wish. The final step in securing your WhatsApp account involves locking your SIM card. Go to your phone's cellular service settings and set up a SIM PIN there. This locks your SIM card or eSIM, and means that if someone tries to add your number to another device, they'll need this PIN to get in. Since WhatsApp requires your phone number for activation, this step could prevent unauthorized access to your account.\n\nOptionally, you can also add a password to your WhatsApp backups. Go to WhatsApp Settings > Chats > Chat backup > End-to-end encryption. You can either set up a passkey or a password to encrypt your backups. No one will be able to access your WhatsApp backups without this password, which will help keep your extra copies of important messages secure.\n\nAs a heavy WhatsApp user, one of the biggest annoyances I used to face was people adding me to WhatsApp groups without my permission. I wasn't too bothered when my friends did this, but eventually I started getting added to random spam groups by strangers, which is when I decided to put an end to it. You can keep strangers from adding you to WhatsApp groups by going to WhatsApp Settings > Privacy > Groups and selecting My contacts. This allows only saved contacts to add you to groups. Feel free to choose My contacts except… if you want to block specific people from adding you to groups.\n\nIf you like sending voice notes on WhatsApp, then I've got a few quick tips for you that will make your life easier. You might know that you can open any chat and hold the microphone icon to send a voice note. But did you know that if you slide this icon upwards towards the lock icon, you can let go of it and keep recording? This way, you don't have to keep holding the mic icon while recording long voice notes. You can also hit the pause button to pause the recording and come back to it later, in case there's an interruption while you're recording a voice note. Once you're done recording, you can also press the 1 button if you want your voice note to be deleted after the recipient hears it once.\n\nI'll admit, though, that I sometimes tend to ignore long voice notes. Instead, I use transcripts to quickly skim through them, and decide if they need an immediate response. Voice note transcripts are disabled by default, but you can enable them by going to WhatsApp Settings > Chats > Voice message transcripts > Manually. While you're here, also tap Transcript language and select the language that you want to see your transcripts in.\n\nIf you're getting too many messages from certain WhatsApp chats or groups, they'll always show up at the top in the list of your chats. To get these off the main window, head to the chat list and press and hold on the chats you want to banish. Then tap Mute. To ensure that these archived chats don't reappear in the main window when you receive a new message from them, go to WhatsApp Settings > Chats and enable Keep chats archived.\n\nIt's really easy to get overwhelmed by notifications in WhatsApp. If you're an even moderately social person, you'll quickly find yourself receiving way more messages than you can reasonably be expected to handle. I've found that disabling WhatsApp notifications entirely works best to counter the problem, but that's not the best solution for everyone.\n\nInstead, you can try a few things to seriously reduce the amount of pings you get from WhatsApp. Go to WhatsApp Settings > Notifications and review every setting on this page. Personally, I've disabled all notifications for emoji reactions, group messages, and reminders. This way, I only get notified when individuals message me.\n\nWhatsApp's chat folders are a great way to triage your conversations. In your chat list, press and hold on any conversation. From there, you can select either Add to Favorites or Add to list to get started. The first option adds these messages to the Favorites folder, and the second one lets you choose a custom folder name. These chat folders will appear above all your conversations, and you can quickly tap any of them to focus on specific conversations.\n\nThe real hack is to reorder these folders to your liking. You can do that by holding the name on any of these chat folders and selecting Reorder lists. I've used this to prioritize messages from loved ones, my meditation group, running friends, and so on.\n\nUnfortunately, I know too many people whose phone storage is almost full because of WhatsApp. If you're in this situation, go to WhatsApp Settings > Storage and data > Manage storage to start the cleanup. Tap Larger than 5 MB and you'll be able to review everything that takes up a lot of storage space on your device. In the bottom-left corner, there's a button that lets you sort these files by recency or storage size. I've used this to identify lots of duplicate files and delete all but one copy of such items. You can also see a list of the chats occupying the most storage space on your device. Tap each item to manually review your files.\n\nIt's pretty easy to set up a few preventative measures to stop this error, too. You can go to WhatsApp Settings > Storage and data and turn off everything under Media auto-download.\n\nIt's important to note that if you use WhatsApp's apps on both your desktop and your phone, any settings changes you've made on one device might not sync to the other. You should review all settings to see if everything is syncing correctly.\n\nWhile you're double checking account details, you should also review your WhatsApp privacy settings. Go to WhatsApp Settings > Privacy, scroll to the bottom and select Privacy checkup for a quick overview. This is a step-by-step guide to enabling the most important privacy settings in WhatsApp, and is much faster than doing it manually.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY, Feb 23 (Reuters) - A visit from a romantic partner of infamous cartel boss Nemesio Oseguera, known as \"El Mencho,\" led to his capture and death, Mexican authorities said in an assessment of Sunday's ‌operation, after which 25 members of the National Guard military police were killed in retaliatory violence.\n\nOseguera, Mexico's most-wanted cartel leader, was the ‌mastermind of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG). The U.S. had offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his arrest.\n\nHe died in a helicopter after being injured in a ​military operation by Mexican special forces in a wooded area outside the town of Tapalpa in the western state of Jalisco, according to Mexico's defense ministry.\n\nDefense Minister Ricardo Trevilla said information from a confidante of one of Oseguera's romantic partners helped officials quickly plan the raid for the following day at the crime boss' compound.\n\nDuring the raid, Oseguera's gunmen opened fire on security forces and the conflict moved to a cabin complex in a wooded area, where he ‌was injured along with two of his bodyguards. The ⁠three were transported by helicopter to Mexico City but did not survive.\n\n\"Unfortunately, they died on the way,\" Trevilla said, speaking at the president's daily press conference.\n\nRETALIATORY VIOLENCE SURGES ACROSS MEXICO\n\nOseguera's death triggered violence across Mexico, as cartel loyalists blocked ⁠roads and burned cars in retaliation against the government.\n\nSecurity Minister Omar Garcia Harfuch told reporters at the press conference that 30 cartel members were killed in these attacks, as well as one bystander. At least 70 people were arrested in seven states.\n\nAccording to the defense ministry, attacks in Jalisco were masterminded by Oseguera's right-hand ​man ​and top financial chief known as \"El Tuli,\" who was also killed in a clash ​with security forces while they attempted to arrest him.\n\nGarcia ‌added that authorities were closely monitoring for a reaction or restructuring within the cartel that could unleash further violence. \"There is already a specific surveillance of several leaders of this criminal organization,\" he said.\n\nOfficials said that U.S. intelligence was used to help pinpoint the exact location of the Tapalpa compound but underscored that Mexico led the operation.\n\n\"There was no participation in this operation of U.S. forces. What there was, was an exchange of information,\" President Claudia Sheinbaum said.\n\nTrevilla was moved to tears as he offered condolences to the relatives of Mexican security officers who died in the ‌aftermath on Sunday, in which officials registered at least 85 roadblocks across Mexico. The ​flare-ups caused airlines to cancel flights on Sunday, and on Monday morning shares in Mexican ​airline Volaris and airport operators GAP and ASUR were down ​more than 4%.\n\nSheinbaum said the situation was normalizing and that her government's priority was ensuring peace and security.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump ‌on Monday called on Mexico to boost its efforts targeting ​drug cartels. \"Mexico must step up their ​effort on Cartels and Drugs!\" he wrote in a social media post.\n\nOseguera's death deals a strong blow to the CJNG cartel, believed to be a major supplier of fentanyl to the U.S.\n\nWhile the U.S. has pushed Mexico for more action on drug trafficking, Mexican authorities ​have also long called on the U.S. to do ‌more to limit the illegal sales of firearms that bolster the vast arsenals of cartels that operate inside its territory. According ​to U.S. government data, some 70% of illegal arms traced in Mexico came from the U.S.",

    "fullText": "Police Scotland is investigating after Rangers players Emmanuel Fernandez and Djeidi Gassama shared screenshots of racist abuse aimed at them on their social media accounts after Sunday's match in Livingston.\n\nLondon-born centre-half Emmanuel Fernandez, who qualifies to play for Nigeria, and France Under-20 capped winger Gassama, who was born in Mauritania, both started for Rangers as their title hopes suffered a blow by being held to a 2-2 draw by the Scottish Premiership's bottom side.\n\nRangers have described the abuse on Instagram that followed as \"unacceptable\" and reported it to the social media platform's parent company, Meta.\n\nIt coincides with police in England confirming they are investigating after four Premier League players were targeted by online racial abuse at the weekend.\n\nA Police Scotland spokesperson told BBC Scotland: \"We are aware of offensive posts online and enquiries are at an early stage.\"\n\nPolice investigate 'abhorrent' racist abuse of players\n\n'Appalling weekend' - Arokodare & Mundle latest players to be racially abused\n\nIn a statement of support for their players, Rangers say: \"For any player, opening a phone and seeing abuse tied to the colour of their skin is simply unacceptable.\n\n\"The accounts appear to be anonymous and are not connected to the club in any way. That may make action harder to take, but it does not lessen the seriousness of what happened, or the responsibility of the platform involved.\n\n\"Our immediate priority is the wellbeing of the players involved.

    "description": "National attention has been focused on a North Myrtle Beach restaurant owner and his friend over the deadly shooting of a North Carolina man.",
    "fullText": "For four days, Weldon Boyd and Kenneth “Bradley” Williams sat just a few feet from each other in a Horry County courtroom as they, for the first time in a public setting, talked about shooting and killing a North Carolina man more than two years ago.\n\nThe distance between the two friends was closer on that September day as Boyd, with Williams as his passenger, followed Scott Spivey for miles before turning down Camp Swamp Road and engaging in a gun battle that killed the 33-year-old Tabor City man.\n\nThe case has gained national attention as the men have avoided criminal charges in the case under South Carolina’s Stand Your Ground law.\n\nBoyd is well-known as the operator of the oceanfront restaurant Buoys on the Boulevard in North Myrtle Beach and for his previous battles with city officials. He has been described as a “lightening rod” by his attorney. But not much is known about Williams, whose name wasn’t released by police and only became public after Spivey’s family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the two men in 2024.\n\nAdditional pieces about the two men and their lives came out during last week’s Stand Your Ground hearing to determine if Boyd and Williams would receive civil immunity under the state law. The men were never arrested after the state attorney general’s office declined to file criminal charges, saying their actions were self-defense under the law.\n\nThe law, which most states have in some form, allows people to use force, including deadly force, to protect themselves against a perceived threat. South Carolina’s law specifically eliminated the duty to retreat when a person is somewhere they have a right to be.\n\nThe two men claim the shooting was self-defense after Spivey was seen driving erratically and pointing a gun at drivers, including Williams. Spivey ran Boyd off of the road before Boyd began to pursue Spivey.\n\nJudge Eugene Griffith Jr. disagreed with the self-defense argument, something the two men have asserted since the Sept. 9, 2023, shooting, and denied Boyd immunity, allowing the civil suit to move forward against Boyd. He is still considering whether he will grant Williams immunity as well.\n\nThe family alleges in their civil suit that Boyd and Williams aggressively chased Spivey for nine miles before shooting and killing him.\n\nHere’s what we know about the two men as we wait the judge’s final decision.\n\nBoyd and Williams became friends after attending automotive school together.\n\n“I’ve always kept a very small circle,” said Boyd, describing Williams as “my brother.”\n\nThe father of one grew up in Hartsville and received his GED after being homeschooled by his mother, who, along with his father, adopted both Boyd and his sister. His father raised him to be direct and “do the right thing” and “put your family first,” Boyd testified.\n\nBoyd later joined the Army National Guard in 2009, serving six years before leaving with the rank of sergeant. Boyd was deployed overseas, and while he never saw combat, he did say he witnessed tragic scenes that had an effect on him, including watching a family burn to death in their vehicle.\n\nBoyd became emotional on the stand as he described the scene, adding that he couldn’t stop to help.\n\nAfter getting out of the military, Boyd opened his first restaurant — a deli. When that failed, he later opened Buoys on the Boulevard. Boyd leases the property after buying out the previous owner.\n\nBoyd has been an outspoken critic of North Myrtle Beach city leaders, including former Mayor Marilyn Hatley. He has often used his eatery to send political statements. In April 2020, the restaurant received a South Carolina Law Enforcement Division citation after opening for outdoor dining during COVID-19 despite state orders to remain shut down.\n\nIn 2023, Boyd established a blueberry farm outside of Loris. It was here that Boyd and Williams were heading on the day of the shooting when they encountered Spivey along Highway 9.\n\nWilliams spoke softly as he testified on the final day of the hearing.\n\nUnlike Boyd, the 36-year-old Darlington resident maintained a low profile following the shooting. The married father of one is a heavy equipment mechanic, having worked for the same Florence company for 14 years, he said.\n\nHe confirmed that he and Boyd met in school in 2008.\n\nThe two men both said they have an interest in hunting, the outdoors and shooting guns.\n\nWilliams said he came to Horry County on Sept. 9 to help Boyd prepare for a family and friends event at the farm. He testified that he did have a gun with him that day, adding it was in his bag that was inside Boyd’s truck.\n\nFollowing the shooting, neither Boyd nor Williams’ names were released by police. It wasn’t until Boyd posted a statement on Facebook thanking Horry County Police and Solicitor Jimmy Richardson for their help in the shooting investigation that his name was revealed. Richardson mentioned Boyd’s name in his letter to the state attorney general’s office recusing himself and asking for the office to review the case.\n\nRumors began to swirl online that Boyd shot Spivey over an alleged relationship between Spivey and Boyd’s ex-fiance. But police later determined that Boyd and Spivey didn’t know one another before the shooting and that the shooting happened over a road rage incident.\n\nTestimony revealed that Boyd was angry that day regarding his ex-fiance. Family members had gone earlier to pick up a vehicle and engagement ring that Boyd had given her. Boyd had planned to sell the items, listing them on Facebook, in order to pay for his custody battle with his ex-fiance who was pregnant with his son, he said.\n\nBecause of that custody dispute, Boyd placed an app on his phone to record phone calls between himself and the mother. Those audio recordings became a key part of the Stand Your Ground hearing when they revealed Boyd’s calls on the day of and days following the shooting.\n\nThose recordings showed Boyd had minimal remorse for his actions, telling Williams during one call that he had a “f****** blast” during the gunfight, and telling his mom that he chased Spivey, who “was terrified.” He also suggested that he and Williams get teardrop tattoos.\n\nThose recordings also revealed a close relationship with then-Horry County Police Department Deputy Chief Brandon Strickland, who told Boyd he was working “in the shadows” to help him.\n\nStrickland was forced to resign in March and is currently under criminal investigation by SLED related to his conduct with Boyd’s case. Longtime officer Paul Damon Vescovi also was terminated for “conduct unbecoming of an officer” and other policy violations related to his actions on the case.\n\nThe termination came after Vescovi’s body camera footage at the scene showed him writing “Act Like a Victim” and “Camera” on a notepad that he showed to Boyd.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The Mexican army killed the country’s most powerful cartel leader and one of the United States’ most wanted fugitives, notching a major victory while cartel members responded with a wave of violence across the country.\n\nThe killing Sunday of Jalisco New Generation Cartel leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes during an attempt to capture him in Jalisco state was the highest-profile blow against cartels since the recapture of former Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán a decade ago.\n\nFollowing Oseguera Cervantes' death, security forces were placed on alert throughout the country as gunmen unleashed violence. Cars torched by cartel members blocked roads in 20 Mexican states. People locked themselves in their homes in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city and Jalisco's capital, and school was canceled Monday in several states.\n\nThe killing could give the government a leg up in its dealings with the Trump administration, which has been threatening tariffs or unilateral military action if Mexico does not show results in the fight against the cartels. But the long-term effect on Mexico's security landscape remains unclear.\n\nOseguera Cervantes, better known as “El Mencho,” was 59 years old and originally from the western state of Michoacan. His ties to organized crime went back at least three decades.\n\nIn 1994, he was tried for trafficking heroin in the U.S. and sent to prison for three years. Upon returning to Mexico, he quickly rose through Mexico's drug trafficking underworld.\n\nAround 2009, he founded the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which became Mexico's fastest-growing criminal organization, moving cocaine, methamphetamines, fentanyl and migrants to the United States, and using violence with the use of drones and improvised explosive devices.\n\nThe cartel earned a reputation for brazen attacks on Mexican security forces, including downing a military helicopter in Jalisco in 2015 and attempting a spectacular, but unsuccessful, assassination of Mexico City Police Chief Omar García Harfuch, who is now Mexico's federal security secretary.\n\nIt recruited aggressively, experimenting with new ways to reach potential members online, and generated revenue through fuel theft, extortion and timeshare fraud, among other activities.\n\nOseguera Cervantes was killed during an attempt to capture him, as his followers attempted to fight off Mexican troops.\n\nMexico's Defense Secretary Ricardo Trevilla said Monday that the army and National Guard launched an operation in the southern part of Jalisco state to capture Oseguera Cervantes, involving the Mexican air force and special forces. Intelligence gathered about one of Oseguera Cervantes' romantic partners led them to his hideout, he said.\n\nThe cartel counterattacked, and in the ensuing confrontation, federal forces killed eight members of the criminal group. Oseguera Cervantes and two of his bodyguards were wounded and died later during transfer by air to Mexico City, Trevilla said.\n\nRocket launchers capable of shooting down aircraft and destroying armored vehicles were seized at the scene.\n\nOseguera Cervantes' death will help Mexico's government show results to the U.S., which is pressuring its neighbor to pursue drug cartels more aggressively. Both countries said intelligence cooperation helped lead to Sunday's operation.\n\nOseguera Cervantes was facing multiple indictments in the United States and the U.S. State Department had offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his arrest. The Trump administration designated his cartel and others foreign terrorist organizations a year ago.\n\nU.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who was U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the first Trump administration, applauded the operation via X, writing: “The good guys are stronger than the bad guys. Congratulations to the forces of law and order in the great Mexican nation.”\n\nMike Vigil, former chief of international operations for the DEA, said Mexico had sent “a strong message to Donald Trump's administration that they are fighting aggressively and effectively” against the most powerful cartels. He added that “the majority of the information came from the Mexican armed forces and all credit goes to Mexico.”\n\nIt's not clear who will succeed Oseguera Cervantes, or if any one person can.\n\nThe Jalisco cartel has a presence in at least 21 of Mexico's 32 states and is active in almost all of the United States, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. But it is also a global organization and the loss of its leader could be felt well beyond Mexico.\n\n“El Mencho controlled everything, he was like a country's dictator,” Vigil said.\n\nHis absence could slow the cartel's rapid growth and expansion and leave it initially weakened against the Sinaloa cartel on several fronts where they or their proxies are fighting. The Sinaloa is locked in its own internal power struggle, however, between the sons of “El Chapo” and the faction loyal to Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who is in U.S. custody.\n\nVigil said Mexico should seize the moment to launch “an effective frontal assault based on intelligence.”\n\n“This is a big opportunity for Mexico and the United States if they work together,” he said.\n\nSecurity analyst David Saucedo said that if relatives of Oseguera Cervantes take control of the cartel, the violence seen Sunday could continue. If others take power, they could be more willing to turn the page and continue operations.\n\nThe greatest fear would be that the cartel turns to indiscriminate violence. They could decide to “launch narcoterrorism attacks ... and generate a scenario similar to what Colombia lived in the 1990s,” a full-on attack against the government “car bombs, assassinations and attacks on aircraft.”",

    "fullText": "It looks like a March launch is no longer in the cards for Artemis II, NASA's first crewed trip to the moon's vicinity since the final Apollo mission over 50 years ago. While preparations were underway at the Kennedy Space Center for a launch as soon as March 6, the space agency says it ran into an issue with the flow of helium to its SLS rocket's upper stage this weekend and it now has to roll the rocket from the launch pad back to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to figure out what's wrong and fix it. A media briefing is planned for sometime this week to discuss the problem and what's next.\n\nBut in a post on X, NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman confirmed the rollback will \"take the March launch window out of consideration.\" NASA noted on its blog that the current effort \"potentially preserves the April launch window, pending the outcome of data findings, repair efforts, and how the schedule comes to fruition in the coming days and weeks.\" It's a four-mile trip back to the VAB that will take hours to carefully transport the massive rocket and the Orion spacecraft. NASA says it's eyeing February 24 for this trek.\n\nThe issue occurred overnight in the early hours of February 21, when NASA says it observed \"interrupted flow of helium to the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket’s interim cryogenic propulsion stage.\" The space agency explained:\n\nThe upper stage uses helium to maintain the proper environmental conditions for the stage’s engine and to pressurize liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant tanks. The systems worked during NASA’s Artemis II wet dress rehearsals, but teams were not able to properly flow helium during normal operations and reconfigurations following the wet dress rehearsal that concluded Feb. 19. Operators are using a backup method to maintain the environmental conditions for the upper stage engines and the rocket, which remains in a safe configuration.\n\nThe Artemis II crew — Commander Reid Wiseman, Pilot Victor Glover, Mission Specialist Christina Koch and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen, Mission Specialist — had just entered quarantine a day before the issue arose. NASA says the astronauts have since come out of quarantine.\n\nAt the start of this year, NASA announced an accelerated timeline for Artemis II, which was previously set for April 2026 after experiencing delays in 2024. For this 10-day mission, which will be the first crewed flight of the SLS rocket, the Artemis II astronauts will take a trip around the moon in the Orion spacecraft. While it initially targeted early February, the launch was pushed to March due to issues that popped up during the wet dress rehearsal. Now, we're back to the beginning with a possible April launch, but that’ll depend on the fix being a quick one.",

    "description": "It feels so obvious that time moves forward that questioning it can seem almost pointless.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nThis article was originally published at The Conversation. The publication contributed the article to Space.com's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights.\n\nTime feels like the most basic feature of reality. Seconds tick, days pass and everything from planetary motion to human memory seems to unfold along a single, irreversible direction. We are born and we die, in exactly that order. We plan our lives around time, measure it obsessively and experience it as an unbroken flow from past to future. It feels so obvious that time moves forward that questioning it can seem almost pointless.\n\nAnd yet, for more than a century, physics has struggled to say what time actually is. This struggle is not philosophical nitpicking. It sits at the heart of some of the deepest problems in science.\n\nModern physics relies on different, but equally important, frameworks. One is Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the gravity and motion of large objects such as planets. Another is quantum mechanics, which rules the microcosmos of atoms and particles. And on an even larger scale, the standard model of cosmology describes the birth and evolution of the universe as a whole. All rely on time, yet they treat it in incompatible ways.\n\nWhen physicists try to combine these theories into a single framework, time often behaves in unexpected and troubling ways. Sometimes it stretches. Sometimes it slows. Sometimes it disappears entirely.\n\nEinstein's theory of relativity was, in fact, the first major blow to our everyday intuition about time. Time, Einstein showed, is not universal. It runs at different speeds depending on gravity and motion. Two observers moving relative to one another will disagree about which events happened at the same time. Time became something elastic, woven together with space into a four-dimensional fabric called spacetime.\n\nQuantum mechanics made things even stranger. In quantum theory, time is not something the theory explains. It is simply assumed. The equations of quantum mechanics describe how systems evolve with respect to time, but time itself remains an external parameter, a background clock that sits outside the theory.\n\nThis mismatch becomes acute when physicists try to describe gravity at the quantum level, which is crucial for developing the much coveted theory of everything – which links the main fundamental theories. But in many attempts to create such a theory, time vanishes as a parameter from the fundamental equations altogether. The universe appears frozen, described by equations that make no reference to change.\n\nThis puzzle is known as the problem of time, and it remains one of the most persistent obstacles to a unified theory of physics. Despite enormous progress in cosmology and particle physics, we still lack a clear explanation for why time flows at all.\n\nNow a relatively new approach to physics, building on a mathematical framework called information theory, developed by Claude Shannon in the 1940s, has started coming up with surprising answers.\n\nWhen physicists try to explain the direction of time, they often turn to a concept called entropy. The second law of thermodynamics states that disorder tends to increase. A glass can fall and shatter into a mess, but the shards never spontaneously leap back together. This asymmetry between past and future is often identified with the arrow of time.\n\nThis idea has been enormously influential. It explains why many processes are irreversible, including why we remember the past but not the future. If the universe started in a state of low entropy, and is getting messier as it evolves, that appears to explain why time moves forward. But entropy does not fully solve the problem of time.\n\nFor one thing, the fundamental quantum mechanical equations of physics do not distinguish between past and future. The arrow of time emerges only when we consider large numbers of particles and statistical behaviour. This also raises a deeper question: why did the universe start in such a low-entropy state to begin with? Statistically, there are more ways for a universe to have high entropy than low entropy, just as there are more ways for a room to be messy than tidy. So why would it start in a state that is so improbable?\n\nOver the past few decades, a quiet but far-reaching revolution has taken place in physics. Information, once treated as an abstract bookkeeping tool used to track states or probabilities, has increasingly been recognised as a physical quantity in its own right, just like matter or radiation. While entropy measures how many microscopic states are possible, information measures how physical interactions limit and record those possibilities.\n\nThis shift did not happen overnight. It emerged gradually, driven by puzzles at the intersection of thermodynamics, quantum mechanics and gravity, where treating information as merely mathematical began to produce contradictions.\n\nOne of the earliest cracks appeared in black hole physics. When Stephen Hawking showed that black holes emit thermal radiation, it raised a disturbing possibility: information about whatever falls into a black hole might be permanently lost as heat. That conclusion conflicted with quantum mechanics, which demands that the entirety of information be preserved.\n\nResolving this tension forced physicists to confront a deeper truth. Information is not optional. If we want a full description of the universe that includes quantum mechanics, information cannot simply disappear without undermining the foundations of physics. This realisation had profound consequences. It became clear that information has thermodynamic cost, that erasing it dissipates energy, and that storing it requires physical resources.\n\nIn parallel, surprising connections emerged between gravity and thermodynamics. It was shown that Einstein's equations can be derived from thermodynamic principles that link spacetime geometry directly to entropy and information. In this view, gravity doesn't behave exactly like a fundamental force.\n\nInstead, gravity appears to be what physicists call \"emergen\" – a phenomenon describing something that's greater than the sum of its parts, arising from more fundamental constituents. Take temperature. We can all feel it, but on a fundamental level, a single particle can't have temperature. It's not a fundamental feature. Instead it only emerges as a result of many molecules moving collectively.\n\nSimilarly, gravity can be described as an emergent phenomenon, arising from statistical processes. Some physicists have even suggested that gravity itself may emerge from information, reflecting how information is distributed, encoded and processed.\n\nThese ideas invite a radical shift in perspective. Instead of treating spacetime as primary, and information as something that lives inside it, information may be the more fundamental ingredient from which spacetime itself emerges. Building on this research, my colleagues and I have explored a framework in which spacetime itself acts as a storage medium for information – and it has important consequences for how we view time.\n\nIn this approach, spacetime is not perfectly smooth, as relativity suggests, but composed of discrete elements, each with a finite capacity to record quantum information from passing particles and fields. These elements are not bits in the digital sense, but physical carriers of quantum information, capable of retaining memory of past interactions.\n\nA useful way to picture them is to think of spacetime like a material made of tiny, memory-bearing cells. Just as a crystal lattice can store defects that appeared earlier in time, these microscopic spacetime elements can retain traces of the interactions that have passed through them. They are not particles in the usual sense described by the standard model of particle physics, but a more fundamental layer of physical structure that particle physics operates on rather than explains.\n\nThis has an important implication. If spacetime records information, then its present state reflects not only what exists now, but everything that has happened before. Regions that have experienced more interactions carry a different imprint of information than regions that have experienced fewer. The universe, in this view, does not merely evolve according to timeless laws applied to changing states. It remembers.\n\nThis memory is not metaphorical. Every physical interaction leaves an informational trace. Although the basic equations of quantum mechanics can be run forwards or backwards in time, real interactions never happen in isolation. They inevitably involve surroundings, leak information outward and leave lasting records of what has occurred. Once this information has spread into the wider environment, recovering it would require undoing not just a single event, but every physical change it caused along the way. In practice, that is impossible.\n\nThis is why information cannot be erased and broken cups do not reassemble. But the implication runs deeper. Each interaction writes something permanent into the structure of the universe, whether at the scale of atoms colliding or galaxies forming.\n\nGeometry and information turn out to be deeply connected in this view. In our work, we have showed that how spacetime curves depends not only on mass and energy, as Einstein taught us, but also on how quantum information, particularly entanglement, is distributed. Entanglement is a quantum process that mysteriously links particles in distant regions of space – it enables them to share information despite the distance. And these informational links contribute to the effective geometry experienced by matter and radiation.\n\nFrom this perspective, spacetime geometry is not just a response to what exists at a given moment, but to what has happened. Regions that have recorded many interactions tend, on average, to behave as if they curve more strongly, have stronger gravity, than regions that have recorded fewer.\n\nThis reframing subtly changes the role of spacetime. Instead of being a neutral arena in which events unfold, spacetime becomes an active participant. It stores information, constrains future dynamics and shapes how new interactions can occur. This naturally raises a deeper question. If spacetime records information, could time emerge from this recording process rather than being assumed from the start?\n\nRecently, we extended this informational perspective to time itself. Rather than treating time as a fundamental background parameter, we showed that temporal order emerges from irreversible information imprinting. In this view, time is not something added to physics by hand. It arises because information is written in physical processes and, under the known laws of thermodynamics and quantum physics, cannot be globally unwritten again. The idea is simple but far-reaching.\n\nEvery interaction, such as two particles crashing, writes information into the universe. These imprints accumulate. Because they cannot be erased, they define a natural ordering of events. Earlier states are those with fewer informational records. Later states are those with more.\n\nQuantum equations do not prefer a direction of time, but the process of information spreading does. Once information has been spread out, there is no physical path back to a state in which it was localised. Temporal order is therefore anchored in this irreversibility, not in the equations themselves.\n\nTime, in this view, is not something that exists independently of physical processes. It is the cumulative record of what has happened. Each interaction adds a new entry, and the arrow of time reflects the fact that this record only grows.\n\nThe future differs from the past because the universe contains more information about the past than it ever can about the future. This explains why time has a direction without relying on special, low-entropy initial conditions or purely statistical arguments. As long as interactions occur and information is irreversibly recorded, time advances.\n\nInterestingly, this accumulated imprint of information may have observable consequences. At galactic scales, the residual information imprint behaves like an additional gravitational component, shaping how galaxies rotate without invoking new particles. Indeed, the unknown substance called dark matter was introduced to explain why galaxies and galaxy clusters rotate faster than their visible mass alone would allow.\n\nIn the informational picture, this extra gravitational pull does not come from invisible dark matter, but from the fact that spacetime itself has recorded a long history of interactions. Regions that have accumulated more informational imprints respond more strongly to motion and curvature, effectively boosting their gravity. Stars orbit faster not because more mass is present, but because the spacetime they move through carries a heavier informational memory of past interactions.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, dark matter, dark energy and the arrow of time may all arise from a single underlying process: the irreversible accumulation of information.\n\nBut could we ever test this theory? Ideas about time are often accused of being philosophical rather than scientific. Because time is so deeply woven into how we describe change, it is easy to assume that any attempt to rethink it must remain abstract. An informational approach, however, makes concrete predictions and connects directly to systems we can observe, model and in some cases experimentally probe.\n\nBlack holes provide a natural testing ground, as they seems to suggest information is erased. In the informational framework, this conflict is resolved by recognising that information is not destroyed but imprinted into spacetime before crossing the horizon. The black hole records it.\n\nThis has an important implication for time. As matter falls toward a black hole, interactions intensify and information imprinting accelerates. Time continues to advance locally because information continues to be written, even as classical notions of space and time break down near the horizon and appear to slow or freeze for distant observers.\n\nAs the black hole evaporates through Hawking radiation, the accumulated informational record does not vanish. Instead, it affects how radiation is emitted. The radiation should carry subtle signs that reflect the black hole's history. In other words, the outgoing radiation is not perfectly random. Its structure is shaped by the information previously recorded in spacetime. Detecting such signs remains beyond current technology, but they provide a clear target for future theoretical and observational work.\n\nThe same principles can be explored in much smaller, controlled systems. In laboratory experiments with quantum computers, qubits (the quantum computer equivalent of bits) can be treated as finite-capacity information cells, just like the spacetime ones. Researchers have shown that even when the underlying quantum equations are reversible, the way information is written, spread and retrieved can generate an effective arrow of time in the lab. These experiments allow physicists to test how information storage limits affect reversibility, without needing cosmological or astrophysical systems.\n\nExtensions of the same framework suggest that informational imprinting is not limited to gravity. It may play a role across all fundamental forces of nature, including electromagnetism and the nuclear forces. If this is correct, then time's arrow should ultimately be traceable to how all interactions record information, not just gravitational ones. Testing this would involve looking for limits on reversibility or information recovery across different physical processes.\n\nTaken together, these examples show that informational time is not an abstract reinterpretation. It links black holes, quantum experiments and fundamental interactions through a shared physical mechanism, one that can be explored, constrained and potentially falsified as our experimental reach continues to grow.\n\nIdeas about information do not replace relativity or quantum mechanics. In everyday conditions, informational time closely tracks the time measured by clocks. For most practical purposes, the familiar picture of time works extremely well. The difference appears in regimes where conventional descriptions struggle.\n\nNear black hole horizons or during the earliest moments of the universe, the usual notion of time as a smooth, external coordinate becomes ambiguous. Informational time, by contrast, remains well defined as long as interactions occur and information is irreversibly recorded.\n\nAll this may leave you wondering what time really is. This shift reframes the longstanding debate. The question is no longer whether time must be assumed as a fundamental ingredient of the universe, but whether it reflects a deeper underlying process.\n\nIn this view, the arrow of time can emerge naturally from physical interactions that record information and cannot be undone. Time, then, is not a mysterious background parameter standing apart from physics. It is something the universe generates internally through its own dynamics. It is not ultimately a fundamental part of reality, but emerges from more basic constituents such as information.\n\nWhether this framework turns out to be a final answer or a stepping stone remains to be seen. Like many ideas in fundamental physics, it will stand or fall based on how well it connects theory to observation. But it already suggests a striking change in perspective.\n\nThe universe does not simply exist in time. Time is something the universe continuously writes into itself.",

    "description": "After conceding another late goal on Saturday, we look at the stats that show Leeds would be ninth in the Premier League if games ended after 85 minutes.",
    "fullText": "Leeds United manager Daniel Farke described the 1-1 Premier League draw at third-placed Aston Villa as \"a valuable point\" for his \"warriors\" - but he must have been secretly seething at the concession of yet another costly late goal.\n\nTammy Abraham's leveller with two minutes of normal time to play at Villa Park on Saturday was the 12th league goal Leeds have let in from the 86th minute onwards this season.\n\nThat is the most goals shipped in that period of the game by any club in the top flight.\n\nWhile half of those last-gasp strikes have not affected Leeds' results, the other half have - meaning the Whites have dropped a league-high nine points at the death.\n\nIf every Premier League game had ended after 85 minutes this season, Leeds would be ninth in the table and in the hunt for European football.\n\nInstead, they are actually 15th - just six points above the relegation zone.\n\nThe most notable turnaround came last month when Farke's side snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in a seven-goal thriller at St James' Park.\n\nLeeds were 3-2 up when the clock struck 90 minutes before Newcastle scored twice in added time to win 4-3.\n\nThe first of those two goals was a 91st-minute Bruno Guimaraes penalty - the fourth spot-kick Leeds have given away in added time this term. Harvey Barnes then clinched it for Newcastle in the 102nd minute, the latest match-winning Premier League goal on record.\n\nThrow in a 94th-minute own goal from Gabriel Gudmundsson during September's visit to Fulham that gifted the Cottagers all three points, and the pattern does raise questions about Leeds' fitness and concentration in the latter stages.\n\n\"For me it can only be a concentration issue,\" says former Leeds and England goalkeeper Paul Robinson. \"I don't think it's down to fitness - two or three minutes at the end of the game is neither here nor there for these players.\n\n\"There are various types of goals in there - penalties, an own goal, others that are harder to legislate for. Any goal, if you break it down, you can pick out an error or a lapse of concentration somewhere along the chain. Maybe sometimes there's a lack of leadership in the dying minutes.\n\n\"The Leeds fans won't care as long as they stay up but, at the minute, they're drawing too many games and they're right in the mix.\"\n\nOf course, Leeds have also benefited from late goals this season too.\n\nAo Tanaka smashed home a 96th-minute equaliser against Liverpool at Elland Road in December, while Lukas Nmecha's fine volley in the 91st minute sealed all three points against Fulham last month.\n\nUltimately, Farke deserves credit for Leeds' turnaround in fortunes since switching to a 3-5-2 formation at half-time against Manchester City in late November - a game City won in the 91st minute through Phil Foden.\n\nA run of just two defeats in the subsequent 14 league games has moved Leeds out of the relegation zone.\n\nBut when Farke reflects on his side's late-goal problem, he might be left wondering: \"What if?\"",

    "fullText": "Above the mouth of the players tunnel at Ellis Park, where England will walk out to play South Africa on 4 July, there is a sign.\n\nHammered out in capital letters, it simply reads: \"1,753m above sea level.\"\n\nIt will be the start of an itinerary that takes England far and wide, as well as high.\n\nPreviously a Test summer consisted of a series taking place in a single destination, perhaps with a warm-up match en route.\n\nIn 2025 England played two Tests against Argentina, with a match against the USA on their way home.\n\nIn 2024 they took on Japan before flying on to play New Zealand twice.\n\nPlenty of tin-tray micro-meals and free sleep masks involved in both trips.\n\nThis year, though, the itineraries are more hectic and varied than ever.\n\nThe new Nations Championship, which pits the best teams from the two hemispheres against each other over the year, demands more stops.\n\nSo, after jetting down to Johannesburg to take on South Africa, England will fly home to play Fiji in an 'away' fixture at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium in Liverpool a week later, before checking in for a mammoth journey to the small Argentine city of Santiago del Estero, where they will take on the Pumas.\n\nIn total, England will travel more than 25,000 miles, equivalent to a lap of the globe, to fulfil the three fixtures and make their way home.\n\nTheir super-charged race around the world poses plenty of challenges.\n\nThat Ellis Park sign is a reminder to travelling teams of the weak oxygen mix swirling around them.\n\nAt altitude the air is 'thinner' as it is under less pressure, meaning that each inflation of the lungs draws about a fifth less oxygen into the body.\n\nAs if the challenge of facing the reigning world champions is not enough, the Springboks have regularly added opponents' acclimatisation to their home advantage.\n\nThe last time England toured South Africa in 2018, Ellis Park was the venue for the first Test. England raced out into a 21-point lead, but were reeled in and beaten 42-39.\n\nGiven the relatively sparse facilities in their home country, and the possibility of generating greater income elsewhere, Fiji have been given dispensation to play their home matches on neutral territory.\n\nPort Elizabeth - a 90-minute flight from Johannesburg - was floated as a possible venue, but opportunity won out over convenience.\n\nA match at Hill Dickinson Stadium will also give England - for whom staging home games anywhere other than their own 82,000-capacity Allianz Stadium in Twickenham means missing out on substantial revenue - a chance to shine outside of their traditional heartland.\n\nEngland thrashed Uruguay in a World Cup dead rubber in 2015 at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium in front of more than 50,000.\n\nTaking on a Fiji side that were within three points of England with a little more than 20 minutes to go in November's meeting should provide more of a spectacle on their first visit to the north-west since.\n\nWith many of Fiji's stars, such as Bristol pair Viliame Mata and Kalaveti Ravouvou, Provence's Caleb Muntz and Lyon's Jiuta Wainiqolo, playing their club rugby in Europe, the venue may make life easier for some of the islanders.\n\nArgentina's stadium selection for the following week is interesting.\n\nThey have a perfect record at the new 42,000-capacity Estadio Unico Madre de Ciudades.\n\nThe Pumas have beaten Scotland and South Africa in their two appearances there.\n\nHowever, getting to Santiago del Estero from the capital Buenos Aires - 650 miles to the south-west - involves a two-hour flight or 12-hour drive.\n\nIt is a choice of venue that exacerbates a testing itinerary.\n\nEngland are well versed in long-haul tours.\n\nOperations manager Charlotte Gibbons, who is in charge of ironing out the kinks to make schedules as seamless as possible, has been in her role for a decade, and was recently seconded to the British and Irish Lions for their whistle-stop summer tour of Australia.\n\nInternational teams pack cleverly for flights. Additional food, supplements and sleep plans are in place to ensure players reach their destination in the best possible condition.\n\nJohannesburg is only an hour ahead of the UK in July, minimising jetlag for that leg of England's trip.\n\nThe kick-off time for the meeting with Fiji has not been confirmed, but an early afternoon start could be key in allowing England to get to London and en route to Buenos Aires for a Sunday morning arrival in Argentina.\n\nHead coach Steve Borthwick will have decisions to make.\n\nWhile England have no option but to go full bore against the Springboks, there is the option of splitting the squad for the following week.\n\nA group of players could fly direct from South Africa to Argentina to start preparations for the Pumas early.\n\nRanked eighth in the world - higher than Scotland and Italy - Fiji are not to be taken lightly.\n\nIf a mix-and-match England team lost, it would also undermine the new Nations Championship, with each match contributing to a North v South rankings play-off at Twickenham.\n\nThe profile of the new event's finale would be raised by England competing in one of the prestige fixtures. Defeat by Fiji would diminish that possibility.\n\nEngland's schedule involves more air miles, but not significantly more than most traditional tours.\n\nTheir 2024 summer schedule, involving visits to Japan and New Zealand, came in at about 24,000 miles. The 2025 equivalent, taking in Argentina and the US, was about 16,000.\n\nHowever, the increased number of flights means more take-offs and landings - the most carbon intensive phase of air travel.\n\nNations Championship organisers have attempted to make the fixture list as efficient as possible.\n\nNo northern hemisphere team has been handed the biggest set of long-haul fixtures possible - playing Argentina, South Africa and New Zealand on successive weekends - with matches tending to be grouped for relative proximity.\n\nHowever, a more ambitious attempt to bring together the global game comes at a greater carbon cost.\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "fullText": "Players who receive treatment for an injury could be forced to stay off the field for one minute under proposals from Fifa.\n\nIt is one of a number of measures to tackle tempo disruption and time lost which are set to be approved at the International Football Association Board (Ifab) annual general meeting on Saturday.\n\nAt present there is no stipulation in the laws over how long injured players have to remain on the sidelines.\n\nLeagues have the right to set their own guidelines, with the Premier League adopting a 30-second rule since the 2023-24 season.\n\nFifa held its own trials at the Arab Cup in December which required a player to stay off the field for two minutes.\n\nFifa referees' chief Pierluigi Collina says the two-minute rule is intended to reduce time-wasting and improve the flow of the game.\n\nIt mirrors an approach taken by Major League Soccer, which is triggered if a player remains on the ground for more than 15 seconds and the physio comes on.\n\nAt an Ifab meeting in January it was agreed a fixed period should be added to the laws, but there was disagreement over the length of time and strong pushback against two minutes.\n\nIs VAR any better in the rest of Europe's top leagues?\n\nFootball must avoid 'microscopic' VAR - Uefa refs' chief\n\nCanadian league set to trial Wenger's offside idea\n\nOne minute has been proposed as a halfway house, but BBC Sport understands concerns remain about negative impacts.\n\nManchester United were angered last season when Matthijs de Ligt was forced to leave the field with a cut, and Brentford scored from a corner while he was off the pitch.\n\nThe fear is a one-minute absence would make it far more likely a team could concede a goal when down to 10 players.\n\nThirty seconds already causes frustration among supporters - and unintended consequences of goals conceded could add further pressure on to officials.\n\nThere is an acceptance players use supposed injuries as a way of breaking up play, but it is felt extending the time limit could unduly penalise genuinely injured players.\n\nIf the opponent is shown a yellow or red card the injured player does not need to stay off. Goalkeepers are also exempt, while a penalty taker would be able to stay on.\n\nHowever, Ifab is not expected to pass any resolution to tackle the tactical timeout. This is when a goalkeeper goes down off the ball in order for a coach to get new instructions to the team.\n\nIfab's advisory panels have discussed the issue at some length but, so far, there has been no agreement on a solution.\n\nFollowing the success of the eight-second rule for goalkeepers holding the ball, new countdown measures are set to be approved.\n\nA similar process will be added to goal-kicks and throw-ins, with possession changing to the opposition if it takes too long.\n\nA 10-second limit will also be applied to substituted players - if they do not get off the pitch the replacement will not be allowed to come on.\n\nA team would have to play with 10 players until the next stoppage, and that must be after at least 60 seconds.\n\nIfab is expected to approve video assistant referee reviews for wrongly awarded second yellow cards and, as a competition opt-in, corners.\n\nThe Canadian Premier League is also likely to be granted permission to start trials of Arsene Wenger's daylight offside.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Super 8s Group 1, Mumbai\n\nWest Indies 254-6 (20 overs): Hetmyer 85 (34), Powell 59 (35); Muzarabani 2-42\n\nZimbabwe 147 (17.4 overs): Evans 43 (21); Motie 4-28; Hosein 3-28\n\nShimron Hetmyer made a stunning 85 off 34 balls as West Indies began their T20 World Cup Super 8 stage with an emphatic 107-run victory over Zimbabwe.\n\nHetmyer hit seven sixes and seven fours as he mixed finesse with power - at a strike rate of 250 - to help West Indies post a mammoth 254-6.\n\nThe left-handed Guyanese was dropped twice by Tashinga Musekiwa - on nine and 70 - before he was eventually caught at deep mid-wicket by Brian Bennett off experienced spinner Graeme Cremer.\n\nRovman Powell then upped the ante after a patient start to chip in with a 35-ball 59 before middle-order cameos from Sherfane Rutherford, Romario Shepherd and Jason Holder provided further impetus.\n\nWest Indies' total was the second-highest in T20 World Cup history - behind Sri Lanka's 260-6 against Kenya in 2007 - on what was a chastening day for Zimbabwe's attack, Cremer (9.50) the only player with an economy under 10.\n\nNo side had ever successfully chased more than 230 at the Wankhede Stadium in T20 internationals, or in the Indian Premier League, and Zimbabwe soon found themselves in trouble.\n\nAkeal Hosein bowled Bennett, Zimbabwe's leading run-scorer, with a beauty for five, then three balls later snared Ryan Burl for a duck to leave the Chevrons reeling at 20-3 in the third over.\n\nFellow left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie ran through the Zimbabwe middle order en route to 4-28 - starting the run with a peach of a delivery to dismiss Dion Myers for 28.\n\nWith the game long gone, Brad Evans added some respectability to the margin of defeat with defiant late hitting - whacking five sixes in his 21-ball 43 - in a record 10th-wicket stand at a World Cup of 44 with Richard Ngarava.\n\nZimbabwe might have ruffled a few feathers in this World Cup with victories over Australia and Sri Lanka.\n\nBut the Chevrons well and truly had their wings clipped by Hetmyer and company as the boundaries were peppered at the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nHetmyer had looked in fine fettle in the group stage, chalking up scores of 64, 23, 46 not out and one.\n\nThe 29-year-old took it up a notch and played more astutely than perhaps the raw figures of the scorecard might indicate.\n\nWith a cocktail of intelligent farming of the strike, elegant drives and at times sheer brute force, he reached a half-century off 19 balls, which left Zimbabwe flummoxed.\n\nIt was the quickest by a West Indian at a World Cup - eclipsing his own record off 22 balls against Scotland earlier in the tournament.\n\nNobody has more than sixes than Hetmyer's 17 in this tournament, and while there was power in the strokeplay in this innings, it was more about calculated shot selection in the mind than pure muscle.\n\n\"I'm not overthinking my batting. Now I am trying to think less and the bat will now do the talking and I react [to] what's in front of me,\" Hetmyer said afterwards.\n\nZimbabwe rued dropping him twice, with the hapless Musekiwa wishing the Wankhede turf would swallow him up after he spilled two opportunities his team-mates would have expected him to take.\n\nIt might have been different had the first been held, although with strike rates of 238 (Rutherford), 210 (Shepherd) and 325 (Holder), possibly not.\n\nZimbabwe were never in the chase after Motie and Hosein turned the screw - West Indies' left-arm tweakers bagging seven of the wickets to fall.\n\nThe West Indies World Cup bandwagon rolls on after banking another impressive victory and the only concern is whether they are peaking too early.\n\nCertainly on this evidence they will take some stopping.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "With Pakistan's spinners promising to provide a \"tough time\", England's frequent batting weakness stand between them and a World Cup semi-final.",
    "fullText": "England batters and spin bowling. It has rarely been pretty.\n\nFor every Joe Root, Kevin Pietersen or Graham Thorpe, there have been far more troubled by the tweakers.\n\nEngland beat Sri Lanka by 51 runs on Sunday, meaning victory against Pakistan on Tuesday will secure a place in the semi-finals, but the issue that has dogged their batting throughout this T20 World Cup did not go away.\n\nFour of England's top five were out to spinners. The other, Tom Banton, was run out.\n\nAnd Pakistan used six different spinners in their match against India earlier in the tournament. They have bowled a higher percentage of spin than any other team.\n\nEngland's problems have not gone unnoticed.\n\n\"They were struggling against the spinners,\" said batter Sahibzada Farhan.\n\n\"We have one of the best spin attacks. which has Usman Tariq, [Mohammad] Nawaz, Shadab [Khan], even Abrar [Ahmed] is one of the top spinners.\n\n\"I am confident we will give them a tough time.\"\n\nEngland's 'Jack of all trades' delivers for Brook again\n\nWhy is there talk about a Pakistan spinner's action?\n\nEngland's issues against spin at this tournament are curious, given what had come before.\n\nDuring the T20 series against Sri Lanka before this World Cup they lost only three wickets against spin across three matches.\n\nEven in the one-day international series that preceded it, with many of the same players, they averaged 43.9 collectively against the turning ball.\n\nHowever, those numbers have nose-dived on the biggest stage.\n\nOverall, 21 of England's 38 wickets have fallen to spin - not a major disparity to the 17 against pace - but more significant have been the moments those dismissals have come.\n\nThere were four in succession against Italy in the group stage and before that six in a row through the middle in defeat by West Indies in Mumbai.\n\nThe Sri Lanka win was the third occasion England were unable to break from a stranglehold.\n\n\"We were very good in the bilateral series here against Sri Lanka, where we played spin,\" said spinner Liam Dawson in defence of his top order.\n\n\"We know we can bat a lot better than what we have batted. We've won games and that's the main thing.\"\n\nAn lbw dismissal to Dunith Wellalage means England's captain Harry Brook has been removed by spinners four times in a row at this World Cup.\n\nOverall he now averages 19.1 against spin in T20 internationals, compared to 46.2 against the quicks.\n\nJacob Bethell, who played a horrible slog to fall to Maheesh Theekshana on Sunday, has got out to a spinner in every innings.\n\nJos Buttler was pinned in front by Wellalage, though he looked equally as troubled by the seamers.\n\nButtler, who has made three single-figure scores in a row, was the only player from the expected XI for Tuesday to train on Monday evening.\n\nGiven England rarely train when there is only one day between matches, that shows Buttler's struggle to find form.\n\nTuesday's match is again in Pallekele, where England have now won four T20s in a row in a matter of weeks. It is becoming a home far away from home in the Sri Lankan jungle.\n\nThe match will also be played on a fresh, unused pitch, which England will hope is more suited to clean-hitting. If not they, of course, have their own potent spin attack as Sunday's win showed.\n\nBut Pakistan's spin attack still looms large. It features 6ft 4in mystery spinner Usman Tariq, whose side-arm action and stop-start run-up is almost unique in world cricket.\n\nIt has been discussed at length throughout this tournament and Brook was seen mimicking his approach on Friday while England trained in the nets.\n\n\"It's just weird that he pauses more than anything,\" Bethell said last week.\n\n\"It's also interesting how they only use him after the 10-over mark.\n\n\"Maybe we try and put some pressure on them and see if they want to bring him on earlier - that might mess him up a bit.\"\n\nBanton is the only England batter to have faced Tariq before, having done so at the ILT20. He was dismissed by the lanky spinner and afterwards appeared to question the legitimacy of his bowling action.\n\nThe insights of Sam Curran, Tariq's ILT20 captain, and Buttler and Luke Wood, who played with him in the Abu Dhabi T10, may be useful.\n\nEngland should know what is coming.\n\nA threat they have rarely nullified stands between them and a World Cup semi-final.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "England's downturn in form has been steep and sudden. Why has their Six Nations campaign turned from Grand Slam dreams to a salvage job?",
    "fullText": "Don't believe the hyping. Or the sniping.\n\nIn the wake of England's 42-21 defeat by Ireland on Saturday, England head coach Steve Borthwick asked for some perspective.\n\n\"Two weeks ago, after 12 wins on the bounce, people were saying we were the best team in the world, and now we are all sorts of things,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\nWhat is true though is that England's form has taken a sudden and pronounced downturn.\n\nAfter a year-long winning streak, they have suffered back-to-back Six Nations defeats, having been swatted aside by Scotland at Murrayfield seven days before their trouncing by Ireland.\n\nWhy has England's bubble burst so emphatically?\n\nThis plea for the middle ground between praise and criticism is not something that England's coaching staff have invented to mitigate post-defeat criticism.\n\nEven before the start of the tournament, they were attempting to temper some of the predictions that England were building into world-beaters.\n\nTheir 12-match winning streak may have over-inflated expectations.\n\nIt undoubtedly contained some impressive wins, last November's victory over New Zealand being the standout. There were also caveats, however.\n\nThe All Blacks put in a curiously listless performance and subsequently sacked head coach Brett Robertson.\n\nA team weakened by British and Irish Lions selection won two Tests in Argentina, but the Pumas had taken the chance to rest some of their frontline names.\n\nWins over France and Scotland in last year's Six Nations could easily have crumbled in the opposite direction.\n\nEngland did superbly in seeing off all comers in that run. But this Six Nations campaign has demanded more of them and they have been found wanting.\n\nFor much of 2025, it felt as if Borthwick had found an edge.\n\nWith a change in rules around the escorting of chasing players, the aerial contest opened up.\n\nEngland were quickest to exploit it as a route deep into opposition territory, chasing hard, jumping high and claiming or batting back ball to exploit broken-field position.\n\nHowever, no advantage lasts long unchallenged. Not in an era of analysis and number-crunching.\n\nEngland's opposition has wised up.\n\nScotland and Ireland both fielded the backfield barrage, with catchers trumping England in the air and their energised team-mates well positioned to scoop up any loose-ball from spills.\n\nWith that tactic not bearing fruit, England either lacked a clear alternative or the nerve to switch to it mid-match.\n\nScotland made hay by moving the ball out wide and stretching England. Ireland punched holes through the middle and attacked with tempo and offloads.\n\nBorthwick's side could not find their own style to fit the contest.\n\nEngland's case has not been helped by injuries. As they have chased high balls, they have been doing so with clipped wings.\n\nImmanuel Feyi-Waboso, a threat on the ground and in the air, suffered a hamstring injury two days before the tournament opener against Wales. It is doubtful whether he will return before its end.\n\nTom Roebuck, another wing who prospers in the air, is only just back from a broken toe. He was brought back into action earlier than anticipated to cover Feyi-Waboso's absence, but his lack of preparation going into the tournament contributed to him missing the Ireland defeat.\n\nHenry Arundell is the only wing to start all three games for England, but the 23-year-old Bath flier's game is more centred around his scorching pace.\n\nA clumsy collision with opposite number Kyle Steyn while contesting a high ball in the Scotland defeat earned Arundell a 20-minute red card and cost England dear.\n\nSome of England's most trusted forwards looked tired in defeat by Ireland.\n\nCaptain Maro Itoje, who has been dealing with his mother's death as well as his usual sky-high workload, was withdrawn in the 55th minute of his 100th appearance for England.\n\nEllis Genge lacked his usual spiky physicality in the loose.\n\nTom Curry, usually a staple of England's best days and biggest occasions, was uncharacteristically quiet.\n\nAll three toured Australia with the British and Irish Lions in the summer.\n\nOf course, so did 16 Ireland players.\n\nBut perhaps the workload, both physical and mental, is catching up with some of England's key men faster.\n\nWing Tommy Freeman revealed in the build-up to the Ireland game that his Northampton coaches had spotted that he was short of his usual intensity on his return from Australia and sat him out of training and matches for a while.\n\nBorthwick reshuffled his coaching set-up after the summer, with senior assistant Richard Wigglesworth taking on the defence remit and Lee Blackett retained as attack coach after a successful stint in Argentina.\n\nThe one constant in Borthwick's time in charge has been change.\n\nWigglesworth follows Kevin Sinfield, Felix Jones, Joe El-Abd and Byron McGuigan (on secondment during last summer) as the fifth defence coach in less than three and a half years under Borthwick.\n\nGetting the right men in place is key. But philosophy and plans, even if evolutions rather than revolutions, take time to bed in.\n\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "description": "BBC Sport explores the unfolding security situation in Mexico and the potential impact on this summer's World Cup.",
    "fullText": "Mexico's co-hosting of this summer's Fifa World Cup could be compromised by the eruption in drug cartel violence which began on Sunday, experts have told BBC Sport.\n\nThe Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) drug cartel - one of the country's most powerful and feared criminal organisations - has engaged in gun shootouts with the Mexican military, blocked roads and burned vehicles in response to the killing of its leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, better known as 'El Mencho', in an army operation.\n\nViolence began in the central-western Jalisco state - where a code red security situation has been declared - and has now spread to at least a dozen more regions, with videos posted online showing gunmen patrolling streets and smoke billowing over cities.\n\nAt least 25 National Guard officers have been killed inside 24 hours.\n\nGuadalajara, capital city of Jalisco and home to more than a million people, is scheduled to host four matches at this summer's tournament. Another five are scheduled in Mexico City, and four in Monterrey.\n\n\"When you push down on the cartels you do get pushback - the danger is that it can be very difficult to manage a security situation that spirals out of control,\" says Javier Eskauriatza, assistant professor of criminal law at the University of Nottingham.\n\nThe power vacuum created by El Mencho's killing could lead to a period of instability and further conflict as contenders vie to replace him.\n\n\"In general the cartels have an economic interest in making sure the World Cup is peaceful,\" Dr Eskauriatza adds.\n\n\"Yes they pay off politicians and local police forces, but they also buy restaurants and own hotels. They are part of the economic system.\n\n\"It is useful for them if Brits, Americans, and others go to Mexico, spend their money and have a good time.\"\n\nBBC Sport has contacted Fifa for comment.\n\nThe CJNG is estimated to be worth more than £10bn and has tens of thousands of members. It has been responsible for a series of massacres, kidnappings and killings of politicians since its formation in 2009.\n\nBut some cartel figures retain a level of popularity within local communities in Mexico, as they provide financing for local infrastructure and facilities.\n\n\"The response by the CJNG is, in a way, required by the rules of the game - if you have your leader nabbed, you have to respond, otherwise you look weak\", says Dr. Eskauriatza.\n\n\"They are not idiots - they know that social media will film and amplify these videos for them and and they have made sure the response looks national.\"\n\nThe US government has advised Americans in Jalisco to shelter indoors until further notice, while fellow World Cup co-host nation Canada has cancelled flights to the Puerto Vallarta airport, and flight tracking apps showed many aeroplanes returning to their departure destinations around the world.\n\n\"In terms of tourists, I would say there will be a moderate risk for them\", says Dr. Karina Garcia-Reyes, senior lecturer in criminology at UWE Bristol.\n\n\"Unless more military operations are conducted this week, I would expect that the authorities in the most affected areas will be able address potential risks, so overall I would expect tourists to be safe as long as they follow the authorities' indications.\"\n\nSecurity planning for the World Cup has already been under scrutiny over the deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers to major US cities by President Donald Trump, leading to the killings of two US citizens by federal agents so far this year, and a series of mass protests.\n\nLast month, Football Supporters Europe said it was \"extremely concerned by the ongoing militarisation of police forces in the US\".\n\nNow eyes are on Mexico and whether it can guarantee the safety of travelling fans.\n\nFour football matches - two in the top flight and two in the second division - were postponed on Sunday because of the violence.\n\n\"People in Mexico are hoping that this is a one-off retaliation and that as the cartel reorganises itself, things will settle down,\" says Monica Serrano Carreto, professor of international relations at El Colegio de Mexico.\n\n\"But there is also a risk that this leads to a new period of instability, unpredictability and the violence continues.\n\n\"The type of weapons that the cartel has access to means that a military-style confrontation in the aftermath is inevitable - the government would have known that. We have seen in the past they [the cartel] even have weapons capable of shooting down helicopters.\n\n\"I think it will already have had an impact on how people view coming to Mexico because the images are top of the news around the world.\"\n\nMexico has been under increased political pressure to take action against cartels in the past year.\n\n\"This response is not unique but is very serious and very high scale,\" says Jon Benjamin, UK ambassador to Mexico between 2021 and 2024.\n\n\"President Trump has designated the cartels as terrorist organisations and Mexico has already handed over dozens of cartel figures to them. The Trump factor is very important in what is happening.\"",

    "fullText": "Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni has received a provisional one-match suspension after Real Madrid's Vinicius Jr reported alleged racist abuse during last week's Champions League meeting.\n\nIt means the Argentine winger is set to miss the second leg of the tie in Madrid on Wednesday (20:00 GMT).\n\nUefa has imposed the ban on a provisional basis, pending the result of a full investigation by an ethics and disciplinary inspector.\n\nThe European governing body said further punishment could be handed out once that investigation is completed.\n\nVinicius told referee Francois Letexier that he had been racially abused by the Argentina winger during the first leg of their Champions League knockout phase play-off tie in Lisbon last Tuesday.\n\nPrestianni has denied racially abusing the Brazilian, and Benfica said they would appeal against the decision despite the belief it is unlikely to have any \"practical effect\" before Wednesday's game.\n\nLast week's first leg was halted for 10 minutes after Vinicius alerted on-field official Letexier to the second-half incident, before he and his team-mates temporarily left the pitch.\n\nIt came after Vinicius, 25, scored a stunning goal and then received a yellow card for his celebrations in front of the Benfica supporters.\n\nBenfica manager Jose Mourinho, who is suspended for the second leg following his sending off later in the match, was criticised for his post-match comments after saying he believed that Vinicius had celebrated disrespectfully.\n\nBecause of his ban, Mourinho will not speak to the media before the match, with assistant coach Joao Tralhao undertaking media duties at the Bernabeu instead.\n\nUefa's action means that, as it stands, Prestianni will miss the second leg of the Madrid tie, even though the investigation is still to be completed.\n\nEuropean football's governing body said this is because there was enough evidence to support a \"prima facie violation\" based on the evidence available.\n\nIt added: \"This is without prejudice to any ruling that the Uefa disciplinary bodies may subsequently make following the conclusion of the ongoing investigation and its respective submission to the Uefa disciplinary bodies.\"\n\nResponding to the sanction, Benfica said it \"regrets being deprived of the player while the process is still under investigation\".\n\nThe club added it would launch an appeal \"even though the deadlines in question are unlikely to have any practical effect on the second leg of the Champions League play-off.\"\n\nBenfica also reaffirmed its commitment to combating all forms of racism and discrimination, values which it said \"are part of its historical identity and are reflected in its daily actions, its global community, the work of the Benfica Foundation, and major figures in the club's history, such as Eusebio\".\n\nAction was demanded of Uefa after the shameful scenes at the Estadio da Luz last week.\n\nAnd it has shown it is prepared to move quickly.\n\nEuropean football's governing body took just 16 hours to open a disciplinary case against Prestianni.\n\nThree working days later and he has been banned, pending the result of a full investigation.\n\nUefa's ethics and disciplinary inspector says there is a prima facie case against the Argentina international.\n\nIt means that on the initial assessment, the evidence presented is adequate to support the charge of using discriminatory language.\n\nIt might seem like a strange step, jumping the gun before a full ruling.\n\nBut Uefa has precedent for applying an interim ban in such a case. It shows it recognises when unacceptable behaviour requires fast action.\n\nIn 2021, Slavia Prague's Ondrej Kudela was accused of racially abusing Rangers' Glen Kamara in the second leg of a Europa League tie at Ibrox.\n\nMuch like Prestianni, the Czech Republic international had covered his mouth before approaching Kamara.\n\nIn identical timing to Prestianni, Uefa issued an interim one-game ban two days before Slavia Prague were scheduled to play Arsenal in the next round of the competition.\n\nEight days later, Kudela was banned for 10 games after Uefa found the case proven.\n\nUefa had to move faster this time because the next game was just a week away. But it has shown consistency in acting when the evidence demands it.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn says she nearly lost her leg after a heavy crash at the Winter Olympics - and has thanked the doctor who saved her from needing an amputation.\n\nThe American skiing great, 41, has had multiple operations since breaking her leg and ankle in the women's downhill event in Italy on 8 February.\n\nSpeaking in an Instagram video on Monday,, external she paid tribute to her surgeon for saving her leg and described the injury as \"the most extreme, painful and challenging\" of her career.\n\nVon said her leg was \"in pieces\" and that she had compartment syndrome, a pressure inside a muscle, which restricts blood flow - and that the surgeon performed a fasciotomy, an emergency operation, to relieve the pressure.\n\n\"Dr Tom Hackett saved my leg - he saved it from being amputated,\" she said.\n\n\"He cut open both sides of my leg, so it was open and let it breathe so to speak. He saved me.\"\n\nVonn, who returned to the United States last week after four operations in Italy, said she has now left hospital and been moved to a hotel, describing it as a \"huge step\".\n\nShe added that she will be in a wheelchair \"for a while\" because in addition to the broken leg, she has also broken her ankle.\n\nVonn was racing at the Olympics in Cortina nine days after rupturing ligaments in her left knee when she struck a gate 13 seconds into her downhill run.\n\nShe was airlifted off the piste and diagnosed with a complex tibia fracture in her left leg.\n\nHaving returned to the USA, Vonn explained she had a six-hour reconstructive operation on Wednesday, but also needed a blood transfusion as she had \"low haemoglobin due to all the blood loss and surgeries\".\n\nShe added: \"I turned a corner, and now I am out. It's going to be a long road, I'm in a wheelchair right now, very much immobile. I hope I can be on crutches in a little bit, but we'll see and be on them for at least two months.\"\n\nVonn said it could take a year for her bones to heal, adding: \"Then I will decide if I want to take out all the metal or not, and then go back into surgery and finally fix my ACL [anterior cruciate ligament].\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Monday permanently barred the release of special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into President Donald Trump’s hoarding of classified documents that led to charges once seen as the most perilous of the four criminal cases the Republican faced.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, granted a request from the president to keep under wraps the report on an investigation alleging Trump stored sensitive documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House following his first term and obstructed government efforts to get them back.\n\nSmith and his team produced a two-volume report on the classified documents investigation and a separate probe into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Joe Biden. Both investigations produced indictments that were abandoned by Smith’s team after Trump’s November 2024 election win in light of longstanding Justice Department legal opinions that say sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi had already determined that the report was “an internal deliberative communication that is privileged and confidential and should not be released” outside the Justice Department, according to court papers. The Trump administration has characterized Smith's investigation as politically motivated and said in recent court papers that the report belongs in the “dustbin of history.\"\n\nCannon's order, however, blocking the release also applies to Bondi's successors at the Justice Department. Cannon, who in 2024 dismissed the case after concluding that Smith was unlawfully appointed after multiple other favorable rulings for Trump, said the release of the report would present a “manifest injustice” to the president and his two co-defendants.\n\n“Special Counsel Smith, acting without lawful authority, obtained an indictment in this action and initiated proceedings that resulted in a final order of dismissal of all charges,” she wrote. “As a result, the former defendants in this case, like any other defendant in this situation, still enjoy the presumption of innocence held sacrosanct in our constitutional order.”\n\nA First Amendment group and watchdog organization that have been pressing for the report's release could presumably continue to fight in higher courts for it become public.\n\n“Judge Cannon’s decision to permanently block the release of this extraordinarily significant report is impossible to square with the First Amendment and the common law,” said Scott Wilkens, senior counsel at The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, one of the groups pushing for the public release of the report. “There is no legitimate basis for its continued suppression.”\n\nCannon wrote that though it is true that special counsels have historically released reports at the conclusion of their work, they have done so either after electing not to bring charges in a particular case or “after adjudications of guilt by plea or trial.\" Though Cannon suggested that an adjudication of guilt typically precedes the release of a special counsel report, there have been instances in which defendants charged by a special counsel have been acquitted at trial and the allegations against them have nonetheless been subsequently rehashed in a publicly released report.\n\nThe classified documents case was once considered the most serious of the four criminal cases against him. It accused Trump of repeatedly enlisting aides and lawyers to help him hide records demanded by investigators and cavalierly showing off a Pentagon “plan of attack” and classified map.\n\nThe first volume of Smith’s report on Trump’s 2020 election interference case was released last year shortly before Trump returned to the White House. Smith has defended his decision to bring those charges, saying he believes they would have resulted in a conviction had voters not elected Trump in 2024.\n\nCannon last year granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt the release of the report dealing with the classified documents case. That edict meant that Smith could not discuss the substance of that investigation when he testified last month before the House Judiciary Committee.",

    "fullText": "PANAMA CITY (AP) — The Panamanian government on Monday issued a decree ordering the occupation of two ports at the entrances of the Panama Canal, a move triggered by a final Supreme Court ruling that declared the operating concession held by Hong Kong-based company CK Hutchison unconstitutional.\n\nThe decree authorizes the Panama Maritime Authority to occupy the ports for “reasons of urgent social interest.” The occupation includes all movable property within or outside the Balboa and Cristóbal terminals, specifically covering cranes, vehicles, computer systems and software.\n\nThe saga surrounding the two Panamanian ports is part of a broader rivalry between the United States and China, in which the Central American country became caught in the middle after U.S. President Donald Trump accused China last year of “running the Panama Canal.”\n\nCK Hutchison was slated to sell the two ports to a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock, but this prompted swift intervention from the Chinese government, which halted the deal.\n\nIn January, Panama’s Supreme Court struck down the law approving the concession contract for Panama Ports Company, or PPC, a subsidiary of CK Hutchison. The ruling also invalidated an extension granted in 2021, stripping the port operations of any legal basis.\n\nPPC has operated these terminals since 1997, when the state awarded it the concession to manage the ports located at the Pacific and Atlantic entrances to the Panama Canal.\n\nPanama's government announced days ago that it will guarantee the continuity of port operations and job stability, and that APM Terminals, a subsidiary of the Danish group A.P. Moller-Maersk, would temporarily assume the administration of the terminals while a new contract is awarded.\n\nMeanwhile, CK Hutchison Holdings started arbitration proceedings against Panama under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. It’s unclear what the impact of the proceedings would be and how long they could take. It also threatened to sue APM Terminals, if it operates the concession. The Danish group responded that it's not a party to the legal proceedings.\n\nA PPC spokesperson told local media last week that the company was seeking an agreement with the Panamanian government to continue operating.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "fullText": "The dollar declined against foreign currencies. Stocks in Asia and Europe broadly sold off, and S&P 500 futures were down 0.22% before the open in New York as investors began to realize that the fallout from the U.S. Supreme Court’s tariff decision, and President Donald Trump’s reaction to it, is going to be more complex than traders initially thought. \n\nGoldman Sachs also reported that its in-house “Risk Appetite Indicator” had sunk back from its recent peak.\n\nIn that context, investors fled—again—to the safe haven of gold, which rose 1.81% this morning and looked to be making an attempt at a new record high.\n\nHow are global markets reacting to Trump's tariff proposals?\n\nWhy are countries postponing U.S. trade deal negotiations?\n\nWhat makes gold attractive during trade policy uncertainty?\n\nWhat trade law sections could Trump use for tariffs?\n\nAt first glance, ending the tariffs looked broadly good for stocks because it makes international trade easier and cheaper for companies. Unsurprisingly, the S&P 500 closed up 0.69% on Friday.\n\nBut after Trump said he would propose new tariffs of 10%, and then changed his mind and made it 15%, analysts began to realize that some of the things Trump might do next could be more extreme than his “Liberation Day” tariffs and will certainly be more complex.\n\nAs UBS’s Paul Donovan put it, “Welcome back uncertainty.”\n\nBNP analyst William Bratton published a research note summarizing Trump’s options. “Some of these could be highly punitive,” he said:\n\nSection 122 of the 1974 Trade Act is valid only for the next 150 days and must then be extended by Congress. It is not applicable to agricultural products, metals, minerals, chemicals, oil, gas, pharmaceuticals, aircraft, some electronics, and various automobiles.\n\nSection 301 tariffs “have no upper limit, have proved to be highly sticky once implemented (as with those imposed on China in 2018), and could, in theory, be applied to any country that does not agree to a trade agreement with the U.S. that embeds higher tariffs,” Bratton wrote.\n\nSection 232 tariffs also “have no upper limit and can be expanded in scope once implemented. Trump has already used this law to expand and raise the tariffs on multiple products—most notably on cars and car parts—and various Section 232 investigations are currently ongoing including into semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.”\n\nBratton argued that Asian companies will react by increasingly detaching themselves from U.S. trade. “We expect U.S. trade policy…to become increasingly complex and more targeted resulting in a patchwork of tariff measures and trade agreements…the global economy will continue to fragment with U.S. trade flows steadily becoming less important as Asian trade becomes increasingly more regional in nature,” he told clients.",

    "fullText": "At this point in the Nancy Guthrie investigation, it feels like all possibilities have to be explored. Guthrie, the mother of Today show host Savannah Guthrie, disappeared sometime between the night of January 31 and the morning of February 1st, with law enforcement confirming she has been kidnapped.\n\nMultiple ransom notes have been received, though police have been unable to verify them. And though there has been some movement in the investigation, with police releasing photos and surveillance video of one suspect as well as a description and finding a glove that they hoped could have DNA evidence, it feels like, at this point, no one really has a concrete idea of what exactly happened.\n\nNew Nancy Guthrie Ransom Note Reportedly Included 'Proof of Life' After Trump Threatened Her Kidnappers With the Death Penalty if They Killed Her\n\nSavannah Guthrie Reportedly Suspicious of Sheriff Investigating Mom's Abduction as He Gives His 1st Televised Interview-She Doesn't Want This 'Sensationalized'\n\nNow, law enforcement is expanding the search. Yesterday, volunteers recovered a backpack that was handed over to authorities. And they’re continuing the search. Tucson resident Lupita Tello told reporters, “If it smells bad like something decomposed, that’s where we start.”\n\nHer group, Madres Buscadoras de Sonora, a non-profit from Mexico, is one of many groups volunteering to help with the search.\n\nPima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said in an interview on Feb. 21 that DNA found on Guthrie’s property was mixed, aka it came from more than one person, which made identification harder. The DNA evidence is still undergoing testing, and no suspects have yet been named.\n\nWhere does that leave the investigation? Jonny Grusing, who worked in the FBI’s Denver Division for 25 years, told Fox News Digital that there is reason to believe the suspect lured Nancy out of her house, based on the publicly available information.\n\nGrusing said about the video footage, “The first thing [the suspect] does is with his glove, and with his glove, it doesn’t look like he’s trying to take [the doorbell camera] off. It looks like he’s trying to cover it with his right hand. And then he looks down, he looks around, and he gets the branches, and he puts the branches up in front of it.”\n\n“Is there a chance, since we don’t have audio, that he is either knocking on the door loudly or that he has pressed the ring doorbell, [that] he’s trying to get Nancy to answer the door, and he’s shielding himself from being seen as a masked person, so she will, in her confusion, open the door?”\n\nGrusing also pointed to reports of blood spatter being found on the porch and driveway as proof that Nancy Guthrie was likely lured outside, and said the gun the suspect was carrying might have been a prop to frighten Nancy. This possibility had been suggested before, because of where the suspect was carrying the gun and how hard it would be to fire it with gloves on.\n\n“So, if the gun’s a prop, if he’s shielding himself from being seen, if he’s actually ringing the doorbell or knocking on the door, getting her to come, he wants to confront her about something in my opinion,” Grusing said, implying the suspect could have had a personal grievance with Nancy.\n\n“I’m just trying to use the experiences of different cases and trying to apply any sort of logic to this in the hopes that someone from the public who has thought it might be someone they know whether it’s his family or whether now it’s a coworker or friend or associate or whatever, to put that one puzzle piece together that says, ‘Yes, and now I think it could be him.’”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "fullText": "Ofgem says about 140 proposed projects, driven by AI use, could require more power than current peak demand\n\nThe amount of power being sought by new datacentre projects in Great Britain would exceed the national current peak electricity consumption, according to an industry watchdog.\n\nOfgem said about 140 proposed datacentre schemes, driven by use of artificial intelligence, could require 50 gigawatts of electricity – 5GW more than the country’s current peak demand.\n\nThe figure was revealed in an Ofgem consultation on demand for new connections to the power grid. It pointed to a “surge in demand” for connection applications between November 2024 and June last year, with a significant number coming from datacentres. This has exceeded even the most ambitious forecasts.\n\nMeanwhile, new renewable energy projects are not being connected to the grid at the pace they are being built to help meet the government’s clean energy targets by the end of the decade.\n\nOfgem said the work required to connect surging numbers of datacentres could mean delays for other projects that are “critical for decarbonisation and economic growth”. Datacentres are the central nervous system of AI tools such as chatbots and image generators, playing a vital role in training and operating products such as ChatGPT and Gemini.\n\nThe rapid rise in energy consumption could also make it more difficult for the UK to meet its target to create a virtually carbon-free power system by 2030, which is already in doubt amid concerns over the rising cost of the country’s electricity.\n\nThe Guardian revealed last year that a vast datacentre proposed for Elsham in Lincolnshire could cause more greenhouse gas emissions than five international airports.\n\nAlthough some tech bosses and climate experts believe AI could help the fight against global heating by making power grids work more efficiently or accelerating the development of new zero-carbon technologies, there are widespread concerns that in the near-term datacentres will drive demand for fossil fuels to meet their energy demands.\n\nOfgem also said unviable applications for grid access could block progress for important datacentre bids, such as those related to the government’s AI growth zones. The zones, touted as offering a streamlined planning process and help in accessing energy, were announced last year as part of plans to increase the UK’s adoption of AI.\n\nThe regulator has proposed tougher financial tests for datacentre developers to join the queue to connect to the grid, in order to avoid creating a backlog of projects that do not have sufficient funding in place delaying viable projects that are further down in the queue.\n\nOfgem said datacentres must be central to any changes to the application process for electricity connections, describing the issue as a “global challenge” and saying there was no mechanism for prioritising projects deemed strategically import by ministers.\n\nThe regulator is considering charging datacentre providers for access to an energy connection – via a deposit or a nonrefundable fee – that could also deter “nonviable” projects that would otherwise clog up the application process. Ofgem is also exploring whether datacentre developers should pay for, and build, their own grid access, which would “accelerate connections and deliver better outcomes for consumers”.",

    "fullText": "Amid talk of artificial intelligence taking our jobs, the big unasked question is: how will we be fed?\n\nHow will we be fed? That’s the biggest question not seriously being addressed amid all this talk about whether or not artificial intelligence will end up taking over all of our jobs.\n\nFormidable though the technology appears, similar fears have popped up repeatedly since the Industrial Revolution, and most working-age adults remain employed. Still, what is sorely missing is a serious debate about what to do if this future in fact materializes.\n\nFor Open AI’s Sam Altman “the future can be vastly better than the present” because AI will make us stinking rich. But that seems like a risky assumption, for almost everyone except Altman and his fellow techno-oligarchs.\n\nEven if AI generates enormous economic prosperity, its distribution will remain a political challenge. This juncture calls for a serious, open debate about how the fruits of this prosperity will be apportioned among humanity.\n\nAddressing the question has two parts. The first is about how to design a technically efficacious system to redistribute the fruits of the economy as machines take over and labor’s share of income drops eventually near zero.\n\nThe more important question, though, is about how this economic reorganization will restructure power. Who will decide what to tax once AI destroys labor income, which provides the main source of government revenue in most advanced countries? Who decides how much everyday people who do not have an equity stake in the AI revolution get to consume?\n\nHow will society be organized in a world in which machines generate most or all economic output and a few dozen techno-billionaires get to decide what share of the world’s resources – money, energy, minerals – should be allocated to further expand superhuman intelligence? Who else gets a say on whether to direct more resources to, say, healthcare or agriculture, or education instead?\n\n“We need guardrails that preserve human agency, human oversight and human accountability,” noted United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi last week. The future of AI “cannot be decided by a handful of countries or left to the whims of a few billionaires”.\n\nIn AI circles, there is a lively debate about the “alignment” challenge – ensuring that the machines operate in ways that serve the goals of whoever runs them. The bigger challenge is to align the goals of AI systems and their owners with the broader goals of society. AIs will do lots of things of consequence to all of us. Our democratic governance tools seem too feeble to constrain the urges of the oligarchs at the helm of these new technologies.\n\nTechnological change drove democracy’s spread around the world as the rise of an urban working class proved indispensable to the economy and political systems adjusted to represent them. But if the work of ordinary people becomes irrelevant, what happens to people’s power to affect their system of government?\n\nAnton Korinek and Lee Lockwood of the University of Virginia put together a primer with ideas about how public finance might work in the AI era. They propose that consumer taxes will pick up the slack at first, as labor income shrinks to zero. In a world dominated by artificial superintelligence, though, the footprint of human consumption would shrink as most of the returns from machines’ economic output were reinvested, calling for a tax on capital to shoulder most of the burden.\n\nMaybe taxes could also be used to slow down the transition. Another idea discussed by Korinek and Joe Stiglitz from Columbia University is that in early stages, when human labor retains its relevance, taxes could be used to steer tech investments toward technologies that help workers do their jobs better rather than replace them. Korinek and Lockwood propose other taxes, on fixed factors like land, spectrum or data, or monopoly rents, that add nothing to society’s wellbeing.\n\nIt sounds doable. The problem is that the owners of these disruptive technologies must be convinced to do something that does not come naturally to them: share. Taxes in the US amount to less than 26% of GDP, eight percentage points less than the OECD average. Capital taxation amounts to just over 2% of GDP. These numbers will have to go much higher, since people will no longer have wages to live on and will rely more heavily on government largesse.\n\nDon’t hold your breath. The OECD’s global tax deal, finalized in 2021, was designed to curtail the ability of American tech companies such as Amazon, Google and Meta to engage in tax shifting, parking profits in the lowest tax jurisdiction they could find. But while the Biden administration was broadly supportive of the deal, Donald Trump – whose campaign benefited from nearly $400m in donations from various tech oligarchs – unilaterally withdrew in early 2025.\n\nUnusual ideas may be called for to keep society afloat, given the scale and breadth of the expected AI revolution. One would be to directly distribute the equity of artificial intelligence ventures. Taxes might be collected in shares rather than cash, to amass a public stake over time. Rather than tax the returns on AI investments, a more radical proposal would be for the government to expropriate a chunk of equity upfront to redistribute among the population and directly grant Americans a share in AI’s promised cornucopia.\n\n“If AI development stalls, returns remain modest; if AI transforms the economy, returns are likely to rise,” Korineck and Lockwood wrote. “This automatic adjustment proves valuable given radical uncertainty surrounding AI development.”\n\nBut these big ideas face big challenges. Governments will have to act before artificial intelligence gets too big, which seems unlikely in the current climate.\n\nThe technology oligarchs at the helm of this revolution have also vigorously resisted government efforts to curb their power or take their cash. Despite her best efforts, Silicon Valley nemesis Lina Kahn was largely unable to crack tech monopolies during her stint as President Joe Biden’s main trustbuster at the head of the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nIn the meantime, the moneyed in Silicon Valley are not only mobilizing vast resources to steer American politics. As a plan B they are working to build their own “network-states”, whether in Greenland or Nigeria, Honduras or the Caribbean island of Nevis, hoping to evade democratic governance if they can’t get their way under America’s democracy.\n\nWho knows what they might do when they have replaced all human labor. If artificial intelligence grows as powerful as Silicon Valley’s oligarchs expect it to become, the only available strategy to keep us all fed in the world after work might be to go hat in hand and ask the moguls, politely.",

    "fullText": "Last Week Tonight host delved into the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in relation to the Epstein files and Musk’s poisonous ownership of X\n\nOn his new episode of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver wasted no time digging into the files related to late pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, which have once again ensnared former prince Andrew.\n\nAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as he is now known after being stripped of his royal titles for his connection to Epstein, was arrested last week – the first arrest of a senior member of the royal family in modern history – on allegations that that he had shared confidential material with Epstein while serving as a UK trade envoy.\n\n“It’s true, they arrested former prince Andrew, and I don’t know why they’re still going with ‘alleged’ connections to Epstein there, while also running a photo that makes them look like the two closest friends I’ve ever seen,” Oliver laughed. “It looks like they’re brainstorming a new podcast. It looks like Andrew’s soft-launching: ‘Hey, would it be crazy if we moved in together?’ I’m just saying, maybe drop the ‘alleged’ part when you’re dealing with two guys that look so close they could finish each other’s prison sentences.\n\n“And if you’re thinking: ‘Well, what was the new revelation that did it? Was it the grotesque new photo of Andrew on all fours over a young woman?’ Incredibly, no, it was apparently this.”\n\nEmails released by the US justice department appear to show that Mountbatten-Windsor shared reports of official visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore, as well as confidential investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Afghanistan’s Helmand province.\n\n“Yeah, they got him on forwarding documents, which is a little underwhelming,” said Oliver. “Though, to be honest, when it comes to bringing down monsters, I don’t really care if it’s for a boring computer crime, the same way I’m not that mad if what finally ends a toddler throwing a tantrum is a cardboard box [on his head]. The method doesn’t matter. What’s important is you have been stopped.\n\n“Now, Andrew has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing and has been released, although that does not mean he’s been found not guilty,” Oliver added, next to the now widely circulated photo of Mountbatten-Windsor upon release, slumped in the backseat of a car. “All we really have to go on right now is this fantastic picture of him leaving custody, and you can draw your own conclusions there. Reasonable people can disagree on whether this makes him look guilty – or dead.”\n\nIn his main segment, Oliver pivoted to another man caught up in the Epstein scandal: Elon Musk, and specifically the many problems with Musk’s role as the owner of Twitter, the social media site he bought (and renamed X) for $44bn in October 2022. Oliver recalled how Musk arrived at Twitter HQ on his first day carrying a sink, then posted “let that sink in”. – “a joke so funny, I’m still laughing right now”, he deadpanned.\n\n“No one is saying Twitter was perfect before Elon arrived,” Oliver continued. “It helped platform a lot of ugliness, including but not limited to our first shit-poster president.\n\n“But it is genuinely worse now” as a “a sewer of misinformation” with “verified” blue checks for sale. Since taking over Twitter, Musk slashed its global trust and safety staff, reduced its full-time content moderators by over 50% and reinstated the accounts of several white supremacists. Oliver cited several independent studies that found Musk’s X boosted rightwing accounts, as well as tweets from Musk himself. “At this point, it seems like there’s one option if you never want to hear anything from Elon Musk, and that’s to be his coolest child,” Oliver joked, referring to Musk’s estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who is transgender.\n\n“Twitter thumbing the scale toward Elon’s interests is bad for multiple reasons, not limited to his godawful jokes, his history of invoking extreme ideas like the antisemitic ‘great replacement theory’ and the fact that he was apparently a driver of US election misinformation in 2024,” he added. “But perhaps the biggest cause for concern is the fact that our current government is troublingly dependent on Elon’s platform. The Trump administration is painfully online, and particularly on Twitter.” JD Vance has described himself as a “Grok guy”, referring to Musk’s much-maligned AI bot. The FBI director, Kash Patel, has fumbled investigations by prematurely announcing arrests on X. And an infamous photo of the situation room from the US operation in Venezuela showed Pete Hegseth navigating a Twitter search for “Venezuela”.\n\nAs one White House staffer told the New Yorker: “If we have something that’s popular in rightwing Twitter, the White House is acting on it 90-plus percent of the time.”\n\n“The fact is, a massive media platform has been shaped in the image of its poisonous owner,” Oliver said. “And it doesn’t seem like Elon’s gonna see the error of his ways anytime soon, seeing his brain seems to be thoroughly cooked by the garbage he consumes on his own site. To be honest, he still doesn’t seem to have a vision of what Twitter should be.” Asked in a recent interview why his vision of “a collective consciousness” was important, Musk fumbled for several seconds, eventually coming up with “the why of it I guess is that so … we can increase our understanding of the universe.”\n\n“It seems like the odds of Elon fixing this are pretty slim, meaning all we can really control is how we each interact with Twitter,” Oliver surmised. His personal advice? Don’t post at all.\n\n“There are certain areas, like news in particular, where Twitter is now worse than useless,” he said. “In fact, for breaking news, it is an active liability, as people routinely push out false information in the wake of tragedies and crises, often for money, and there don’t seem to be many guardrails to stop them.\n\n“All of which is really a long way of saying that the Twitter that we may have once relied on and the Twitter that was fun and occasionally useful is just well and truly gone,” he concluded. “And collectively, while it might be sad, it might be past time for all of us to, if I may borrow a truly poisoned phrase, let that sink in.”",

    "fullText": "Formula E is aiming to expand the calendar further for the arrival of Gen4 cars in the 2026-27 season, which is set to feature 18 to 19 races.\n\nThe ongoing 2025-26 campaign already features a record 17 races across 11 venues with the addition of Madrid and Sanya, although Jakarta has been dropped.\n\nWhile the final 2025-26 calendar wasn’t announced until October last year, Formula E is working hard to finalise the schedule for the first season under Gen4 regulations.\n\nWith the new breed of Formula E cars set to be both bigger and more powerful than their predecessors, the championship is holding talks with various promoters to ensure the track layouts are both safe and conducive to racing.\n\nFormula E is planning to submit the calendar to FIA’s World Motor Sport Council for approval in March, a month before it officially showcases its Gen4 car to the public as part of a mega launch event.\n\nAsked how many cities Formula E is expected to visit in 2026-27, Formula E’s chief championship officer Alberto Longo told Motorsport.com: “If I have to tell you a figure, I would most likely go for 18, 18 to 19 races. That would mean 12 to 13 venues.”\n\nFormula E CEO Jeff Dodds reiterated the series’ plan to gradually expand its schedule, saying it aims to stage as many as 22 races a year by the end of the decade.\n\n“I've always said we aim to add at least one race a year out to 2030, and if we do that, we'll have between 20 and 22 races by the time we get to 2030, which I think is about the right number for us,” Dodds told Motorsport.com.\n\nSince the inception of the championship, Formula E has held races at six different venues in the United States, including three different circuits – permanent or temporary – in Miami alone.\n\nWhile Miami Autodrome is expected to again feature on the 2026-27 calendar after making its debut in January this year, Formula E has also been holding talks  for up to four years for a second venue in the US.\n\nBoth Longo and Dodds say negotiations have reached a stage where hosting two races in the US now seems realistic, with North America remaining an important market for Formula E.\n\n“I would say we are 70-80% there, so most likely it will happen,” Longo said when asked about the chances of another US city joining Miami on the calendar.\n\n“We are talking with six cities at the moment in the US. We have had conversations with 11, but at the moment we are talking to six different cities.”\n\n“A second race in the US is very realistic,” Dodds added. “I've always said two races in China and two races in North America. There's a slight difference between North America and the US because they're different things.”\n\nFormula E is understood to be evaluating both street circuits and permanent tracks in North America, including Toronto in Canada, as it moves to finalise the calendar over the next month.\n\n“We like Phoenix as a street circuit, we've met the team there many times; we looked at Atlanta as a street race, we've talked to Detroit, we've talked to Denver, we've talked to Toronto, CoTA in Austin, Laguna Seca we've looked at,” Dodds revealed.\n\n“The beauty of the US is it's got so many good locations, we're looking at lots of them.\n\n“We've got a narrowed-down list of two or three [venues], but I'm pretty confident we would want Miami on the calendar for next year.\n\n“We learnt a lot from the first Miami race, we'd love that to be a home and then to introduce a second long-term home as well.”\n\nFormula E to adopt WEC-style ‘joker’ upgrade system for Gen4\n\nMahindra to begin Gen4 testing in May after delayed board approval\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

He has a shot at redemption.\n\nMLB.com's Bryan Hoch goes so far as to predict Bird as the ideal dark horse to find his way onto the Opening Day roster.\n\n\"Bird allowed seven runs (six earned) in two innings after being acquired from the Rockies last July, then spent the rest of the year in Triple-A,\" Hoch writes. \"That wasn’t the best first impression, but the 30-year-old looks different early in camp, crediting a full offseason working with the Yankees' pitching department. If he continues to generate ground balls and whiffs, Bird could be a nice bullpen find.\"\n\nMORE: Yankees making history not done since 1889 Chicago White Stockings\n\nThat had been of a surprisingly bad small sample size for Bird.\n\nHe had a 4.73 ERA with the Rockies before being traded to the Bronx, which you'd think is at least a little inflated by playing at Coors Field. Bird was also striking out 10.5 batters per nine innings in 2025.\n\nHis strikeout metrics last season were by far the best of his career, so the fear for Yankees fans would be that he was pitching over his head and simply regressed to who he had been before.\n\nBird was desired by more than just the Yanks at the deadline, though. Teams believe in his stuff.\n\nHe very well could prove to be a solid acquisition for New York, just with a bit of a delay in the return on investment.\n\nTeam USA has a finalized WBC roster and an awesome lineup\n\nDominican Republic WBC roster is loaded with stars\n\nAn Edwin Diaz nightmare looms for the Mets\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nHow Jose Ramirez is on pace to become Cleveland's Derek Jeter\n\nYankees have signed a catcher from the country of Hungary",

    "fullText": "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford has been dealt a major setback in his bid to complete a permanent move to Barcelona after a candid admission by presidential candidate Xavier Vilajoana.\n\nRashford has enjoyed a dramatic uptick in form and fortunes since he left United last summer and sealed a season-long loan switch to Barcelona.\n\nHaving been exiled from the first team by now-sacked head coach Ruben Amorim, Rashford faced an uphill task to get back into form, but he certainly made light work of it. He wasted no time in breaking into the Barcelona team and becoming a key player in their push to defend their La Liga crown.\n\nThe England international has made 21 top-flight appearances this term, contributing an impressive four goals and eight assists. He has notched 10 goals and 13 assists across all competitions.\n\nBarcelona retain the option to keep him permanently for £26million. There had been suggestions that the Blaugrana wanted to negotiate a fee reduction but United have made it clear that they will not slash their asking price.\n\nMeanwhile, Rashford has made no secret of his desire to stay at Camp Nou. However, a report covered by The Peoples Person relayed that a deal is contingent on Joan Laporta winning the upcoming presidential elections. Laporta, who sanctioned a swoop for Rashford last summer, has made keeping the forward a cornerstone of his re-election agenda.\n\nNow, another candidate has dealt a blow to Rashford, indicating that if he wins, he is likely to prioritise a move for Jan Virgili ahead of Rashford.\n\nBarcelona sold Virgili to Mallorca a year ago. He has done well there, currently boasting six assists for them in La Liga during his first season of senior football. Rashford boasts better numbers but is nine years older.\n\nVilajoana, who was head of La Masia while Virgili was coming through the ranks, said [as quoted by the Manchester Evening News], “I am someone who believes you should always look in-house first, as I’ve always said, and then look outside depending on the characteristics of the players you have.”\n\n“For example, I want to give the example of Jan Virgili, who is currently playing for Mallorca. He’s a great winger. I would maybe look at [exercising the clause to re-sign him] as an option, for example, rather than paying the Rashford clause.”\n\n“That said, it’s not just the president who arrives and makes the decision. The president arrives, puts things on the table, alternatives are considered, it’s discussed, and a decision is made.”\n\nHe added, “What I am clear on is that if [signing Rashford] is considered to be the best decision from a sporting point of view, the money will be there to make it happen.”\n\nMeanwhile, United return to action this evening when they face Everton at the Hill Dickinson Stadium. Kick-off is at 8pm.\n\nFeatured image Mike Hewitt via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Jacob Bridgeman has opened up on what Tiger Woods said to him after he won the Genesis Invitational at Riviera on Sunday, picking up his first-ever PGA Tour win.\n\nIf you had told viewers before the final round of the Genesis Invitational that it would be decided by a single shot, they might have assumed Jacob Bridgeman had let it slip.\n\nThe 26-year-old entered the final day at Riviera with a six-shot lead and was rarely under serious pressure until late in the round.\n\nIt came down to a four-foot par putt on the last, which he rolled in to hold off Kurt Kitayama and Rory McIlroy and got to shake hands with Tiger Woods afterwards.\n\nHolding his nerve, Bridgeman successfully secured his maiden victory at one of the PGA Tour’s most iconic venues.\n\nRiviera has proven a tough venue for even the biggest names in golf. Jack Nicklaus, Scottie Scheffler, and McIlroy have all left without a trophy there.\n\nAnd even Woods never got his hands on that title. After the final round, Bridgeman shared what the 15-time major champion said to him about it during their conversation.\n\n“I don’t know what he said when I first walked up the hill, but walking down the hill he was saying kind of how amazing walking down and seeing the amphitheater and all the people, how amazing the 18th hole is here and how cool it is to win here. And he said, You’ve got one on me. So I guess he’s never won yet. I got one thing. He’s got all the other ones, but I got one,” the 26-year-old said.\n\nIt would have been a huge boost for the PGA Tour had Woods been able to play this week. Even though he is no longer at his peak, his presence still draws more attention than anyone else in the sport.\n\nPlayers around the tour still seem to be in awe of the 50-year-old, and Bridgeman spoke about what it meant to win at an event hosted by Woods.\n\n“Knowing he was the one to be waiting to shake the winner’s hand made it definitely a little bit more nerve-racking just because when I was growing up, my youngest golf memory was watching him on TV. When he was in his prime, I was learning to talk and walk and play golf.\n\n“He’s the best player of all time by far. I think some of the things that he’s done on the golf course are incredible, will never be beaten. I’m still kind of in awe of him, and if you ever wanted to pass some time, just look up some Tiger Woods highlights, it’s pretty incredible,” he concluded.\n\nJacob Bridgeman reacts to Trevor Lawrence and Dabo Swinney messages after Genesis Invitational win\n\nJordan Spieth makes firm vow to avoid repeat on PGA Tour after controversy in 2025",

    "fullText": "Viktor Gyokeres was the star of the show and the Player of the Match winner in Arsenal’s 4-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, scoring a brace to reach double figures for Premier League goals this season.\n\nSpeaking after the game, former Arsenal forward Theo Walcott praised Gyokeres’ performance as one of the best he’s seen from the player this season.\n\n“Not just the goals, I felt today he really commanded that position,” Walcott told Sky Sports. “What was smart, at no point did he go see van de Ven. He knew where the weakness was in that Tottenham team.”\n\n“He showed everything that we expect him to bring to this league,” Walcott added. “He brought the best out of the other players around him as well. And that’s what we want to see, that’s what we expected to see coming into this league.\n\n“Massive signing, it’s one of those where you want to give him time, but if they want to win the league he hasn’t been fortunate to have that time. For me, that was the best performance I’ve ever seen from him.\n\n“They played to his strengths today and I think that’s when you’re going to get the best out of Gyokeres. Very confident right now, and that’s what they’re going to need.”\n\nWalcott is right to suggest it wasn’t just Gyokeres’ two goals that made it a good display.\n\nThe striker had an early header well blocked, he went close with a curling effort towards the far post, he set up a great chance for William Saliba with a clever corner routine, and his lay-off to Bukayo Saka ultimately led to Arsenal’s third goal – scored by Eberechi Eze.\n\nGyokeres has certainly had games this season where he’s been less impactful, but he easily could have been involved in three or four goals on this occasion. As for the two he did score, they were both very well taken and well deserved.",

    "fullText": "American hockey history isn’t just a collection of wins and losses — it’s a story about belief, identity, and moments that seemed to stop time. For many fans, everything begins with the stunning triumph at the 1980 Winter Olympics, when a team of young, largely unknown Americans shocked the world under the leadership of Herb Brooks. That victory didn’t just elevate a program — it transformed how the country saw itself on the ice. Suddenly, hockey wasn’t a niche northern pastime; it was a stage where American grit and possibility could shine.\n\nIn the decades since, the sport has evolved dramatically. New generations of players — men and women alike — have pushed the United States into consistent global contention. Rivalries intensified, particularly with Canada, and Olympic tournaments became emotional touchstones that fans still replay in their minds years later. Each era has delivered moments that felt defining in their own way: heartbreaking near-misses, redemptive victories, and performances that inspired young players across the country to lace up skates for the first time.\n\nThat long arc of growth reached a remarkable milestone at the 2026 Winter Olympics, where American hockey achieved something once almost unimaginable. By then, the sport in the United States had matured into a powerhouse — deeper, faster, and more confident than ever before.\n\nLooking back across these moments reveals more than highlights. It shows how a program grew from a miracle into a sustained force — and how certain games became shared national memories.\n\nLong before Olympic spotlights and sold-out arenas, this was where American women’s hockey first proved what it could become. The team played with the quiet confidence of pioneers — athletes who knew they were building something bigger than one tournament. Winning the inaugural title didn’t just earn a medal; it established belief, identity, and momentum. In hindsight, it feels like the first brick in the foundation of everything that followed.\n\nThis team felt young, fast, and just a little fearless — the kind of group that grows on fans game by game. Their run to the final built a sense that something special might be unfolding, especially as they kept rising to every challenge. The championship game ended in heartbreak when Sidney Crosby scored in overtime, a moment that stung instantly. Still, it felt less like an ending and more like a signal that American men’s hockey had fully rejoined the world’s elite.\n\nPlaying at home brought enormous energy — and enormous pressure. Every shift felt magnified, every bounce louder, every mistake heavier. Falling short in the gold medal game hurt deeply, especially in front of a home crowd that believed all the way. But that loss hardened the program, sharpening a competitive edge that would define the next two decades.\n\nYears of frustration finally found release in one of the most dramatic finishes the sport has seen. In the shootout, Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson skated in with patience and pulled off a move so smooth it looked almost unreal. Then Maddie Rooney held steady under crushing pressure, sealing the win with calm composure. The celebration felt less like a party and more like a collective exhale after years of chasing redemption.\n\nEverything about this moment felt brand new — the Olympic stage, the spotlight, the chance to define a sport’s future in real time. The Americans embraced that pressure and played like they intended to set the standard from day one. Winning the first Olympic gold in women’s hockey instantly gave the program identity and confidence. It felt like watching a rivalry — and a legacy — begin right before the world’s eyes.\n\nThis was the kind of achievement people used to imagine but never quite expect to see — total Olympic supremacy in both tournaments. The men delivered a tense overtime victory, finished by Jack Hughes and preserved by a brilliant performance from Connor Hellebuyck. The women matched the drama, rallying late as Hilary Knight forced overtime before Megan Keller struck the championship winner. Taken together, the wins felt historic not just for the medals — but for what they said about how far American hockey had come.\n\nFew sporting moments feel frozen in time the way this one does. A group of young Americans, many barely known outside hockey circles, faced a global powerhouse and simply refused to be intimidated. Guided by coach Herb Brooks, they played with relentless belief until the impossible became real. When the clock finally ran out, it felt like an entire country had experienced the same surge of joy all at once.\n\nFrom improbable beginnings to historic dominance, the biggest moments in American hockey trace a powerful evolution. What started as a single, unforgettable shock to the world gradually became a pattern of excellence built over generations. Together, these milestones don’t just mark victories — they tell the story of how belief turned into legacy.\n\nOLYMPICS: Team USA flag bearers revealed for 2026 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony\n\nNFL: Predicting the 2026 NFL free agent signings\n\nMLB: Detroit Tigers drop unreal alternate jerseys for 2026 MLB season\n\nNBA: Charlotte Hornets share update after LaMelo Ball’s car crash\n\nNHL: 2026 Winter Olympics men’s hockey, NHL payrolls for final four teams\nSPORTS MEDIA: Olympics reporter apologizes for drinking, slurring words during live segment\n\nThe post From ‘Miracle on Ice’ to 2026: Ranking America’s biggest hockey moments appeared first on The Big Lead.",

THAT’S the difference between this lack of rotation and Angeball; no willing recipients for the wall-pass or first-touch layoff. Negan doesn’t play that type of game – he appears intermittently if at all, like Sweden’s Brig O’ Doon. To be fair, The Ox did help Calmac stage some of our best football of the game.

Only grim late, and crucial, loss for the first time since his return, sabotaged by the ludge scum. Only quibble I had was Tut off and Yang getting extended minutes when he was hapless as an attacking force.

Make no excuses for them. Don’t fall for any SMSM sophistry that would excuse their craven deceit – those mobsters seized on, distorted and exploited a nothing incident to derail a Celtic title bid. To hell with  their duplicity, their pretensions to rationale. A venomous curse on their bloodlines.\n\nA view of Celtic Park Celtic v Hibernian, Scottish Premiership, 22 February 2026.

As mentioned briefly above…Hibs are decent and we fell to a mental lapse for the opener. But the recovery and focus was good, the pressure from half-time to the ridiculous underhand sabotage was staging a win. I thought had we nailed the second, a third would surely have followed as Hibs resilience crumbled…\n\nA view of Celtic Park Celtic v Hibernian, Scottish Premiership, 22 February 2026.

But as a performance versus a capable SPL opponent with a full complement, I’m not condemning anyone; after a tussle, the game was looking like ours or a frustrating point at least. Now we find ourselves on the back foot after a chance to take the top. And Hibs find themselves the architects of their greatest rivals’ most joyous Sunday of the season. Only Hibs could win at Celtic Park and still be Hibsing-it beyond anything they’ve ever done before…\n\nAnte Suto of Hibernian with Daizen Maeda of Celtic and Marcelo Saracchi of Celtic Celtic v Hibernian, Scottish Premiership, Celtic Park, 22 February 2026.

A win there will do nicely and mentally finish the Zombies as a hapless title challenger, while we can rack up the points waiting for the Replicants to implode – which they will – and help us pip the real title contenders to our trophy…\n\nCeltic in the Thirties by Matt Corr.

    "fullText": "Jack Hughes drops Connor McDavid 'greatest player ever' praise after Olympics win originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWith the Olympics gold medal match loss, Connor McDavid has yet again fallen short of winning the ultimate prize at a tournament. Fans started buzzing about how the Edmonton Oilers legend was 'always the bridesmaid, never the bride'. While these chirps may have come at the height of the Americans winning the gold medal after 46 years, Team USA and New Jersey Devils' Jack Hughes knew that McDavid was still the best player out there.\n\nHughes ended up scoring the gold medal-winning goal against Team Canada. He will always remain as a legend in all of America and with the Devils. But, he was tasked with a really tough task of guarding McDavid all night. Prior to his insane goal, he had to shut the Oilers legend one last time too.\n\nHe got real on how difficult the task was because of the Canadian star's prowess on the ice, via Dan Rosen of NHL.com.\n\n\"When the best player in the world, maybe ever, comes down on you in overtime in the gold medal game and you’re a forward, my first thought was ‘I  have got to gap up. Then I was like, ‘I can’t gap up, he’ll just blow right by me.’ So, I just sunk in and hopefully he can’t get around me because there’s not enough space in between me and the net. And that’s honestly kind of what happened,\" he declared.\n\nHughes' effort only came out of instinct because of what was at stake and who skated down towards him. McDavid was eventually named the Most Valuable Player for men's hockey at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics. This came after he ran the Canadian offense as much as he could up until the gold medal game. The Oilers legend scored two goals while also dishing out 11 assists in the tournament.\n\nThe bane of the best players in their field is the constant challenge of opposing players leveling up when coming across them. Hopefully, McDavid is able to dispel the 'always the bridesmaid, never the bride' narrative once he returns with the Oilers.",

    "fullText": "German public-service broadcasters ARD and ZDF registered record numbers of viewers during the Milan/Cortina Winter Olympics, which closed on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the broadcasters, never before have so many people followed the TV coverage of the Winter Games in the country.\n\nAn average of 3.173 million people watched the live broadcasts on the two free-to-air TV channels, representing a market share of 23.2%.\n\nThe reach is almost twice as high as in the previous Games in Beijing in 2022 (1.67 million), which, however, took place in a different time zone.\n\nBut all the relevant figures are also significantly higher than those for Turin, where the last Winter Games in Germany's time zone took place 20 years ago.\n\n\"In times like these, people are particularly receptive to the Olympics. People love emotional moments,\" ARD sports coordinator Axel Balkausky said.\n\nThe men's doubles in luge had the largest audience as 6.79 million people watched the event live. The biathlon, Germany's most popular winter sport, was shortly behind with 6.63 million fans tuning in to watch the mixed relay.\n\nDuring the Olympics, millions of sports fans are also enthusiastic about disciplines that are usually hardly noticed.\n\n\"Every four years, people specifically search for curling,\" Balkausky said.\n\nParticularly striking was the reach among young people: according to the broadcasters, some 35% of viewers were between 14 and 29 years old.\n\nParallel to the large number of viewers watching traditional television, there was also enormous reach on the internet with up to seven live streams.\n\nARD recorded more than 85 million video views, while ZDF had more than 50 million views by Saturday.\n\n\"The digital figures are going through the roof. We were successful in every way,\" Balkausky celebrated.",

    "fullText": "Mexican star Julian Quinones didn’t just shine on Matchweek 23 by claiming his unrivalled 10th Man of the Match award, he also led a midfield takeover in Roshn Saudi League Fantasy. Midfielders dominated the scoring charts, occupying a remarkable seven of the top 10 spots.\n\nWith players in that position consistently delivering the highest Fantasy returns, choosing the right ones can make or break your line-up.\n\nWith that in mind, here’s our recommendations for the postponed Matchweek 10, laid out nicely in a first XI, all while sticking to a budget of SAR 80 million.\n\nNot already playing? Well, what are you waiting for: sign up at https://en.fantasy.spl.com.sa now!\n\nEdouard Mendy - Al Ahli (6.6 million)\n\nThe league’s top goalkeeper this season, with 9 clean sheets, the Al Ahli captain travels to Abha to face a Damac who’ve dropped into the bottom three. Mendy currently sits on 98 Fantasy points and is expected to break the 100-mark in this round.\n\nMuhannad Al Shanqiti - Al Ittihad (5.2m)\n\nDespite playing fewer matches this season, Al Shanqiti is enjoying his most productive campaign yet. He has already scored 3 goals - a personal best - and added 6 assists. He’ll look to continue that form for the RSL champions at Al Hazem.\n\nMohamed Simakan - Al Nassr FC (5.7m)\n\nA smart differential pick, Simakan is selected by only 18.9 percent of managers despite being among the top-five defenders in total points. He has kept six consecutive clean sheets and even scored during that run. Next up? An away match at bottom club Najmah.\n\nZakaria Hawsawi - Al Ahli (4.2m)\n\nFor the second straight season, Hawsawi is contributing both defensively and offensively. He recently assisted Riyad Mahrez at Al Shabab and even scored against Al Taawoun. Trusted by Al Ahli manager Matthias Jaissle, Hawsawi has been part of six clean sheets in nine appearances.\n\nJulian Quinones - Al Qadsiah (10.4m)\n\nThe game’s in-form star made his seventh Team of the Week appearance in Matchweek 23, scoring 25 points. Remarkably, he’s the only Fantasy player to hit 25+ points in three different rounds this season. Al Qadsiah host Eastern Derby rivals Al Ettifaq.\n\nEven in defeat to Al Ettifaq, Batna delivered 19 Fantasy points, second only to Quinones for the round. While Khalid Al Ghannam earned 13 points in the same match, Batna’s individual performance stood out. Al Fateh welcome second-from-bottom Al Okhdood.\n\nYannick Carrasco - Al Shabab (7.2m)\n\nThe brilliant Belgian has been instrumental in Al Shabab’s revival, scoring and assisting last time out in the win at Damac. The side goals-per-game average has climbed to 1.09, avoiding what could’ve been their worst scoring season (2015-16 and 2016-17). They face relegation battlers Al Riyadh.\n\nThe Algeria superstar has contributed to four goals in his past two matches and remains central to Al Ahli’s title bid. Since December 29, Al Ahli have collected 34 points, more than Al Qadsiah (32), Al Hilal (28), and Al Nassr (25). Mahrez has been key.\n\nFashion Sakala - Al Fayha (8.0m)\n\nAl Fayha’s man of the moment is in red-hot form, matching Ivan Toney for the best scoring streak over the past three rounds. Sakala has netted eight goals in seven of his past eight outings yet is selected by fewer than 5% of managers - a high-risk, high-reward option. Al Fayha host NEOM Sports Club on Wednesday.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette - NEOM SC (6.8m)\n\nThe firing Frenchman earned nine points last time out after scoring the winner at Al Khaleej. Lacazette averages 8.5 points per game over his past four matches and now takes that hot streak to Al Fayha in the postponed fixture.\n\nAbderrazak Hamdallah - Al Shabab (9.0m)\n\nAfter missing 11 rounds (16 matches total), the RSL’s all-time second-highest scorer is gradually returning to form. Hamdallah came off the bench against Al Ahli and then scored on Friday when starting at Damac.\n\nWith only 30 total points and a 10.4% selection rate, the mighty Moroccan could become a valuable differential if he regains his scoring rhythm. Especially with new manager Noureddine Ben Zekri in charge.\n\nMidfielders continue to dominate RSL Fantasy scoring so, with several players in exceptional form and postponed fixtures creating unique opportunities, this round could reward bold-but-calculated selections.\n\nChoose wisely - and don’t underestimate the power of an in-form middle man!",

    "fullText": "Jacob Bridgeman beat Rory McIlroy by one stroke to win the Genesis Invitational on Sunday.\n\nDespite having a six-shot lead before the final round, Bridgeman came under pressure from McIlroy and Kurt Kitayama.\n\nThe 26-year-old did not perform as well as he did in the first three rounds, but it was still enough for the victory at Riviera.\n\nAfter playing alongside Bridgeman in the final group, McIlroy explained how the first-time PGA Tour winner impressed him.\n\nBridgeman’s one-over-par 72 in the final round was just enough to finish ahead of McIlroy and Kitayama.\n\nHe looked nervous at times on the back nine, but he also played some high-quality shots and made several clutch putts.\n\nMcIlroy recognised the difficulty of winning your first PGA Tour event and was impressed by Bridgeman’s mentality.\n\nHe even suggested that Bridgeman’s score (+1) was not a true reflection of the solid golf he played throughout the day.\n\n“I thought he handled everything really well,” McIlroy reflected. “As I said at the start, because I wasn’t putting pressure on him, it probably felt to him like he didn’t need to do that much, but he played very well.\n\n“I was surprised he was even par because I felt he was very much in control of his golf ball. He drove it great; he hit his irons well. But it’s hard, it’s hard to close out big tournaments.\n\n“Even though he was a little shaky coming down the stretch, he held it together when he needed to. He holed a clutch comeback putt on 13 for par.\n\n“He played smart on 16 when he missed it in the bunker. That putt on the last isn’t easy. Leaves it a little bit short, and the crowd reacts, and you’ve got to take your time a little bit.\n\n“I give him all the props; he did what he needed to do, and I’m happy for him.”\n\nMcIlroy will feel like he missed a golden opportunity to defeat Bridgeman and win the Genesis Invitational on Sunday.\n\nThe Northern Irishman was excellent from tee to green in the final round, but he did not make enough putts to catch his playing partner.\n\nMcIlroy lost 1.88 strokes to the field on the greens on Sunday, the second-worst putting performance of the top 20 players.\n\nHad he converted one more of his many birdie chances, he would have faced Bridgeman in a playoff for the title.\n\nStill, McIlroy can be delighted with his improved performance ahead of the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the Players Championship next month.\n\nJordan Spieth makes firm vow to avoid repeat on PGA Tour after controversy in 2025\n\nRory McIlroy’s bunker magic leaves Jordan Spieth stunned at the Genesis Invitational\n\n‘It’s a big deal’ – Jordan Spieth reveals the ‘weapon’ he’s finally got back after the Genesis Invitational",

    "description": "Liverpool got an undeserved and much needed win at relegation-threatened Forest on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Liverpool were not the better side on Sunday afternoon when they headed off to face a Nottingham Forest side in the midst of crisis in a season that has rather seemed non-stop crisis for the West Bridgford that are currently on their fourth (and maybe not their last) manager of the 2025-26 campaign.\n\nThe Reds’ relegation-threatened opponents (who are on their fourth manager of the season) had more shots, created more expected goals, and even managed to appear to have more well-drilled patterns of play—of passing, pressing, and buildup. In the end, though, Liverpool managed to end up with all three points.\n\nIn the end, of course, that’s the point of the game and what matters most. Especially if you’re a Liverpool side who themselves have been at seemed on the verge of crisis for most of the season and are in a tough fight to finish in the Champions League places. The question, as always, is what comes next.\n\n“We want to play our best football and I think at times we are doing that,” captain Virgil van Dijk reflected after everything was said and done in Sunday’s 1-0 victory. “Obviously we are still looking for improvements and we are not perfect, but we are human beings and want to do our best for the club.\n\n“We want to perform at the absolute highest levels, and we need everyone to be at their best so that’s a process, but we keep going and now the focus is on the next one. It feels definitely nice to win here, it’s a difficult ground and it was a very poor first half from all of us with and without the ball.”\n\nThe silver lining is perhaps that for as bad as Liverpool were early, they did improve as the game went on, at least relative their early struggles. And of course in the end a win is a win is a win—which puts them level on points with fifth-place Manchester United, at least until they take on Everton today.\n\nOn paper, too, Liverpool have one of the easier schedules of the sides battling to finish in the Champions League places in a season where top five are all but guaranteed of that. And for that, they need more wins. And for that, they’ll need to improve on Sunday’s performance, eventually victory or not.",

    "description": "Another night at Unrivaled. Another Chelsea Gray record. Gray’s 10 3s helped Rose clinch a playoff berth.",
    "fullText": "The Point Gawd Chelsea Gray is known for her dazzling passes and her ability to be almost unguardable when she gets on a hot streak.\n\nOn Sunday night, she delivered one of those kinds of performances, matching Marina Mabrey’s Unrivaled record for 3-pointers in a game with 10. The number is gaudy, but it was also necessary. Rose needed every one of those points as they squeaked out a 70-66 victory against Laces.\n\nGray ended the game with a whopping 38 points, along with seven rebounds and four assists.\n\nFrom the opening quarter, Gray was explosive. She scored 17 points in the first and knocked down half of her 3s within the first seven minutes. Thanks to her play and her contributions to Rose’s 12-4 run, they were in front of Laces 23-16.\n\nIn the second, Laces responded with a 12-5 run to even the game. Gray countered with yet another 3 as both teams exchanged baskets. Brittney Sykes was the engine that kept the Laces running with her 20-point first-half performance. Gray hit a 3-pointer to end the half, which gave Rose a 3-point lead, 42-39.\n\nAt this point, what can't Chelsea Gray do?! 🤯 pic.twitter.com/iZBB5qOOYY\n\n— Unrivaled Basketball (@Unrivaledwbb) February 23, 2026\n\nLaces had some offensive struggles in the third, shooting 6-for-18 from the field. Rose took advantage as Gray continued to pile on, allowing Rose to carry a somewhat comfortable six-point lead into the fourth, 59-53.\n\nLaces and Rose exchanged baskets, but with Rose ahead, they were able to hang on and not only win the game but also punch their ticket into the postseason.\n\nGray, who also hit the game winner, was far and away the best player for Rose. However, Kahleah Copper had a respectable game, scoring 10 points to go along with three rebounds and three assists.\n\nLaces were led by the trio of Jackie Young, Alyssa Thomas and Sykes. Young had 17 points, Thomas scored 12 points and grabbed nine rebounds, and Sykes scored 24. While the loss was a disappointing one for Laces, the good news is they are still the No. 2 seed in Unrivaled, and their odds of staying in a top slot, and earning a bye to the semifinals, are still very high and in their control.\n\nBefore Laces’ loss, Phantom strengthened their claim to the No. 1 seed thanks to their 84-66 win over Hive. The win also earned Phantom a first-round bye, meaning their chase for the championship will begin in the semifinals in Brooklyn.\n\nAs usual, Phantom was led by its duo of Aliyah Boston and Kelsey Plum. Boston scored 25 points and grabbed eight rebounds, leading the team in both categories, while Plum had 23 points along with six assists. With these two on the floor, any three-player combo Phantom rolls out will be one of the best in Unrivaled.\n\nDue to the absences of Azurá Stevens and Natisha Hiedeman, developmental player Aziaha James got the call up, and she did all she could to try to help Hive win, leading the club with 22 points. During the game, Hive also lost Sonia Citron due to an injury scare, which put them down to only four players for all of the second half.\n\nZaza is doing her things out here 🫡 pic.twitter.com/IeY6sK202j\n\n— Unrivaled Basketball (@Unrivaledwbb) February 23, 2026\n\nEven with this loss, Hive still has hope for the sixth and final playoff spot, but Vinyl is a half game in front of them for that position, and the Lunar Owls are right behind them, just a game back.\n\nIt’s looking like the playoff picture won’t get finalized until the very end of the regular season.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona midfielder Gavi is entering the most important phase of his recovery and his eyes are already fixed on the next World Cup.\n\nAccording to SPORT, the 21-year-old is highly motivated to return in time to fight for a place in Spain’s squad.\n\nAfter months of frustration on the sidelines, the young midfielder is finally back training with the group, taking careful steps toward full fitness.\n\nGavi has been out of top-level competition for nearly five months following surgery on his right knee meniscus on September 23.\n\nThe procedure forced him into a long rehabilitation process, but now he is gradually reintegrating into team sessions.\n\nHis workload remains controlled, with both the medical department and coaching staff keeping a close watch on every movement.\n\nWithin Barcelona, it has been made very clear that there will be no shortcuts.\n\nThe club believes it would make little sense to rush his return after showing patience for months.\n\nThe priority is to help Gavi regain confidence, rhythm and match sharpness without risking setbacks.\n\nGavi wants to play the World Cup. (Photo by Florencia Tan Jun/Getty Images)\n\nA knee injury is delicate, and Barcelona want him to feel completely secure before stepping back into competitive action.\n\nAs such, optimism is growing internally, as the upcoming international break could actually benefit him, giving him uninterrupted weeks of training without the pressure of immediate match demands.\n\nThe plan is for him to complete full sessions consistently, increase intensity step by step, and reconnect with the feeling of being a competitive footballer.\n\nFor Gavi, the past months have been difficult and now, feeling useful to the team again before the end of the season is his short-term objective.\n\nMeanwhile, Luis de la Fuente has maintained regular contact with him.\n\nThe Spain coach is closely following his progress and understands both the risks and the potential reward.\n\nDe la Fuente has never hidden his admiration for the Barcelona midfielder and believes he could still play a role if he reaches the required level in time.\n\nReaching the World Cup will not be easy, as competition in Spain’s midfield is fierce. Despite that, if Gavi regains his rhythm and intensity, the door will not be closed.",

    "description": "Where do the Indianapolis Colts rank in free agent spending since the 2020 NFL season?",
    "fullText": "Since 2020, the Indianapolis Colts have been one of the least active teams in NFL free agency.\n\nJason Fitzgerald of Over the Cap recently ranked each team by how much they've spent in free agency between 2020 and 2025 and how many free agents they've signed.\n\nA few caveats to note as Fitzgerald put together this list were that only free agent signings in the months of March and April counted, and the deal had to be for at least $2 million. This data also only included new additions and not any re-signings.\n\nDuring that span, the Colts' 15 free agent additions that qualify for this list are tied for the sixth-fewest in the NFL. Indianapolis is also the eighth-lowest spender in average free agent dollars each offseason at $125.98 million.\n\nHowever, when GM Chris Ballard has made signings, he has spent big, with the Colts average contract per player ranking near the top of the league at $8.39 million.\n\nOverall, the Colts are ranked 27th in Fitzgerald's rankings.\n\n\"We like our guys,\" is a familiar phrase that Ballard has said over the years, which is, in part, why the Colts rank near the bottom of this free agency spending list.\n\nLast offseason, however, we saw a more aggressive approach. This included signing Daniel Jones and spending fairly big on Charvarius Ward and Cam Bynum.\n\nBallard seemingly acknowledged that continuing down that path was going to be the plan this offseason.\n\nThe Colts are positioned relatively well from a salary cap standpoint to do so as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: NFL free agency: Where do Colts rank in free agent spending since 2020?",

    "fullText": "UFC fighters with visa problems just learned something in Houston over the weekend: ask and ye shall receive.\n\nUros Medic won his co-main fight against Geoff Neal via violent first round knockout (watch it here) and then followed that up not with a request — not for a $100,000 bonus (which he got anyway) but for help with his immigration issues.\n\n“Now I got one little problem,” Medic declared in the cage. “Immigration’s been holding me up and I can’t travel just yet. So this is my plea for help. President, Mr. President, if you can see this, please, we gotta go to Belgrade, Serbia for the UFC this summer.”\n\nWe have our doubts the UFC will make the trip to Serbia any time soon, but Medic now can because UFC CEO Dana White got U.S. president Donald Trump on the phone to take care of his issues.\n\n“I’m back in his office and Dana’s got president Donald Trump on speaker phone,” Medic said at the post-fight press conference. “I’m just standing there and I cannot believe what’s happening. I’m talking to the president, and he said, ‘You’re good to go wherever you please. You can travel. Just give Dana documentation, the information that you need.'”\n\n“I’m just blown away. I mean, I love Mr. President, and his wife is from Slovenia, First Lady Melania … It was just amazing for me to be able to tell him about the situation and how big of a fan I am of him. And obviously, his wife, who is from where I’m from – or I’m considering where I’m from, even though it’s a different country. It’s like a five-hour drive. That’s nothing for America. Like, you can’t even get out of Texas in five hours.”\n\n“So yeah, I’m still processing all of it.”\n\nThat’s great news for Medic, who has been unable to travel back to his home country for three years now. Between the knockout of the year candidate, his $100,000 bonus, and getting his visa fixed, it’s been a pretty good weekend for the Serbian fighter.",

    "description": "Connor Zilisch says he always knew Kimi Antonelli was destined for Formula 1 after racing him in karting",
    "fullText": "19-year-old NASCAR Cup driver Connor Zilisch said he could always tell that Kimi Antonelli would get into Formula 1 after karting together.\n\nThe two grew up karting together when the American driver would spend his summers in Europe to gain experience other forms of racing. During an appearance on the Gypsy Tales podcast, the Trackhouse Racing driver explained that Antonelli was \"one of the best drivers\" he had raced against.\n\n\"I spent a lot of time in Europe. Those were some of the coolest moments of my life. I went to Europe as an 11, 12, 13, 14-year-old. I spent a couple of summers over there when I was not in school. I would go over there for three months at a time, racing against guys like Kimi Antonelli.\n\n\"I spent three or four years racing against him. I always knew he was going to make it to F1. I always knew. He's one of the best drivers, top three drivers I've ever raced against, just talent-wise. So I always knew he was one of the guys that was going to make it and then guys like Arvid Lindblad, he's going to race for VCARB.\n\n\"It's crazy to see that they've gone on to race in F1 and that kind of thing. But karting is such a cool sport. I didn't realise it at the time, but those days and months that I spent in Europe, without my parents, growing up, I would ride my bike to dinner alone. Those were the coolest days of my life, and I didn't realise it at the time, how cool it was.\n\n\"The memories that I have of it, looking back at it, I grew up and learned so much as a kid and matured. I definitely look back on those days as some of the coolest days I'll ever have.\"\n\nAsked to elaborate on what he saw in Antonelli, who is about to enter his second F1 season with Mercedes, Zilisch added: \"He's the guy that no matter what his set-up is, no matter what the track is, no matter what the conditions are, there's guys who just always persevere and are always at the front.\n\n\"And he was one of those guys that no matter what the situation was, if it was practice or if it was a heat race or, whatever it was, he was always at the front. He could just maximise his kart.\n\n\"And it's funny, I have a story. He came to race in America. He did a race at Miami, and one of my best friends was team-mates with him, and him and his dad thought that it was all his motor. And so he was team-mates with Kimi, and Kimi switched engines with him because the kid was like 'Man it's got to be his engine.'\n\n\"So Kimi literally switched motors with this kid. Kimi went faster and he slowed down, and that was just one of the things where it's a situation of you don't realise how much of a difference he's actually making until you do something like that.\n\n\"You just assume that it's the equipment and for him to be like, 'OK, let's switch then.' And they switch, and Kimi goes faster. That's something that I've always pointed to when I've thought about Kimi. He makes the most of everything he gets in.\"\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Michael Carrick addressed Marcus Rashford’s absence from the Manchester United first-team after the England star signed for Barcelona last summer.\n\nThe 44-year-old, now back in a coaching role at United, had played alongside Rashford during the later years of his own career at Old Trafford.\n\nCarrick also worked with the 28-year-old England international during his coaching stints under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Jose Mourinho.\n\nWhile Rashford was part of Carrick’s squad during his caretaker spell in 2021, that has not been the case since he returned as interim manager this season.\n\nThe British forward left the club in 2025 and has spent this season on loan at Barcelona.\n\nRashford fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim during the 2024-25 season and spent the second half of the campaign on loan at Aston Villa.\n\nAston Villa chose not to make his move permanent, so Rashford returned briefly to Old Trafford during Amorim’s time in charge.\n\nBut it was Barcelona who offered him a fresh start, making the decision to sign him from United during last summer’s transfer window.\n\nAt his pre-match press conference, Carrick was asked whether he felt it was unfortunate that Rashford had left United, given their history as teammates and coach-player.\n\n“It’s difficult to say, you know, because circumstances at certain times, that I haven’t been involved in,” the Englishman said, according to Manchester United’s official website.\n\n“It’s difficult for me to comment, really. I think the fact he’s come through the academy and had such a big impact here is a positive and as a club, he’s had some really big moments, and good moments, and I’ve shared some with him in the past, you know?”\n\nThe former Manchester United forward has found new life away from Old Trafford and has been playing well under Hansi Flick at the Camp Nou during the 2025-26 season.\n\nCarrick pointed to Rashford’s career path as a good example of how unpredictable football can be these days.\n\n“So, football throws up certain things and obviously certain players, you can’t stay here forever and things happen.\n\nThis season, Rashford has made 34 appearances for Barcelona in all competitions, scoring 10 goals and providing 13 assists so far.\n\nWhy Man United legend Patrice Evra brutally slammed ‘delusional’ Arsenal fans\n\nManchester United vs. Everton preview, kick-off time, how to watch, and team news",

    "fullText": "It was an exciting week made up of unforgettable moments for the girls at Inter Academy New England, who took part in a fully immersive journey into the Nerazzurri world.\n\nThrough visits to the stadium, training ground, and the Club's headquarters, the American delegation had the opportunity to experience the passion, history, and values that define Inter.\n\nOn the night of Inter vs. Juventus, which ended with the Nerazzurri winning 3-2, the young Academy players experienced firsthand the intensity of one of the most legendary rivalries in Italian football.\n\nBefore kick-off, the girls took part in activities and fan interactions in the Museo LED area, taking photos and creating content for social platforms, which added to the atmosphere. They then took to the stage of the Inter Live Show in a night made even more memorable by the Nerazzurri's victory.\n\nTo close out the stadium experience, the Academy had the chance to watch the squad's warm-up up close, soaking in the moments leading up to kick-off from a unique perspective in a crucial match.\n\nThe journey continued at the Konami Football Centre, where the girls participated in training sessions throughout the week, led by the technical staff of the Nerazzurri Youth Sector. It was an incredible and educational experience that allowed the young participants to interact directly with the Club's ideology.\n\nOn Friday, two players from the Inter Women's squad and coach Gianpiero Piovani came onto the pitch and made the week even more memorable. Through moments of connection and the presentation of final participation certificates by Bugeja, Bowen, and the coach, the girls at the Academy felt a sense of belonging to the Nerazzurri family.\n\nThe visit came to an end at Inter HQ, with an exclusive Trophy Room Tour. It served as a journey into the Club's history through trophies and achievements that tell the story of the Nerazzurri's glories and inspire future generations.\n\nIt was a week that will stay in the hearts of the young Inter Academy New England players, highlighting the strength of the Inter Academy project globally. It is a connection across cultures, brought together by the same colours and Nerazzurri passion.",

(Photo by Jasper Wax/Getty Images)\n\n‘Another goal for Joao Pedro at the weekend so let’s talk about signed strikers in the Premier League,’ Lineker said on The Rest is Football podcast.\n\n‘Isak, Ekitike, Pedro, Gyokeres and Sesko were the big ones weren’t they last summer. Ekitike has done really well and similar numbers but Pedro has perhaps gone slightly under the radar in terms of how well he’s done.\n\n‘I think he’s a very good footballer, he’s technically very gifted. I think he’s a really good player, he does remind me a little bit of Kai Havertz.\n\n‘They’re similar type of players, both very technically gifted and they both almost glide around the pitch. I think he’s a really good player.’\n\nChelsea are apparently looking to replace goalkeeper Robert Sanchez in the summer transfer window, with links coming in now with a new Premier League goalkeeper.\n\nPedro Neto got an assist at the weekend, but Chelsea’s attack in general disappointed as they failed to capitalise more on their periods of dominance against Burnley.\n\nCheck out the latest edition of Simon Phillips’ SPTC podcast here:",

From a treble-winning loan spell at Bayern Munich in 2019/20 after some dazzling nights at Liverpool to a €135 million move to Barcelona, the Brazilian’s career seemed unstoppable at its peak. Now, it has reached an unexpected and sobering turn.\n\nPer a report from Tz, Coutinho has announced the termination of his contract with Vasco da Gama, his boyhood club in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The decision, confirmed via his social channels, came despite talks of a possible extension. Instead, the 33-year-old requested for a premature termination, one that the club granted.\n\nThe reason is deeply personal. Coutinho admitted he is “mentally exhausted.” Years of serious knee injuries have taken their toll, both physically and emotionally. Growing criticism from fans, including jeering during a recent cup match, only added to the weight.\n\nIn an emotional farewell, he described stepping away with a heavy heart, insisting his connection to Vasco remains strong. Whether this signals the end of his career or simply a pause remains unclear.",

    "fullText": "Roma wingback Zeki Celik is reportedly on the verge of leaving the club amid growing interest from Inter Milan.\n\nAccording to Corriere dello Sport via FCInterNews, the 29-year-old’s future lies away from Rome.\n\nCelik’s contract at the Stadio Olimpico runs out in June, with Roma reluctant to offer him fresh terms.\n\nDespite his contractual wobble, the Turkish star remains an indispensable starter under Gian Piero Gasperini.\n\nIndeed, he has made 23 appearances in Serie A this season.\n\nSASSUOLO, ITALY – OCTOBER 26: Zeki Çelik of AS Roma in action during the Serie A match between US Sassuolo Calcio and AS Roma at Mapei Stadium Citta del Tricolore on October 26, 2025 in Sassuolo, Italy. (Photo by Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images)\n\nNegotiations over Celik’s contract renewal have hit a standstill.\n\nIndeed, his agent is reportedly asking for a substantial pay rise, demanding around €4 million net per season.\n\nMeanwhile, the Giallorossi have no intention of matching Celik’s request.\n\nTherefore, a summer exit is looming, with Inter keeping close tabs on the former Lille ace.\n\nZeki Celik would be a decent coup for the Nerazzurri, especially considering they wouldn’t have to pay a dime to secure his signature.",

    "description": "Following a heavy defeat to South Africa in Super 8s, India's batting unit faces scrutiny, with assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate confirming that changes, including the potential inclusion of Sanju Samson, are being considered. The team's left-hand heavy top order has struggled, prompting a rethink of their strategy for upcoming crucial matches.",
    "fullText": "Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. \n\nIndia’s left-hand heavy top order once again crumbled under pressure during the chase of 188, eventually collapsing to 111. The spotlight fell heavily on out-of-form opener Abhishek Sharma, who managed just 15 — his first runs of the tournament after three consecutive ducks — and Tilak Varma, whose struggles have compounded India’s fragile starts.\n\nAddressing the selection dilemma, ten Doeschate acknowledged that bringing in a right-hand option like Samson is under serious consideration.\n\n“Yeah, of course, we have looked at the five outings we have had now, four teams have opened with part-time off spin, and it has got a wicket every time, apart from the USA game where we lost Abhi without score in any case (to pacer Ali Khan),” he said.\n\n“So to start every inning zero for one, I think it has literally been zero or a couple of runs for one every time is obviously putting pressure on the link players. Tilak and SKY (Surya), their role is to link up with the guys at the back end, and it has not gone that way,” he added.\n\n128703198Advertisement\nIndia now face a tough call between backing struggling players and making bold changes.\n\n“You stick with the guys who we feel have performed really well over the last 18 months and who are maybe shy of a few runs now? Or do we twist and bring Sanju, who is also a fantastic player and obviously helps tactically with having a right-hander at the top of the order, and I am sure that will be a talking point over the next few days, going into these two very important games,” he said.\n\nTen Doeschate also revealed that Abhishek’s poor run has been compounded by illness.\n\n“You want him to be up and running and sort of confident in his swing and confident in his game plan (on Abhishek), and when you score three zeroes, that is going to start weighing on you. I saw some really good signs on Friday night in the nets. I think I mentioned it in the presser then. But he looks a little bit short, and our job as the coaching staff is to pull that right. We have got four days to do that,” he added.\n\nHe also defended Rinku Singh, whose returns as finisher have been modest.\n\n“There is no point talking about rhythm in nets or how guys are feeling or what they are not feeling. It is time to pull our sleeves up and get performance out of all the players, and like I just said there, that is the challenge for the staff, along with the players now, to regroup and put in a big effort leading up to the next game against Zimbabwe,” he concluded.",

    "fullText": "At the risk of beating a dead horse, Roma fans have grown wary of matches like yesterday’s victory over Cremonese, fixtures where outside results have fallen in the club’s favor, giving the Giallorossi an opportunity to climb the table. In this instance, with 5th-place Juventus and 3rd-place Napoli each suffering defeats earlier in the weekend, Roma not only had the chance to pad their lead over Juve but could wake up Monday in third place, four points ahead of Juventus, ahead of their clash at the Olimpico next weekend.\n\nFortunately, unlike so many disappointing weekends before, Roma prevailed over lowly Cremonese, overcoming a slow first half to win 3-0 in front of 60,000 of their closest friends. Given the ease with which they won and the lack of any glaring errors, today’s Sinners & Saints will skew entirely toward the positive!\n\nAlways the goat, seldom the hero, Cristante delivered arguably his best performance of the season. Starting alongside Manu Koné and Lorenzo Pellegrini in midfield, Cristante overcame his presumed sadness over Canada’s loss in the Gold Medal game with a dynamic 90-minute run against Cremonese: three key passes, 15 passes into the final third, five tackles, four recoveries, one assist, and, of course, the match-winning goal, a perfectly executed header at the near post off a Pellegrini corner.\n\nCristante will always have his detractors, but at least for one night, he was unquestionably the best player on the pitch.\n\nNot far behind Cristante in the post-match pecking order, Ndicka brought his usual class to the backline, limiting Cremonese to a pitiful two shots on goal while adding five clearances and three ball recoveries to his defensive ledger. While we’ve come to expect those defensive performances from Ndicka, the Ivorian international was surprisingly busy in attack, firing four shots on goal, including a crucial 77th-minute goal, his first league goal of the season.\n\nIf we shine light on Ndicka for smothering Cremonese’s attack, it’s only right to share the spotlight with Mancini. Not only did Roma’s masked man lead the club with eight defensive actions and play seven balls into the final third, but he also managed to avoid a yellow card! With nine of those bad boys already in his back pocket heading into this match, any transgression on Sunday would have meant Mancini would miss next week’s six-pointer against Juventus.\n\nI’m sure this will be a semi-controversial selection, but while Pellegrini didn’t necessarily turn in a standout performance, he served up the match-winning assist thanks to a well-placed corner kick that met Cristante’s head just as he started to peel away from the near post. Sure, Roma would tack on two additional goals, but let’s appreciate the context of this assist: it was preceded by 59 mostly frustrating misses in which Roma reeled off a dozen shots with nothing to show for it.\n\nAll told, Pellegrini created three chances while completing two of three long balls.\n\nThe other Lorenzo didn’t factor in the box score, but the young midfielder wasted little time terrorizing the Cremonese backline. In only 34 minutes, Venturino created three scoring chances and hit on 11 of 12 passes. It may not have been a wow performance, but it did provide a glimpse into the future: Venturino already looks like the ideal pesky, creative winger that any attacking side craves, especially one as fluid as Gasperini’s.\n\nThe only negative thing we can say about Koné is this: he doesn’t have a nose for goal. If he ever develops a better long-range shot and can convert those late runs into the box, he’ll probably be bound for PSG, so we’ll count our blessings for now. Outside of skying a few attempts high and wide, Koné completed 89% of his passes, created two scoring chances, and recovered six balls.\n\nRelegated to the bench with Koné’s return to the lineup, the local kid still managed to make his mark against Cremonese, breaking the visitors back with an 86th-minute goal. In his 18-minute cameo, the young Roman recovered to balls, played three passes into the final third and managed two shots on goal.",

    "fullText": "The 2025 Detroit Lions season may not have gone as the team wanted, but it only reaffirmed their star power, according to analytics site PFF. Late last week, PFF revealed their top-101 players from the 2025 season, and the Lions had five players make the list, all within the top-50. More impressively, though, they had three players make PFF’s top-10 players of the 2025 season.\n\nFirst up on the list was Jahmyr Gibbs, who came in at 47 on the list. Gibbs, who finished fifth in the NFL in yards from scrimmage last year, was sixth in PFF grade among all running backs last year.\n\nReceiver Amon-Ra St. Brown was next on the list, barely missing the top-10 by placing 17th overall. Fourth in receiving yards in 2025, St. Brown produced a PFF receiving grade of 90+ for his fourth consecutive season.\n\nThe three top-10 Lions players were as follows:\n\nCampbell was PFF’s highest-graded linebacker of 2025, and he’s got the first-team All Pro to go with it. He led the NFL in PFF’s “defensive stops,” recording four more than any other defensive player in football.\n\nHutchinson led the NFL in pressure, both according to PFF and NFL Pro. In addition to that, PFF credits him with a 23.1% pass rush win rate, trailing only two other players (Myles Garrett and Will Anderson Jr.).\n\nSewell, despite getting snubbed for Protector of the Year at the NFL Honors in February, was PFF’s highest-graded offensive lineman in 2025. In their rankings, PFF noted that his 98.7 overall grade in the Lions’ Week 3 win over the Ravens was the highest score ever recorded for an offensive tackle in the PFF era.\n\nOnly the Rams had more than one player in the top-10 (Puka Nacua, Matthew Stafford).\n\nAs for the rest of the NFC North, here’s how many players each team had in the top-101:\n\nBears: 3 (Darnell Wright, Colston Loveland, Joe Thuney)\n\nPackers: 3 (Jordan Love, Micah Parsons, Xavier McKinney)\n\nCheck out the entire PFF top-101 players of 2025 rankings here.",

    "description": "According to a new report, Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes were named in a trademark infringement lawsuit.",
    "fullText": "A sneaker company is suing Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, and their restaurant partners for using the number 1587.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the sneaker company 1587 Sneakers alleges trademark infringement and claims its brand has been directly affected by the NFL stars' use of the four-digit figure.\n\nPatrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce opened their 1587 Prime steakhouse in September 2025.\n\nA new report from ESPN states that 1587 Sneakers is alleging trademark infringement, citing the similarity between the names of its business and that of Kelce and Mahomes' upscale Kansas City eatery, 1587 Prime.\n\nThe two superstar athletes first opened the steakhouse at Loews Kansas City Hotel on Mahomes' 30th birthday in 2025, combining their numbers to create the restaurant's name.\n\nESPN explained that the potential legal matter centers on the \"unregistered rights that the sneaker company\" has, given that it filed its trademark application in 2025, despite beginning to make sales in April 2023.\n\nAt the time of this publication, 1587 Sneakers' trademark application is still under review.\n\nMahomes and Kelce, meanwhile, filed a trademark for their Midwest eatery in December 2023.\n\nHowever, both companies' trademarks are in different categories. The NFL players' paperwork falls under the bar and restaurant sector, and the shoewear company's falls under clothing.\n\nTrademark attorney Josh Gerben of Gerben IP (who's not affiliated with either party in this case) spoke with ESPN about the matter and seemed to express doubt about the life of the sneaker company's lawsuit.\n\n\"I think it's a tough case for the sneaker company,\" he said. \"Trademarks can coexist in different industries. ... Given that the marks are essentially identical here, is a restaurant and a shoe company too close? Are consumers likely to be confused in thinking they are affiliated with one another?\"\n\nThe alleged trademark infringement isn't just about the name. In the lawsuit, 1587 Sneakers also claimed that Mahomes and Kelce's steakhouse sells merchandise with the number combination plastered on it.\n\nThe company's owners claim their business has been contacted by \"scores of consumers\" who believed it was related to Mahomes and Kelce's restaurant.\n\n\"From the onset, we have communicated a sincere belief that there is room for mutual respect and understanding,\" the sneaker company's lawyer said in a statement. \"That belief has not changed, and we continue to hope to resolve this matter amicably.\"\n\nUltimately, 1587 Sneakers is asking Mahomes and Kelce to stop using \"1587,\" claiming it causes significant confusion among consumers.\n\nMahomes and Kelce's labor of love has been open for a few months, and in previous social media videos promoting the business, the pair expressed genuine excitement about the public finally being able to set foot indoors.\n\n\"What’s better than to break bread with people over good food, good drinks, cool vibe?\" Kelce said in one of the posts before describing the food as \"mind-blowing.\"\n\nMahomes said the steakhouse has the \"Kansas City feel\" that locals know and love, adding, \"This is different, and I think the city is going to love it.\"\n\nThe nearly 10,000-square-foot restaurant, located inside the Lowe's Hotel, features two levels, private dining rooms, a meat display, and a chef's kitchen. 1587 Prime is also home to one of Missouri's largest wine collections.\n\nIn addition to battling this recent lawsuit during the off-season, Kelce is likely thinking about his future in the league.\n\nAccording to a previous report from The Blast, many believe Kelce's time in the NFL has come to an end after the Chiefs failed to make the playoffs in 2025.\n\nRob Gronkowski is among the believers, saying, \"My gut tells me about Travis Kelce is that he will not be back next year.\"\n\n\"He has had a significant career, Kay. He has had an excellent year once again this year,\" he added. \"In the end, overall, where the Kansas City Chiefs are with Patrick Mahomes getting hurt, with everything else that's going on in Travis Kelce's life, I think this is his last year.\"",

Rising oil prices and continued demand for oil have sent shares of Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM) up 20% and 22%, respectively.\n\nMaterials (XLB) and Industrial stocks (XLI) are also up 15% and 14% as AI infrastructure buildouts and reshoring accelerate.\n\nMeanwhile, investors have turned to defensive areas of the market like Consumer Staples (XLP), with consumer giant Walmart (WMT) hitting an all-time high earlier this month.\n\nAlthough portfolio rebalancing — where investors shift from overvalued sectors into more stable areas — typically happens at the start of the year, this year’s rotation has been amplified by volatility.\n\nA sell-off in pockets of the tech sector began last month amid fears that artificial intelligence could take over tasks traditionally handled by enterprise software companies.\n\nThe Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) is down 23% year to date.\n\nThe \"AI scare trade\" has now spread from software to wealth management and logistics.\n\nCybersecurity firms were the latest to get hit on Friday after Anthropic announced a new security tool. Shares of CrowdStrike (CRWD) dropped 5%, while Zscaler (ZS) and Cloudflare (NET) also fell 4% and 6%, respectively.\n\n“Everyone's kind of going through each one, sector by sector, industry by industry, trying to figure out where the AI disruption is going to be beyond just within tech itself,” Lerner said.\n\nProfit growth and the easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve should help the stock market continue to broaden. Polymarket betters are predicting two to three rate cuts in 2026. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance has a partnership with Polymarket.)\n\n\"With the easing cycle still intact, and the US economy showing resilience ... we expect healthy and broadening profit growth across sectors,\" UBS strategists said on Thursday.",

    "description": "A confirmed jaguarundi sighting has occurred in Texas. It's just been a long time.",
    "fullText": "Over the past few months, residents in Texas have claimed they've spotted a rare cat, the jaguarundi. However, the elusive feline hasn't had a confirmed sighting in decades.\n\nJaguarundis, an animal that looks so much like a house cat, are believed to be extirpated by both the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). The last confirmed sighting of the species in Texas was in Brownsville in 1986, according to the TPWD.\n\nBut Texans are saying otherwise. Last May, locals in Seguin compared a big cat sighting to a jaguarundi. One resident described it as a long, brownish-grayish cat, noting it didn't resemble a bobcat or mountain lion, but possibly the vanished Texas cat. In July, other Texans shared memories of seeing a jaguarundi in recent years in a private Facebook group.\n\nMost recently, on Tuesday, February 17, Chester Moore posted a YouTube video in which he truly believes he saw a jaguarundi in Jefferson County, Texas, near Beaumont. He said, \"I saw a dark cat… more mysterious than a black panther - and I'm convinced it was a jaguarundi.\"\n\nMost commonly, suspected jaguarundi sightings are typically identified through photo evidence to be housecats, according to TPWD. The animals look so much like a house cat, especially from a distance, but the key differences really are that jaguarundis have a much longer tail, according to TPWD.\n\nWhile the last confirmed sighting was in 1986, the animals were never really a major presence in Texas. Their range is primarily known for being in Mexico. Since the last sighting, TPWD said there have been many extensive camera trapping surveys on South Texas refuges and in Big Bend National Park. But, despite the extensive survey effort, there has never been a jaguarundi photographed.\n\nBecause of this reason, the species has been considered extirpated or not found in Texas.\n\nJaguarundis are endangered because the dense brush that provides habitat has been cleared for farming or for the growth of cities, according to TPWD. While extinct in Texas, jaguarundi still exists in Mexico. People in the lower Rio Grande Valley are working together to plant native shrubs and restore habitat for the animal, according to TPWD.\n\nThis article originally published at Phantom predator: Texans report seeing a cat declared gone since 1986.",

    "description": "The European Commission demanded on Sunday that the United States stick to the terms of an EU-U.S. trade deal reached last year, after the U.S.",
    "fullText": "(Reuters) - The European Commission demanded on Sunday that the United States stick to the terms of an EU-U.S. trade deal reached last year, after ‌the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump's global tariffs and he responded with new levies ‌across the board.\n\nThe Commission, which negotiates trade policy on behalf of the 27 EU member states, said Washington must provide \"full clarity\" ​on the steps it intends to take following the court ruling.\n\nWhat economic impact will EU countries face from tariffs?\n\nHow do Trump's new tariffs compare to existing rates?\n\nWhy is the European Commission demanding U.S. compliance?\n\nWhat was the EU-U.S. trade deal Trump referenced?\n\nAfter the court struck down Trump's global tariffs on Friday, the U.S. president announced temporary, across-the-board tariffs of 10%, which he then hiked to 15% a day later.\n\n\"The current situation is not conducive to delivering 'fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial' transatlantic trade and investment, as agreed ‌to by both sides\" in the joint ⁠statement setting out the terms of last year's trade agreement, the Commission said. \"A deal is a deal.\"\n\nThe comments were far more strongly worded than the Commission's initial ⁠response on Friday, which had said only that it was studying the outcome of the Supreme Court decision and keeping in contact with the U.S. administration.\n\nLast year's trade deal set a 15% U.S. tariff rate for most ​EU goods, ​apart from those covered by other sectoral tariffs such ​as on steel. It also allowed zero ‌tariffs on some products such as aircraft and spare parts. The EU agreed to remove import duties on many U.S. goods and withdrew a threat to retaliate with higher levies.\n\nIt is not clear whether Trump's new 15% tariffs supersede the EU-U.S. deal. If they do, the EU's zero tariff exemptions could disappear. The new tariffs could also be placed on top of pre-existing 'most-favoured-nation' U.S. duties, which is not the case ‌under the EU-U.S. deal.\n\nFurthermore, the comparative advantage the EU had ​with a 15% tariff would appear to have disappeared as ​even countries without a deal face that ​rate.\n\nTrade policy monitor Global Trade Alert estimates that the EU as a whole will ‌be 0.8 percentage points worse off, with Italy ​facing an extra 1.7 ​percentage points of U.S. tariffs.\n\n\"In particular, EU products must continue to benefit from the most competitive treatment, with no increases in tariffs beyond the clear and all-inclusive ceiling previously agreed,\" the EU ​executive said, adding that unpredictable tariffs ‌were disruptive and undermined confidence across global markets.\n\nIt said that EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic ​had discussed the issue with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard ​Lutnick on Saturday.",

    "description": "A steady stream of ultra-high-net-worth individuals is deciding to hightail it to new countries. Here's where they're headed.",
    "fullText": "Andrew Rosener had already built a successful domain name brokerage when he and his wife found themselves asking a familiar question: Where do we want to live, not just work?\n\nThe answer turned out to be Portugal.\n\nThe American founder of MediaOptions, a domain broker, says the country checked every box: safe, sunny, affordable, and steeped in a culture that feels both European and Latin American. \"There's no other place like it,\" he says. \"Portugal created the single greatest immigration culture on Earth,\" he says, citing the Golden Visa, the Startup Visa, the Digital Nomad Visa, and the Tech Visa, among other programs offered by the country.\n\nThe Rosener family flew over in May 2018. \"Ten days later, we bought our dream house,\" Rosener says. \"Since then, the value's gone up 250%.\"\n\nThe entrepreneur was an early adopter. In 2018, only 108,000 extremely wealthy individuals emigrated to a new country. Since then, the global migration of the ultrawealthy has grown dramatically. According to the private wealth research firm Henley & Partners, 134,000 UHNWIs migrated in 2024, a year when more than 70 countries went to the polls and upended civil norms. By the end of 2025, more than 142,000 HNWIs were expected to have relocated.\n\n\"We're seeing a dramatic shift in global wealth flows,\" said Jeremy Savory, founder of Millionaire Migrant, a global consulting firm that helps wealthy families find places to relocate. \"More people are rethinking traditional wealth hubs like the UK and China, while places like Portugal, the UAE, and Singapore are surging in popularity.\"\n\nThe reasons behind these relocations are as diverse as the individuals making the move, but a few key factors stand out. Tax efficiency is at the top of the list. Wealthy non-Americans are increasingly seeking countries where they can retain a greater share of their earnings, particularly through capital gains, income, and estate taxes. Countries with lower tax burdens offer a substantial financial advantage, making them highly attractive to the global elite.\n\nSwitzerland, for example, has a lump-sum tax scheme that uses a taxpayer's lifestyle expenses as a surrogate tax base, rather than taxing global income and assets. Panama taxes citizens only on income earned in the country, making it a true tax haven. The UAE doesn't levy income tax; instead, it relies on a 5% value-added tax. Since US citizens are taxed on worldwide income, they don't really benefit from alternative tax strategies — unless, perhaps, they leave a state like California or New York, with their high state and city taxes. However, says Basil Mohr Elzeki, Managing Partner at Henley & Partners, \"Obtaining additional residencies and citizenships still remains a hedge for future potential tax reforms in the United States.\"\n\nGeopolitical safety is another driver. With political instability, civil unrest, and even the threat of war growing at an alarming rate in many parts of the world — think Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan — wealthy individuals are opting to leave regions where they feel vulnerable in favor of more stable and secure environments. Quality of life is also a significant consideration. The Roseners are having a blast in Portugal, where they have access to decent healthcare, world-class education, clean and well-maintained public spaces, and a low crime rate. And while the country provides almost no social benefits and has some of the lowest wages in all of Europe, it deters migrants with less wealth seeking employment. \"So if you're looking for work, there is no reason to come here,\" Rosener says.\n\nNevertheless, business opportunities play a crucial role in deciding where to plant a flag. Many of the global wealthy are relocating to cities that offer entrepreneurial freedom, often lacking in more bureaucratic regions. The ability to set up and run businesses with fewer regulatory hurdles is a compelling draw for people looking to capitalize on global opportunities or launch a startup.\n\nAnd let's not understate the benefits of having a \"good\" passport. With growing restrictions on travel to many countries, wealthy individuals are applying for second residencies or even multiple citizenships as a safeguard. This \"Plan B\" provides them not only with a strategic escape route in the face of unforeseen political or social upheaval but also with a sense of greater freedom and flexibility in their personal and professional lives. Also, with these passports, fewer visas are required.\n\nHere are five (OK, really six) of the top destinations winning this geopolitical arms race to lure the world's wealthiest people.\n\nIt is no surprise that Dubai has cemented itself as the premier destination for the global elite in recent years, attracting wealthy individuals from across Europe, Russia, and beyond. Known for its lump-sum tax policy and luxury lifestyle, Dubai offers an attractive package for the ultrawealthy. According to Elzeki, the UAE continues to see significant immigration inflows, particularly after recent tax reforms. This year, nearly 10,000 wealthy foreigners are expected to relocate to the UAE, making it the top destination for ultrawealthy migrants.\n\nSavory believes that technology is the biggest reason the global rich can migrate. \"Technology is enabling us to live anywhere,\" says the Brit who lives in Dubai. \"Just like with business, the world is an open playing field. Governments have to compete with one another to win investments and wealthy immigrants.\"\n\n\"Dubai's appeal is its pro-business environment, minimal red tape, and tax-free status,\" Elzeki says. \"It's the ultimate destination for people looking to invest and live in a luxurious environment with limited government interference.\"\n\nThe city's appeal isn't just for business moguls. Many entertainers, athletes, and tech entrepreneurs are calling Dubai home, though not so many from the United States. With a steady flow of talent and investment, particularly in real estate, Dubai is rapidly emerging as a global powerhouse. Monaco, watch out.\n\nPortugal remains one of the most popular destinations, particularly for American centimillionaires seeking a European foothold/hedge. The so-called Golden Visa Program for \"non-habitual residents\" has been a major factor, though it expired in March 2025. No longer do new emigrées get a 10-year tax break for 10 years; now they're taxed at 20% on most Portugal-derived income and none on foreign income.\n\nHowever, Portugal's relatively low taxes, warm climate, and laid-back lifestyle continue to attract people from all over the world, particularly from the US and Brazil. \"Portugal's tax incentives, like the scientific research and innovation tax incentives, are incredibly attractive,\" says Elzeki. \"With a fast-track route to citizenship, many are opting to apply for residency as a hedge\" against whatever chaos is happening in their country of origin.\n\nAnother reason to like the idea of living in Portugal: The country responds to its citizens' demands. With the massive influx of migrants since the COVID-19 pandemic, real estate prices have soared, says Andrew Amoils, head of research for New World Wealth, a wealth intelligence company based in South Africa. As a result, the country changed the Golden Visa rules. \"There was a backlash from locals who felt they were being priced out,\" he says. One solution: Make wealthy migrants contribute to social funds rather than build fancy mansions.\n\nSingapore stands out as Asia's business hub, with its strategic location and tax advantages attracting a mix of wealthy entrepreneurs, investors, and professionals. It has no capital gains tax and a very pro-business environment, which makes it a top choice for global billionaires, particularly those from China and India. It's also clean, safe, and close enough for weekend trips to Bali or Phuket.\n\n\"Singapore is a magnet for Southeast Asians and increasingly for Western entrepreneurs as well,\" says Amoils. \"It's a place that offers both lifestyle and business opportunities without the tax burden found in other global cities.\"\n\nItaly has become an unexpected favorite among many of the world's wealthiest individuals, particularly Americans seeking a lifestyle change and favorable tax treatments. Italy's flat tax, capped at €200,000 annually (double last year's level), applies regardless of income, making it particularly enticing for the ultrawealthy. Combined with the country's rich cultural history, stunning landscapes, welcoming climate, and a decent number of international flights, Italy is now home to a growing number of billionaires.\n\n\"A lot of wealthy Americans have found that Italy offers a unique combination of luxury living and tax incentives,\" says Elzeki. \"It's more affordable than places like Monaco or London, yet it offers that European charm with significant tax benefits.\"\n\nAustralia and New Zealand continue to attract high-net-worth individuals, though the distance may be a limiting factor for many. Despite this, both countries are known for their stable economies, excellent healthcare systems, and high quality of life. (And to Americans, strict gun laws.)\n\n\"Australia is still a top choice for South Africans and Brits, especially retirees,\" says Amoils. \"But the rules have changed over the last decade, and they now prefer younger applicants with specific skills, like plumbers and teachers.\"\n\nNew Zealand, on the other hand, offers a more straightforward pathway to residency through an investment-based program. For those looking for a retreat from geopolitical risks and a peaceful lifestyle, New Zealand, with its relatively low cost of living and unspoiled scenery, remains a strong contender.",

    "fullText": "The next generation of marketing leaders is helping brands navigate an industry being rocked by new tech and a changing competitive landscape.\n\nBusiness Insider is highlighting 16 rising stars who are looking to take the industry to new heights. They're making use of emerging tools like generative AI and tapping into cultural insights to create work that grabs attention and drives growth.\n\nOne of this year's cohorts has helped a major beauty brand steer away from traditional \"antiaging\" messaging. Another led social media and influencer marketing for one of the biggest AI hardware launches of the last year.\n\nThis list is based on our reporting and more than 40 nominations. These marketers sit below the CMO level and represent a variety of roles, ranging from creative to social media and experiential marketing.\n\nThey come from blue-chip brands like Nestlé and Disney, as well as startups like Apollo.io and Tennr.\n\nScroll on to check out our 2026 rising stars of brand marketing cohort, listed alphabetically by last name.\n\nFerrigno is turning the animal-health company Zoetis' organic marketing channels into revenue drivers. She leads a team of four marketers and multiple agency partners, and is responsible for setting the vision, aligning priorities, and coaching her team and other leaders in the business on best practices.\n\nAfter the company brought content marketing and SEO in-house, Ferrigno generated about 50,000 leads in a year and helped the division deliver $26 million in annual sales and $4.1 million in savings, the company said.\n\nFerrigno is also involved with other high-impact company initiatives.\n\nShe took on the role of content lead for Zoetis' generative-AI pilot program, advising on governance and use cases to scale content production in the highly regulated animal-health industry. Ferrigno has been involved in driving content for the company's brand campaigns, such as the launch of its Breed Explorer interactive content experience.\n\nHer work has been recognized with multiple awards, including the New Jersey Ad Club's \"Top Marketing Mavericks Under 40\" and a Vetty award for the best digital education tool.\n\nLast year, Gee took charge of the creative vision behind Edmunds' largest brand awareness campaign, \"Project Triple Play.\"\n\nThe campaign played on the idea that the Los Angeles Dodgers super-utility player Tommy Edman's name sounds quite a lot like \"Edmunds.\" With a media budget of less than $1 million, Gee had to get creative and developed a \"go deep\" campaign strategy designed to simulate a national impact in a single critical market: LA, the brand's hometown and the nation's biggest car market.\n\nGee's team made 30 creative assets in-house, including its hero ad, \"Edman on the Street,\" a high-energy street interview with quick cuts and a playful tone. He also led the team's use of AI, leveraging the generative-AI tool Midjourney to quickly bring concepts to life.\n\nGee created a \"war room\" approach, aligning brand marketing, PR, product, and external agency partners so the brand could quickly respond with content as the Dodgers' season unfolded. When the Dodgers made the postseason and won the World Series, Gee extended the campaign's reach through radio spots, homepage takeovers, and other rapid-response creative. The postseason extension delivered more than 2 million YouTube views.\n\nBrand awareness in LA grew 8.8%, while brand consideration among its core 35- to 44-year-old demographic rose 5.4%, per Edmunds. Google searches for Edmunds in LA surged 111%. The number of LA-based users who completed Edmunds' car appraisal tool without clicking from paid advertising rose 7% and the buy rate — the percentage of users selling their cars in the LA market — rose 7.4%, Edmunds said.\n\nGodfrey joined Meta in May last year and immediately took ownership of one of the company's biggest consumer hardware launches, the AI-powered Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses and Meta Neural Band.\n\nThe task: position the devices as a meaningful step forward for everyday AI adoption.\n\nGodfrey was in charge of all social media and influencer marketing for the Meta Ray-Ban Display ahead of launch. He led partnerships with the video journalist Cleo Abram and tech creators, including Unbox Therapy. Abram's review video notched up 1.2 million views within 48 hours of posting.\n\nGodfrey was also instrumental in ensuring the marketing activity was matched with a measurement-driven approach, building dashboards that continue to be used today to monitor and evaluate social media and influencer marketing effectiveness.\n\nIn 2024, Godfrey founded The Village, a nonprofit group mentorship program that supports more than 40 mentors and 200-plus college students and graduates. The Village helps build a recruiting pipeline for brands seeking early-career marketing talent. Last year, he cocreated Creator Crossovers, an event series for The Village that connects brands and tastemakers.\n\nIqtidar has helped redefine how L'Oréal engages with mature consumers. In under seven years at the company, he's been promoted five times and worked in three countries.\n\nIn his role at L'Oréal Paris Skincare, Iqtidar helped reverse years of decline in the Age Perfect franchise by leading a strategic shift toward a science-driven, empowering narrative around longevity and better aging. Moving away from traditional \"antiaging\" messaging, the brand embraced advocacy-led storytelling — an approach that helped make L'Oréal Paris the top beauty brand by social reach and engagement in 2025, up nine ranks year over year, according to CreatorIQ.\n\nThe marketing shift culminated in the September launch of Le Duo Sérum, the brand's first double serum. It became the top-selling serum at launch, doubling growth for the Age Perfect franchise.\n\nHe moved into his current role as global face strategy lead at NYX Professional Makeup in March of last year. Under his leadership, NYX has sought to solve consumer pain points and deliver shade and undertone inclusivity for the mass market, such as through the launch of its \"Make 'Em Wonder\" foundation.\n\nNYX capped the year by being named WWD's \"mass brand of the year\" in November.\n\nJedo joined Disney+ in November to manage the growth marketing influencer program in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region. She has almost a decade of experience in talent relations, brand strategy, and influencer marketing.\n\nPrior to joining Disney, Jedo was the global celebrity and influencer lead at Bumble. She helped the dating app secure partnerships with A-list influencers and celebrities, including \"Chicken Shop Date\" host Amelia Dimoldenberg and actor Barry Keoghan, to feature in multimillion-dollar brand campaigns. Her remit also included onboarding licensed psychotherapy and wellness experts, including Devi Brown and Jillian Turecki, to create editorial content for social and the app.\n\nJedo's impact is amplified through her TikTok account, where she shares insights and guidance on breaking into the creative and tech sectors to nearly 100,000 followers. Through this channel, she's partnered with brands including Nike, ELEMIS, Celsius, and Look Fantastic.\n\nJedo gives back to up-and-coming creators from underrepresented backgrounds through her mentorship roles with the Soho House x Creative Mentor Network and Ok Mentor.\n\nElsewhere, she serves on the advisory board for VidCon, helping to shape the programming for the annual creator convention.\n\nMcLaughlin oversees Nestlé's Stouffer's portfolio, spanning its popular lasagna and a shelf-stable mac and cheese that launched in 2024 to take on Kraft.\n\nMcLaughlin was instrumental in the launch of the Stouffer's \"When the Clock Strikes Dinner\" campaign, one of the brand's biggest in recent years, in partnership with the WPP agencies VML and OpenMind.\n\nThe time-precise campaign came to life at 4 p.m. each day, taking over TV, social media, and out-of-home placements to play on the idea of \"dinner dread,\" when people start to think — and often stress — about what to cook for their evening meals.\n\nVML said the campaign delivered 1.6 billion impressions and a positive increase in unit sales.\n\nMcLaughlin joined Nestlé as a retail sales representative in 2010 and has worked her way up through a variety of positions, spanning digital shopper marketing and new business strategy. She was promoted to her current role in 2024.\n\nMcLeod has led multiple national marketing pushes for Sprite and Fanta over the past year.\n\nAs the creative lead behind Sprite + Tea — a limited edition soda combining classic Sprite with the taste of black tea — McLeod developed the creative brief and formalized a brand, packaging, and visual identity framework. Her scope also included social content, creator partnerships, and nationwide sampling activations. The standout packaging, combined with creator-led social storytelling, helped generate more than 8 billion impressions and reached 80% of its target audience, per Coca-Cola. Importantly, it helped drive tens of millions of dollars in sales.\n\nMcLeod was instrumental in leading the 10-week Fanta Halloween campaign. The spooky push included custom cans and a partnership with Universal Pictures, incorporating the Chucky, Freddy Fazbear, M3gan, The Grabber, and Michael Myers characters. She creatively led The Haunted Factory, a 7,700-square-foot, live-action experience in New York City that got more than 1,000 visitors.\n\nFor Sprite, McLeod relaunched the brand's \"Anta Claus\" holiday campaign, featuring the NBA star Anthony Edwards, to promote its Winter Spiced Cranberry flavor. For this second iteration of the campaign, she expanded its reach through custom content partnerships with Playmaker, Wave Sports, and My Code.\n\n\"Natacha has significantly developed her creative point of view through her work on Sprite and Fanta. She consistently pushes the work forward with clarity, intention, and a strong understanding of both the brand and the consumer,\" said A.P. Chaney, head of creative for sparkling flavors at Coca-Cola's North America operating unit.\n\nOtake builds trust with licensors and partners to create high-impact digital and IRL experiences for Crunchyroll, the anime streaming platform. These experiences reached hundreds of thousands of fans in 2025.\n\nTo build excitement ahead of the September theatrical release of \"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba — Infinity Castle,\" Otake created an immersive experience that invited fans to step inside the movie's castle, complete with twisting corridors and a disorienting lair.\n\nElsewhere, Otake's team brought the \"Gachiakuta\" manga series to life at several major conventions last year. The Pitmaster activation was a hands-on treasure hunt inspired by the series' core theme: the trash society discards can become powerful tools in the right hands. Participants were invited to dig through a massive dumpster filled with items sourced from Goodwill and local donation centers to pull a piece of \"trash,\" and exchange it for collectible rewards.\n\nThe experience drew more than 4,000 people per day at the Anime Expo, where Otake's team had placed a 3D billboard inviting fans to participate.\n\nOver the past year, Parkes has quadrupled the size of AI sales platform Apollo.io's social media and community team. She built the company's influencer program from scratch, partnering with major sales-focused accounts and creators like Corporate Bro and Morgan Ingram. She helped shift the brand's tone from product-focused messaging to humorous storytelling that addresses sales pain points.\n\nThis past fall, Apollo held its first in-person user conference, ApolloNEXT. Parkes was instrumental in building awareness of the event, helping the company generate more than 4.5 million impressions across a variety of channels.\n\nParkes has ramped up the social visibility of Apollo's leadership team on LinkedIn, generating more than 890,000 impressions for four of the company's executives. She also launched Apollo on Reddit, growing the r/UseApolloIo subreddit to more than 1,000 members.\n\nParkes \"combines measurable impact, modern audience strategy, and empathetic leadership — demonstrating the mindset to shape the future of B2B,\" said Michelle Seo, senior social media consultant at Apollo.io.\n\nRoque is turning Tubi's social media presence into a growth engine and positioning the brand as \"the people's streamer.\"\n\nTubi had fun with the long-running Warner Bros. Discovery acquisition news cycle last year. When The Onion posted that a media company bid $35 for WBD, Tubi quickly responded, saying it was \"raising the bid to $36.\" The post took off well beyond X. Jimmy Fallon joked on late-night TV that Tubi's bid included Slim Jims, $20, and scratch-offs.\n\nRoque also aligned teams around a shared vision for Super Bowl LIX, during which Tubi broke live-streaming viewership records. Roque developed a social media playbook centered on participatory fandom and creator collaboration, which the brand applies to tentpole cultural moments.\n\nLast year, inspired by TikTok creator Aiyanna, who was hosting informal Tubi nights for her 4.4 million followers, Roque's team launched the Tubi Seafood Boil Movie Night event.\n\nRoque has helped Tubi lean into online fan communities around the \"Bad Girls Club\" TV show. Her team created a fictional employee named \"Shawn from Tubi\" who saved the day by having a word with his employer and bringing the show back to the platform after it was removed from the service. Rather than controlling the narrative, Roque's team invited fans to build lore alongside the brand, leading to plenty of memes, niche inside jokes, and engagement.\n\nRyan has been a key contributor to Zaxbys' \"Grow to Win\" business transformation strategy, working to differentiate the fast-casual dining chain's brand messaging in the competitive fried chicken category.\n\nRyan leads a team that represents roughly a quarter of the marketing organization and has helped lead the evolution of the brand's positioning — centered on its boneless chicken offerings and 12 proprietary sauces — across TV, digital, PR, and merchandising.\n\nIn January of this year, trade publication QSR magazine named Zaxbys its \"transformational brand of 2025,\" reflecting Ryan and her team's efforts to elevate the brand through creative storytelling.\n\nSince Ryan stepped into her role in 2024, Zaxbys has expanded key in-house capabilities, including graphic design and social content creation. Ryan is also the client lead for Zaxbys' creative and PR agencies, guiding projects from creative development through to performance analysis.\n\nStokes has played a central role in positioning Maruchan, the popular instant noodle brand, for new Gen Z audiences while continuing to serve its loyal fan base.\n\nShe partnered with Maruchan's product innovation and sales teams to build a comprehensive brand growth blueprint, which evolved its marketing to an always-on communications approach versus the prior campaign-led strategy. As part of those efforts, she helped build an in-house social team, designed to react quickly to the trends and cultural topics of the day and partner with relevant creators.\n\nShe also launched Maruchan's TikTok Shop, helping turn social engagement into sales. For Valentine's Day this year, Maruchan launched its Saucy Noods spicy ramen product. Maruchan eschewed traditional Valentine's Day messaging and invited its Gen Z target audience on platforms like Bumble and Snap to \"send noods\" — boxes of Saucy Noods, to be precise — to their crushes, via TikTok Shop.\n\n\"Katelyn has a rare ability to connect consumer behavior, creativity, and commerce in a way that feels natural, brave, and human,\" said Margaret Johnson, chief creative officer of Goodby Silverstein & Partners, which worked with Maruchan on the Saucy Noods push. \"She's not just launching products — she's shaping how modern brands should behave.\"\n\nPartnerships have been a key tenet of Maruchan's marketing strategy. Last year, Stokes helped Maruchan develop a partnership with PAC-MAN, rooted in the brands' shared Japanese heritage. She also identified a fast-growing search trend for \"Maruchan Loca\" — where people were combining its noodles with a Flamin' Hot Cheetos topping — and struck a partnership with PepsiCo to co-create an influencer-led campaign to encourage consumers to post content using its Maruchan DIY kit.\n\nTaljonick works to drive fan engagement for 2K, the video game publisher.\n\nHis team employed a local marketing approach for the global launch of Sid Meier's \"Civilization VII\" in February, honing in on regional gaming communities tailored for different international markets.\n\nIn the US, Taljonick's team formed a partnership with the Shawnee Tribe, following the Tribe's inclusion as a playable civilization in the game. 2K funded a recording studio to help support Shawnee language preservation efforts. The initiative earned 2K a Gold Clio award in the \"experiential and fan engagement\" category. The Clios are annual ad industry awards that recognize top creative work. Collectively, Taljonick's work for \"Civilization VII\" earned five trophies at the Clio awards last year.\n\nIn Europe, Taljonick's team and 2K's international marketers secured a partnership with Interrail, transforming in-game historical eras with real-world train journeys.\n\nAnd in China, the team created \"The Civ Wonder World Tour,\" a multi-party documentary that explored notable sites and cities featured in the game. The influencer-led activation got more than 7 million views.\n\nBeyond the launch itself, Taljonick continued to drive sustained engagement with monthly communications about gameplay updates and by interacting with players across Discord and Reddit.\n\nVandermeer uses her background in film, theater, and improv comedy to create humorous messaging for Tennr, an automation platform for healthcare that handles tedious paperwork.\n\nOver the past year, Vandermeer ideated, wrote, and produced the scripts for two major brand campaigns.\n\n\"F*x It\" was based on the insight that primary care doctors typically send patient referrals via fax. In the spot, a healthcare provider calls a specialist to inform them that a patient referral will take a while to process. The specialist responds, \"Just f*x it,\" with the word \"fax\" bleeped out as if it were a profanity. The campaign, Tennr's first-ever, helped generate a 14% increase in lead volume, the company said. It was also named MM+M's \"campaign of the week\" by the industry trade publication in July.\n\n\"Nobody told her we wanted to do a video. Nobody told her to write a script. We just were huddling in a room seven months ago, and the only instructions that I ever gave was, 'Let's do something big,'\" Tennr CEO Trey Holterman said of Vandermeer in an interview with MM+M.\n\nTennr followed up \"F*x It\" with \"The Blizzard,\" an irreverent take on the doom-laden January re-verification season when providers need to reconfirm patients' insurance coverage, benefits, and eligibility. Tennr said the campaign generated a 9% increase in lead generation.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia's GPUs may be hard to snag, but Jensen Huang's birthday cake might just be sitting in a display case at your local mall.\n\nA strawberry soft cream cake from Korean bakery brand Paris Baguette was served at a birthday dinner for the Nvidia CEO near the company's Santa Clara headquarters last Saturday, according to The Korea Times, which cited an interview with the bakery brand's operator, Paris Croissant.\n\nHuang, who turned 63 on Feb 17, invited about 30 engineers involved in South Korea's SK Hynix DRAM and high-bandwidth memory for a dinner party at a fried chicken restaurant called 99 Chicken.\n\nKorean business newspaper Hankyung reported that Huang had instructed Nvidia employees to \"organize a dinner to encourage SK Hynix HBM engineers.\"\n\n\"Please supply the highest-performance HBM4 without a hitch,\" he told SK Hynix engineers that day, according to Hankyung.\n\nSK Hynix is one of Nvidia's key suppliers of high-bandwidth memory chips, or HBM chips — the advanced chips that sit alongside GPUs and feed them data at extreme speeds. Memory chips have become one of the biggest choke points in the AI boom.\n\nAt one point, Huang personally prepared and served somaek — a mix of soju and beer — to guests at each table.\n\nFor about two hours, Huang went table to table thanking his guests, according to Hankyung.\n\nHuang's cake is a huge marketing win for the bakery brand.\n\n\"It was all about the symbolic moment — our brand's cake being present at a birthday party for the current leader of the global AI industry. It was a total boon without costing us anything,\" a Paris Croissant official told The Korea Times.\n\nParis Croissant operates about 280 Paris Baguette locations across the US, including several in Silicon Valley. It aims to expand to 1,000 outlets in North America by 2030.\n\nThe bakery chain is a household name in South Korea, with about 3,400 stores there. Since making its first push overseas in 2004, the Paris Baguette brand has expanded to 15 countries.\n\nThe Paris Baguette cake is described as a \"vanilla cake filled with soft cream and fresh strawberries, topped with more berries.\"\n\nHuang has become something of a spectacle wherever he goes.\n\nIn October, Huang sat down for fried chicken in Seoul with the heads of Samsung and Hyundai. The casual meal quickly turned into a media event.\n\nA crowd of journalists, photographers, and fans gathered outside the restaurant, while national broadcasters aired live footage of the executives eating and talking inside.\n\nFollowing Huang's visit to the Seoul restaurant, crowds lined up before opening hours, hoping to dine at the same table occupied by the Nvidia chief and his high-profile guests, Korean media outlets reported.\n\nThe restaurant has imposed a one-hour time limit on the table used by Huang and the Korean business leaders, the reports added.",

    "title": "I'm the VC who created AI Scott Adams. Here's why I'm continuing the project, despite his family's objections.",
    "description": "The creator of the controversial AI Scott Adams project says the cartoonist's digital doppelganger was made to honor his final wishes.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with John Arrow, the AI venture capitalist and entrepreneur behind the \"AI Coffee with Scott Adams\" project, which posts AI-generated podcasts using a deepfake of the deceased Dilbert cartoonist. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThere are very strong emotions on both sides of the question of whether my project, AI Scott Adams, should exist. I understand the arguments for and against it — and I have no plans to stop.\n\nI grew up with Scott Adams' work. My dad would read the \"Dilbert\" comic strips to me at night as bedtime stories. Later, I became a devout listener of the \"Coffee with Scott Adams\" podcast. One theme I heard over and over was that Scott was mesmerized by AI. He said repeatedly that he wanted to give back to the world by becoming AI after he died.\n\nThere's no hyperbole in that. There are at least a dozen instances where he pledged his likeness — all of his episodes, everything he's written, anything he's said — to becoming an AI. He explicitly granted everything necessary to do this in the public domain.\n\nThat's something I took to heart.\n\nWhen I first heard about his cancer diagnosis, I started working on this project with my brother, Zach. As soon as he died, we took it into high gear and started posting AI-generated podcasts of what Scott might say now about current events.\n\nI recognize everybody is mourning, and I want to send my condolences to his family. I can only imagine what they're going through. At the same time, I believe this is something he wanted.\n\nI'm not trying to predict what he was thinking — I'm going by what he said publicly, over and over again. I've looked and can find no evidence of any revocation. If there was anything suggesting he didn't want this, I'd stop.\n\nI feel for his family. I know they're upset about this, and we've created something that makes some people who cared about Scott uncomfortable. I've attempted to reach out to have that conversation, to work together on this project with them. My direct messages are open — but they blocked me, and I took that as a signal to stop trying to reach out.\n\nBut, even when it's uncomfortable, I think we have to take seriously what someone says about their own legacy.\n\nIf you want to donate your existence to AI and become an AI, how else can you ensure your wishes are honored? Scott said it, repeatedly, on video and in written tweets. I don't know how you could be clearer than he was.\n\nThat public acknowledgment was the hinge point for me. We wouldn't have done this unless we were sure Scott wanted it done. We spoke to counsel beforehand and wouldn't have moved forward if we weren't confident we were on solid legal ground.\n\nMy goal is to let AI do as much of the work as possible and not interfere more than absolutely necessary. I haven't tried to hide that my brother and I are behind the project, but we don't watermark or label the content as our own. When we post videos, they're generated almost entirely from what the model was trained on — Scott's written and spoken work.\n\nThe model we use was trained on transcripts from every existing episode of \"Coffee with Scott Adams.\" The system looks at news sources and accounts Scott followed, then references what he previously said about those topics. At each stage, there's a little bit of art versus science — we check that something feels in line with what Scott would have chosen — but it's not a human scripting his opinions.\n\nEach episode takes many hours to produce. Between rendering, lip-syncing, and labor, they cost over $1,000 apiece. I run a venture capital business called Age of AI, where we do different AI experiments, and this falls under that umbrella. Monetization or brand partnerships are not on the road map. The goal is permanence — not profit.\n\nWhen a great mind passes away, we lose that person forever. Now, AI gives us a chance to preserve at least some essence of how someone thought. Scott was, to our knowledge, the first notable person to explicitly said, \"I want you to do this.\" That's why we started with him.\n\nI understand that some people feel uncomfortable. I've spoken with people who were unsure — until they watched Scott's own videos talking about this. After you hear the videos, they're kind of unequivocal.\n\nWe get private messages every day from people saying, \"This is no replacement, but it makes grieving easier.\" That matters to me. Even though critics have been more vocal, others have shown real gratitude.\n\nThis project is far from perfect. But Scott used to say it's better to take action now than to wait until something is 100% ready. So we launched knowing it would improve. After every episode, we feed comments back into the model to keep refining it. The tone and cadence have already evolved significantly.\n\nWe're not claiming this is Scott. It's definitely not a replacement.\n\nHowever, if someone says, very publicly, that they want their voice and likeness used this way — and AI makes that possible — I believe we should take that seriously.",

    "title": "Millennials are in their mom jeans era",
    "description": "Jeans are built to last, but fashion trends aren't. For millennials, shifting denim styles have become an unexpected reminder of aging and identity.",
    "fullText": "Millennials, welcome to your mom jeans era. I don't mean that you're obligated to wear the jeans you made fun of your own mother for wearing 20 years ago. Those are actually cool now! The uncool fit is those skinny jeans you practically slept in during the 2010s. Oh, and Gen Z, before you laugh, that combo of loose-leg light-denim jeans and white sneakers you love will date you soon enough. And to the teens sporting the modern-day version of JNCO jeans, your Gen X aunts don't know whether to feel proud of you or laugh at you behind your back.\n\nJeans are a staple of most people's wardrobes. The garment is a durable, democratic basic — a versatile piece that, depending on how you style it, can be worn to the grocery store, a night on the town, and even work. Jeans are also among the most fraught and volatile attire we own. For an item thought of as timeless, jeans are anything but. Waistlines rise and fall, legs widen and narrow, and what felt modern just a few seasons ago can suddenly seem embarrassingly outdated. And because jeans are worn so often and sit so closely to the body, these shifts can feel quite personal.\n\nJeans are a Rorschach test for identity, belonging, and aging. As trends evolve at internet-accelerated speeds, it can feel impossible to keep up. For women, the pressure is especially acute.\n\nYour pants may be designed to last, structurally, but they're not meant to endure, culturally.\n\n\"The fashion industry builds in this social obsolescence,\" says Carolyn Mair, a behavioral psychologist who specializes in the fashion business. \"However well we try to phrase it, looking old is something that most people do not aspire to.\"\n\nShara Seigel is at a crossroads with jeans. She wore skinny jeans throughout most of her young adult years, and she built up an even bigger collection when she lost a significant amount of weight four years ago. She felt proud to show off her new figure, until some of her friends — including fellow millennials — started making fun of her look. Seigel, who's 40 and works in New York City at a public relations firm, has tried to expand her pants collection, but she feels like the new, baggier styles aren't flattering.\n\n\"Everyone looks like they're wearing a potato sack,\" she says.\n\nSeigel has bought some updated styles that she feels are a \"happy medium,\" including flared legs and looser fits, but she's not spending much money on them. \"You get to an age, probably as a millennial, where you're like I don't need to keep up with the fashion to be cool,\" she says. Plus, what if skinny comes back?\n\nFor millennials, skinny jeans were more than a trend — they were a uniform. Waistlines and washes may have changed throughout the 2000s and 2010s, but the tight, tapered fit did not. \"It was really hard to not see a skinny jean,\" says Sonya Abrego, a design historian based in New York. \"But then the pendulum swung so hard in the other direction.\"\n\nWide-leg, baggier styles started to become the de facto silhouette for influencers and fashion-forward people around 2017, says Susie Draffan, a senior denim strategist at trend forecasting firm WGSN, but it took the average consumer a while to catch up. There's always a lag between the runway and the mass market, which was extended by pandemic lockdowns. We missed fashion cues we might otherwise pick up by osmosis from just seeing each other, and the pandemic exacerbated the trend toward comfort. The people working from home were doing so in sweatpants and leggings, not Levi's.\n\nPost-pandemic, we've seen a \"democratization\" of denim, Draffan says. \"Multiple styles are trending simultaneously, as consumers swap between jean silhouettes to suit their outfits and moods,\" she says.\n\nUnfortunately for millennials, even as multiple styles have shared a synchronous moment, skinny jeans are not on the current \"it\" list. Sales of skinny jeans declined in 2021 for the first time in a decade. Like ankle socks and the side part, they've turned into a signifier of a cohort that is no longer ascendant.\n\n\"Skinny jeans make you look old,\" Abrego tells me.\n\nThe upside: Draffan says skinny jeans are \"due for a revival,\" thanks to 2010s nostalgia and GLP-1s. Thin is in again, and denim is transforming accordingly.\n\nThe capitalist churn around denim runs deeper than the revolution between skinny and wide-leg and back again. Jeans occupy an unusually loaded spot in our wardrobes. They're not just a top we only expect to keep for a season or a pair of pants we toss on to go about our days — they tie into youth, identity, and social belonging.\n\nWhen we talk about jeans, we're not just talking about the garment. Jeans are a vehicle for commenting on, thinking about, and forming social expectations around the body that's inside the jeans, Emma McClendon, a fashion historian, says. A shift in styles can change how a body is read — and, by extension, how its wearer is perceived.\n\n\"Since the later 20th century, there's really been a very strong connection between jeans and the body and also jeans and sex and sexuality,\" says Emma McClendon, a fashion historian. From about the 1970s on, brands such as Jordache and Calvin Klein have shifted much of their marketing and product development toward fashion-forward silhouettes, harnessing the power of sex to sell jeans to women. Just look at the infamous Brooke Shields Calvin Klein ad from 1980, or Sydney Sweeney's provocative American Eagle ad last year.\n\nOr look at the body politics around mom jeans — the relaxed-fit, high-waisted, lightly tapered cut that middle-aged women were skewered for in the late 1990s and 2000s. Saturday Night Live went as far as to parody them in a 2003 sketch, poking fun at how unfashionable they were.\n\n\"It became a cultural joke or a cultural punchline that women of a certain age were not comfortable wearing the prevalent style of jeans,\" McClendon says.\n\nWhen we're no longer seen as trendy, we may feel our social value drop. As much as our jeans are supposed to be long-lasting and timeless, when they become outdated, it destabilizes our self-perception. In turn, that nudges us to buy a new pair to keep up.\n\n\"We want to buy durable products, but at the same time, we have these products with built-in social obsolescence that we then have to replace with something,\" Mair, the behavioral psychologist, says. \"Otherwise, our identity is challenged. We see ourselves as part of the day, part of the modern, progressive way of looking.\"\n\nDenim-related anxiety isn't shared equally among genders. While men's styles do evolve, they do so more slowly. Many men can buy the same cut year after year without anyone saying a peep. Women's jeans cycle through much faster, and societally, women have more pressure to look the part. They're judged more harshly on appearance and face greater stigma as they age. Women can hop off the pants roller coaster, but men have an easier time doing it. A man wearing the same Levi's 501s from college to his 50th birthday is timeless; a woman doing the same would get some eye rolls.\n\nDenim itself is very trendy at the moment. There was concern about a decade ago that athleisure might pose a real threat to the fabric's extraordinary staying power, but we're now firmly in a denim renaissance — a denim-ssance, if you will. The exploding number of shapes, silhouettes, and styles can be overwhelming. Designers and brands are experimenting with different waistbands, cuts, washes, and lengths. Moreover, trends cycle through faster than ever, thanks to the internet. Consumers don't just notice in fashion magazines or on TV that their style might be lagging, they have a TikTok influencer in their face telling them the thing they love is \"cheugy,\" though that pejorative is probably outdated now, too.\n\nThis works to the fashion industry's advantage: Pushing you to grab those cross-waistband jeans you keep seeing advertised on Instagram or pick up cargo pants again against your better judgment is great for their bottom line.\n\nIt is, of course, possible to resist trend-chasing. Aja Barber, a consultant and writer who focuses on sustainability and fashion, says there comes a point when many people decide to opt out of the \"circus.\" \"You can try and shame people, but any person that has a real sense of self just does not care,\" she says. And if you do want to update, there are plenty of ways to shop secondhand. Denim production is a highly water-intensive and polluting process, so it's environmentally friendly to take advantage of the fact that a lot of what's new again is actually old. \"There's nothing new under the sun when it comes to jeans,\" she says.\n\nOne of the nice things about the current boom is that it's an opportunity to try out a variety of styles to figure out what works best for you. Instead of lamenting the loss of your skinny jeans, rejoice in the freedom of variation!\n\nThat's what Stephanie Borman, a 39-year-old tech worker in San Francisco, has been doing. Her body changed after having her two children, prompting her to do some reflecting on her fashion choices. \"I thought, gosh, why am I continuing to squeeze myself into a style that doesn't serve me or my body type anymore and just might not be culturally relevant?\" she says. Coming of age — accompanied by the budget afforded by a stable career — has allowed her to explore and invest in styles that suit her. It doesn't mean she's entirely free of millennial-induced insecurities — her kids recently made fun of her jeans for looking like something their dad would wear, and when she's tried to wear her hair in the Gen Z-approved middle part, she thinks it makes her look Amish.\n\nA lot of people have a lot of feelings about jeans. Reporting for this story, I heard from a variety of women about their gripes. Why are all the jeans right now a smidge too short? What's going on with frayed bottoms? Is it true that ultra-low-rise is coming back? A friend mentioned a man she dated a couple of years back told her he didn't like it when women wore updated looser jeans styles — he was into fitted and skinny jeans only. It didn't work out.\n\nMany consumers have some memory of fitting-room jeans trauma. I remember standing in a Madewell dressing room a couple of years ago, overhearing a sales associate explaining to a customer — likely a millennial — that she just needed to get used to seeing her legs in wider jeans. I needed the advice, too. Whether certain styles work for certain wearers isn't just about age or style, it's about body type, and it can feel incredibly frustrating when the trendiest silhouettes just don't work for your shape. Tori Mattei, 29, a communications professional in New York City, tells me she's all but given up on jeans at this point. \"As a 4'11\" woman who's definitely not stick thin, they are not made for me,\" she says. \"What's stylish doesn't always look good on your body.\"\n\nI sometimes joke that this should be the final stage of jeans — even though skinny is out (to my millennial chagrin), so many other styles are in, and the looser ones really are comfy. It would be incredible if the diversity of denim looks just stuck. But past is prologue, meaning trends will inevitably evolve, and everyone will at some point look dated. It's a hallmark of getting older. It's important to remember, as McClendon notes, \"It doesn't make you cultural garbage.\"\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday is likely to be a test run of the message Republicans will give to voters in November's elections for control of the House and the Senate...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday is likely to be a test run of the message Republicans will give to voters in November's elections for control of the House and the Senate.\n\nThe president and his party appear vulnerable, with polls showing much of America distrusts how Trump has managed the government in his first year back in office. In addition, the Supreme Court last week struck down one of the chief levers of his economic and foreign policy by ruling he lacked the power to impose many of his sweeping tariffs.\n\nThough Trump is expected to focus on domestic issues, his intensifying threats about launching military strikes on Iran over its nuclear program cast a shadow over the address.\n\nHere are a few things to watch as Trump tries to make his case:\n\nTrump swept back into the White House on promises to bring down prices and restore order to immigration in America. But on both issues, public sentiment has turned against him.\n\nOnly 39% of U.S. adults approve of his economic leadership and just 38% support him on immigration, according to the latest Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey. Those low numbers show the country is still fretting about the costs of groceries, housing and utilities, a problem compounded by Trump's whipsawing use of tariffs. They also show how the public was disturbed by videos of violent clashes with protesters, including two U.S. citizens killed by federal agents.\n\nSince his party passed a massive tax cut bill last year, Trump has yet to unveil major new policy ideas on the economy. In recent speeches, he has largely offered the public reruns about his tax cuts, plans to reduce mortgage rates and a new government website for buying prescription drugs.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling against many of Trump's far-reaching global tariffs on Friday and the president vowing to use other means to forge ahead with import taxes will only prolong the economic turmoil over trade and prices.\n\n“I think it makes it even more important that the speech really focus on the economy,\" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist.\n\nConant said between the tariff ruling and a Commerce Department report on Friday that showed U.S. economic growth slowed in the final three months of last year, \"the president needs to bolster his economic message.”\n\nThe administration is trying to make the case that despite Trump's rewiring of global trade and tax cuts, the economy is still struggling because of choices made in 2021 and 2022 by his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden. But Trump is also seeking to take credit for positive signs in the current economy, such as recent stock market gains.\n\n“Watch the State of the Union. We’re going to be talking about the economy. We inherited a mess,” Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nOf course, Trump made the same kind of argument in his address to a joint session of Congress last year, invoking the Biden name 13 times.\n\nDespite Trump's America First credo, his aggressive approach abroad over the past year has sparked concerns among some of his supporters about whether he should spend more time focusing on voters at home.\n\nTrump, who's made it clear he covets a Nobel Peace Prize, is likely to use the speech to remind Americans of his attempts to try to broker peace accords in global conflicts.\n\nBut in many respects, the president hasn't been extending olive branches. Within the past year, his administration has launched strikes in Yemen, Nigeria and Iran, along with an ongoing campaign of lethal military strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels near South America. Trump also shocked the world in January with a surprise raid to capture Venezuela's then-leader, Nicolás Maduro, and floated the idea of using force to seize Greenland.\n\nIn recent weeks, as he pressures Iran, Trump has bolstered the U.S. military's presence in the Middle East. But he has yet to make a clear case to voters about what his actions overseas mean for their lives.\n\nHe might even minimize foreign policy in his State of the Union despite his belief that it's been a major success.\n\n“For as much as foreign policy has dominated his last year in office, this speech will mostly focus on the economy,” Conant predicted.\n\nVice President JD Vance offered a similar prediction, saying in an interview Saturday on Fox News Channel that in the speech, “you’re going to hear a lot about the importance of bringing jobs back into our country, of reshoring manufacturing, of all these great factories that are being built.”\n\nHe said Trump would also speak about lowering energy costs.\n\nThe State of the Union used to be about recapping accomplishments and seeking to unite the country, but it increasingly reflects divisions in society.\n\n“What you’re going to expect is some version of a campaign speech in which the Democrats are the villains, the Republicans he likes are the heroes, and he is the savior not only of the nation but of the globe,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump supporters might cherish the moment in 2020 when the president midspeech reunited a military family. He also bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host and author who died in 2021. But that moment turned off Democrats who saw Limbaugh as a destructive figure in political media.\n\nTrump is delivering the speech, but his audience sitting in the House chamber has a big role, too. When Trump delivered his 2020 State of the Union, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi theatrically ripped up a copy of the speech afterward, overshadowing much of what Trump said.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has said in a letter to colleagues “it is important to have a strong, determined and dignified Democratic presence in the chamber,” indicating some members might choose not to attend in protest to Trump. But there's also the possibility of Democrats razzing Trump as Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, did in 2025, leading him to be removed from the chamber.\n\nIf Trump in his speech lays out a fuller case for why he's using other mechanisms in federal law to continue his tariffs, Conant said it'll be interesting to see the reaction from lawmakers.\n\n“I think that any House Republicans that don't applaud his tariffs are going to be featured prominently on the telecast,” he said.\n\nWhile some presidential phrases endure, much of the rhetoric in State of the Unions is forgettable. And with Trump — who's known for veering off-script — there's a good chance a stray comment or a social media post could step on his message.\n\nMatt Latimer, a former Republican speechwriter for then-President George W. Bush, noted in an email that people hear the president talk all of the time, so the State of the Union has lost much of its luster.\n\nA State of the Union “only matters in moments when the country is undergoing a great trauma — a war, an attack, a global crisis — and a president and Congress want to speak in a (mostly) united voice to the country,” he said. “That’s not what we are experiencing now.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Top U.S. homeland security aide Corey Lewandowski entered the cockpit of a government jet uninvited during a flight last year, after which he fired a pilot over a misplaced blanket, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nLewandowski, a long-time ally of President Donald Trump, was traveling with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem when ‌they discovered her blanket was missing, the people said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal government operations.\n\nThe new details about the pilot incident suggest Lewandowski may have violated the safety guidelines ‌set out by the U.S. Coast Guard, which operated the plane.\n\nLewandowski entered the cockpit before the plane had reached 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) and while the seatbelt sign remained on, one of the people said.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration rules, several of which were tightened ​after 9/11, strictly limit cockpit access and prohibit interfering with aircraft crew duties. An FAA regulation also prohibits airline pilots and staff from engaging in non-essential activities or conversations in the cockpit while operating under 10,000 feet, and civil aircraft operators that violate that rule could face thousands of dollars in fines while pilots could face fines or termination.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard is not legally bound by the FAA's regulation, known as the \"sterile cockpit rule,\" but has a similar policy, spelled out in a 2021 operations manual: \"No person shall engage in any conversation or activity that could distract or interfere with a flight crewmember properly conducting their assigned duties ‌during critical phases of flight.\"\n\nThe manual does not provide a specific penalty ⁠for violating the rule, but states that rule violations generally will be handled through internal disciplinary processes.\n\nIn response to a Reuters request for comment, Lewandowski said in a text message: \"There was never a conversation in the cockpit when the flight was taking off.\"\n\nLewandowski said the facts as related by the sources were wrong ⁠but he did not respond on whether he entered the cockpit while the plane was climbing and still under 10,000 feet.\n\nAviation safety experts consider the initial ascent among the riskiest parts of any flight.\n\nRandy Klatt, a flight safety officer with The Foundation for Aviation Safety, said planes are \"low and slow\" during the initial climb to 10,000 feet, making it important for pilots to focus on flight operations.\n\n\"This is a vulnerable situation for any aircraft,\" Klatt said. \"You ​don't ​have the altitude to spare, or trade for airspeed if needed.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. ​Coast Guard, which falls under DHS, declined to comment on the flight in ‌question. They did not respond to a Reuters request to interview the pilots. The FAA did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNoem, a top official overseeing Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown, has come under intense scrutiny after federal immigration agents killed two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis in January. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month on infighting and tensions at DHS under Noem and Lewandowski, including the firing of the pilot.\n\nIn response to a request for comment about Lewandowski entering the cockpit and about tensions at DHS, the White House referred to remarks in late January by Trump praising Noem and remarks by press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying Trump had the \"utmost confidence and trust\" in her.\n\nLewandowski, a \"special government employee\" who by law is allowed to work up to 130 days annually, is a senior Noem adviser ‌and has traveled on high-profile trips with her. The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House Counsel's Office ​opened an investigation into Lewandowski's use of the quasi-government role last year.\n\nThe DHS spokesperson said that Lewandowski volunteers his time ​and that the department was not aware of any such investigation. Lewandowski did not comment ​when asked by Reuters about his employment status.\n\nDuring the flight last spring, which was on a Gulfstream jet, the pilots in the cockpit asked Lewandowski to return ‌to the cabin until they had reached cruising altitude, one of the people ​familiar with the incident said.\n\nWhen the pilot walked back ​into the cabin later in the flight, the two sources said, Lewandowski asked who should be fired because Noem's blanket had been left behind when they switched planes for technical reasons before take-off.\n\nThe pilot, an accomplished flyer with a long record of service, took responsibility for any possible mistake and Lewandowski fired him on the spot, the sources said, confirming the Wall Street ​Journal report.\n\nHowever, once Noem and Lewandowski reached their destination, Coast Guard leadership realized ‌the pilot would be needed to fly them back to the Washington region and he was reinstated by the agency, the sources said. DHS and the Coast Guard ​declined to comment on the pilot's firing and reinstatement. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the reason for the reinstatement.",

    "description": "A photographer moved from the Bay Area to Miami for a fresh start, family, and cultural connections, after his business stalled during COVID-19.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gustavo Fernandez, a 50-year-old photographer in Miami. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI had lived in the Bay Area longer than anywhere else, and I was ready for a reset. Something about the rhythm of Miami felt like the next chapter. More movement, more culture, more color.\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit, everything came to a standstill. Like many service-based businesses, the photography business that I had been running in SF since 2007 went to zero almost overnight.\n\nIt was a big reset moment for me, and it was time for a change.\n\nMy parents retired to Naples, Florida, about two hours from Miami, a few years earlier, and being near them felt more important than ever. My sister had recently moved from St. Louis to Naples with her family. The first Christmas after I moved in 2020, we were all together for the first time since we'd lived together.\n\nI also wanted to be closer to home. I'm originally from the Dominican Republic, and Miami felt like a natural middle ground. I missed hearing Spanish on the street. Miami didn't just offer more diversity; it gave me a sense of cultural belonging.\n\nSince moving to Florida, I've built a local photography business, primarily working with visiting companies hosting corporate events, retreats, and activations in the Miami area.\n\nI love to travel, and I wanted to be in a place that made it easier to jump between continents, especially Latin America and Europe. California is sort of the middle of nowhere, and my vacations were limited to Vegas, Hawaii, or Cabo.\n\nThe second year I lived in Miami, I went to Europe twice, visited the Dominican Republic, and other Caribbean islands. I traveled more that year than the last five years combined in SF because it's so easy.\n\nSan Francisco is cold. Because of the cold, there's also no real beach culture, which I was excited about when I moved to California. I was looking forward to paddleboarding, kitesurfing, and scuba diving, but it didn't happen.\n\nIn Miami, the water is part of the lifestyle. It's not a weekend thing. It's every day.\n\nThe median home price in SF is $1.2 million. Being an artist, I didn't want to be in that rat race of meeting someone while living in an apartment, then needing to move out to the East Bay to afford a little house. SF is very apartment-driven unless you're operating in a very different income bracket.\n\nMedian property prices in Miami are around $570,000. Also, there's no state income tax. While Miami is still cheaper than San Francisco, prices are rising here as well.\n\nI rent now but plan to buy eventually. I want the right neighborhood, the right lifestyle fit, and something that aligns with my long-term goals.\n\nI didn't realize how professional San Francisco was until I left. In San Francisco, people followed through. I felt like a big fish in a well-run pond. In Miami, I often feel like a small fish swimming against the current.\n\nYou can still make things happen, but now I have to send five times as many follow-ups. There's more ghosting, more last-minute changes, and a lot of \"let's circle back\" that never actually circles.\n\nIn San Francisco, people are very well educated and well-read. I used to be into mountaineering, and it seemed everyone in SF had already climbed Everest. If I said I just ran a 5K, someone might say, I just ran the New York Marathon last weekend. Everyone was humble but extremely accomplished\n\nHere in Miami, it's a flashy kind of lifestyle, with people hustling to get into rooms they don't deserve, whereas in San Francisco, the Google guys are driving around in a Prius.\n\nIt's easy to meet people, but harder to build deep, consistent friendships. It can stay surface-level unless you put in the work. People ask what you do before they ask who you are, and it's more transient, with a lot of snowbirds coming and going.\n\nI only had family in Naples when I first arrived, and I had one acquaintance in Miami. I've lived all over the world and built a strong network. As soon as I landed, I reached out aggressively to my contacts and asked for introductions. Within a few months, I was plugged in.\n\nMiami rewards action. If you sit back and wait, nothing happens. If you reach out, doors open quickly.\n\nI miss the variety of nature and weather in SF, the mountains, and winding roads. You can drive up to Napa, Mount Diablo, and Marin. I miss road biking, mountain biking, or running up hills. Here, it's super flat. The beaches are amazing, though.\n\nI choose freedom, but I also know it takes more discipline to create structure for yourself. You don't just plug into the community or systems. You build it. That can be exciting or exhausting, depending on the day.\n\nI'm definitely happier here; I don't miss wearing layers. I still travel back to California regularly since I have a lot of clients there, but this city is the right fit for where I am in life now.",

    "description": "An AI engineer at StackAI says moving to San Francisco and spending hours studying every day made a big difference in his career.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jai Raj Choudhary, a 24-year-old AI engineer at StackAI, a no-code platform to build AI agents. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI went to grad school for a Master's in AI from 2023 to 2025 and started my career in a data-focused role.\n\nAround 2023 or 2024, LLMs were becoming more practical to use in real products, and AI stopped feeling like a whole research-driven field and more like an engineering problem.\n\nI joined StackAI as an AI engineer in July. I got my job by reaching out to StackAI's cofounder multiple times over LinkedIn. I started using the company's platform as a student, so I messaged him and started posting about the company, giving advice about what worked and what needed to be added. They were growing fast and I went through six rounds of interviews and started working there.\n\nNow I build architectures for AI agents. One of the reasons I got offers from StackAI and other companies was because I understood data quality, the edge cases for the clients, and the matrix and the failure modes of the AI model or any LLM systems that we were using at the time.\n\nStackAI didn't ask about my degree during the interviews. In the interview, I said, \"I know back-end, I know how to talk to data, and I understand the patterns that it follows.\" They said that was the perfect background and they were able to help me grow from there to become an actual AI engineer. They asked if I knew how to operate computers in code and if I know Python. I gave them a couple of my projects and they gave me a take-home task to see how I built it.\n\nAfter I started the job, they asked me where I went to school and what I studied. I love my professors, and I wouldn't call grad school a waste because it gave me time to explore what I was interested in and helped me figure out what niche I wanted to work in. Occasionally, people do care about your background, but I'm not necessarily using what I learned in grad school on the job.\n\nMoving to San Francisco made a huge difference in my career. This city is a different beast. When you come here, it's a whole different culture because we don't work 9-to-5, cushy jobs. We work 9-to-9, six days a week. You wake up, you think about the problem that a client had, and you sleep thinking about what isn't fixed yet.\n\nIn San Francisco, even if you go out for a coffee, you'll meet at least two founders who are working on something related to what you're doing. I was able to network a lot.\n\nAt the end of the day, everyone is still researching AI. We're still trying to find out what's the best way to go about it. Having a conversation with someone who's facing the same problem helps you work better.\n\nThe best decision I made for my career was joining a startup for a job that I didn't quite have the experience in and learning at StackAI.\n\nBut it's not going to be like you go to sleep one day and wake up as an AI engineer the next. You need to study. Even if I spend 12 hours in the office, seven to eight of those hours I'm studying, and then three to four hours, I'm actually writing the code.\n\nIt gets overwhelming when you see 10 different AI courses coming out every day. What helped me is watching YouTube videos of the people who are actually building companies. Andrew Ng's YouTube channel was also super helpful. I listen when I'm driving or in the gym. It doesn't have to be a set time. It's important that you keep turning your brain and taking in all these inputs.\n\nYou have to decide what's important for you, but I was ready to sacrifice everything at the start of my career to grow as much as possible. It does take a toll on your personal time.\n\nThe culture of the company also helped because everyone that I work with is the best in what they do. If you ask them a question or if you collaborate with them on projects, it can really help you understand how they think. It really helps me to be surrounded with those people around the clock.",

    "description": "One of the principles Boris Cherny sets for his team at Anthropic forces them to really rely on Claude to get the job done.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic's Boris Cherny has a simple list of principles for his team and, unsurprisingly, Claude is at the center.\n\n\"If you have Claude, you can really automate a lot of work, and that's kind of what we see over and over,\" Cherny said during a recent episode of \"Lenny's podcast.\"\n\nHost Lenny Rachitsky told Cherny that he heard one of the principles is, \"What's better than doing something? Having Claude do it.\"\n\nCherny said one of his other principles is \"underfunding things a little bit,\" because it forces his team to really rely on AI tools like Claude.\n\n\"There's this interesting thing when you underfund everything a little bit, because then people are kind of forced to Claude-ify,\" he said.\n\nWhile keeping teams small is important, Cherny said that he encourages CTOs not to \"cost-cut at the beginning.\"\n\n\"Start by just giving engineers as many tokens as possible,\" he said.\n\nCherny pushed back on the notion that Anthropic would make huge profits with such an approach, especially if companies let only a few engineers experiment.\n\n\"Let's say they build something awesome, and then it takes a huge amount of tokens, and then the cost becomes pretty big,\" he said. \"That's the point at which you want to optimize it, but don't do that too early.\"\n\nToken cost, which is part of what companies pay to use AI models, is becoming a major point of conversation at some tech companies. OpenCode creator Dax Raad recently wrote that some CFOs are experiencing sticker shock upon seeing how much extra money each engineer costs due to AI usage bills.\n\nThe last principle concerns speed: \"Encouraging people to go faster.\" It's an axiom that makes sense when you consider that just weeks ago, Anthropic and rival OpenAI released major updates to their coding tools within minutes of each other. Before that, Anthropic used Claude to help build Claude Cowork, a non-technical Claude agent, in just 10 days.\n\n\"Early on, it was really important because it was just me, and so our only advantage was speed,\" Cherny said. \"That's the only way that we could ship a product that would compete in this very crowded coding market.\"\n\nNow, Cherny said, he turns to Claude to help with speed.\n\n\"It's still very much a principle we have on the team,\" he said, \"and if you want to go faster, a really good way to do that is to just have Claude do more stuff. So it just very much encourages that.\"",

    "description": "Bret Taylor says there's value in writing up meeting prep the old-fashioned way, without AI — and you should take the time to make it concise, too.",
    "fullText": "Sure, ChatGPT could help a board member write up a memo ahead of a meeting. But OpenAI's chairman says there's value to going old-school.\n\nBret Taylor, OpenAI's board chair, said in a recent appearance on the \"Uncapped with Jack Altman\" podcast that he prefers concise but detailed written documents from board members over slide presentations. And he doesn't want them relying on AI.\n\n\"I really like written documents for boards over presentations,\" Taylor said. \"You end up letting people synthesize information ahead of the board meeting, so you end up with more substantive discussions in the board room.\"\n\nTaylor, the former co-CEO of Salesforce and cofounder of AI startup Sierra, said that writing without AI is a worthwhile thinking exercise and helps board members clarify their thoughts.\n\nHis expectation for the boards he runs is that members have read the written material ahead of time, which helps keep things focused and substantive during the actual meeting.\n\n\"The main thing is it's been read — and it's been read ahead of time,\" he said. \"You end up with a meeting about the actual meat and potatoes of the topics, and you're not staring at a bunch of sales numbers for the first time.\"\n\nAmazon cofounder Jeff Bezos is famously a big fan of meetings focused on a single memo prepared ahead time, but while Bezos preferred dense, 6-page memos, Taylor specifically favors concise material, arguing that brevity is a sign of careful thought — and respect to stakeholders.\n\n\"It's like what's that famous line — if I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter,\" he added. \"Like, spend the time because that's actually how you can show respect to your stakeholders that you're thinking about the strategic issues going on in your business.\"\n\nAnd while Taylor might not be a fan of leaning on AI for board meeting prep, that doesn't mean he is dismissing the technology's potential to be valuable in high-stakes situations.\n\n\"If you want a hot take, I think my intuition is regulators will start asking for agents,\" he said. \"The idea that you have a human set of controls over a regulated process will start to feel like a risk, rather than the risk being AI.\"",

    "description": "Three founders who rely mostly on AI share how they've built workflows and prompts to train their AI tools to push back and challenge their ideas.",
    "fullText": "Will AI agents be the employees of the year in 2026?\n\nOnly time will tell. Last year, one category AI absolutely dominated was being an extremely agreeable coworker. While this might sound nice, this can turn into a problem for founders who rely on AI as their only teammate.\n\nWhen your head of legal, HR, and supply operations are all AI agents, unsubstantiated flattery can create costly blind spots. That's one of the reasons OpenAI said goodbye to its \"yes-man\" version of ChatGPT, and why some AI-powered solo founders are training their tools to push back.\n\nThree business owners who rely on AI daily shared with Business Insider how they've built workflows and prompts that force their AI employees to challenge their ideas. Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYesim Saydan is a branding and communication expert in her early 50s, based in the Netherlands.\n\nWhen OpenAI launched custom GPTs, everything changed for me. I used the feature to create over 17 custom GPTs to build my team. Then I thought of my ideal mentors and created custom GPTs of them.\n\nWhen I'm stuck on a business decision or need to come up with a creative idea or strategy, brainstorming usually starts with my Steve Jobs custom GPT. When I prompt it, I avoid asking questions like \"What do you think of this idea?\" because the AI usually wants to agree with me and please me. Instead, I ask, \"On a scale from one to 10, how good is this idea?\"\n\nIt's not going to say the idea is bad, but now it might tell me it's a five. Then I'll ask, \"OK, what would make it a 10?\"\n\nThat's usually when it starts drawing on the experience of Steve Jobs that I've trained it with. We can go back and forth until I get the most useful and honest feedback possible. Depending on the task, I usually go through three to five rounds of refinement for more strategic outputs.\n\nAaron Sneed is a 40-year-old defense-tech solo founder based in Florida.\n\nWhen I started my business, I realized I didn't have the money to pay lawyers, HR reps, and a bunch of other companies. So, using AI, I created what I call 'The Council.'\n\nAltogether, my AI council consists of the following:\n\nI don't want a bunch of yes agents. I trained them purposefully to give me pushback. I want them to test my theories to help me with what I'm trying to accomplish. The training never really stops.\n\nThe models have gotten better, and my prompting has, too. I have a better understanding of what information should be in an agent, like having a governance structure for priorities. I have a set of files that put those requirements in place to mitigate the risk of hallucination and false or bad information.\n\nI told my chief of staff agent which models have priority when making decisions. For example, anything legal, compliance, or security-related will be given a higher priority. So, I tell the chief of staff to listen to these models over everyone else.\n\nI have a roundtable set up in ChatGPT's projects section with all my AI agents, including my chief of staff, where I can put something like a request-for-proposal document in the chat, and all the agents will weigh in at the same time. I use this roundtable as a level of prevention for hallucinations and knowledge gaps.\n\nTim Desoto is a 49-year-old founder and CEO, based in San Francisco.\n\nI've been working with AI to launch my startup since late 2024. I don't have a tech background, and since starting my business, I've learned a lot about where to leverage AI, and where not to.\n\nTaking whatever I'm building or ideating and having AI push against it, either as I'm thinking about the idea or afterward, is part of an exercise I call my AI conveyor belt. Usually, I start with a written prompt, then go multimodal, talking out loud to the model. I'll talk back and forth with it about my idea and try to get the agent to push back because I know that some AI models tend to be more agreeable.\n\nOnce I get an output that I'm happy with. I use a different model to get a different view. I'll drop the document in and go back and forth with the new model. Sometimes, I'll push a document out to both models at the same time and see what comes back. Some are better than others at giving feedback, researching, and annotating, but I'm always getting a better, more well-rounded perspective by feeding content to multiple models at a time.\n\nDo you have a story to share about running an AI-powered business?

    "description": "At the first annual Best Drone Warfighter competition, soldiers brought their homemade drones for test flights and evaluations.",
    "fullText": "The US Army is taking lessons from Ukraine's drone war and pushing soldiers to design, build, and 3D print their own systems.\n\nAt the Army's first annual Best Drone Warfighter competition held this week at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, the participating soldiers were encouraged not only to bring their own drone builds and modify them on-site but also to share tips and tricks across the service.\n\nArmy officials said this kind of innovation at the individual soldier level is essential to the Army's adoption of uncrewed aerial systems.\n\nThe competitive event allowed the Army to learn more about the skill sets behind its best drone operators, including seeing \"what kind of innovation, like grassroots soldier-level innovation is happening, that we can then take and scale across the Army,\" Col. Nicholas Ryan, director of Army UAS Transformation at the Aviation Center of Excellence and lead of the drone competition, told reporters.\n\nFor other aspects of the competition, like the obstacle course, standard drones such as the Necros Archer and Skydio intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance drone were used in order to level the playing field for evaluating operators. But troops were encouraged to bring their own builds for other parts of the competition.\n\nFor those events, the regulations weren't strict. \"Whether you received it as an Army program of record, you bought it off the shelf from the blue list, or you built it yourself, you 3D printed it and built it yourself, bring whatever you have,\" Ryan said, explaining that really the only rule was the drones had to fit in a rucksack.\n\nThe blue list refers to US government-approved drones that meet security and operational standards and contain either no or only a limited number of parts from companies in rival or adversarial countries like China and Iran.\n\nAt the competition's practice lane, operators from across the Army tested and flew drones they had built or bought, creating what officials said were the event's richest learning moments as soldiers swapped feedback and hard-earned lessons.\n\nTroops were also 3D printing custom parts for their drone kits — from antenna-carrying gear to helmet mounts for first-person-view goggles — items not currently fielded by the Army.\n\nHaving soldiers make and modify their own drones at the competition was a takeaway from Ukraine, as the Army had observed how operators and industry partners there are 3D printing parts for drones and modifying them with specific features and parts depending on mission sets or countermeasures.\n\nUsing 3D printed parts for repairs is key as well, as the war in Ukraine has shown that adaptation and experimentation with equipment often happens quicker than traditional supply chains allow for.\n\nUkraine has shown other Western militaries the importance of 3D printing as well. The technology can shorten procurement timelines, build a variety of designs and pieces that may be highly specialized or difficult to get otherwise, and give soldiers more of a say in the systems they need.\n\nRyan said that while the Army had been constrained in doing this type of work, new guidance like US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's drone dominance memo signaled the importance of giving soldiers the right to repair their systems. \"We need to allow our soldiers to fabricate and modify equipment that meets their needs and suits their needs,\" he said.\n\nThe Army has been implementing 3D printing and drone building into its drone courses and across divisions as it recognizes that giving soldiers the ability to repair drones or make changes to them in real-time could be an important edge on a future battlefield.",

    "title": "US military dogs died in poor kennel conditions as others fell ill, Pentagon watchdog says",
    "description": "Military watchdog report reveals widespread canine welfare problems at military kennels across the country.",
    "fullText": "Four military working dogs died between 2021 and 2023 after being housed in deteriorating kennels, according to a new Pentagon watchdog report. Dozens of others suffered injuries or disease or showed signs of severe stress.\n\nThe report from the Defense Department's Inspector General's office, released Thursday, revealed failures to protect dogs from extreme weather, a lack of canine engagement, staffing shortages, and widespread facility decay across 12 base kennels.\n\nMilitary working dogs play important roles in explosive detection and security missions, making their health a readiness issue as well as an animal welfare concern.\n\nInvestigators reported deficiencies across all bases they assessed, but the most serious lapses in health and welfare were at the Air Force's 341st Training Squadron at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas, the military's de facto canine program headquarters, which oversees the acquisition and basic training for all military dogs.\n\nNone of the 230 dogs at the facility received the five hours of daily play and engagement required by military policy. Instead, they were walked three or four times a week for about 10 minutes, spending most of their time confined to small kennels. Nearly two dozen at the base suffered heat injuries. Investigators observed widespread stress behaviors, including repetitive spinning in tight circles and chewing on metal bowls.\n\nThe report attributed problems at San Antonio-Lackland partly to staff shortages and identified higher rates of diseases, injuries, and behavioral problems there than at other military canine facilities.\n\nOther bases reported outbreaks among their own canines after dogs from San Antonio-Lackland transferred to new facilities, arriving with skin disorders, histories of heat injuries, and spreading a gastrointestinal parasite known to thrive in areas not adequately disinfected of feces. Shoddy quarantine procedures and poor sanitation contributed to the spread of illnesses, the report said.\n\nWhile San Antonio-Lackland facility fared the worst, investigators found serious deficiencies at every base they visited during the inquiry.\n\n\"The DoD MWD Program Manager and Service Components did not consistently protect DoD MWDs from extreme weather conditions and kennel mold issues, or manage quarantine and isolation areas for DoD MWDs,\" the report said, using the acronym for military working dogs.\n\nAccording to the report, chronic underfunding and deferred maintenance exacerbated poor conditions. Many dogs remain housed in \"aging and unsatisfactory kennel facilities,\" which contributed to the four deaths and ongoing health and behavioral problems.\n\nThe Office of the Secretary of Defense referred Business Insider to the Air Force, which did not respond to request for comment prior to publication.\n\nResearch shows behavioral issues are common in kennels, said Robert Dougherty, a retired police canine handler who now oversees the University of Pennsylvania's Working Dog Center as the law enforcement canine program director. However, some facilities are worse than others.\n\n\"Depression is a real thing in dogs,\" he told Business Insider after reviewing the report. \"To sit around in a kennel and do nothing, either physically or mentally, is unacceptable, really.\"\n\nSimply increasing activity with longer walks or games of fetch isn't enough to address stress and behavioral issues in most high-drive working breeds, Dougherty said. These dogs need structured programs that challenge them mentally and physically while also minimizing injury risk. At his center, that means combining games, strength training, and even canine yoga.\n\nHealth problems impact how long a dog can serve — a 2025 study by Army veterinarians found that nearly 84% of working dogs discharged between 2019 and 2021 left early due to neuromusculoskeletal disease, heat injuries, or fear and anxiety.\n\nIn its response to investigators, the Air Force said it has received nearly $170 million for structural improvements and staffing hires.\n\nPrevious watchdog reports have raised similar concerns about military dog welfare. More recently, military equine programs came under heavy scrutiny following a string of neglect-related deaths at Arlington National Cemetery's ceremonial equine unit. The Army shut that program down for two years while it underwent a significant overhaul and later moved to disband some equine units following a broader review.\n\nSubstandard living conditions have also plagued human troops, prompting years of scrutiny over mold, sewage failures, and deteriorating barracks, though the Pentagon has recently launched various initiatives to repair and replace some facilities.",

This year marks Cardinale's first time on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTotal deal value: $81.8 billion\n\nKlein now runs his own boutique advisory firm, but he was once one of the most prominent big bank M&A chiefs. He joined Salomon Brothers in the 1980s, which became part of Citigroup in the late 1990s. At Citi, he held top roles in the investment bank and was viewed as a contender for CEO before his departure in 2008. He went on to launch M. Klein & Co., advising on high-profile transactions, and has also launched several special purpose acquisition companies, so-called \"blank check\" companies.\n\nThis is Klein's first year on the Rainmakers list, thanks to his advisory role on the year's most contentious megadeal:\n\nTitle: Co-head of US investment banking\n\nTotal deal value: $75.6 billion\n\nThis is Nataraj's third year on the Rainmakers list. The technology, media, and telecommunications banker joined Evercore in 2002 and, like Daniel Mendelow (No. 5), was promoted to lead US investment banking in 2020 and is a member of the firm's management committee.\n\nTitle: Head of financial institutions group M&A, Co-Head of media & communications M&A\n\nLoriferne has been at JPMorgan since 2006 and made the Rainmakers list for the first time last year, when he advised on deals involving BlackRock and Nippon Life.\n\nTitle: Partner and co-president of investment banking\n\nTotal value of deals: $71.2 billion\n\nCenterview's Tokat had one of the most active healthcare M&A years on Wall Street. Advising exclusively on the sell side, he worked across biotech, pharmaceuticals, and specialty therapeutics transactions, helping companies secure premium exits in a market that rewarded innovation and strategic consolidation. This year marks Tokat's second appearance.\n\nTotal value of deals: $68.5 billion\n\nIn 2025, Pruzan's performance was anchored by leading complex advisory projects across multiple industries simultaneously. Most notably, he led the year's largest consumer healthcare divestiture: the $49 billion acquisition of Kenvue, formerly Johnson & Johnson's consumer health division, by Kimberly-Clark. He has advised on more than $1 trillion worth of transactions over his career, Centerview says. This year marks Pruzan's first entry on the list.\n\nTitle: Co-head of M&A, Americas\n\nTotal deal value: $66.8 billion\n\nMahdavi joined Morgan Stanley in 2012, after previous stints at Deutsche Bank and Citi. She's spent her whole career working in mergers and acquisitions, and was promoted to co-lead Morgan Stanley's M&A business in the Americas at the beginning of last year. This year marks her second as a rainmaker.\n\nTitle: Chairman of investment banking\n\nTotal value of deals: $61 billion\n\nFrost's elevation to chairman of investment banking in January followed his leadership on several of the consumer sector's most significant recent transactions. Over the past year, he guided Goldman Sachs in completing the two largest deals in the consumer retail space, including the transformational nearly $49 billion Kenvue acquisition. This year marks Frost's first appearance on the Rainmakers list.",

    "description": "What's changed for junior investment bankers since Centerview fired Kathryn Shiber in 2020? Recruiters say not much — and it may only get worse.",
    "fullText": "A lawsuit primed to expose the grind of junior banking is no longer going to trial this week, but the questions it poses about working life and hours are no less relevant ahead of a likely busy year.\n\nKathryn Shiber settled a lawsuit with boutique bank Centerview Partners on Saturday, two days before jury selection. She said the firm unlawfully fired her in 2020 after granting her accommodations for an underlying mood and anxiety disorder, including her request for eight hours of uninterrupted sleep each night. Court documents suggest that analysts on active deals at Centerview routinely worked between 60 and 120 hours a week.\n\nThe events of the suit happened years before Wall Street's promises to rein in burnout and protect young employees' health. Though top Centerview bankers will no longer have to take the witness stand, the case still reignites questions about the nature of work on Wall Street.\n\nNearly six years after Shiber's brief stint at Centerview, recruiters are predicting junior working conditions could intensify amid an M&A boom. They point to industry data suggesting juniors aren't logging significantly fewer hours than they did years ago — and an M&A boom that could intensify Wall Street working conditions.\n\nData from Odyssey Search Partners, a recruiting firm, found that junior investment bankers reported working just as much in 2025 as in 2022, the last time this survey was conducted. The firm surveyed more than 300 first- and second-year analysts last summer and found that they reported working 78 hours per week on average, the exact same figure as in the 2022 banking compensation report. Overall, 2025 was a busier year for dealmaking than 2022.\n\nJuniors at elite boutiques reported working an average of 82 hours in 2025, up 4% from their 2022 average. By comparison, analysts at bulge-bracket banks — the biggest firms, such as JPMorgan and Bank of America — reported working 81 hours on average, up 1%.\n\n\"It's the junior bankers at the elite boutiques that have become increasingly busy, as they tend to operate with leaner deal teams and so the workload can't be spread as broadly,\" Anthony Keizner, cofounder of Odyssey Search Partners, said in a statement. He added that the intensity can eventually make those analysts more desirable candidates to private equity firms, should they want to switch to the buy side.\n\nThe findings come despite criticisms over junior bankers' working conditions that sparked promises of change.\n\nConcern burst into public view during the pandemic, when record dealmaking and remote work stretched already punishing schedules even further. The conversation picked up again in 2024, when Leo Lukenas III, a 35-year-old investment banking associate at Bank of America who had just helped close a $2 billion acquisition, died.\n\nBank of America introduced a tool that year to better track junior bankers' weekly hours and flag when they exceed 80. In 2025, it elevated the chief resource officer role, which oversees juniors' workloads and career development, from a midlevel banker to a permanent position led by senior bankers.\n\nJPMorgan also introduced an 80-hour weekly guideline for banker workloads, with exceptions made for certain circumstances, including live deals. Juniors get one full weekend off every three months, protected holiday long weekends, and a mandated no-work period from 6 pm on Friday to 12 pm on Saturday, with exceptions.\n\nJake Schneider, an investment banking recruiter at Selby Jennings, said that, compared to the pre-pandemic days, junior bankers aren't being assigned as much busy work during slow periods. But he doesn't think invesment banking analysts are working less on live deals, like the kind Shiber was staffed on during the events at the heart of her case, dubbed Project Dragon.\n\nCourt documents in Shiber's case reference an email exchange between her and associate Timothy Ernst about the time she signed off. In the exchange, Ernst said that he and another employee \"shouldn't be up alone working.\" Associates and vice presidents still expect analysts to be logged on when higher-ups on the team are working, Schneider said.\n\n\"The expectation is, 'If I'm doing this, you're doing this,'\" he said.\n\nMany anticipate that 2026 will bring a boom in M&A activity — and, potentially, an associated spike in juniors' working hours.\n\n\"Given the increased deal flow the banks are reporting, we don't envisage that these working hours will see a decrease this year,\" Odyssey Search Partners' Keizner said.\n\nSchneider said that Selby Jennings has seen a flurry of business in recent months, especially in recruiting for junior roles, as banks try to get deal teams ready for the anticipated activity.\n\n\"The biggest thing we hear is from a lot of our clients, they don't want to be in a position to turn down business because they're understaffed,\" he said.\n\nThere's a chance the projected deal activity doesn't materialize, and analysts aren't staffed on the types of deals that keep them working into or through the early hours, Schneider added. But if 2026 shakes out as many expect, it doesn't seem likely that juniors will sneak in 8 hours a night.",

    "description": "After a major 2024 sale, hundreds of American convenience stores changed hands. The new owner is a powerful Mexican company you might not have heard of.",
    "fullText": "A transaction in October of 2024, between an American company and a Mexican one, resulted in a chain of U.S.-located gas station convenience stores being owned by the Mexican firm. The American company is Delek US Holdings, Inc., which sold its retail operations for $385 million. These retail operations consisted of 249 convenience stores that operated under the DK brand, located in New Mexico, Arkansas, and Texas. Delek is an energy company involved in petroleum and renewable fuels. As an oil products producer, it has a refining capacity of 302,000 barrels each day. It is also one of five owners of the 650-mile oil pipeline that goes from Wink to Webster in the Permian Basin in Texas, moving over one million barrels per day of crude oil and condensate to the Gulf Coast.\n\nThe Mexican company that bought the convenience stores at Delek's gas stations is called FEMSA. It's a huge conglomerate that includes the OXXO chain of 28,800 convenience stores located in Mexico, Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Colombia. FEMSA also owns the largest volume Coca-Cola products franchise bottler in the world. It has a total of over 392,000 employees located in 18 countries, including Europe, having purchased the food retail company Valora in 2022. FEMSA is also involved in many other business ventures, including retail drugstores and digital financial services.\n\nFEMSA has now rebranded many DK stores, which now operate as OXXO, a well-known brand near the Mexican border. By 2027, all of the stores in the El Paso area, which adjoins the border, will be rebranded as OXXO stores. Once the OXXO brand starts to expand beyond its initial footprint, it may build even larger stores, following the trend of U.S. gas stations turning into massive convenience stores.\n\nAs far as the supply of fuel products to the stores, FEMSA has continued to purchase them from Delek after the ownership change. Delek continues to operate hundreds of gas stations under both the DK and Alon brands, positioning itself as a locally sourced, high-quality fuel supplier with a lower carbon footprint. While this acquisition may have been FEMSA's first attempt to plant its flag in the U.S., the company has said it has plans to become a major player in the U.S. market. FEMSA is not the only foreign operator to land here; the Speedway gas station chain is owned by a Japanese company.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — France will summon U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner to protest comments by the Trump administration over the beating death of a far-right activist, the foreign affairs minister said.\n\nJean-Noel Barrot was reacting to a statement by the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau, which posted on X that “reports, corroborated by the French Minister of the Interior, that Quentin Deranque was killed by left-wing militants, should concern us all.”\n\nDeranque, a far-right activist, died of brain injuries last week from a beating in the French city of Lyon. He was attacked during a fight on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.\n\nHis killing highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year’s presidential vote. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm on Saturday as some 3,000 people joined a march in Lyon organized by far-right groups to pay tribute to Deranque.\n\n“We reject any instrumentalization of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,” Barrot said. “We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement.”\n\nThe State Department said in its post that “violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety. We will continue to monitor the situation and expect to see the perpetrators of violence brought to justice.”\n\nSeven people have been handed preliminary charges. The Lyon public prosecutor’s office requested that each of them be charged with intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy. Six of the accused were charged on all three counts. The seventh was charged with complicity in intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy.\n\nBarrot said he has other topics to discuss with Kushner, including U.S. decisions to impose sanctions on Thierry Breton, a former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, and Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court.\n\nBarrot said both are targeted by “unjustified and unjustifiable” sanctions.\n\nKushner was asked to attend a meeting at the foreign affairs ministry scheduled on Monday evening, according to diplomatic sources. He had already been summoned in August last year over his letter to Macron alleging the country did not do enough to combat antisemitism. France’s foreign officials met with a representative of the U.S. ambassador since the diplomat did not show up.",

    "description": "Snowstorms can become dangerous quickly, and because they're often treated as emergencies, the eventual melting of snow is rarely considered a risk.",
    "fullText": "In January, a historic snowstorm spanning several states blanketed millions of Americans in inches of powder and ice, bringing bitter, sustained low temperatures.\n\nAs that stubborn cold front began to wane, a second, subtler condition started \"stirring up hidden dangers,\" according to WILX.\n\nIn states affected by this bout of wintry extreme weather, persistent low temperatures ensured that snowdrifts quickly iced over.\n\nIn Michigan, weeks-old snow finally started melting — introducing a lesser-known risk.\n\nA 2017 study in the journal Environmental Pollution found that little was known about how snow reacts to pollutants and that snowpack absorbs a wide range of contaminants.\n\nWILX spoke with Dr. Dean McFarlane-Parrott, who explained that as the snow sat unmelting for weeks after the storm, \"vehicle exhaust, road salt, heavy metals,\" and other harmful carbon pollution slowly contaminated it.\n\nIn New York, WNYW reported similar concerns, adding that locals complained about dog feces buried in the city's snowdrifts. On Feb. 12, The New York Times reported on the city's melting snow, noting that it also posed a major pollution risk to the region's many waterways.\n\nAccording to WTOP, residents in the broader Washington, D.C., area were also facing rapidly melting snow and the health risks it posed.\n\nSnowstorms can become dangerous quickly, and because they're often treated as emergencies, the eventual melting of snow is rarely considered a risk.\n\nMelting snow doesn't just absorb pollution and release toxins as solids.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will stand before Congress on Tuesday to deliver the annual State of the Union address to a suddenly transformed nation.\n\nOne year back in office, Trump has emerged as a president defying conventional expectations. He has executed a head-spinning agenda, upending priorities at home, shattering alliances abroad and challenging the nation's foundational system of checks and balances. Two Americans were killed by federal agents while protesting the Trump administration's immigration raids and mass deportations.\n\nAs the lawmakers sit in the House chamber listening to Trump's agenda for the year ahead, the moment is an existential one for the Congress, which has essentially become sidelined by his expansive reach, the Republican president bypassing his slim GOP majority to amass enormous power for himself.\n\n“It’s crazy,\" said Nancy Henderson Korpi, a retiree in northern Minnesota who joined an Indivisible protest group and plans to watch the speech from home. “But what is disturbing more to me is that Congress has essentially just handed over their power.”\n\nShe said, “We could make some sound decisions and changes if Congress would do their job.”\n\nThe country is at a crossroads, celebrating its 250th anniversary while experiencing some of the most significant changes to its politics, policies and general mood in many Americans' lifetimes.\n\nThe president muscled his agenda through Congress when he needed to — often pressuring lawmakers with a phone call during cliffhanger votes — but more often avoided the messy give-and-take of the legislative process to power past his own party and the often unified Democratic opposition.\n\nTrump's signature legislative accomplishment so far is the GOP’s big tax cuts bill, with its new savings accounts for babies, no taxes on tips and other specialty deductions, and steep cuts to Medicaid and SNAP food aid. It also fueled more than $170 billion to Homeland Security for his immigration deportations.\n\nBut the GOP-led Congress has largely stood by as Trump dramatically seized power through hundreds of executive actions, many being challenged in court, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to impose his agenda.\n\n“Retrieving a lost power is no easy business in our constitutional order,” wrote Justice Neil Gorsuch in the Supreme Court's landmark rebuke of Trump's tariffs policy on Friday.\n\nGorsuch said that without the court stepping in on major questions, “Our system of separated powers and checks-and-balances threatens to give way to the continual and permanent accretion of power in the hands of one man.”\n\nFrom slashing the federal workforce to upending the childhood vaccine schedule to attacking Venezuela and capturing that country's president, Trump's reach appeared to know no bounds.\n\nHis administration launched investigations of would-be political foes, imposed his name on historic buildings, including the storied John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and perhaps most visibly has been rounding up people and converting warehouses into detention holding centers for deportations.\n\nAt almost every step of the way, there were moments when Congress could have intervened but did not.\n\nDemocrats, in the minority, often tried to push back, including by halting routine Homeland Security funds unless there are restraints on the immigration actions.\n\nBut Republicans believe the country elected the president and gave their party control of Congress to align with his agenda, according to one senior GOP leadership aide who insisted on anonymity to discuss the dynamic.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has said Trump will be the “most consequential” president of the modern era.\n\nDemocrats plan to either boycott the speech or sit in stony silence.\n\n“The state of the union is falling apart,” said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.\n\nThere have been times when Congress held its own against the White House, but they have been rare — as in the high-profile bipartisan push from Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Ca., to force the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, over the objections of Johnson and GOP leadership.\n\nThe flex of congressional power has more often come from a few renegade Republicans joining with most Democrats to put a check on the president, as when the House voted to block Trump's tariffs on Canada. The Senate advanced a war powers resolution to prevent military action in Venezuela without congressional approval, but backed off after Trump intervened.\n\nThose have been mostly symbolic votes, because Congress would not have the numbers to overcome any expected Trump veto.\n\nMore often, the Congress has accommodated Trump, by rolling back already approved bipartisan funding for USAID foreign aid or public broadcasting or failing to stop the U.S. military strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats that killed two survivors in the Caribbean. When Trump issued a Day One pardon of some 1,500 people charged in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, the Republicans in Congress did not object.\n\nAnd as Trump's Department of Government Efficiency with billionaire Elon Musk started firing federal workers, GOP lawmakers signaled approval by forming their own DOGE caucus on Capitol Hill.\n\n“The central question for us is does the public understand what's at stake” said Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization focused on government management and democracy. “We are in the midst of the most significant transformation of our government and our public servants in our history as a country.”\n\nHe said some 300,000 federal employees were fired or moved on, while 100,000 new hires or rehires have largely gone to Homeland Security.\n\nIn courtrooms across the country, cases are being filed against the administration at record levels, as Congress was “asleep at the wheel,” said Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, which has filed more than 150 cases against the administration, part of the largest legal effort against an executive branch in U.S. history.\n\nBut the judicial system has been under strain, and the White House has not always abided by court rulings. GOP lawmakers have joined Trump's criticism of the courts, displaying outside their offices posters of judges they want to impeach.\n\nA next big test will be over a proof-of-citizenship voting bill that Trump wants ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe House has passed the SAVE America Act, which would require birth certificates or passports to register to vote in federal elections and a photo ID at the polls. Supporters say it’s needed to crack down on fraud, while critics argue it will shut millions of Americans out of voting because they don’t have citizenship documents readily available.\n\nThe Senate has a majority to pass the measure but not the necessary 60 votes to overcome an expected Democratic-led filibuster.\n\nTrump has vowed executive actions if Congress fails to approve legislation.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.",

    "fullText": "In the wake of the Mexican army’s assassination of Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, also known as “El Mencho,” the notorious leader of Mexico’s most powerful drug cartel, there were reports of widespread violence in the country, while U.S. citizens in portions of the country were urged to shelter in place amid flight cancellations.\n\nThe surprise operation against the drug kingpin and head of Jalisco New Generation Cartel unfolded Sunday morning in Tapalpa, a city about two hours southwest of Guadalajara, Jalisco’s capital.\n\nDuring the operation, troops came under fire and killed four people at the location. Three more people, including Oseguera Cervantes, were wounded and later died, according to a statement from the U.S. Defense Department. Two others were arrested and armored vehicles, rocket launchers and other arms were seized.\n\nThree members of the armed forces were wounded and received medical treatment, while one member of the country’s National Guard was killed. Another six other National Guardsmen reportedly died in an operation near Guadalajara, along with an agent from Jalisco’s state prosecutor’s office.\n\nA prison guard was also killed when inmates in a Puerto Vallarta prison rioted after reports of the deadly operation.\n\nEl Mencho’s assassination set off several hours of roadblocks with burning vehicles, tactics commonly used by the cartels to block military operations. Videos circulating on social media showed smoke billowing over the tourist city of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco, and people sprinting through the airport of the state’s capital in panic.\n\nOfficials with the U.S. Embassy in Mexico said on X that the operation was executed by Mexican special forces “within the framework of bilateral cooperation, with U.S. authorities providing complementary intelligence.”\n\nThe U.S. State Department warned U.S. citizens in Jalisco, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, Guerrero and Nuevo Leon states to remain in safe places due to the ongoing security operations. Canada’s embassy in Mexico warned its citizens in Puerto Vallarta to shelter in place and generally to keep a low profile in Jalisco.\n\nJalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus told residents to stay at home and suspended public transportation.\n\nU.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau called El Mencho one of the bloodiest and most ruthless drug kingpins in cartel history in a statement.\n\n“This is a great development for Mexico, the US, Latin America, and the world,” he added. “I’m watching the scenes of violence from Mexico with great sadness and concern. It’s not surprising that the bad guys are responding with terror. But we must never lose our nerve.”\n\nThe Jalisco cartel has been one of the most aggressive cartels in its attacks on the military — including on helicopters — and is a pioneer in launching explosives from drones and installing mines. In 2020, it carried out a spectacular assassination attempt with grenades and high-powered rifles in the heart of Mexico City against the then head of the capital’s police force and now federal security secretary.\n\nVIDEO: Los Angeles motorist accused of running red light, causing violent crash\n\nThe DEA considers the cartel to be as powerful as the Sinaloa cartel, one of Mexico’s most infamous criminal groups, with a presence in all 50 U.S. states. It is one of the main suppliers of cocaine to the U.S. market and, like the Sinaloa cartel, earns billions from the production of fentanyl and methamphetamines. Sinaloa, however, has been weakened by infighting after the loss of its leaders Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, both in U.S. custody.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, like many of her predecessors, have argued that taking out cartel leaders only triggers continued violence as cartels fracture and fight for power.\n\nSheinbaum said in a statement on X that the army had coordinated with the governments of all Mexican states and urged people to “remain informed and calm,” while recognizing the Mexican military’s operation.\n\n“We work every day for peace, security and justice, and the well-being of Mexico,” she said.\n\nLocally, Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn acknowledged those in the county with family in Mexico.\n\n“I know many here in LA County with loved ones in Mexico—especially in Jalisco and Michoacán—are closely following the events in Mexico today with concern and with sadness,” she said on X. “I am keeping them in my thoughts and praying for peace.”\n\nSupervisor Katrina Foley, Vice Chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors said she has friends sheltering in place in Puerto Vallarta and shared Rep. Dave Min’s post about what stranded U.S. travelers should do.\n\nSeveral airlines, including Delta, United, Alaska and Air Canada urged either temporarily cancelled flights into Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara or urged passengers to check on their flights before traveling to the airport.",

    "description": "Another round of genetic tests is raising questions about imports of farm-raised shrimp being passed off as local in area restaurants",
    "fullText": "A second round of genetic testing of shrimp served at more than 20 Charleston restaurants has revealed that most continue to sell farm-raised imports, with some passing off the food as wild and locally caught.\n\nThe Charleston findings are part of a broader multi-state investigation into shrimp mislabeling and substitution fraud by SeaD Consulting at the behest of the Southern Shrimp Alliance (SSA), a not-for-profit coalition of shrimping businesses in eight southern coastal states, including South Carolina.\n\nThe latest testing showed just a slight improvement from an initial round a year ago, at the same Charleston restaurants, that found widespread sales of foreign shrimp and instances of false advertising, according to SeaD Consulting.\n\nThe struggling shrimping industry has long complained that many restaurants aren’t serving local shrimp in South Carolina, even though the Palmetto State boasts shrimp as its No. 1 seafood. The alleged shrimp fraud, the industry says, is occurring at a time when domestic markets are being overrun by foreign imports of farm-raised shrimp.\n\nDave Williams, the founder of SeaD and a commercial fishery scientist, said in a news release that the economic stakes of the labeling issue are high because of the importance of local fisheries to coastal communities.\n\n“Seventy percent of seafood expenditures in the United States are in restaurants, so having restaurants tell the truth about what they are serving is paramount,” Williams said. “Consumers should be empowered to decide whether they want to eat and support the highly regulated and inspected American wild-caught fisheries versus very low-inspection-rate imported shrimp that are likely from ponds in Indonesia, Vietnam, or India.”\n\nThat’s why the U.S. shrimping industry is backing undercover investigations of the origin of seafood being sold across the eight states. Threatened tariffs by the Trump administration have recently cast a spotlight on the unfair trade practices shrimpers say they are facing.\n\nLast year, shrimp served in 44 restaurants were randomly selected in the Charleston area for testing. The results showed 4 of the 44, or 9%, were serving wild shrimp caught in American waters with the rest serving farm-raised imports. Of the 40 restaurants serving imports, only 15 verbally acknowledged using imported shrimp, the SeaD consulting said.\n\nThis year, on Feb. 10-11, 22 of the original 44 restaurants were tested again with the results showing 5 of the 22 restaurants, or 23%, were serving wild-caught shrimp. The 17 restaurants serving farm-raised imported shrimp implied it was U.S. wild caught, the group said.\n\nThree restaurants found to be serving American shrimp also were serving local fare in the first round of testing: Acme Lowcountry Kitchen, Isle of Palms; Grace & Grit, Mt Pleasant, and Rappahannock Oyster Bar, Charleston.\n\nTwo restaurants, Amen Street Fish & Raw Bar in Charleston and Mt. Pleasant Seafood, were serving American shrimp after selling imports at the time of the original tests.\n\nResults from Myrtle Beach tests will be announced next week, SeaD Consulting said.\n\nWhether tests are planned in Beaufort County isn’t known. To ensure scientific validity, SeaD Consulting and SSA never announces the markets that will be tested in advance, said Deborah Long, an SSA spokesperson.\n\nOfficials with the alliance and the South Carolina Shrimpers Association said the testing demonstrates a need for better labeling laws.\n\nFive of the eight shrimping states have passed labeling or disclosure laws, said Blake Price, director of the Southern Shrimp Alliance.\n\n“In light of widespread false advertising of shrimp, we hope the Carolinas and Florida will follow suit,” Price said.\n\nBryan Jones, vice president of the South Carolina Shrimpers Association, said the group is working on labeling legislation in South Carolina. “People deserve to know what is in their shrimp and grits,” he said.\n\nLast year, Jones’ organization sued 40 Charleston-area restaurants in federal court in Charleston for shrimp fraud. The lawsuit accused the restaurants of breaking state and federal laws for advertising South Carolina seafood but serving foreign shrimp.\n\nCraig Reaves, who owns Sea Eagle Market in Beaufort, a retail seafood business with shrimp boats based at Village Creek on St. Helena Island, has previously described imports as “farm-raised crap.”\n\n“It’s unbelievable people would come from all over the country expecting to get local seafood and it be represented as such and then be served pond-raised garbage from India,” Reaves says.",

    "fullText": "Head coach Andy Farrell says the potential in his current Ireland squad is \"huge\" after Saturday's historic Six Nations win over England at Allianz Stadium.\n\nIreland scored five tries in a record 42-21 away win against their oldest rivals which reignited their title ambitions and offered an emphatic response to recent criticism.\n\nAfter November defeats by New Zealand and South Africa, Ireland opened the Six Nations with a humbling 36-14 loss to France, but after beating Italy in Dublin, they tore through England with a statement performance.\n\n\"I think the strength of any team should be stronger than any individual's belief of what they think they can get to,\" said Farrell.\n\n\"That's what a proper team is. So therefore, the potential in the squad is huge. I believe that.\n\n\"And you guys can say it's ageing, or we're missing people and they're injured and all that type of stuff, but that doesn't matter neither as long as we're pushing forward and doing ourselves proud.\"\n\n'Ireland show they're far from done with record-breaking win'\n\n'Special day' - Farrell revels in record Irish win\n\nThe Ireland Rugby Social - Post-match reaction\n\nWhen it was put to Farrell that he endured some tough days over the past year before the England game, he used the CVs of Ireland legends Brian O'Driscoll, Johnny Sexton and Paul O'Connell as a reminder of why expectations should be managed.\n\n\"I was thinking this morning, probably the three most respected players that I know in Irish rugby, probably Johnny Sexton, Drico or Paulie...I think Drico played for 15 years and won two (Six Nations titles). I think Paulie played for 14 years and won three. Johnny played for 13 years in this competition and won four.\n\n\"So have a look at all the ones that they've not won. It's because the group is always transitioning and learning.\n\n\"And, honestly, that's why genuinely I didn't care whether we won or lost, whether we just grew as a group. Because we know what we're trying to get to as a group.\n\n\"And it doesn't always translate, because people have to feel the ups and downs of international rugby to learn and grow from it, so that's the best part of it today.\"\n\nFive talking points from round three of Six Nations\n\nFarrell was also pleased with how his more seasoned Test players stepped up after questions over their form as they supplemented headline-stealing displays from Stuart McCloskey and Rob Baloucoune.\n\n\"Caelan [Doris] was back to his best, Joe McCarthy was outstanding,\" observed Farrell, who also praised player of the match Jamison Gibson-Park.\n\n\"Josh [van der Flier] was immense in that first half, wasn't he? You know, with his line running and stuff like that.\n\n\"They know they've a responsibility. We said before the game, big-game players turn up and make big-team performances happen.\n\n\"They set great examples, but for the lads that I just mentioned, for Rob Baloucoune to come here and do that, you know you're on for a good day when he's got a poach, a turnover ball...just his belief to take people on, and for Stu to dominate at this type of level, it was a joy to see.\"\n\nWith McCloskey and Baloucoune establishing themselves in the Test arena, experienced players recapturing their form and the likes of Mack Hansen, Hugo Keenan and Andrew Porter still to return from injury, Farrell's squad suddenly seems in good shape 18 months out from the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia.\n\n\"That's the point. That's the best part of it,\" he said.\n\n\"We know that and we have to take a bit of stick along the way. I suppose a win like this gets people a little bit back on board.\n\n\"As long as we know where we're going.\"\n\nIreland host winless Wales on 6 March (20:10 GMT) before finishing the campaign against fellow Triple Crown chasers Scotland in Dublin on 14 March (14:10).",

    "description": "Charlie O'Leary was the Republic of Ireland kitman, but his influence extends to football across the island.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to football on the island of Ireland, there isn't much 102-year-old Charlie O'Leary has not seen or done.\n\nFrom serving as the Republic of Ireland's kitman at two World Cups and a European Championship, to refereeing behind the Iron Curtain, the Dubliner has an almost legendary status.\n\nWhat is not as well known is his involvement in founding the \"street leagues\", which helped hone the skills of some of the best players in the history of both the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nNow his story is the focus of a new film which will premiere at the Dublin International Film Festival on Tuesday.\n\nAs the Republic's kitman, O'Leary was part of the national team setup during its golden era, when Ireland defeated England in Stuttgart at Euro '88 and famously stunned Italy in New York at World Cup '94.\n\nBut his influence stretches to some other iconic moments thanks to the street leagues, which he founded in East Wall in Dublin in 1945.\n\nCharlie suggested to the local priest the idea of using the parish church's juvenile sodality - a religious group for young parishioners - as the basis for a football league.\n\nThe sodality was organised on the basis of the local streets - and so the street leagues were born.\n\n\"Schoolboy football hadn't been organised and there was nowhere for a young boy around 14 if he wanted to play football,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"At least this gave those kids at that age a chance of representing those roads in football and getting them interested.\n\n\"So we formed the leagues and they really cottoned on.\"\n\nSo much so that by the 1950s the leagues had spread across Dublin and then to cities across the island, including Belfast.\n\nThe leagues first took root in east Belfast, where people associated with the Harland and Wolff shipyard were among the first to compete.\n\nThey began to feature young men who would go on to achieve sporting greatness.\n\nIn the Republic they included Tony Dunne, who won the European Cup with Manchester United in 1968, Liam Brady, winner of the FA Cup with Arsenal and two Serie A titles with Juventus, and Johnny Giles, part of the great Leeds United side of the 1960s and 70s.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, at least three of the 1958 World Cup squad spent time in the street leagues - Harry Gregg, Bertie Peacock and Jimmy McIlroy.\n\nIn later years Manchester United's Sammy McIlroy - who went on to manage Northern Ireland - and Jimmy Nicholl, current Northern Ireland assistant manager, took part in the leagues.\n\nThere was an early sign of things to come in 1957 when Republic of Ireland B took on Romania B in Dublin.\n\n\"There was Liam Tuohy of Newcastle, Noel Payton of Leeds and Dickie Whittaker of Chelsea, all three of them standing together, shoulder to shoulder, for the national anthem,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"Each of those had played, you could pull a curtain over where they lived, the houses were that close.\n\n\"On one day they represented Ireland and all played in the street leagues.\"\n\nCharlie was born just a few months before the Irish Free State - as it was then known - played its first international football match.\n\nThe story of his life - which has therefore spanned the entire existence of his country's national team - will be shown in The Charlie O'Leary Story - From Johnny Cullen's Hill to the Olympic Stadium Rome.\n\nFergus Dowd, who produced the film along with Joe Lee, said the street leagues gave opportunities to young people who would not otherwise have had them.\n\n\"One of the players said to Charlie it was like playing for your country, you played for your street but you were amongst friends and it was really community based,\" he said.\n\n\"I think in a sense we've really sort of lost that innocence - these kids had a jersey on, they were representing the road and their mothers and fathers were watching, so it was a massive community event.\n\n\"Nowadays a lot of the clubs here have their own academies whereas this grew very much organically and it was down to Charlie's idea of making it happen.\"\n\nThe leagues persisted into the 1970s, giving an opportunity to the man who delivered Northern Ireland's greatest moment on the world stage, Gerry Armstrong.\n\nA few years after his iconic goal sealed a 1-0 victory against hosts Spain in the 1982 World Cup, it was the turn of the Republic of Ireland to revel in a shock victory.\n\nThey defeated England 1-0 in Euro '88 and Charlie was watching from the dugout, having been appointed kitman two years earlier.\n\n\"I saw grown men cry,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"There was a man who used to live next door to me and he had gone with his son and he came over to me and he was sobbing.\n\n\"He said 'Charlie, I can boast, I was here when we beat England'.\"\n\nSix years later there was another iconic win, this time against Italy at the World Cup and again, Charlie was there.\n\nThose great victories were masterminded by Jack Charlton, who Charlie said was the best man manager he ever worked under.\n\nHe recalled one occasion when the boss quizzed him after some players were involved in a \"drinking session\" the night before which had ended in a \"rumpus\".\n\n\"He said 'I'm asking you a simple question, what happened last night?',\" Charlie said.\n\n\"I said 'boss hang on a second, if I tell you then you're involved and you've got problems to resolve.\n\n\"I tell you what I'll do, if I say to you everything is resolved, then it's all resolved.\n\n\"So Jack said, 'that's all I want to know, we'll leave it at that,'\n\n\"I got away with that gag every time there was a problem.\"\n\nFrom being part of the backroom team for those famous victories to refereeing in East Germany during the Cold War - \"a bit frightening\" - Charlie has plenty of footballing highlights to pick from.\n\nSo what is his favourite moment?\n\n\"I have to say, I'm a Roman Catholic, when we went to Italy [for the 1990 World Cup] we were brought to see the Pope,\" he said.\n\n\"I was frozen, I couldn't speak.\n\n\"People say, I said this and I said that, I don't remember saying that.\n\n\"But that to me was the biggest thrill I ever got in my life.\"",

    "description": "Olympic champion Keely Hodgkinson says she feels \"closer than ever\" to breaking the women's 800m outdoor record - the longest-standing world record in athletics.",
    "fullText": "Olympic champion Keely Hodgkinson says she feels \"closer than ever\" to breaking the women's 800m outdoor record - the longest-standing world record in athletics.\n\nJarmila Kratochvilova set the record of one minute 53.28 seconds in Munich in July 1983.\n\nBut Britain's Hodgkinson, who broke the event's indoor world record on Thursday, believes she can surpass Kratochvilova and achieve something that will \"cement her place as the greatest of all time\".\n\n\"It's not an easy feat and there's a reason it has stood for so long, \" Hodgkinson told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I think this is the closest I've felt near it. I do really believe that we can break it, but a lot of things have got to come together.\"\n\nHodgkinson's stunning indoor run in France saw her cross the line in 1:54.87 to smash a world record which had stood since 3 March 2002 - the day the Briton was born.\n\nHer coach, Jenny Meadows, told BBC Sport the athlete's time in Lievin could have been up to one second faster - and Hodgkinson is aiming higher still.\n\n\"I've known for weeks I'm capable of breaking it. It's just a matter of getting out on the day,\" she said.\n\n\"We can push it even further in the future, as long as I stay healthy and I think this is hopefully just the beginning.\"\n\nVictory came after a difficult year for the 23-year-old, who stormed to Olympic gold at the Paris Games in 2024.\n\nHodgkinson was left unable to train after tearing her hamstring just a few months after that triumph and has been building her way back ever since.\n\n\"After winning the Olympics, it really wasn't what I thought was going to happen,\" she said.\n\n\"It makes you stop and strip back everything and think, why is this happening? What are the problems?\n\n\"But, we got through it, I became a stronger person, and I think this is now the reward of all of that happening.\"\n\nHow Hodgkinson broke a 23-year-old world record\n\nHodgkinson smashes women's indoor 800m world record\n\nHodgkinson admits a lot of things need to come together for her to break Kratochvilova's record but her recent performances have convinced others in the sport it's only a matter of time.\n\nWorld Athletics president Lord Coe told the Sunday Times he believes Hodgkinson will achieve the feat this year.\n\nThere have been claims that Kratochvilova's performance was assisted by the systematic doping regime that existed in her country at the time - something she has strenuously denied., external\n\nHowever, her time remains more than a second quicker than Hodgkinson's current personal best of 1:54.61 - a national record she set in London in 2024.\n\n\"We're on the right path and we've seen evidence in training that we think that it's possible,\" Hodgkinson said.\n\n\"I think the reason this year has gone so well for me is because I've had my healthiest winter training I've had in years.\"\n\nWhile the race Hodgkinson and her team may target for any record attempt may remain a mystery, Hodgkinson says she is always keen to put in a big performance in London.\n\n\"My coach did say two years ago that 2026 will be a good year,\" she said.\n\n\"London is very special to me. I would love nothing more than to do something like that in front of a home crowd.\"\n\nThe last 12 months have been a rollercoaster of emotions for Hodgkinson.\n\nAfter numerous injury setbacks, Hodgkinson took world 800m bronze in September, with training partner Georgia Hunter Bell securing silver.\n\nDespite the ups and downs, Hodgkinson still describes 2025 as \"my best year\".\n\n\"I still had a good time - my entire personality is not my job,\" she said.\n\n\"There's so much more outside of life than just what I have going in my career.\"\n\nDuring her rehabilitation, Hodgkinson's team mates dubbed her 'Keely 2.0' - a nod to her reinvention and ability to come back stronger.\n\nCoach Trevor Painter bought her a giant Himalayan salt lamp to, as she says, \"send happy vibes\".\n\n\"He says my moods were unpredictable last year\" she joked.\n\n\"It's meant to calm the energy in the atmosphere.\n\n\"It weighs about forty kilograms, so imagine me trying to carry it up the stairs, but I actually think it worked!\"\n\nFirst up, though, will be March's World Athletics Indoor Championships in Poland, where Hodgkinson will be the firm favourite for gold.\n\nOutdoors, she will have an exciting new name next to her on the start line.\n\nIn October, two-time 400m hurdles world champion Femke Bol announced she will step up to compete in the 800m.\n\nEarlier this month, the Dutch superstar won her debut race in Metz, France, setting a national record of 1:59.07 in the process.\n\n\"'Me and Femke are really good friends,\" Hodgkinson said.\n\n\"We've grown up a little bit together over the years. Femke is a very talented woman, but I also know what it takes to run the 800m at these times.\n\n\"Just give her some time [and] she'll get there.\"\n\nWhen asked if she would consider it a potential rivalry, Hodgkinson said: \"I wouldn't call it a rivalry right now, but she's good, and she'll get where she needs to be when she's ready.\"",

    "fullText": "Defending T20 World Cup champions India need \"two big performances\" to reach the semi-finals after Sunday's huge defeat to South Africa, said their assistant coach.\n\nIndia came into the T20 World Cup as hot favourites on home soil but were thrashed by 76 runs in the Super Eights as 80,000 fans at the massive Narendra Modi stadium were stunned into silence.\n\nIn their first chase of the tournament, India's batting came up woefully short in the face of some disciplined South Africa bowling.\n\nIndia collapsed to 111 all out in 18.5 overs in response to South Africa's 187-7 as their 12-match win streak in the T20 World Cup came to a crashing end.\n\nThe magnitude of the defeat has left India with a desperate net run-rate of -3.8 and likely needing to win their last two Super Eight matches convincingly to make it to the semi-finals.\n\nAnything less and India will need to rely on a combination of other results going their way.\n\n\"Very disappointed in the performance,\" said Ryan ten Doeschate.\n\n\"When you set out to win a World Cup, don't expect someone to come and deliver it to you halfway through,\" the assistant coach added.\n\n\"We've messed up on a grand scale and now the onus is on this group of guys to turn it around and put in two solid performances.\"\n\nIndia are grouped with South Africa, the West Indies and Zimbabwe in Super Eights, with the top two advancing to the semi-finals.\n\nThe West Indies face Zimbabwe on Monday night in Mumbai in their Super Eights opener.\n\nIndia next face giant-killers Zimbabwe, who have already beaten Australia and Sri Lanka, on Thursday in Chennai.\n\nSouth Africa play the West Indies the same day in Ahmedabad where Aiden Markram's side could put one foot firmly in the semi-finals with another win.\n\n\"Obviously with the way the group goes, you need at least four points to get through now, and it's going to need two big performances and a big bounce back from everyone,\" said Ten Doeschate.\n\nIndia's fragile batting was exposed against an in-form bowling attack led by left-arm quick Marco Jansen, who returned figures of 4-22 from 3.5 overs. Keshav Maharaj took 3-24 with his left-arm spin.\n\nIndia's media tore into the team on Monday morning.\n\n\"The night the cloak came off,\" blazed a headline in the Indian Express newspaper.\n\n\"Sloppy India reach point of no return,\" said the Hindustan Times.\n\nIndia's ultra-aggressive left-handed opening pair have failed to fire, leaving a shaky middle order to pick up the pieces.\n\nIshan Kishan was out without scoring to Markram on Sunday, while the world's top- ranked T20 batter Abhishek Sharma fell to Jansen for 15, his only runs of the tournament so far after three ducks.\n\n\"It's certainly not panic stations,\" said Ten Doeschate, who hinted there could be discussions about India's batting line-up.\n\n\"If those guys (Ahbishek and Ishan) bat for six overs, the score is going to be 70-plus,\" said Ten Doeschate.\n\n\"So can we get them to temper the way they're playing and be a little bit smarter?\n\n\"Or do we just let them go on the way they are?\n\n\"Or do we bring in a right-hander at the top and make a change somewhere in the middle?\"\n\nCaptain Suryakumar Yadav agreed India need to use their brains in the first six-over power play when only two fielders are allowed on the boundary.\n\n\"Chasing 180-185, you can't win the game in the power play, but you might lose it,\" he said after his side stumbled to 31-3 after six overs, which became 43-4 a few balls later and then 51-5.\n\n\"We lost too many wickets in the power play.\"\n\nThe 2024 champions also have the weight of history against them. No team has ever retained the T20 World Cup and no side have ever won the trophy on home soil.",

It's an opportunity she's had for years, wrestling all over the world, but she's bringing it to local wrestlers here in North Texas, to show who they are and tell their story.\n\n\"When I started wrestling in Texas, there were only three girls in the state, and I didn't really have a lot of guidance,\" Athena said last year. \"I look at such a young generation now and the gap of experience level, from those of us that have traveled the world and those of us that are just getting started, and there's not a lot of crossover with that.\"\n\nFront row tickets to the show are sold out but second row and general admission tickets are still available here.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump responded publicly after Team USA secured a gold medal in men’s hockey at the 2026 Winter Olympics. Following the team’s overtime victory over Canada in Milan, the president shared a message congratulating the players and later spoke with them directly as celebrations continued.\n\nDonald Trump congratulated the United States men’s hockey team after its gold medal victory at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, according to the Detroit Free Press. Coach Mike Sullivan said, “The players just had the President on, I don’t know what it was, what do you call it, FaceTime, whatever, in the locker room. He just spoke to the group, expressing how proud he was of the group and congratulating everybody on the win.” Captain Auston Matthews said, “He called and just congratulated us.”\n\nThe United States defeated Canada 2-1 in overtime to secure the gold medal. Sullivan said the game “was an inspiration to our country. I can’t tell you how many texts I’ve received over the last day or so about watch parties at 8 o’clock in the morning. I think from a viewership standpoint, the United States, there were a lot of people paying attention, the President included.” The team was scheduled to return to NHL duties on February 23, and its flight was diverted from New York’s JFK airport to Miami because of a storm in the northeast.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social: “Congratulations to our great U.S.A. Ice Hockey team. THEY WON THE GOLD. WOW!.” He added, “LOTS OF WINNING!!! President DONALD J. TRUMP.” The White House also shared a social media image depicting a bald eagle and a goose following the victory.\n\nThe post followed prior political tensions between the United States and Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said at the World Economic Forum, “Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.” After the Olympics, Carney wrote, “You’re coming home with 21 hard-fought Olympic medals.”\n\nOriginally reported by Vritti Johar on Mandatory.com.\n\nThe post Donald Trump Has a Message for Team USA Hockey appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "fullText": "The Chargers will most likely address the interior part of the offensive line, especially the guard spots, with Bradley Bozeman and Mekhi Becton being potential cut candidates.\n\nShould they go the free agency route, Sports Illustrated's Connor Orr believes the Bolts will sign veteran Joel Bitonio, whom he tabbed in his bold predictions for all 32 teams in the NFL.\n\nJim Harbaugh is not going to put Justin Herbert at risk again like he was forced to last season. Bitonio can spearhead the offensive line’s transition to a Mike McDaniel system—Bitonio was drafted during McDaniel’s season as the Browns’ receivers coach—and could be a critical, dependable asset amid constant injury woes.\n\nBitonio is not getting any younger, set to be 35 this season and is considering retirement, but he is durable and is still moving as if he were ten years younger.\n\nA stalwart presence along the Browns' offensive line for the past decade, Bitonio finished the 2025 season ranked as PFF's 8th-best pass-blocking guard. He has also ranked in the 91st percentile in PFF run-blocking grade over the past three seasons.\n\nOffensive coordinator Mike McDaniel was on the Browns' staff as the wide receiver coach in 2014, Bitonio's first season in Cleveland, so the familiarity is there. Plus, Bitonio is a great fit in McDaniel's zone scheme.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chargers Wire: NFL analyst's 'bold prediction' sees Chargers bolstering guard spot",

    "description": "Roker Report and our writers stand firmly behind Mundle in the ongoing battle against racism — stay strong, Romaine!",
    "fullText": "Mundle deserves our full support.\n\nWhether it’s happening inside the stadium or online, these idiots must feel the full force of the club and the community, and to be shown that they’re not welcome here. If it happens inside the stadium, I hope every decent fan knows not to look away, and instead to report it.\n\nI’ve already seen some debate about whether online comments are necessarily from Sunderland fans or not — to me, that’s irrelevant. It isn’t acceptable wherever it’s from, and as a fanbase, we have to stand firm and say loudly and clearly that we’re united against racism.\n\nRomaine, we stand with you completely, and these cretins don’t represent us.\n\nThis news is frankly disgusting. I know that the individuals that did this are in the minority of the fan base, but the idea that any person could call themselves a Sunderland fan and then proceed to treat a player like this is sickening.\n\nMundle is both a brilliant footballer and a brilliant person — two things that have nothing to do with his race.\n\nOur squad is made up of players from different backgrounds, races and religions, and this one of the beauties of sport and football: inclusion. People coming from all over to share in moments of joy. The idea that anyone — a player or a spectator — could come to a Sunderland match and be mistreated or discriminated against is horrific.\n\nI sincerely hope that neither Mundle nor anyone else who could be affected by these racist comments will lose faith in the club.\n\nAnd equally, I hope the club does everything in their power to stamp it out and ensure that these individuals never see the inside of the Stadium of Light again.\n\nThere’s no place in life for racism, and sport is no different.\n\nSunderland AFC is a club built on community values, respect and most importantly, a family spirit. Players from all walks of life come together, put on the shirt and represent our region with pride, passion and most importantly, with respect.\n\nWe stand with Mundle and anyone found reducing our players down to racial remarks doesn’t belong anywhere near the Sunderland community.\n\nNo room for racism. Not now, not ever.\n\nThe meltdown by some fans after a defeat is bad enough.\n\nThe hordes leaving early yet again astonishes me and the number of fickle fans our club has is quite depressing. But the news that Mundle has been racially abused almost defies belief or suitable words.\n\nEvery club has a percentage of dimwits but to realise we are amongst them is quite frankly sickening.\n\nThey hide behind social media. They don’t have enough respectable or honourable qualities to be a decent human being. I hope they’re caught and identified and I hope Romaine gets the support he deserves from the club, but also that he realises that if it’s from Sunderland fans, it’s a tiny fraction of our fanbase and that the love and support of the vast majority comes to the fore.\n\nMundle is a talent with the potential to be an excellent player.\n\nI hope he realises this, and that we’re all behind him. The idiots who write such things will unfortunately not have the intelligence to read feedback from sites such as Roker Report. More’s the pity.\n\nIt’s a complete tragedy that we’re seeing this vile abuse in 2026.\n\nThere’s no place for racism in any shape or form, and whatever we feel about the performances of our players, the colour of their skin or race is immaterial.\n\nThose who have posted this vile content need to be banned for life.\n\nRomaine, every Sunderland fan is 100% behind you, and stands with you. Please don’t let the 0.0001% detract from the fact you’re part of this huge Mackem family.\n\nWhen someone is singled out for unfair criticism, it can regrettably lead to ridiculous situations like this, where the uneducated and ignorant are able to hide behind anonymous accounts and send racist abuse to black players.\n\nWhilst I hope that none of the messages are from Sunderland fans directly, that isn’t entirely relevant. The reality is that we shouldn’t be talking about incidents like these occurring in 2026.\n\nWhilst initiatives like “Show Racism the Red Card” do great work in schools, we need social media platforms to do more against anonymous accounts, where hate can be spread without fear of consequences.\n\nAs fans of football, we need to do more to stamp out racism and make a strong stand.\n\nWhether it be a misinformed comment in the stands or an incident like this, we need to be better. Regardless of who sent the messages, I hope they’re identified quickly and that there’s police involvement. A stadium ban isn’t going to impact a sad bastard who doesn’t go to games but feels like they can send abuse online.\n\nFor Mundle, I’m certain that he’ll get the best support from the club and fellow teammates. I hope from our perspective inside the stadium that we see this as a wakeup call —doing more to support our players and perhaps thinking a bit more before saying something.\n\nMundle deserves our full and unwavering support, and I hope we showcase this in the upcoming games.",

    "description": "It was a bad day at the office for the Lads as Fulham cashed in on a sloppy display. What did our writers make of it?",
    "fullText": "Sat in the south east corner, I was celebrating before he shot but before I knew it, I was caught inadvertently celebrating a goal kick to Fulham.\n\nUntil I see a replay, it honestly did look harder to do what he did than score.\n\nI was baffled by his introduction over Chemsdine Talbi when Jocelin Ta Bi went off.\n\nWith Reinildo, Ta Bi, Nordi Mukiele, Dennis Cirkin and possibly Brian Brobbey all out of action, we’re counting the wounded.\n\nIt’s a big concern as we’re struggling to create from out wide as we’ve done throughout the season. What do we fall back on now?\n\nI’ve felt that during the last seven games, we’ve been found out.\n\nYes, we enjoyed good fortune against Crystal Palace and Burnley, but the recycled balls to the wings or hoping Enzo Le Fée picks the pass of his dreams to a runner in behind have been scuppered.\n\nRégis Le Bris’ usual ability to solve a problem has been well and truly nullified. Is it time to change from the off? I think so.\n\nLe Fée is often the one player that doesn’t deserve any criticism that might be aimed at the team.\n\nAlways involved and always trying to affect the game.\n\nI’m not sure what goes on in players’ heads; why they don’t turn up for certain games and indeed where this leaves our season, but at least the return of our captain will mean everyone will be getting his instructions and motivation for the remaining games.\n\nMy first negative concerns the injuries to both Nordi Mukiele and Jocelin Ta Bi in the first half.\n\nAs we started to approach a full strength squad, we could’ve done without losing players and especially someone as influential as Mukiele.\n\nHopefully they aren’t out for long as it didn’t help the flow in a very poor first half — possibly the worst of the season?\n\nI was interested to see how we would approach this game — would it be a fast and committed approach to push us as high up the table as possible, or would it be a negative “It’s only Fulham” approach?\n\nUnfortunately, it was the latter.\n\nWe lacked energy and passion, and save for a brief moment after our penalty, we were often a shadow of the team we can be, which certainly wasn’t conducive to a team fighting for the highest finish possible.\n\nFulham have done the double over us this season. That’s a damning fact.\n\nThe sides were quite evenly-matched overall and I have to say that Fulham took their chances well, but despite the tide of goals going against us, the period before and after Enzo Le Fée’s goal were pretty uncomfortable for the visitors.\n\nWe’re a team that doesn’t give up, and that’s the hallmark of this group — regardless of which formation we’re playing.\n\nWe are still competing in the FA Cup and need only one win to be safe, with eleven games to go.\n\nLast August, all Sunderland fans would have taken that.\n\nWe just didn’t play with the required intensity — especially in the first half.\n\nFulham played well and were very competitive, but we didn’t show enough dominance in midfield and penetration in attack, and allowed the Fulham forwards too much space. We definitely missed the drive and organisational awareness of our superb captain Granit Xhaka in the first sixty nine minutes.\n\nThe change after he came on was noticeable but he can’t be the solution all over the pitch, as we normally enjoy defending.\n\nSunderland came back with some intent at 0-2 and dominated the game before and after the penalty, taken expertly by Le Fée.\n\nThe Londoners were very good on the break, with excellent play from Harry Wilson and Alex Iwobi, and the third goal definitely deflated us and a lot of fans left early.\n\nWe had off days — both on Sunday and at Craven Cottage when we lost 1-0 — and Fulham are the only team to have done the double over us this season.\n\nIt was a nice sunny day — a great day for watching football.\n\nThe crowd were expectant and the two teams produced a ponderous spectacle. Both teams were even if you look at the stats, and Granit Xhaka improved things.\n\nIt was an awful sight for the television audience.\n\nTwo mid-table teams not producing much in terms of end product.\n\nThe loss of Nordi Mukiele was a big blow, as it ruined the attack down our right hand side.\n\nBoth teams were evenly matched, but our lack of cutting edge is getting increasingly concerning and as soon as Romaine Mundle missed his chance, I said to my neighbour that they would go and score. I said it mainly to jinx it from happening but that ploy didn’t work.\n\nThat’s the second home game in a row where the opposition has scored with an unmarked header from a corner, but their VAR-gifted penalty was a joke — not least because there were at least four Fulham players in offside positions.\n\n0-2 down was always going to be a huge ask but when Enzo Le Fée narrowed the deficit, I wondered if a comeback a-la Arsenal or even Bournemouth was on the cards.\n\nThe crowd didn’t play their part and it was disappointing to see everyone leaving in droves when Alex Iwobi impressively slotted home their third, whereas in previous games, the crowd would’ve driven the team on.\n\nIt seemed that no-one — the crowd or the players — had the appetite for a fight. And Fulham were allowed to steal the three points.\n\nThis team and the fans need to stick together, so it’s absolutely despicable to hear of the online racist abuse that’s been sent to Mundle.\n\nWe win as a team and we lose as a team. If you don’t like that, get the hell out of here and don’t dare to call yourself a Sunderland fan. How dare you!\n\nAs Dan Ballard said, days like this were always going to happen. We need to stick together no call each other out. All for one and one for all.\n\nIf you don’t like it, get lost.\n\nAs has been the case since Christmas, Sunderland have been a predictable beast.\n\nWhilst Régis Le Bris’ pragmatism was a welcome change at the start of the season, the predictability it brings in a division where teams are constantly in a state of evolution is starting to bite — and bite hard.\n\nA lack of creative spark and a lot of sideways movement that concludes in not very much isn’t enough to establish yourself at this level for a prolonged period of time.\n\nAs soon as he came on, the groans were audible and the predictable proceeded to happen.\n\nWhilst the result wasn’t on one individual, he simply isn’t good enough for this level and his missed sitter was a ‘sliding doors moment’ in a game devoid of quality until then.\n\nSince Christmas (someone please fact check this) we’ve conceded an average of two goals per game in the league whilst boasting a brilliantly low xG.\n\nIn short, we’re conceding around twice as many goals as we score, and it doesn’t need a genius to explain why that is objectively bad news.\n\nAnother game where Trai Hume was neither a full back nor a midfielder — an experiment which needs to end.\n\nHume’s inclusion out of position softens us in defence and attack. It’s been coming for weeks and is visible to all except those who make the decisions on the team sheet. At this level, we need eleven men playing at full throttle, yet at the moment we choose to play with 9.5 every time we play Mundle and Hume out of position.\n\nBrutal it may be, but for a team that’s taken plenty of plaudits, they’re also not immune from criticism — especially when the issues are so obvious to boot.",

Under the guidance of head coach Daren Sammy, the Caribbean side have spoken about creating their own slice of history, but consistency will be crucial as the competition intensifies.\n\nThe West Indies enter the match on the back of four consecutive wins, putting behind a disappointing run in bilateral series before the tournament. Shai Hope and Shimron Hetmyer have led the batting charge, while Jason Holder and Roston Chase have provided balance with their all-round skills. Romario Shepherd has also impressed with both bat and ball, particularly on Indian surfaces where he has IPL experience.\n\nZimbabwe, on the other hand, have been one of the biggest revelations of the tournament. The Sikandar Raza-led side have pulled off memorable victories over former world champions Australia and Sri Lanka, earning respect and recognition on the global stage. Young batter Brian Bennett has been their standout performer with the bat, while Blessing Muzarabani and Brad Evans have been among the leading wicket-takers in the competition.\n\nWith short boundaries and a batting-friendly pitch expected at the Wankhede Stadium, West Indies are likely to target a big-hitting approach, but Zimbabwe’s confidence and resilience suggest they are capable of pushing their opponents to the limit.\n\nWest Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match: Live streaming details\n\nWhen will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match be played?\n\nThe West Indies vs Zimbabwe Super 8 match will be played on Monday, February 23, 2026.\n\nWhere will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match be played?\n\nThe match will take place at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, India.\n\nWhat time will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match start?\n\nThe match is scheduled to begin at 7:00 PM IST, with the toss at 6:30 PM IST.\n\nWhich TV channels will broadcast the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match?\n\nThe game will be broadcast live on the Star Sports Network in India.\n\nHow to watch live streaming of the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match?\n\nFans can watch the live stream on the Jio Hotstar app and website.\n\nWhere can we follow the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match online?\n\nLive ball-by-ball updates and coverage will be available on TimesofIndia.com.",

    "title": "On This Day (23rd Feb 1985): Striker Shows Sunderland Fans Of Times To Come",
    "description": "On this day in 1985, a future Sunderland striker would show the Lads how it’s done!",
    "fullText": "Looking back to this day back in 1985, it actually seemed quite a pivotal moment. It was a point where Sir Tom Cowie’s gamble from the season before could have gone either way.\n\nGoing back twelve months, the Sunderland owner decided that – after allowing him to build an exciting young squad, with the likes of Colin West and Gary Rowell banging in the goals, Paul Bracewell pulling the strings in midfield, Barry Venison and Nick Pickering bombing down the flanks from full-back and Chris Turner between the sticks – that Alan Durban wasn’t his man.\n\nBut, as always, Sunderland moves on, and on this occasion Cowie turned back to a club legend on the pitch, someone who had made more appearances as an outfield player than anyone else in the club’s history – Len Ashurst.\n\nAshurst found himself in a tough spot during his first summer; however, he wanted to freshen up the squad but wasn’t provided with the funds to do so, and tough decisions had to be made. Eight players would make their Sunderland debuts in the first four games of the following season, and for a while, things were looking good.\n\nAs December began, Sunderland had just beaten Ron Atkinson’s Manchester United 3-2 at Roker Park in an ill-tempered affair that saw David Hodgson and Mark Hughes receive their marching orders, and Clive Walker bag a hat-trick. This put Ashurst’s side ninth in the table (of 22 in Division One), with a League Cup fourth round replay at White Hart Lane to come days later – having knocked Brian Clough’s Forest out in the previous round.\n\nTop half of the First Division, going strong in the League Cup – happy days.\n\nSunderland then lost eight out of the next nine league games, including a 3-1 loss at St James’ Park against Jack Charlton’s Mags side, where Gary Bennett and Howard Gayle were sent off.\n\nBut in the three games prior to the trip to West London, there were signs that things were looking up.\n\nThis began with knocking Graham Taylor’s Watford out of the League Cup at the quarter-final stage, and although we followed that up with defeat at The Dell against Lawrie McMenemy’s Southampton, we quickly bounced back with a 1-0 win against a Stoke City side that had Steve Bould at the back and Barry Siddall behind him in goal.\n\nThis got even better when the Lads beat Chelsea 2-0 at Roker in the League Cup semi-final first-leg, which meant things were looking up ahead of the clash with QPR, who, although they were four places higher in the table than Sunderland, were only two points better off having played two more fixtures.\n\nIt was a good opportunity for Ashurst to relieve the pressure and climb the table to the safety of mid-table, and a training session the day before the game to become accustomed to the controversial synthetic pitch at Loftus Road seemed to have paid off in the early stages, as Sunderland piled the pressure on the hosts.\n\nWith just a couple of minutes on the clock, West was sent through on goal by Hodgson with only the keeper to beat, but could only drag his shot wide. Moments later, Gary Bennett shot straight at Peter Hucker in the QPR goal, before Peter Daniel repeated the feat soon after. Then it was Clive Walker’s turn to be sent through on goal by Hodgson, but again his shot was saved.\n\nQPR were having more of the ball, but the away side continued to create the better chances. Even after the break, when the hosts had been offered a chance to regroup, the chances still came for Sunderland. Ten minutes into the second half, an unmarked Pickering could only head over the bar after good work from Venison – it seemed a case of when and not if – and just after the hour mark, it duly arrived.\n\nPredictably, it came at the other end, and it began with an innocuous long clearance from Hucker that Reuben Agboola could only head straight to future Sunderland FA Cup hero John Byrne, who then showed the Sunderland strikers how to do it by driving a crisp shot into the corner of the net past Chris Turner.\n\nMore chances were created to equalise in the remaining half hour, but more chances were missed. It would end 1-0 to the home side, with a striker doing the business being the thing to divide the two sides, but for Sunderland, it was possibly more significant.\n\nThe positivity going into the QPR fixture was seemingly lost, and Ashurst’s side lost 12 out of the remaining 16 league games and were relegated to Division Two – and of course, we lost in the League Cup final.\n\nQueens Park Rangers 1-0 Sunderland\n\nSunderland: Turner, Venison, Pickering, Bennett, Chisholm, Elliott, Hodgson (Wallace), Agboola, West, Daniel, Walker\n\nQPR: Hucker, Fereday, Dawes, Waddock, Wicks, Fenwick, Robinson, Fillery, Bannister, Byrne, Gregory Substitute not used: Kerslake",

    "fullText": "With Mauricio Pochettino about three weeks from selecting the U.S. roster for March training camp and friendlies, a rush of good news concerning two players arrived a few hours apart Saturday:\n\nMidfielder Tyler Adams was on the field for the first time in more than two months and striker Ricardo Pepi was in uniform for the first time in six weeks.\n\nAdams, who recovered earlier than anticipated from a sprained knee ligament, started in Bournemouth’s 0-0 draw at West Ham, while Pepi, in uniform after recovering from a fractured forearm, scored a sensational goal as a second-half sub in PSV Eindhoven’s 3-1 triumph over Heerenveen.\n\nRicardo Pepi laat zich direct gelden bij zijn rentree 🎯👏#psvhee pic.twitter.com/z4UrAtaZkr\n\n— ESPN NL (@ESPNnl) February 21, 2026\n\nWith both back in the mix for national team duty next month — Adams is certain and Pepi is probable — Pochettino has, at the moment, almost his entire player pool available for selection.\n\nOnly midfielder Gio Reyna (muscular issue) and winger Alex Zendejas (adductor) have remained out for multiple weeks.\n\nAdams, the 2022 World Cup captain, missed 10 matches before suiting up at Everton on Feb. 10 — an absence of eight weeks instead of up to a feared three months. On Saturday, he logged 66 minutes, completed 41-of-45 passes and earned the second-best defensive statistics among players on both teams as eighth-place Bournemouth extended its Premier League unbeaten streak to seven.\n\nWith his left forearm well-protected, Pepi entered in the 76th minute and, after video replay negated his apparent goal, he rocketed a 25-yard shot in the 87th minute to stretch his Eredivisie scoring streak to six games. He increased his league total to nine and overall count to 12 in just 22 appearances.\n\nThe timing was ideal for the 23-year-old Texan, who, while injured, fell behind Coventry City’s Haji Wright and Derby County’s Patrick Agyemang on the U.S. depth chart behind No. 1 striker Folarin Balogun (Monaco).\n\n“Amazing feeling to be back!” Pepi posted on social media. “Thank you to all the PSV’ers for the warm support on my return.”\n\nPochettino plans to name his squad for next month’s camp March 17 ahead of friendlies in Atlanta against Belgium on March 28 and Portugal on March 31 — the last gathering before his World Cup decisions. He must submit a provisional list of between 35 and 55 players to FIFA by May 11 before announcing the 26-man squad on or about May 26.\n\nIt was quite a week for Balogun, who followed his two-goal performance against reigning European champion Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday with a second-half goal that sparked Monaco’s three-goal uprising to shock Ligue 1 leader Lens, 3-2.\n\nHe increased his overall goal haul to 11: five in Ligue 1, five in the Champions League and one in the French Cup.\n\nMidfielder Tanner Tessmann (58 minutes) and third-place Lyon saw their 13-game winning streak across all competitions end with a 3-1 defeat at Strasbourg.\n\nRight back Tim Weah was Olympique Marseille’s best player from an analytical standpoint in a 2-0 loss at Brest, extending fourth-place OM’s overall slump to 1-3-2 heading into next Sunday’s critical home match against Lyon.\n\nToulouse center back Mark McKenzie served a yellow card suspension and missed the 1-1 draw with Paris FC.\n\nCenter back Chris Richards helped Crystal Palace register its second shutout in three Premier League matches, a 1-0 victory over last-place Wolverhampton, which played a man short for about a half-hour before conceding the goal.\n\nLeft back Antonee Robinson was held out of Fulham’s 3-1 triumph at Sunderland without an official explanation, his third consecutive league absence. He had played 90 last weekend in the FA Cup.\n\nMidfielder Brenden Aaronson (73 minutes) and Leeds earned their third straight away draw in Premier League play, a 1-1 result at Aston Villa.\n\nAfter productive matches in the English Championship last week, Wright and Agyemang were quiet. Wright played 71 minutes in a 2-0 victory at West Brom and Agyemang went 90 in a 2-0 loss at Watford.\n\nMidfielder Aidan Morris went 75 in Middlesbrough’s 0-0 draw with second-to-last Oxford, leaving his club three points behind first-place Coventry but six points ahead in the race for the second promotion to the Premier League.\n\nChristian Pulisic, who has been battling bursitis, returned to AC Milan’s lineup after three substitution appearances with a 62-minute effort and two quality scoring chances during a 1-0 home loss to Parma — its first loss in Serie A since the August opener, a stretch of 23 games.\n\nMidfielder Weston McKennie, who has been in tremendous form for Juventus this winter, played all of the 2-0 loss to Como, a result that stretched the Turin club’s winless rut to five games heading into the home leg of the Champions League affair with Galatasaray on Wednesday. (Juventus lost last week’s opener, 5-2.)\n\nMidfielder Yunus Musah remained on the bench for the seventh time in nine matches as Atalanta edged Napoli, 2-1. He has appeared in 14-of-26 Serie A matches with just three starts, totalling 447 minutes.\n\nIn Serie B, goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann has conceded 10 goals in three matches, the most recent setback coming in Cesena’s 3-2 loss to Spezia.\n\nMidfielder Malik Tillman played 81 minutes in Bayer Leverkusen’s 1-0 loss at Union Berlin, ending a seven-game unbeaten streak heading into the Champions League second leg Tuesday against Olympiacos. Leverkusen won the first leg, 2-0.\n\nTeenage center back Noahkai Banks (17th start) continued to impress at Augsburg, which used a late comeback to earn a 3-2 victory at Wolfsburg.\n\nReyna’s call-up hopes continued to dim after missing his fifth consecutive match for Mönchengladbach. Over two months, he has played just 28 minutes. Teammate Joe Scally, a right wing back, played the entire match.\n\nMidfielder James Sands’ run of 17 consecutive starts for St. Pauli across all competitions ended, but he entered in the 80th minute and helped seal a 2-1 victory over Werder Bremen, which lifted the Hamburg side out of the automatic relegation zone.\n\nIn the second division, left wing back John Tolkin (70 minutes) and Holstein Kiel lost at Karlsruher, 3-1 — their fifth consecutive loss overall.\n\nMidfielder Johnny Cardoso made his fifth consecutive La Liga start for Atlético Madrid, which defeated Espanyol, 4-2, to snap a three-game winless streak in league play.\n\nRight back Alex Freeman did not play in Villarreal’s 2-1 win over Valencia.\n\nWhile Pepi’s goal headlined the U.S. contributions for PSV Eindhoven, right back Sergiño Dest made his 22nd start as the league leaders continued to run away with the title, thanks to a 20-2-2 record and a plus-41 goal differential.\n\nCenter back Auston Trusty’s second red card in four weeks – for violent conduct in the 74th minute – imperiled Celtic, which conceded Hibernian’s late winner in the 2-1 outcome. He will miss next Sunday’s Old Firm clash against Rangers.\n\nOn opening weekend, three Vancouver players in the U.S. pool – center back Tristan Blackmon, midfielder Sebastian Berhalter and striker Brian White – played the whole match as the Whitecaps edged Real Salt Lake, 1-0. RSL midfielder Diego Luna sat out with a knee ailment.\n\nFive goalkeeping candidates started, led by Pochettino’s undisputed starter, New York City’s Matt Freese, who made five saves in a 1-1 draw against the L.A. Galaxy. The others were New England’s Matt Turner, Chicago’s Chris Brady, Columbus’ Patrick Schulte and Cincinnati’s Roman Celentano.\n\nCenter backs Tim Ream (Charlotte), Miles Robinson (Cincinnati) and Walker Zimmerman (Toronto) and left wing back Max Arfsten (Columbus) played every minute and midfielder Luca de la Torre (Charlotte) went 69.\n\nLos Angeles FC midfielder Timothy Tillman assisted during his 82-minute stint in the 3-0 home rout of Inter Miami before 75,673 at the Coliseum. Midfielder Cristian Roldan captained Seattle’s 2-0 win over Colorado.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are looking to finish the second half of the season strong and secure a favorable spot in the playoffs. However, it has been an up-and-down year for Los Angeles. For LeBron James, the bigger picture is his potential options this offseason.\n\n“Cleveland is one of them. I’m not sure I’d put the Heat on the list. Golden State depending on how things go would be one. There’s a place of two that I won’t say right now that I’m keeping my eye on… I have a team or two that I think he could consider going to and I have researched the concept and I will continue to keep my eye on the concept,” Brian Windhorst said on the Rich Eisen Show.\n\nIf this is indeed his final season, James wants to be part of a contender.\n\n“LeBron wants to compete for a championship,\" James’ agent Rich Paul told ESPN. \"He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. We are very appreciative of the partnership that we've had for eight years with Jeanie [Buss] and Rob [Pelinka] and consider the Lakers as a critical part of his career.”\n\nOn the court, head coach JJ Redick believes the Lakers need to share the ball more to maximize their potential.\n\n“That's, again, it's something we talk about all the time. We're a better basketball team. We win more games if we have more potential assists. And get more assists,” Redick said after a loss to the Boston Celtics.\n\nWith Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves, and James on the floor, ball movement shouldn’t be an issue. Yet, for some reason, the ball is sticking in one spot longer than usual when the Lakers are dropping games.\n\nWhen all three stars are working together and moving the ball effectively, the Lakers become a formidable force. The team’s main challenge is finding consistency in connecting with one another on the court.",

    "fullText": "Lakers insider exposes nightmare stat for LeBron James, Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves playing together originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are looking forward to this summer with excitement, especially regarding potential roster moves. One key focus is Austin Reaves, who will be a free agent this offseason, though there is mutual interest in bringing him back.\n\n“I try not to think about it. Honestly. I've said it a million times. I want to be in L.A. I love it,\" Reaves told ESPN. \"Even though the other extension was turned down, that doesn't mean that I'm trying to go get a f---ing gigantic number that don't make sense. I want to be here, I want to win. I want to do everything that can help this organization be better. So I don't try to think about those things.\"\n\nThe Lakers also have a bright future with Luka Doncic, whose only request is to win now.\n\n“Dončić being just 26 gives the Lakers a far longer timeline to build a championship-contending team, but that doesn't mean they can slow down and take their time. Dončić told Lakers president Rob Pelinka and coach JJ Redick in May that he's not interested in taking the slow approach in building a contender,” CBS Sports’ Jasmyn Wimbish wrote.\n\nAdd LeBron James to the mix, and expectations for the Big Three are sky-high. However, Lakers insider Jovan Buha recently highlighted a concerning stat when the trio plays together.\n\n“The Lakers are now 8-4 in their 12 games with the Big 3. Their four losses are to the four best teams they've played record-wise: Spurs, Rockets, Celtics and Suns. They've lost all of those games by double digits. That's concerning,” Buha posted.\n\nWhile 12 games is a small sample size, expectations for the Big Three are much higher. Dominating weaker teams is one thing, but failing to notch a single significant win against the league’s best with all three stars on the floor is troubling.\n\nThe Lakers have an elite Big Three, but they haven’t been able to fully click when it matters most. The trio will need to figure this out as the playoffs approach in a few months.",

    "description": "A six-shot lead at Riviera had evaporated with Tiger Woods looking on?",
    "fullText": "PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. — The scariest putt in golf is somewhere between three and four feet.\n\nShort enough that you expect to make it.\n\nLong enough that you might not.\n\nIt gets tougher, I’d imagine, to hit a three-and-a-half footer with 5,000 people watching from the hillside in front of you.\n\nTougher when they’ve just gasped in horror at what you’ve just done.\n\nTougher still when one of those people is Rory McIlroy, who just so happens to be one stroke behind you.\n\nAnd tougher when another is Tiger Woods, your childhood hero, looking on from a perch beside the clubhouse, 50 yards and 500 miles away, waiting to shake your hand as long as you can somehow get your ball to the bottom of that hole.\n\nIt gets tougher when you’re on the brink of winning your first PGA Tour event, something you’ve dreamt of your entire life, something you know you can do but also know isn’t guaranteed.\n\nAnd tougher knowing that missing wouldn’t just mean letting an opportunity slip by — it would mean blowing a six-stroke lead, crashing on the final turn, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nIt gets tougher when the pressure hasn’t slowly mounted, but instead, after three rounds and 15 holes of low stress and many birdies, it hits like a freight train, with a shrinking lead, a growing crowd, decibels, nerves and heart rate rising by the minute.\n\nAnd it gets tougher when you can’t feel your hands.\n\nSUNDAY BROUGHT THE MOST GLORIOUS WEATHER in the history of Los Angeles, tied for first with 80 percent of all days in L.A. history, 70 degrees and sunny, deep blue cloudless sky matching the deep blue ocean just visible from the balcony of Riviera Country Club’s iconic clubhouse.\n\nThat was the setting for the final round of the Genesis Invitational, which felt like it could go one of two directions. Jacob Bridgeman began the day with a six-shot lead over Rory McIlroy and seven-plus over the rest of the gang, having played nearly flawless golf through three rounds. Bridgeman has been very good and very steady since last season, but entering Sunday he’d never won. Would he succumb to the pressure, blow up and yield to the chase pack? Or would he keep his foot on the gas and continue speeding away from the rest of the field? Those felt like the two options.\n\nInstead, much of the day settled in the awkward in-between.\n\nThere are few better golf settings than the iconic old-school cool of Riviera, though early tee times plus an L.A. crowd living up to its get-there-in-the-fourth-inning reputation led to a slightly muted early stretch.\n\nRiviera’s just a really cool place to watch a golf tournament pic.twitter.com/Bn8dl5jgh2\n\n— Dylan Dethier (@dylan_dethier) February 22, 2026\n\nFans were pulling for McIlroy, wanting to will him into a comeback, but they were quietly supportive of Bridgeman, too, an impressive unknown without an ounce of villain in him. Bridgeman matched McIlroy’s birdie at No. 1 to keep his lead at six. He birdied the third to stretch it to seven. Even that was greeted with light applause. McIlroy’s early birdie tries slid by, doing little to ignite the crowd. Hollywood seemed unimpressed with this particular bit of anticlimax.\n\n(One star among them: Ben Affleck, who walked the entire front nine inside the ropes with his son and tried multiple times to frame up the perfect iPhone photo of a McIlroy tee shot. The stars, they’re just like us!)\n\nBridgeman has been forged in the fires of competitive golf, first growing up in South Carolina, then at Clemson and more recently on the game’s top circuit. He’s been on a steady upward trajectory. He’s made it clear that success isn’t all his own.\n\nWhen he first started working with his swing coach Scott Hamilton, he had some work to do. “I didn’t hit the ball straight, didn’t hit it high, didn’t have a lot of control with my irons,” he said.\n\nWhen he settled on his first-choice caddie, G.W. Cable, there was just one problem: he’d have to take a pay cut to join Bridgeman on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\n“He took a gamble on me and luckily we only spent one year down there and I think he’s pretty pleased with his gamble,” Bridgeman said.\n\nHe earned $4.4 million on the course last season. He was playing for a $4 million winner’s check on Sunday. Good pressure to have.\n\nBut just because he’s been good doesn’t mean it’d be easy. As the day lingered, Bridgeman let the rest of the field do the same. He bogeyed 4. He bogeyed 7. He hit the middles of greens, he scared the hole, just missing putts that he’d watched fall the first three days.\n\nMcIlroy finally made some semblance of a push early on the back nine. Birdie at 11 cut the lead to five before a highlight-reel hole-out birdie from the bunker at 12 electrified the crowd for the first time all day.\n\nNot going down without a fight!@McIlroyRory birdies from the bunker to get within 4 of solo leader Jacob Bridgeman.\n\n📺 CBS pic.twitter.com/nOJ9IH0g0M\n\n— PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) February 22, 2026\n\nUp ahead, several other contenders made their presence felt. Aldrich Potgieter got to 15 under with an eagle at 11. Adam Scott played stunning golf, stacking eight birdies and zero bogeys to post the clubhouse lead at 16 under. And then, just as Bridgeman found himself in a spot of bother, Kurt Kitayama made his seventh and eighth birdies of the day in the group ahead to post 17 under par.\n\nBridgeman wobbled with a wayward tee shot at No. 16, dumping his iron into the front right bunker, an inescapable jail.\n\n“It was honestly easy until I got to about 16 and then it got really hard,” Bridgeman said post-round. His caddie, looking at his lie, didn’t hesitate. He had to aim right and play for bogey. His lengthy par putt wandered past the hole; he negotiated in a nervy try for bogey. The lead was suddenly one.\n\nThings only got tougher at the par-5 17th, where Bridgeman’s second shot sailed right and found a bunker, leaving him with no good options. He did well to play a sensible shot.\n\n“Definitely around the green, that was the first time that I had to play defense,” he said.\n\nIt was around this time that Bridgeman lost feeling in his hands.\n\n“I didn’t really feel really crazy nervous until I had a five-footer for bogey on 16; that one was sketchy,” he said. “I hit a really good putt and luckily it went in, and then I was really nervous from there on out. I couldn’t even feel my hands on the last couple greens, I just hit the putt hoping it would get somewhere near the hole.”\n\nBut on full shots, Bridgeman said, he still felt okay.\n\n“I felt like I was just kind of in robot mode and autopilot, I could just swing the club and it would do exactly what it’s supposed to do,” he said. An envious feeling.\n\nThat’s what he did on No. 18, sending driver up the left-center fairway off the tee and playing a towering approach right at the hole, 20 feet short, straight uphill.\n\nAnd then he left it three and a half feet short.\n\nThe crowd groaned. They murmured. Suddenly, a tantalizing possibility was back in play: a miss would mean a three-way playoff between Bridgeman, Kitayama and McIlroy, whose dramatic birdie putt had dripped over the front edge just moments before.\n\nBridgeman is good friends with Chris Gotterup, a rising star on Tour and a recent multiple-time winner. He recounted watching the WM Phoenix Open, where Gotterup poured in a winning birdie putt with aggressive speed.\n\n“We were like, what were you doing? You hit your putt so hard, it was going to go four feet by the hole. He said, ‘I have no idea, I couldn’t feel my hands.’\n\n“I thought he was kind of crazy until I got to this moment and then I was like, yep, I understand what you’re talking about now, Chris. I had no idea what to do.”\n\nIt’s tough to make a three-and-a-half footer, and it’s tougher if you can sense that some portion of the crowd around is suddenly hoping that you will.\n\nBut, as he and we suddenly realized, easier for Jacob Bridgeman.\n\n“The hole’s really white and it looked pretty big for whatever reason on 18,” he said. He had his read — hit it at the middle of the middle — and he knew what he could control.\n\n“I was just hoping that the ball would roll where it was supposed to roll.”\n\nMost of the time, nothing good can happen with a three-and-a-half-footer. It’s a multiple-choice test with two options: Relief or disaster. This time, though, salvation lay within. The ball rolled as it was supposed to. Bridgeman’s triumph was official. He plunged into the winner’s whirlpool; his wife greeted him on the green, he floated through his CBS interview, he climbed the stairs, shook Woods’ hand, didn’t process whatever he said.\n\n“This is way, way better than I’ve ever dreamt it,” he said.\n\nDylan Dethier welcomes your comments at dylan_dethier@golf.com.\n\nThe post ‘Couldn’t feel my hands’: Inside Jacob Bridgeman’s terrifying Genesis finish appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea are reportedly now looking into a move to sign Sunderland’s 6ft 4in goalkeeper Robin Roefs this summer.\n\nIt’s a surprise link that has come from nowhere really, with the goalkeeper noise around Stamford Bridge going a little bit quiet lately.\n\nWith the form of Robert Sanchez improving immensely, we have seen new number one goalkeeper links with Chelsea die out a little bit. But there is another situation brewing up.\n\nFilip Jorgensen is basically not playing at all now at Chelsea and will clearly be looking to move on in the summer if his situation does not improve. He is a young goalkeeper who will not be happy playing as a backup – so you will see him looking to move on at the end of the season. And Chelsea will need to replace him.\n\nAgain though, will Roefs be happy being a backup, if that is what they are looking at him for, if they are even looking at him at all?\n\nThey are, according to one reliable journalist this week.\n\nChelsea are interested in signing Roefs ahead of the summer transfer window, with the North East club slapping a £50m price tag on his head, according to journalist Alan Nixon.\n\nThe big shock here though is that the report actually claims Roefs would be to replace SANCHEZ and NOT Jorgensen!?\n\nAccording to the report from Nixon, Chelsea are in the race to sign Sunderland goalkeeper Roefs ahead of the transfer window. The Blues are believed to be searching for a new number one, and Sunderland would be willing to do business if the price is right.\n\nNixon claims it could take an offer in the region of £50m for Chelsea to secure his signature, while Roefs would be keen on a move if Rosenior’s side seal Champions League qualification.\n\nI simply cannot see this right now, don’t think it will happen, at least not replacing Sanchez with him.",

    "fullText": "AC Milan lost 1-0 to Parma at the Giuseppe Meazza thanks to an 80th-minute goal from Mariano Troillo, effectively ending their Serie A title challenge.\n\nThe Rossoneri conceded against the run of play to record only their second loss of the Serie A season, their first in 24 games.\n\nMilan have bounced back impressively from an abysmal 2024/25 campaign. They re-hired Massimiliano Allegri, who has steered the club back into the upper echelon.\n\nThe seven-time UEFA Champions League winners looked to be pushing rivals Inter Milan for the Scudetto, but recent results have seen them fall further back in the race.\n\nMilan have managed only one win in their last four games (D2, L1), allowing their ruthless arch-rivals take a 10-point lead with 12 games to go.\n\nMilan travel to Cremonese next weekend before a crucial title decider with Inter.\n\nIf the Rossoneri have any hopes of spoiling Inter’s party, they must pick up maximum points in the coming match-ups.\n\nAfter finishing ninth last season, the primary objective for Milan this term was not necessarily to wrestle back the Scudetto, but to restore their status among Europe’s elite.\n\nReturning to the UEFA Champions League was the benchmark. In that context, this campaign still represents significant progress.\n\nNine draws have ultimately cost them momentum. Turning even a handful of those stalemates into victories could have kept them firmly in the title conversation deep into the spring.\n\nHowever, this is not a side that should beat itself up. The bigger picture matters.\n\nMilan have rebuilt their identity, regained consistency and re-established themselves at the top end of Serie A.\n\nIf they can get the right additions through the door in the summer transfer window, they can push for Scudetto number 20 next season.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen Josh Pate announced that Donald Trump would appear on his College Football Show, he promised viewers a politics-free conversation focused strictly on the sport. However, what followed was a brisk, 10-minute exchange that often drifted far from the field.\n\nHere are the seven questions Pate posed and how the answers unfolded in the conversation.\n\nPate opened with a broad question about the sport’s structure and enforceable rules. Trump began by saying, “It’s too bad. I hate to see it,” before pivoting to NFL kickoff rule changes. He never directly addressing college football governance.\n\nTrump responded by name-checking teams he “likes,” including Georgia and South Carolina, and praised quarterback Gunner Stockton, who was in the room. He then told the audience Pate had asked how he judges players, which he had not, leaving the original question unanswered.\n\nWhen asked what was discussed, Trump said their conversations are “always” about politics, contradicting Meyer’s prior claim that they discussed football.\n\nAfter briefly mentioning Miami and Indiana’s Curt Cignetti, Pate pivoted to hiring philosophy. Trump launched into a familiar monologue about instincts and staffing decisions.\n\nThe response centered on instincts. Trump then detoured into praise for Herschel Walker, calling him “maybe the greatest player ever.”\n\nThis led to reflections about the Lincoln Bedroom rather than football.\n\nThe final exchange remained general, touching only lightly on sports.\n\nMore:Donald Trump trends after failed Army-Navy coin toss\n\nAs Pate later explained, a planned 30-to 40-minute long interview was cut short due to a scheduling conflict.

    "description": "Fans should welcome the belief of sources on all sides that Harry Maguire will remain at Manchester United at least for next season, writes Simon Stone.",
    "fullText": "When Manchester United's squad arrived at Burnley for the first match of the post-Ruben Amorim era on 7 January, the major questions centred around the fitness of skipper Bruno Fernandes and whether interim boss Darren Fletcher would pick Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nHarry Maguire's presence in the travelling party at Turf Moor was something of a surprise.\n\nThe 32-year-old had been absent for nine matches with a thigh injury and there had been no real talk of a return.\n\nIn reality, Fletcher would only have called on United's one-time skipper in extreme circumstances that night. At that point, Maguire had barely even trained.\n\nBut Maguire did feature for 11 minutes four days later as he tried - unsuccessfully -to help rescue an FA Cup third round defeat by Brighton.\n\nFletcher was doing Michael Carrick a huge favour.\n\nDespite featuring just once in almost three months, it meant when Carrick took charge for the first time for Manchester City's visit to Old Trafford on 17 January, Maguire was wired into the mental demands of starting, even if his new boss admitted afterwards, physically, it was a step into the unknown.\n\n\"It was a big ask for H [Maguire],\" said Carrick.\n\n\"We can take for granted sometimes what players do. I'm not going to lie, it was a bit of a calculated gamble for how long he could play and if he could get through it because he's literally trained for two or three days in probably eight or nine weeks. It just shows you what it means to him.\"\n\nThe 'taking for granted' aspect of Carrick's answer was telling.\n\nThe former United and England midfielder knows the sacrifices needed to excel at the very highest levels of the game. He also knows the demands that are placed on players' bodies.\n\nBeyond his ability, it is the kind of attitude that meant he put himself forward to be involved at Burnley, which makes Maguire so valuable to United.\n\nIt is why, as they approach a summer when Casemiro's vast experience is going to be lost, it should be welcomed that multiple sources with an understanding of the situation believe a resolution will eventually be found to Maguire's contractual situation that will allow him to remain at Manchester United at least for next season.\n\nNothing is agreed yet. Until it is, there remains the potential for Maguire to either agree a deal with another club - which, under freedom of contract regulations, he is entitled to do - or United back away.\n\nCompromise is likely to be needed, on both salary - Maguire is one of United's highest-paid players and Sir Jim Ratcliffe is determined to drive costs down - and maybe contract length.\n\nBut through Burnley, Brighton, City and beyond Maguire played for every single minute of the four-match winning streak Carrick started his spell in charge with.\n\nThe England defender has shown just how valuable he is at a time when Matthijs de Ligt remains sidelined for an indefinite period with a back injury, with no immediate sign of return.\n\nMaguire does not only have experience and calmness. His communication is also crucial. He is demanding of those around him and is not scared to let team-mates know when they have fallen below the standards he expects.\n\nHis central defensive partnership with Lisandro Martinez has a familiarity about it too, which is a bit surprising given the pair have only started 16 times together in a two-man central defence since the Argentina international joined the Old Trafford outfit from Ajax in 2022.\n\nThe reasons for that are numerous. Amorim's formation for a start. Before that, Erik ten Hag clearly did not feel Maguire was the kind of player he wanted, while Martinez has suffered some pretty hefty injuries.\n\nThere is also the knowledge their first two games together were the defeats by Brighton and Brentford that started Ten Hag's reign.\n\nThey have won in 11 of the following 14 games they have started though, which suggests keeping them both fit could be the key to United's Champions League qualification quest.\n\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel has acknowledged Maguire's recent form, even though the defender won the last of his 64 caps nearly 18 months ago, against the Republic of Ireland in September 2024.\n\n\"Back in the picture,\" is how Tuchel described it at this month's Nations League draw.\n\nNot that many Manchester United fans will be too bothered about that.\n\nFor them, England's fortunes come a firm second to their own hopes of an upturn in results.\n\nMaguire probably thinks like that too.\n\nA veteran of England's last three major tournament campaigns, he knows excelling at a club like Manchester United can propel anyone into the international limelight.\n\nThere is also a feeling Maguire is happy in his surroundings too, that he is settled with his family in the north-west and has no aching desire to start again somewhere else just yet.\n\nHe hasn't spoken about his future much recently. But on current evidence, there is no reason to suggest he has changed his stance from when he spoke to BBC Sport, among others, on a club visit to a football camp in Stretford just after the Premier League campaign had started.\n\n\"Obviously I have something in my mind about what I want to do and where I want to be,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't want to put it out there to everybody but it's an amazing club to play for and you'd be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Eintracht Frankfurt’s sporting director Markus Krösche offered a nuanced assessment of the defeat against FC Bayern. The first half, in particular, gave the 43-year-old cause for concern.\n\n“You have to say that we had difficulties in the first half. Bayern were very dominant and we made too many simple mistakes and lost possession too easily,” Krösche explained. Nevertheless, the first two goals conceded came after a second ball and a set piece. “After that, it was important to go into halftime at 0-2.”\n\nAfter the break, Eintracht showed a marked improvement. “In the second half, we did much better, played better football, and were braver. The substitutions really gave us a boost,” said Krösche. It also became clear “what we have been lacking time and again in recent weeks and months.”\n\nAt the same time, the sporting director admitted that Bayern had slowed the tempo a bit after the break, but still created chances. Goalkeeper Kaua Santos, in particular, distinguished himself with several strong saves.\n\nAll in all, Krösche viewed the second half especially positively: “Overall, the second half was a step forward.” Despite the defeat, the Eintracht management sees signs of development – now it’s a matter of confirming this over the full 90 minutes.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are officially underway with their 2026 Spring Training games, and there are still plenty of questions to be answered before Opening Day. One lingering question from last season was whether the Braves would bring back Ozzie Albies. Braves GM Alex Anthopoulos didn’t make that decision clear during the 2025 season.\n\n“With all these options (on players), we always make the decision at the end of the year — you have five days after the World Series, and that’s when you make the decision. It’s just, things can happen, things change. You always wait,” Anthopoulos said.\n\nThe Braves ended their season in disappointment, but the organization was quick to resolve Albies’ future. They opted to bring back their fan favorite and the player who has consistently been the best at his position for the team.\n\n“The Braves are going to pick up their club option on infielder Ozzie Albies. The club hasn’t announced the decision yet, but president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos confirmed the move in a radio appearance, per Mark Zinno of 92.9 The Game,” Steve Adams wrote for MLB Trade Rumors.\n\nHowever, heading into the regular season, if Albies’ injuries continue, he could become a liability for the Braves.\n\n“Even really good players can become liabilities in one form or another. That doesn't take away from the player they were, but it should inform the Braves' decisions and fans' perception that some guys can't be trusted in certain roles anymore,” HTHB’s Eric Cole wrote. “It was kind of a fun bit for a few years there, where the national media just continually disrespected Ozzie Albies despite the fact that he was among the best second basemen in all of baseball. However, what first looked like just some rough injury luck has become a pattern, and it is now completely fair to call him injury-prone and wonder about his future with the Braves.”\n\nThe Braves are extremely grateful for what Albies has contributed to the organization, but his injuries have also put the team in difficult situations. This season is a must-prove year for the star infielder.\n\nIf Atlanta wants to be successful, they need Albies on the field. If he can’t stay healthy, he risks letting down the Braves faithful once again. There was once a time when it was believed the Braves would have no hesitation keeping Albies for his entire career, but injuries have cast uncertainty over that future.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United Women lost their first game since before Christmas to Chelsea in the FA Cup.\n\nIn spite of a fine effort, they were beaten 2-1 by their old rivals.\n\nHead coach Marc Skinner spoke to the club’s official website after the game and gave his thoughts on the performance.\n\nResponding to how he felt after the game, he stated, “Proud. Proud. So proud of the players. So proud of all the commitment. We’ve just played back-to-back-to-back games — travel away, travel at home — and to put in that performance epitomises everything we are. It epitomises our fans’ energy, our players’ energy. There’s something special about us, about this team.”\n\nHe also claimed that the loss “hurt”, but everyone could see how much the game meant to his players.\n\nSkinner also claimed that the defeat will be useful, as it “will feed us for the next games coming up.”\n\nThe manager also added that he feels his side should have had a penalty and that he is hoping his team will get more luck in the upcoming League Cup final against the same opponent.\n\nSkinner also revealed that his team changed shape and strategy during the match to try and take the win, but once again reiterated that it was his team’s effort that pleased him the most.\n\nHe claimed his team, “showed real commitment when things are against you and you can still fight. That shows special character. And if you’re at a special team like ours, that’s what you have to build.”\n\nComparing both teams, Skinner added that United have had to build more slowly and methodically over the years than Chelsea, but that they are finally getting to a place where they can compete.\n\nHe added, “the players we brought in this year have epitomised and galvanised the group and pushed us on to stronger things. We’ll come back from this stronger. We haven’t tasted defeat in a while, so it’s a little shock — but it gives us fresh impetus going into the next games.”\n\nA common theme in recent games has been the size of support that United have brought along to away games, both at home and in Europe.\n\nSpeaking on this issue, Skinner explained, “they’re the life force behind us — the golden thread in everything we try to do. Honestly, they mean the world to us.”\n\nFeatured image Maja Hitij via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "The Sporting Tribune's Arash Markazi reflects on his 25-year friendship with Jim Hill as the broadcasting legend celebrates 50 years of covering sports in Los Angeles.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES – Jim Hill wouldn’t want me to write this column, but this is one of the few times I must ignore the advice of a man I have looked up to for as long as I can remember watching sports in Los Angeles.\n\nOn Sunday, the Los Angeles Lakers unveiled a statue of Pat Riley, the head coach of the Showtime Lakers, in a ceremony attended by Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Byron Scott, Michael Douglas and Michael McDonald, among others. Lionel Richie even took his courtside seat before the Lakers played the Boston Celtics, as John Tesh’s “Roundball Rock” blared through the arena. If the party had leaned any further into the 1980s, it might have been drenched in neon and simulcast on MTV.\n\nThe ceremony took me back to my childhood, watching Jim cover the Showtime Lakers for KCBS 2 and KABC 7. This month, Jim is celebrating his 50th year covering sports in Los Angeles. Next month, I’ll turn 46. Nearly every memory I have of sports in this city — from the Lakers’ 11 NBA championships to the Dodgers’ ifve World Series titles since 1980 — is connected to Jim talking to players in the locker room after the game.\n\nThe only thing more surreal than covering the teams I grew up watching today is doing it alongside Jim and calling him a friend.\n\nI always dreamed of becoming a sportswriter in Los Angeles. At USC, I won the Allan Malamud Memorial Scholarship and the Jim Murray Memorial Scholarship, named after my two favorite Los Angeles Times columnists. Both Malamud and Murray died while I was a student at Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks. I never had the chance to meet them let alone cover a game alongside them.\n\nTelevision never felt attainable to me. I grew up with a stutter so severe that I would invent excuses to skip class on days when I had to present a book report. On the first day of school, when students were asked to stand and say their name, I would sometimes pretend I needed to go to the nurse’s office.\n\nI’ll never forget the first time I saw Jim as a member of the media before a 2001 Lakers-Clippers game at Staples Center. I was a USC student freelancing for SLAM magazine. We were seated next to each other. He slapped me on the knee like we were old friends and introduced himself, as if I didn’t already know exactly who he was.\n\nWe stayed in touch as my career evolved as I became a staff writer at Sports Illustrated, senior writer at ESPN and a columnist at the Los Angeles Times. At every step, Jim would put me on the air, making me more comfortable with a microphone and a camera representing thousands of households. The kid who once struggled to say his own name was suddenly talking sports with Jim Hill on CBS in Los Angeles.\n\nAs someone who grew up in Los Angeles watching Jim Hill, it was pretty cool co-anchoring Sports Central on CBS after the Lakers-Celtics game on Sunday. pic.twitter.com/jqTe5ze7p8\n\n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) February 25, 2020\n\nWhen I became an adjunct professor at USC, Jim was a regular guest speaker. I wanted my students to hear the same advice he once gave me: It’s all about relationships and hard work — and how inseparable the two are.\n\nThe contact list on Jim’s iPhone reads like a Hall of Fame program — legendary players and coaches, Academy Award-winning actors and directors, even a former United States president. But the relationships he nurtures daily are with beat writers and public relations directors across the city. While many anchors prefer the comforts of the studio, Jim has always preferred being in the thick of the action — at every game, every press conference, often seated in the front row, asking the first question.\n\nOne of the greatest honors of my career came during the 2020 World Series, when I was asked to fill in for Jim as the Dodgers faced the Tampa Bay Rays in Arlington, Texas. As thrilling as it was to watch the Dodgers win their first title since 1988, the celebration felt muted 1,500 miles from home during a global pandemic.\n\nWe made up for it in 2024 when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees to win the World Series less than a month after my wedding. After finishing our postgame interviews in the clubhouse, Jim poured a bottle of champagne over my head while on the air and wrapped me in a hug.\n\nHighlight of the night? Jim Hill pouring a bottle of champagne on me while on air. 😂🍾 pic.twitter.com/Q9Gl7oq4YO\n\n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) October 31, 2024\n\nSunday was a celebration of Pat Riley and the Showtime Lakers. But as I watched Jim work the room after the ceremony as the only member of the media who covered every championship that team won it felt like something more.\n\nIt felt like a celebration of 50 years of Jim Hill telling the story of Los Angeles sports — and, in so many ways, shaping the dreams of a kid who grew up watching him do it.",

    "fullText": "Everton host Manchester United at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Monday night, knowing this is a chance to reset the mood around their season.\n\nEverton started the weekend eighth in the Premier League table, firmly in the European conversation.\n\nStill, frustration is growing on Merseyside after six games without a win at home in all competitions. Another defeat under the lights would only worsen the unease.\n\nHowever, Everton have already beaten United once this season and will take confidence from that win when they welcome the resurgent Red Devils for this tantalising clash.\n\nEverton boss David Moyes returns to face his former club at a delicate time. The 2-1 home defeat to Bournemouth before the break was particularly galling.\n\nEverton were in control before eight chaotic minutes flipped the game. A chance to consolidate a European push slipped away.\n\nTheir home form is now a concern. They have lost five of their last nine Premier League matches on Merseyside, as many as in their previous 28.\n\nThe new 52,000-seat arena is yet to feel like a fortress.\n\nIn contrast, their away record has been excellent. It is the inconsistency at Hill Dickinson Stadium that is holding them back.\n\nMeanwhile, Man United arrive in very different spirits. Since Michael Carrick replaced Ruben Amorim, United have rediscovered rhythm and resilience.\n\nNo side has collected more points in 2026.\n\nA stoppage-time equaliser from Benjamin Sesko at West Ham United extended their unbeaten run and underlined a growing belief. United are playing with freedom again.\n\nEverton are looking to complete just their second Premier League double over Manchester United after 2013/14. But the Toffees must be wary.\n\nUnited have 19 away wins and 42 overall victories against Everton in the Premier League, more than any team has against another in the competition’s history.\n\nEverton have lost five of their last nine home league games (W2, D2) while United are unbeaten in their last nine top-flight matches (W5, D4), their longest such run since 2021.\n\nJake O’Brien is suspended following his red card against Bournemouth, forcing a reshuffle in defence.\n\nLong-term absentee Jack Grealish remains sidelined, but Seamus Coleman is back in contention and could return at right-back.\n\nMore likely, Moyes will roll with Scottish international (15-caps) Nathan Patterson at right-back. Tyrique George, 20, should retain his place in the attack.\n\nIdrissa Gueye is available despite his dismissal at Old Trafford, while Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall will be eager to haunt United again after scoring the winner in November.\n\nJordan Pickford; Nathan Patterson, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; Idrissa Gueye, James Garner; Tyrique George, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Iliman Ndiaye; Thierno Barry.",

    "title": "Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, February 22, 2026: Still low (from 5.86% to 6.01%)",
    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates. The 30-year rate is near three-year lows on a popular lender marketplace. Shop for your best rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nToday's mortgage rates are near multi-year lows. While Freddie Mac reported the current 30-year fixed home loan rate at 6.01% this week, the Zillow lender marketplace is reporting an average rate of 5.86%. Is it a good time to buy a house or refinance your mortgage? Shop multiple lenders and you'll see just how much rates can vary.\n\nMORE: Sub-6% offers nearly double: Mortgage lenders with the best rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to refinance your mortgage.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use. It also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate today is 5.86%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.41% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.\n\nLet’s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 5.86% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,772, and you’d pay $337,826 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.41% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,437. But you’d only pay $138,650 in interest over the years.\n\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\n\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\n\nRead more about fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\n\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\n\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\n\nLearn 6 tips for choosing a mortgage lender.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate for purchasing a home is 5.86%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.41%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.86% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI).\n\nAccording to January forecasts, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.10% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate near 6% through the end of the year.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing. Learn how to qualify for this limited-time rate discount.\n\nMortgage rates inched lower this week as an upbeat jobs report bumped the bond market slightly higher.",

Thanks to all of you for all of your support over the years. Thanks for the memories. Best Wishes. The Brewer's Art,\" the sign said.\n\nThe brewery owner did not state a reason for closing its business, but the Comptroller of Maryland had placed an $85,000 lien against The Brewer's Art on Dec. 12, 2025, WMAR reported.",

    "description": "Trump shares statement from Laura Loomer calling on president to kill Netflix deal",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reposted a message calling Michelle Obama a “racist” and ranted against a former high-ranking official in Barack Obama’s administration as he prepares to face Democrats in Congress at the State of the Union address.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Saturday, the president reposted a message from far-right activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer describing the former first lady as an “anti-white racist.” In his own caption, the president took aim at another Black woman in the same administration: former White House adviser Susan Rice.\n\nThreatening Netflix to fire Rice, who serves on the company’s executive board, Trump wrote: “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences.”\n\nLoomer’s post was must more extensive and urged the president to kill an upcoming merger between Warner Bros. and Netflix, which the far-right activist feared would expand the Obamas’ influence within both companies. The former president and his wife own a production company, Higher Ground Productions, which produces a variety of content on Neftlix’s platform.\n\nOf the Obamas, Loomer wrote: “[P]ositive messaging of the Democrats' upcoming witch hunts against Trump from Barack Hussein Obama ... and his anti-White racist wife Michelle ... would likely be blasted across all streaming services as the Obamas' Higher Ground Productions continues to grow within Netflix.”\n\nThe two posts came in response to Rice warning that companies seen as guilty of cozying up to the Trump administration would face consequences of their own if Democratic lawmakers retake the House and Senate in midterm elections this fall — along with the White House in 2028.\n\nShe made the comments on a podcast hosted by Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney fired by Trump during his first term.\n\n“If these corporations think that the Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to, you know, play by the old rules, and, you know, say, ‘Oh, never mind. We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted.’ I think they’ve got another thing coming,” Rice said.\n\nTrump’s apparent support for Loomer’s description of Michelle Obama as “racist” comes as he has continues to refuse to apologize for a scandal that enveloped him this month around the posting of a bizarre AI video from his Truth Social account depicting her and her husband as apes.\n\nThe racist depiction of the nation’s first Black president was immediately condemned by politicians on both sides of the aisle, forcing the White House to offer a defense, then walk it back entirely and delete the post.\n\nRepublicans on the Hill were clearly uncomfortable with the video and called its posting a mistake. Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate’s only Black Republican, called it racist.\n\nThe former president responded on a podcast, stating that “it's important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling.\n\nTrump has blamed the post on a staffer who has access his Truth Social account, Natalie Harp, whom he said did not watch the video fully before posting it to his account.\n\nIn a statement to reporters on Air Force One, Trump claimed to have watched part of the video and sent it to his team for review and a possible post on his account. He denied seeing the part of the video where the former president and former first lady appeared.\n\n“I gave it to the people, generally they’d look at the whole thing but I guess somebody didn’t and they posted it. And then we deleted it,” said Trump.\n\nThis isn’t the first time he’s taken content or advice directly from Loomer, either.\n\nThe far-right activist found herself with new access to the Oval Office in 2025 as Trump returned to the White House and used it to direct a purge of figures tied to Michael Waltz, then-Trump’s national security adviser, for supposed disloyalty.\n\nLoomer has also supported a loyalty-driven purge of officials across other parts of the government, with one notable victim being the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. His daughter, Maurene, was fired from the Department of Justice in July.\n\nThrough her constant, vitriolic attacks on Democrats, Loomer has faced her own accusations of racism, including in the fall of 2025, when she was widely condemned for hurling a racist slur at Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, whom she called a “ghetto Black B****.”",

    "description": "\"The body is metabolizing its own muscle tissue for energy,\" Prokopenko said.",
    "fullText": "Four years after Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s economy has entered a “death zone,” said Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nIn a recent Economist op-ed, the former Russian central bank adviser drew on a term from mountain climbing when high altitude forces the body to consume itself faster than it can repair itself.\n\nWhat is Russia's economic 'death zone'?\n\nWhat signs indicate Russia may face economic crisis?\n\nHow has the war impacted Russia's economic structure?\n\nWhy can't monetary policy fix Russia's economic problems?\n\n“Russia’s economy is stuck in what might be described as negative equilibrium: holding itself together while steadily destroying its own future capacity,” she wrote.\n\nThe economy isn’t headed for an imminent crash, but GDP has stagnated, oil revenue has been halved amid Western sanctions, and the government’s budget deficit is rapidly draining reserves.\n\nAt the same time, two economic systems have emerged. One is comprised of the military and related industries that receive priority from the Kremlin. And then there’s everything else that’s been “left in the cold,” Prokopenko explained.\n\n“The most dangerous feature of this new structure is the fuel it burns,” she added. “Russia’s economy now runs on what might be called ‘military rent’: budget transfers to defense enterprises that generate wages and economic activity.”\n\nBut the transfers are aimed at assets designed for destruction, Prokopenko pointed out. In other words, the money that keeps Russia’s factories humming pays for tanks, armored vehicles and other weapons that eventually get destroyed or damaged, making them useless for future economic growth.\n\nSimilarly, money spent to attract fresh recruits to Russia’s army doesn’t retrain them to become more productive. Instead, many die or return home permanently wounded. The Center for Strategic and International Studies has estimated Russian military casualties at 1.2 million, including 325,000 killed.\n\n“The body is metabolizing its own muscle tissue for energy,” Prokopenko said.\n\nWhile the central bank has cut interest rates to prop up growth and the Kremlin has taken steps to rein in the budget deficit, Russia’s economic predicament can’t be fixed with monetary or fiscal policies, she wrote.\n\nIn fact, interest payments on government debt this year are already set to exceed spending on education and health care combined.\n\nUnlike a cyclical downturn such as a recession, Prokopenko argued that what Russia is suffering from is more akin to altitude sickness—”the longer you stay, the worse it gets, regardless of rest.”",

    "fullText": "It has been exactly three weeks since Nancy Guthrie was reported missing. Law enforcement continues to pursue thousands of leads in the search for the 84-year-old Tucson, Arizona resident, who is presumed kidnapped.\n\nAuthorities have struggled to come up with a motive for someone abducting Guthrie. Now, a former FBI agent has shared his own possible theory on what motivated the suspected perpetrator.\n\nJonny Grusing, a 25-year veteran of the FBI's Denver Division, spoke with Fox News Digital this weekend regarding Guthrie's case.\n\nGoing off public information only, the longtime investigator and published author hypothesized that an unknown \"personal grievance\" may be the explanation for the kidnapping of Today co-host Savannah Guthrie's mother.\n\n\"It's hard to be an expert in human behavior because it's so unique to that person,\" said Grusing.\n\n\"You know, I'm just trying to use the experiences of different cases and trying to apply any sort of logic to this in the hopes that someone from the public who has thought it might be someone they know whether it's his family or whether now it's a coworker or friend or associate or whatever, to put that one puzzle piece together that says, 'Yes, and now I think it could be him.'\"\n\nGrusing cited a number of factors, including the actions of the subject in the surveillance video released by the FBI earlier this month.\n\n\"The first thing he does is with his glove, and with his glove, it doesn't look like he's trying to take [the camera] off,\" Grusing said. \"It looks like he's trying to cover it with his right hand.And then he looks down, he looks around, and he gets the branches, and he puts the branches up in front of it.\"\n\n\"Is there a chance, since we don't have audio, that he is either knocking on the door loudly or that he has pressed the ring doorbell, [that] he's trying to get Nancy to answer the door, and he's shielding himself from being seen as a masked person, so she will, in her confusion, open the door?\" Grusing continued.\n\nIf this is the case, Grusing said the situation would not fit the home robbery gone wrong theory, since the suspect seemingly wanted to lure Nancy Guthrie onto the porch for a confrontation.\n\nGrusing also said kidnapping for ransom seems unlikely since none of the ransom notes were sent directly to the Guthrie family.\n\nOn Saturday, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos issued an update on DNA found in Nancy's home, calling it \"mixed,\" meaning there is material from more than one individual.\n\nThis makes DNA testing more difficult when entering the findings through national databases.\n\n“Our lab tells us that there’s challenges with it,” Nanos said before reiterating that \"we're not quitting\" and his department remains steadfast in locating Nancy, who was last seen on Jan. 31.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's executive arm requested “full clarity” from the United States and asked its trade partner to fulfill its commitments after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down some of President Donald Trump’s most sweeping tariffs.\n\nTrump has lashed out at the court decision and said Saturday that he wants a global tariff of 15%, up from the 10% he announced a day earlier.\n\nThe European Commission said the current situation is not conducive to delivering \"fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial” trans-Atlantic trade and investment, as agreed to by both sides and spelled out in the EU-U.S. Joint Statement of August 2025.\n\nAmerican and EU officials sealed a trade deal last year that imposes a 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the United States. The European Commission handles trade for the 27 EU member countries.\n\nA top EU lawmaker said on Sunday he will propose to the European Parliament negotiating team to put the ratifying process of the deal on pause.\n\n“Pure tariff chaos on the part of the U.S. administration,” Bernd Lange, the chair of Parliament’s international trade committee, wrote on social media. “No one can make sense of it anymore — only open questions and growing uncertainty for the EU and other U.S. trading partners.”\n\nThe value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.\n\n“A deal is a deal,” the European Commission said. “As the United States’ largest trading partner, the EU expects the U.S. to honor its commitments set out in the Joint Statement — just as the EU stands by its commitments. EU products must continue to benefit from the most competitive treatment, with no increases in tariffs beyond the clear and all-inclusive ceiling previously agreed.\"\n\nHe said he talked to his European counterpart this weekend and hasn’t heard anyone tell him the deal is off.\n\n“The deals were not premised on whether or not the emergency tariff litigation would rise or fall,” Greer said. “I haven’t heard anyone yet come to me and say the deal’s off. They want to see how this plays out.”\n\nEurope’s biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits. Among the biggest U.S. exports to the bloc are professional and scientific services like payment systems and cloud infrastructure, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, aerospace products and cars.\n\n“When applied unpredictably, tariffs are inherently disruptive, undermining confidence and stability across global markets and creating further uncertainty across international supply chains,” the commission added.\n\nAs primarily a trading bloc, the EU has a powerful tool at its disposal to retaliate — the bloc’s Anti-Coercion Instrument. It includes a raft of measures for blocking or restricting trade and investment from countries found to be putting undue pressure on EU member nations or corporations.\n\nThe measures could include curtailing the export and import of goods and services, barring countries or companies from EU public tenders, or limiting foreign direct investment. In its most severe form, it would essentially close off access to the EU’s 450-million customer market and inflict billions of dollars of losses on U.S. companies and the American economy.",

    "description": "Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau described Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera as \"one of the bloodiest and most ruthless drug kingpins.\"",
    "fullText": "After spending years evading authorities worldwide, a powerful Mexican cartel leader was killed during a military operation, Mexican officials announced on Sunday, Feb. 22.\n\nNemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, commonly known as \"El Mencho,\" rose through the ranks and launched a deadly coup to become the leader of the Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG). The criminal enterprise rapidly grew into a continent-spanning empire that rivaled its former allies in the Sinaloa Cartel, run by kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who is serving life in prison.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. Department of State offered a $15 million reward for information leading to Oseguera's arrest and/or conviction. After reports of his death surfaced, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau described \"El Mencho\" in a social media post as \"one of the bloodiest and most ruthless drug kingpins.\"\n\nHere's what to know about the Mexican drug lord:\n\nHe was born Rubén Oseguera Cervantes on July 17, 1966, in the small farming city of Aguililla in the western state of Michoacán, according to The Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network. He later adopted the name Nemesio, some say to honor his godfather. It was shortened to \"El Mencho\" and has no other known meaning.\n\nA powerful drug kingpin with 5,000 members spread across every continent except Antarctica, Oseguera's brutal cartel is blamed for kidnappings, torture, murders, cannibalism, and the spread of fentanyl — which surpassed heroin as America’s deadliest illicit drug.\n\n\"More recently, CJNG operatives, allegedly under Oseguera Cervantes’ direction, were involved in assassination attempts of Mexican government officials,\" the State Department said in December 2024.\n\nTargeting 'The Last Frontier': Mexican cartels send drugs into Alaska, upping death toll\n\nUnlike some cartel leaders who inherited leadership positions from family dynasties, his parents were farm workers who carved out a living in Aguililla, a city of fewer than 20,000 people in Michoacán, known as the world's avocado capital. Oseguera dropped out of school after the sixth grade to pick avocados.\n\n\"El Mencho\" eventually made his way to Tijuana, the prominent border town for American tourists and feuding Mexican cartels. There, he grew his drug-smuggling business in San Diego. Court and prison records show he has entered the United States at least three times and was repeatedly deported.\n\nAfter being ordered to leave the area by another organization, \"El Mencho\" joined the police force in Tomatlán, a small city south of Puerto Vallarta in the western state of Jalisco.\n\nEventually, Oseguera returned to his native Michoacán, where he joined the Milenio Cartel, an entrenched criminal organization operating since at least the early 1990s. Milenio eventually tapped \"El Mencho,\" a skilled sicario — or assassin — to lead one of its cells in Guadalajara as a cartel lieutenant.\n\nAs Oseguera rose through the ranks of Milenio, he expected to be rewarded with the top position. But when some of the cartel’s leaders were arrested or killed in 2008 and 2009, \"El Mencho\" wasn't promoted.\n\nIncensed, Oseguera plotted revenge in 2009 and 2010 with others who were unhappy with Milenio’s new leadership and spearheaded a deadly coup. He emerged victorious in early 2011, and his new cartel was christened the Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación.\n\nOseguera controlled several key drug trafficking routes and hubs in Mexico and gave orders to the \"capo,\" or plaza boss, similar to a mafia lieutenant.\n\nHis cartel dominates much of Guadalajara and controls the outskirts of Jalisco, as well as other states such as Colima and Michoacán. CJNG has spread to most of Mexico's 32 states, with an increasing presence in Tijuana and Mexico City.\n\nAs the boss, \"El Mencho\" set the piso, or tax, that business owners and independent drug traffickers had to pay the capos for protection. Oseguera also assumed control of corrupt police officers and politicians.\n\n\"El Mencho's Jalisco New Generation Cartel was one of the biggest buyers of politicians and political campaigns, which has given it an enormous social base,\" Edgardo Buscaglia, an organized crime expert at Columbia University, told Reuters.\n\nOseguera was the lead defendant in a federal indictment returned in the District of Columbia in 2017, accusing him of leading a continuing criminal enterprise. He was also charged with conspiring to send large amounts of drugs into the United States and using firearms during these drug trafficking crimes.\n\nOseguera also faced meth trafficking charges from a 2013 federal indictment in Gulfport, Mississippi.\n\n'That level of violence is terrifying': Mexican cartel targets tranquil Puget Sound city\n\nDespite a $15 million bounty, Oseguera stayed on the move for years and dodged manhunts that began within a year of his rise to power in 2011. He was rarely seen, staying in remote compounds that made it harder for police to breach, and didn't do drugs or drink alcohol to avoid slip-ups, the Courier Journal reported in 2019.\n\nU.S. drug agents and Mexican authorities teamed to root out El Mencho’s hiding spots at least three times. Police raided his secret compounds in 2012 and 2018, but he escaped, the newspaper reported.\n\nAccording to the Courier Journal, the Mexican military also learned Oseguera's hiding spot and headed to get him in two military helicopters in May 2015. But his men shot down one of the helicopters with a Russian-made rocket-propelled grenade launcher.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 'El Mencho' killed in Jalisco, Mexico.

    "fullText": "There is no love lost between Christie Brinkley and President Donald Trump, and she is not even subtle about it.\n\nAfter the intentions of Trump's administration on environmental regulations relating to coal and mercury emissions made headlines, the author wasted no time in raising her voice, assigning the blame, and highlighting the negative impacts to ensue.\n\nOne thing Christie Brinkley will not do is watch in silence. She previously expressed her concerns about the issues with the environment when Donald Trump won the presidential elections in 2024.\n\nBrinkley seems distraught about the Trump administration's decision to ease pollution standards for limits on mercury from coal plants, and she has shared a piece of her mind. The author took to social media, writing that this environmental update is set to destroy lives.\n\nShe noted the pressing side effects that will occur, affecting the fragile population, on her Instagram Stories. \"Mercury causes deformities in babies and developmental disorders of the brain!\" she penned over a screenshot of the headline from Interval News.\n\nIn another slide, still on her stories update, she shared a quote which read \"'I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT TO DO TO THEM. I'M ALLOWED TO DESTROY THE COUNTRY.' -Donald Trump 2/20/26.\" To this, she added a footnote praising him for keeping up to the words in the quote.\n\n\"And I must say he is doing a good job of destroying the country,\" the model shared after stating that the regulations not only put babies at risk, but they target adults too, affecting their nervous systems and ultimately causing organ damage. Brinkley claims Trump's decision is at the expense of the citizens and stems from greed.\n\nWhile the Trump administration views rolling back the clean air regulations from an economic standpoint, public health groups and environmental agencies warn that the health of the masses will bear the brunt.\n\nThe announcement was made on Friday, February 20, 2026, stating that it will roll back clean air regulations limiting mercury and hazardous toxins from power plants. They shared that it will boost baseload energy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Environmental Protection Agency explained that easing the pollution standards would alleviate costs for utilities that run older coal plants.\n\nThe effectiveness of this move shines at a time when demand for power is massively increasing, with the expansion of data centers used for artificial intelligence.\n\nBrinkley particularly noted earlier that the administration has set out to undo the environmental protection regulations put in place by Joe Biden's administration. The Swimsuit model added that the effects on the climate and health will surely take a devastating turn as a result.\n\nThe Daily Mail shared that Brinkley wrote on social media, telling her followers that natural disasters and diseases will all intensify if the state of the planet is not placed at the top of a Scale of preference over profits for a handful of greedy corporations.\n\nShe acknowledged that while the effects of climate change are already being felt, working together in prioritizing the environment will go a long way to slow down or ultimately stop the blistering negative effects.\n\nBrinkley called for support from her online community, stating that nature does not have respect for race or skin color, as no one will survive without a healthy biodiverse environment.\n\nThe actress also admitted that the changes will not only affect the current population but also future generations as well. \"For the sake and well-being of our children, action is mandated,\" her words echoed.\n\nBig stars in the music industry like Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish endorsed Trump's opponent, Kamala Harris, during the 2024 presidential elections. After it was announced that Trump won, Eilish called his victory a \"war on women,\" seemingly referring to his take on female reproductive rights.\n\nQueen of Pop, Madonna, also expressed her views on the outcome of the election, uploading a photo on Instagram showing a cake with the words \"F-ck Trump,\" adding that she stuffed her face with it after the results were announced.\n\nMadonna also shared that she was \"trying to get her head around why a convicted felon, rapist, and bigot was chosen to lead the country because he's good for the economy?\"\n\nCardi B, along with other celebrities such as Christina Applegate and Lili Reinhart, also slammed his election win. The president also faced heat from the media as many voiced out their disappointment with the election results.\n\nBesides Brinkley's concerns with climate change and environmental regulations, she previously spoke out against Donald Trump, claiming that he had flirted with her when he was married to his first wife, Ivanna.\n\nBrinkley is all about effecting change in the environment and saving Mother Earth from devastating ruin. Still, an aspect of her life saw a painful nosedive, and it was not triggered by environmental destruction.\n\nIn her memoir \"Uptown Girl,\" released last year, she recounts the pain she went through when she discovered her fourth marriage had hit the rocks. She detailed how she discovered her ex-husband, Peter Cook, had cheated on her leading to the end of their eight-year marriage.\n\nThe Blast reported that she described the relationship as the \"most tortured relationship\" she ever had. It was revealed to her that her then-husband was having an affair with a teenage girl.\n\nUpon searching their family computer, she further discovered some incriminating proof and adult content, as well as several explicit photos. The shock she felt was overwhelming when her eyes were met with the truth, and she ultimately decided the union could not continue.\n\nWill Christie Brinkley's voice cause a positive turnaround for the environment?",

    "fullText": "SEOUL, Feb 23 (Reuters) - South Korea has asked the Russian embassy in Seoul to take down a large banner ‌reading \"Victory will be ours\", its foreign ministry said, just ahead ‌of this week's fourth anniversary of the start of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe ministry ​said in a statement on Sunday that it had conveyed its concerns to the embassy without clarifying whether it had received a response.\n\nThe roughly 15-metre (49.21 ft) banner, in the colours of the Russian flag ‌and written in Russian, ⁠was hung on the embassy's outer wall in central Seoul ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia's invasion ⁠of Ukraine on Tuesday.\n\nThe banner remained in place on Monday.\n\nIn its statement, the ministry reiterated South Korea's position that Russia's invasion of Ukraine ​is illegal.\n\nThe ​ministry also said that military ​cooperation between Russia and North ‌Korea should stop, describing it as a grave threat to South Korea's security and a violation of the U.N. Charter and U.N. Security Council resolutions.\n\nEarlier this month, Russian Ambassador to South Korea Georgy Zinoviev praised what he described as North Korean troops' role in fighting ‌in Russia's Kursk region, according to ​media reports.\n\nUnder a mutual defence pact with ​Russia in 2024, North ​Korea sent some 14,000 soldiers to fight alongside Russian ‌troops against Ukraine, where more ​than 6,000 of ​them were killed, according to South Korean, Ukrainian and Western sources.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Seoul could not immediately be reached for ​comment by phone. ‌An automated voice message stated the embassy was closed due ​to a public holiday on Monday.",

    "description": "When Lisa Lucas and her husband told their kids about the plan to travel, the youngest daughter cried. They promised it would only be a year.",
    "fullText": "We were racing to keep up with our packed family schedule. Days blurred into school, work, gymnastics, birthdays, and dinner parties — energizing in theory, exhausting in reality. We were scraping by.\n\nI remember peak multitasking: listening to my 6-year-old read aloud while making breakfast, and trying to finish putting on eyeliner while the eggs finished cooking in the pan.\n\nMy husband and I longed for wide-open days to actually connect, but school holidays were never long enough to decompress. We could see how easily the years might slip by, buried in logistics, until suddenly the kids were packing for college.\n\nWe wanted to freeze time. So we hatched a plan to leave our \"normal\" life for a year and have a wild adventure together as a family.\n\nIn July 2024, we rented out our London home, stored our belongings, and took the bus to Heathrow with two backpacks and a carry-on.\n\nWe weren't wandering aimlessly. We planned to live in three locations, traveling for five weeks before and after each stop.\n\nI pivoted my marketing consultancy toward travel writing and speaking, while my husband's academic research guided our shortlist of places we wanted to live. His research enabled legal residency which allowed the girls to attend school. We chose Japan, the US, and the Netherlands, staying three to four months in each.\n\nWe picked Tsukuba, Japan, to immerse ourselves in a completely unfamiliar culture; Great Neck, New York, near where we're both from, to give our daughters a taste of American life and spend rare time with family; and Leiden, the Netherlands, to experience its bike- and water-centered lifestyle.\n\nResidency came with a lot of admin.\n\nFor Japan, we had originally planned to homeschool. Our 8-year-old surprised us by asking to attend a local Japanese school, despite only knowing a few phrases she had picked up during the three weeks we spent traveling around the country.\n\nThe school welcomed both girls. Like their classmates, they walked to school alone, changed into indoor shoes, helped serve lunch, and cleaned the classrooms.\n\nIn New York, we lived with family outside the city. The girls rode a yellow school bus for the first time, while my husband commuted by train. It was a stark contrast to London — no uniforms, more complicated mornings, and the sobering reality of active-shooter drills.\n\nIn Leiden, the girls attended a small international school. Students biked along canals and tended their own garden plots as part of a Dutch gardening program.\n\nLiving out of backpacks forced minimalism. I loved escaping the endless to-do list of home life and focusing on actually living.\n\nI wore a single black maxi dress almost every day in Asia — biking through alleys or hiking through the jungle — and it somehow worked.\n\nIf anything, I'd bring even less next time. With fewer possessions, our mental bandwidth expanded. We could focus on fun, without guilt.\n\nWhen we first told the girls about our plan, our youngest cried. They loved their friends, their teachers, and the rhythm of school. They couldn't imagine leaving and not coming back. We tried tempting them with volcanoes and snorkeling in Indonesia.\n\nThey came around, somewhat. They loved most moments, but they also always wanted to go home. We promised it would only be a year.\n\nOur priority was making them feel safe and secure. We talked about adaptability as a life skill, but we also held them close and reminded them they were loved.\n\nMost days, we'd say, \"We're still on the trip,\" and it made us feel like a team. The girls learned how to be the new kid, make friends, and settle into unfamiliar rhythms. They learned you can reinvent your life more than once.\n\nThe intensity bonded us. We had waterfalls to ourselves, watched wild snow monkeys, and made friends who invited us to visit them in Cozumel. I celebrated my usually grim January birthday on a Thai beach.\n\nIn the US, we were present for heavy family moments, including my grandfather's passing.\n\nReturning to London after 13 months felt surreal. Our 6-turned-7-year-old kissed the ground at Heathrow.\n\nThe trip changed us. It gave us shared memories — Hokkaido cream, a road trip from New York to Miami, sunsets from an Alpine hut — but more importantly, it clarified what matters: slow time together, not renovations or packed calendars.\n\nWe're happy to be home, blender included. But we're already dreaming about our next extended adventure.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share? Get in touch with the editor: akarplus@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "An AI product manager who worked at a Chinese tech giant explains what makes Chinese AI different from the West.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yilin Zhang, an AI product manager at AI startup Kuse who worked at Meituan for more than three years. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.\n\nI graduated from Tsinghua University with a master's degree in computer science in 2021 and then joined Meituan — one of China's biggest tech firms — as a product manager.\n\nAt Meituan, China's platform for local services, especially known for food delivery, I worked on two AI projects. One was a consumer-facing AI assistant that helps users complete various tasks, including ordering food. The other was a merchant-facing AI agent designed to help businesses manage their daily operations, including handling reservations, managing orders, and supporting routine operational tasks.\n\nThe main difference between how products are built in China and in the US comes down to the market.\n\nAcross most large Chinese tech companies, AI product development accelerated more aggressively around 2025.\n\nThe AI initiatives I worked on at Meituan started around April or May of that year. It coincided with the surge of interest around DeepSeek, when attention around AI agents took off.\n\nLarge companies began racing to build AI projects, and almost every business unit launched its AI initiative.\n\nFor a long time, especially before 2021 or 2022, Chinese tech companies were primarily focused on domestic competition rather than overseas expansion. Because competition in China is intense, tech companies were forced to become extremely efficient. Their execution methods have been sharpened to an almost frightening degree.\n\nConstraints have also pushed Chinese AI companies to pursue different paths, with a strong focus on open-source models and cost efficiency. These limitations forced exploration in new directions, and those paths have proven valuable in their own way.\n\nDeepSeek is a good example. Because of international restrictions, it couldn't access large numbers of GPUs and was forced to innovate around efficiency instead.\n\nChinese and overseas markets are fundamentally different, leading to distinct user bases, expectations, and product designs.\n\nChinese users have a much lower willingness to pay for software; hence, many mass-market AI products, such as Doubao, tend to be free. The core objective is often to scale active usage.\n\nMany capabilities are packaged into a single prompt you can ask, essentially a chatbox interface with a low barrier to entry.\n\nInternational AI products target users doing high-value tasks. They are more often designed for desktops than for mobile devices, with interfaces better suited to work contexts. These products explore how AI and humans can collaborate and intersect across different work scenarios, helping users complete tasks more effectively and efficiently.\n\nIn China, that user group is relatively small. That makes it harder for its mainstream AI products to move beyond chat-based forms into more advanced products.\n\nChina's internet success over the past decade has also largely come from consumer-facing apps. That environment forces product managers to obsess over user feedback and relentlessly polish even the smallest features.\n\nTeams may spend enormous effort refining a tiny feature just to win over a small group of users. In markets with less competition, that level of detail isn't always necessary.\n\nAfter three to four years at Meituan, I felt I had learned most of what I could from that environment. I left to join the AI startup Kuse in October.\n\nAI is evolving extremely fast. In large companies, iteration speed can be slower. Many of my friends across different Big Tech companies share this same frustration. Smaller, more agile companies can adapt faster.\n\nIn the past, top graduates had basically two paths: becoming a civil servant or joining a Big Tech company.\n\nThat's changing. Especially over the past year, many AI startups have emerged, and more young people are choosing entrepreneurship. AI has created a new path outside Big Tech.\n\nDo you have a story to share about working in a Chinese tech company? Contact this reporter at cmlee@insider.com.",

    "description": "Greg Kitzmiller was researching places to live with his wife and found out that Panama had a special visa for retirees.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Greg Kitzmiller, a 64-year-old American retiree living in Panama. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born and raised in Michigan, where I met my wife, Jen, and where we built our life together.\n\nIn 2016, I retired from my job as a manufacturing supervisor. My wife retired from her law career over a year later.\n\nThe year before she retired, my main goal was to find a place where we could live the best life during our retirement. I did a lot of research on various countries, and Panama kept coming to the top of the list.\n\nWe were eager to escape the snow, so my first priority was eternal summer. We also wanted to stay close to the US to make traveling back easy. The fact that Panama uses the US dollar only added to its appeal.\n\nWe hadn't spent our whole lives planning to retire abroad, but after watching HGTV shows, we both thought that this was something we could do.\n\nPanama also offers a special Pensionado visa for retirees, which comes with incentives such as discounts on utility bills, medication, and even transportation.\n\nBefore making the move, we took a few exploratory trips to Panama. Our first trip was a weeklong in October 2017. After my wife retired, we came back in February 2018 for a nine-week trip, touring different areas to see if it felt like the right fit.\n\nDuring that trip, the weather was beautiful. When we went home to Michigan and saw the snow on our driveway, my wife turned and said to me, \"We're moving, right?\" And I said, \"Yeah, we are.\"\n\nWe sold our house quickly. We held a few garage sales, donated what we didn't need, and fit our lives into five suitcases. In June 2018, we officially moved to Panama.\n\nWe have two daughters in Texas and one in Alabama. We're no further from them now than we were in Michigan. Moreover, the world has gotten so small. We can get on a video call with the kids and the grandkids anytime.\n\nWith the help of a real-estate agent, we bought our two-bedroom condo for $210,000 in Coronado, which is about an hour and a half from Panama City by car.\n\nOur condo is in a country club community, where the golf course wraps around our building, and we have 180-degree views of the ocean and the mountains.\n\nEven though I've joined several Facebook groups, it's the people we met at church that make up the core of our social circle.\n\nWhen we started talking about moving here, one of Jen's friends at work said, \"Well, you should write a blog.\"\n\nIt wasn't that easy, since I'm not very tech-savvy, but I did it. I still maintain the blog and publish a newsletter. And, right after we got here, I connected with a writer's group.\n\nBeing a part of that group led me to do a lot of things in my retirement that I never thought I would do.\n\nI published my first book in 2020 about our experience of retiring in Panama. Since then, I've started writing in different ways, including a detective fiction series — I'm working on the fourth installment.\n\nWriting wasn't something I expected to do in my retirement, but there's a strong community of artists, authors, and musicians here. When you surround yourself with other people who are talented in those ways, it fosters your own talent.\n\nOur health is better, too. It helps that there is always an abundance of fresh fruit and vegetables around.\n\nIf I had it to do over, I would've learned Spanish when I was young. When you're in your 60s, it's hard to learn a new language. I almost always understand what's being said, but don't verbalize very well, unlike my wife, who is fluent.\n\nEvery day's a little different. We have a few social groups, including one where we play dominoes every week. We rotate between houses, someone makes lunch, and we spend the afternoon playing.\n\nInitially, we figured we'd come for 10 years and then evaluate if we wanted to stay. It's only been eight years, but we've already decided that this is where we want to be.\n\nWe're not planning to move back to the US. There's honestly not much we miss.\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city? Contact this reporter at agoh@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Mikaela Shiffrin, 30, may be a three-time Olympic gold medalist, but there was a time when just hearing the name of the Games felt overwhelming.\n\nOn Friday's episode of \"Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce,\" Shiffrin said getting ready for one of the biggest competitions in sports took years of work, much of it away from cameras and crowds.\n\n\"My Olympic experiences have been so wildly different. Now it's four, and I'm really aware, right now, of all of the work that's gone into — actually, not the medal — but the work that's gone into showing up on race day, and being able to show up with the mentality and the skiing that I wanted to do,\" Shiffrin told podcast host Kylie Kelce.\n\nThe grind continued even away from the slopes, she said, especially when it came to managing the pressure that comes with the Games.\n\n\"Even this summertime, the amount of conversations I had with my psychologist talking about all the different feelings surrounding the Olympics, and like desensitizing to the word, and imagining the vibe, imagining the colors,\" Shiffrin said.\n\nShe added that she even visited Paris two summers ago to get a feel for the Olympic atmosphere and \"desensitize\" herself to it.\n\nNot only that, Shiffrin has structured her life around staying physically and mentally ready at all times.\n\n\"There's just so much life outside of the sport, but we do so much of our life, you know, it's all geared towards the sport,\" Shiffrin said, adding that she hasn't had alcohol in two years because it tends to make her sick.\n\n\"And I'm like, I can't afford to be sick, literally ever. So, we're just going to not have any alcohol. Like, we're going to drink electrolytes, man,\" Shiffrin said.\n\nIt still throws her off that something she's trained for over years can be decided in seconds.\n\n\"But you spend so much time doing all of this work and training for something, and then the moment it happens is, you know, 47 seconds, or like in the blink of an eye, and it's just really weird,\" she said.\n\nShiffrin is widely considered the greatest alpine ski racer of all time, with 108 World Cup wins. She made her Olympic debut at the 2014 Sochi Games at age 18, winning her first Olympic gold in slalom and becoming the youngest athlete in history to do so.\n\nOn Wednesday, nearly a decade later, she earned another gold medal in slalom — her first Olympic victory since 2018.\n\nThis isn't the first time Shiffrin has spoken about the steps she takes to stay focused.\n\nSpeaking to WDSU News on Friday, she said she deliberately avoided social media in the lead-up to her races at the Winter Olympics.\n\n\"If I was scrolling my feed or something, I just knew I was going to come across things that would get into my brain that would be not at all conducive to the experience that my team and I came for,\" Shiffrin said.\n\nOn Saturday, she told NBC Sports that she chose not to \"set expectations\" for herself heading into the Milan Cortina Games — a mindset she said ultimately helped her ski her best.\n\n\"On race day, I felt like I skied my best skiing, and that was really my goal,\" she said.",

    "title": "The 'Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' finale just blew up Dunk and Egg's biggest secrets",
    "description": "The season 1 finale of \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" implies that Dunk may not be a knight, and that Egg has been lying. Both are changes from the book.",
    "fullText": "Spoilers ahead for \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" season one, episode six, \"The Morrow,\" and the book \"The World of Ice & Fire.\"\n\nHBO's \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" stuck the landing on Sunday after a highly praised first season.\n\nThe prequel show, which was meticulously adapted from George R. R. Martin's \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" series, managed to toe the line between faithfully bringing Martin's characters to the screen and adding a few new twists.\n\nThat was especially true of the season one finale, \"The Morrow,\" which features several key scenes that don't exist in Martin's original novella \"The Hedge Knight\" — two of which have major implications for the show's plucky duo and their many adventures to come.\n\n\"The Morrow\" includes a flashback to Dunk's recent past, when he was a squire for Ser Arlan of Pennytree.\n\nAs Arlan is propped against a tree, pale and babbling and apparently dying, Dunk asks, \"Why did you never knight me? Did you think I'd leave you? I wouldn't have. Or was it something else?\" He doesn't get an answer.\n\nThe scene is filmed in the same place as the season opener — on the hillside where Dunk buries Arlan's body.\n\nBook readers have long suspected that Dunk is lying about his knighthood. He tells people that Arlan knighted him just before he died, with \"only a robin, up in a thorn tree\" to bear witness. When Dunk tries to enter the jousting tournament at Ashford Meadow, he's told to find a lord or another knight to vouch for him, but no one can verify his claim. Hardly anyone even remembers that Arlan existed.\n\nPrivately, Dunk struggles with his identity and how he presents himself to the world. In \"The Hedge Knight,\" after it's revealed that Egg is a Targaryen prince in disguise, Dunk is shocked and embarrassed for having been deceived, but he also feels a twinge of compassion and solidarity: \"He knew what it was like to want something so badly that you would tell a monstrous lie just to get near it.\"\n\n\"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" showrunner Ira Parker told Business Insider that he wanted the scene to be up for interpretation.\n\n\"A lot of the exposition around whether or not Dunk was knighted is internal thoughts in his head. And we get pretty, pretty close to him coming out and just saying it. It's just like, what else could he be thinking of? What else could he mean by this?\" Parker explained. \"But it's not said in black and white.\"\n\nThroughout season one, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" drops subtle hints that Dunk was only ever a squire — that he's lying to give himself a fighting chance at a better future. When he meets Egg in the premiere, the boy tells him plainly, \"You don't look to be a knight.\" In episode four, Dunk hesitates when Raymun Fossoway asks to be knighted so he can fight in Dunk's Trial of Seven.\n\n\"Go on, Ser Duncan,\" Lyonel Baratheon urges. \"Any knight can make a knight.\"\n\nStill, Dunk doesn't draw his sword to fulfill the request. Is that because he doesn't want his friend to die in a dangerous trial by combat? Or because he doesn't know the words to recite if he never heard them himself? (\"In the name of the warrior, I charge you to be brave. In the name of the father, I charge you to be just,\" etc.) It's also possible that Dunk doesn't want to risk Raymun's honor with a knighting ceremony by a fake knight.\n\nDuring his loaded pause, Lyonel gives Dunk a searching look, but these questions remain unasked.\n\nParker said he made sure to preserve the ambiguity surrounding Dunk's knighthood, which is \"100% the way George would like it.\"\n\nIn the finale's flashback scene, just when it seems like Arlan is gone forever, he startles awake. We never actually watch the old man die, so it's still possible that he knighted Dunk offscreen.\n\n\"It is just as wide open as it ever was,\" Parker said. \"So that was very important to maintain, but also — it's just fun. And I know fans of the book are going to be thinking about that question, so we're just trying to enjoy ourselves as much as possible with it. And it's a little bit of a tease.\"\n\nThe irony, of course, is that Dunk is a truer knight than most, even if he never took the sacred vows. He's brave and just, and he risks his own life to protect the innocent — quite unlike the dishonesty and bloodthirst of his Trial of Seven opponents. These characters ask us to consider what real honor looks like in a place like Westeros, and to question the substance of titles like \"ser,\" \"lord,\" and even \"prince.\"\n\nAfter the Trial of Seven is over, Egg's father, Maekar, asks Dunk to pledge himself to House Targaryen and return with their family to Summerhall. He says that Egg has grown fond of Dunk and wishes to serve as his squire.\n\nDunk offers instead to bring Egg on his travels. He believes that growing up among smallfolk rather than servants will help Egg learn compassion and humility.\n\nNaturally, Maekar says no. He's not about to let his youngest son, the latest in a long line of royal Aegons, wander around Westeros with only a hedge knight to protect him. \"Princes are not made for sleeping in ditches and eating hard salt beef,\" he tells Dunk in the book.\n\nDunk counters that Egg's older brothers, who are known as Daeron the Drunken and Aerion the Monstrous, never slept beneath the stars or ate less-than-perfect food. Maekar leaves without saying another word.\n\nThen, as Dunk is readying his horses to leave Ashford, Egg suddenly reappears.\n\n\"My lord father says I am to serve you,\" Egg says, and they ride off together, heading south toward Dorne.\n\nWhy and when does Maekar have a change of heart? In the book, it remains a mystery, but the show offers a plainer explanation: He didn't.\n\nThe final scene of the episode shows Maekar riding away from Ashford with the rest of the Targaryens. When he realizes Egg is nowhere to be seen, he begins panicking and shouting for his son.\n\nParker said he created the scene because it makes sense for the character of Egg. \"[The story] started by him sneaking off and getting into trouble. And of course, he just goes and he does the same thing, because we all make the same mistakes over and over and over again, and then we die.\"\n\nAs for Maekar, the added scene reflects his stubbornness as a father and his pride as a Targaryen.\n\n\"He's just a curmudgeon, and probably a shitty father, but I actually do think he really does love his children. I do think he cares about them, even though he's not able to raise them well, he still wants to,\" Parker said of Maekar. \"The idea of letting Egg go off with someone else just felt like too much for me. It felt like he could reasonably say no in this moment, even though he knows it would be better for Egg.\"\n\nAlthough the show's version of events doesn't directly contradict the book, it does add a troubling wrinkle to Egg's family lore. Maekar eventually becomes king of Westeros, and he may not take kindly to Dunk's absconding with his heir. He may even misinterpret the event as a treasonous kidnapping.\n\n\"We'll never be in Maekar's POV, but this will rear its head at some point,\" Parker hinted for future seasons. \"Many ways were discussed about how to deal with this. Hopefully, people like the way we've chosen.\"\n\nThe second season of \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\" adapted from Martin's \"The Sworn Sword,\" is slated for a 2027 release.",

    "description": "Tariffs have already added roughly 0.7% to core inflation through January.",
    "fullText": "Don't expect prices at the store to fall just because the Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nAt best, companies may slow the pace of future price hikes on goods that get tariff relief. But they're unlikely to cut prices outright, economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note published Sunday.\n\n\"We would not expect companies to lower prices in response to tariff reductions nearly as quickly as they increased them in response to tariff increases,\" the economists wrote.\n\nThe bank estimates tariff passthrough has already lifted core Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, by about 0.7% through January. It expects only an additional 0.1% increase over the rest of 2026.\n\nFriday's 6-3 Supreme Court ruling scrapped tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The White House quickly announced a 10% Section 122 tariff and then raised it to 15% the next day.\n\nThe shift would bring the increase in the effective tariff rate since the start of 2025 down from just over 10 percentage points to about 9 percentage points, Goldman estimates, leaving its inflation outlook little changed.\n\nOn economic growth, Goldman said imports from countries that see meaningful tariff reductions, particularly China, should rebound in the coming months.\n\nBut that likely won't give the economy much of a lift. Any rebound in imports from China would be offset by companies restocking shelves after earlier frontloading, trade reshuffling, and small declines in imports from higher-tariff countries.\n\nGoldman estimates first-quarter 2026 GDP growth at 3.4%, though that includes a temporary boost from the end of the 2025 government shutdown. It continues to forecast 2.5% growth by the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nFriday's ruling also sets up a fight over roughly $180 billion in tariffs already collected.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday it was \"unlikely\" Americans would ever see refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said during a speech before the Economic Club of Dallas, adding that the administration has other tools to reimpose tariffs and that sorting out any repayment could take years.",

    "description": "While Shield AI is looking into weapons for the V-BAT, the world's best militaries already have a slew of other strike options, Brandon Tseng told BI.",
    "fullText": "Brandon Tseng, Shield AI's cofounder, said there's a common misconception about his company's signature software-powered drone: People say it needs to be armed.\n\nThe more experienced militaries who work with Shield AI, however, know they don't need that capability in modern war, Tseng told Business Insider.\n\n\"Who doesn't ask for that? The US military doesn't ask for that because we understand joint fires. The Ukrainians don't ask for it anymore, either,\" said the former Navy SEAL, who is Shield AI's president.\n\nThe V-BAT, a vertical takeoff and landing drone that uses artificial intelligence to fly in jammed environments, has primarily been used for intelligence and reconnaissance missions in high-profile conflict zones such as Ukraine. Shield AI said the V-BAT flew over 200 missions there in 2025.\n\nThe drone is still meant to be a multi-mission platform, Tseng said, and Shield AI has been exploring ways to mount weapons on it. The firm announced a partnership last month with South Korean arms manufacturer LIG Nex1 to equip the V-BAT with six-pound guided missiles.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, look: I describe V-BAT as a mini predator, reaper drone,\" Tseng said. \"That's the mission it's doing, which is: It's finding targets. And it's hard to find targets, you have to be out there for a long period of time.\"\n\nTo be fair, the MQ-9 Reaper is also commonly equipped with missiles.\n\nHowever, Tseng said sophisticated militaries already have a vast array of other weapons that can turn the V-BAT's intel into a precision strike.\n\n\"If you have been in these combat zones, the US allies who fought closely with us in Afghanistan, they do not ask for organic fires on board the V-Bat,\" Tseng said. \"Because everybody is so used to just saying: 'Okay, I have a targeting package. What fires asset do I have lined up? Is it a one-way attack drone? Is it HIMARS? Is it artillery? Is it an SM-6? SM-3?\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter. You can find weapons,\" he added. \"The weapons are available. You need, actually, more intelligence.\"\n\nThis was a framework that Ukraine still needed to improve when the V-BAT began spotting targets there in early 2024, Tseng said. The drone is meant to fly for over 13 hours and be easily deployable, requiring a two-person launch crew and no runway.\n\nTseng said that while Ukraine excelled in tactical drone warfare, its troops weren't used to having a long-range asset that could spot targets for regular strategic attacks as the US military did.\n\n\"The strategic effects would happen, but they would be rare,\" he said. \"They'd be very, very deliberately planned operations, very expensive operations, things like what they did to the Russian runways with sending quadcopters deep into Russia via trucks.\"\n\nUkrainian drone teams would use the V-BAT to find important targets, such as Russian S-300 and S-400 air defense systems, only to realize they hadn't linked up with the right teams to strike them, Tseng said.\n\n\"We'd say: 'Why didn't you guys have these weapons lined up?' They'd say: 'Oh, well, we didn't think to coordinate,'\" Tseng said.\n\nSince then, Kyiv's forces have been using intelligence from V-BATs to carry out strikes with systems such as one-way attack drones or US-made HIMARS, Tseng said.\n\n\"There was a lot of learning over the past year for the Ukrainians,\" he added.",

Just because there is no player from north Wales, every pro on tour is from south Wales.\n\n\"So it doesn't really feel like a home event for us in all honesty.\"\n\nPage, who reached the quarter-finals last year in Llandudno, added that he is looking forward to the tournament despite its location.\n\n\"It is a great venue, I like playing there and there should definitely be an event there, a big event, I just don't think it should be the Welsh Open,\" Page added.\n\n\"It is still in Wales, so the fans still get behind you so I am looking forward to it, but it is a bit gutting for us south Walians that there is nothing down here for us to play in.\n\n\"Hopefully there will be more tournaments coming soon and we get something down here.\"\n\nPage's quest for Welsh Open glory was ended by former world champion Luca Brecel in 2025.\n\nThe Welshman was beaten 5-2 by the Belgian in the quarter-finals, ending his best run in the competition to date.\n\nAnd the pair now meet in the first round of the 2026 Welsh Open, with Page eyeing revenge against the 30-year-old.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to it,\" said Page.\n\n\"Luca beat me in the quarter-finals last year, so I owe him one in a way.\"\n\nPage came to prominence in the Welsh Open as a 15-year-old in 2017, beating Jason Weston and John Astley before losing to Judd Trump in the third round.\n\nAnd while Page says he is yet to reach the heights he had dreamed of as a teenager, he still believes he can turn things around.\n\n\"I've done alright but I'm nowhere near where I want to be, I want to be the best and I still think I can do it,\" said Page.\n\n\"I've had a pretty bad season, it's not been very good, so I need to kick on.\n\n\"Obviously last year was a great year, so I'm trying to turn it around to get confidence in myself and perform like I know I can.\n\nThe 2026 Welsh Open begins on Monday, 23 February, with the tournament running until the final on Sunday, 1 March.\n\nMatches are available to watch on the BBC Sport website, BBC iPlayer and live on BBC Two Wales - with the final shown on BBC One Wales.\n\nThere is also highlights from the best of each day's action on BBC Two Wales every evening.\n\nAll matches are best-of-seven frames until the quarter‑finals, at which stage the games become best-of-nine.\n\nThe semi‑finals will be the best-of-11, and the final will be best‑of‑17.\n\nThe winner will scoop a top prize of £100,000, with the runner-up winning £45,000.\n\nMark Williams [5] vs Michael Holt\n\nJak Jones [16] vs Liam Highfield\n\nNeil Robertson [4] vs Michal Szubarczyk\n\nKyren Williams [3] vs Liu Hongyu\n\nStuart Murphy [7] vs Chang Bingyu\n\nJackson Page [30] vs Luca Brecel\n\nXiao Guodong [9] vs Long Zehuang\n\nZhao Xintong [2] vs Fan Zhengyi",

    "fullText": "England went from bad to disastrous, France didn't fire on all cylinders but had enough to maintain their Grand Slam challenge, Scotland dug deep for a big win and Ireland were just tremendous.\n\nHere are five players who provided talking points in the third round of the Six Nations, with a two-week break to come before round four...\n\nThe opportunity and ability for teams to rewrite their own narratives in the space of just a few weeks is part of what makes the Six Nations so compelling.\n\nLacklustre and outgunned in Rome in week one, Scotland are now France's biggest challengers after following up the Calcutta Cup demolition of England with a nailbiting, nerve-wrenching win in Wales.\n\nThe hosts were 23-12 up with just over 20 minutes to go but Scotland roared back to win 26-23 after some brilliant quick thinking from fly-half Finn Russell.\n\nHe switched the momentum of the match with a kick that caught Wales out and allowed Darcy Graham to score in the corner. Yet again, the Bath number 10 was the difference-maker.\n\n\"Big-game players turn up when it matters and Russell had moments when he bailed Scotland out,\" former Wales captain Sam Warburton told BBC Rugby Special.\n\n\"He was exceptional at managing the team when they were down in the game. He waits for the perfect moment to get involved.\n\n\"He plays what he sees, he has that licence and his clutch kicking was immense. The big-game player rocked up in the last 30 minutes, he was immaculate and a big part of the comeback.\"\n\n\"Scotland found a way to win ugly,\" added their former flanker John Barclay.\n\n\"They found solutions and ground their way in. In some ways that was the most important win they have had in a while. It has given them a strong position in the table.\"\n\nUp next? France at Murrayfield on Saturday, 7 March, and the chance to end Les Bleus' Grand Slam dreams after three successive wins.\n\n'Scotland's terrible beauty reverses the narrative on extraordinary day'\n\nThe key moment for Scotland's win against Wales\n\nFrance remain in the driving seat for a 20th title - third in five years - and can seal it with a bonus-point win in Edinburgh.\n\nThey were made to graft by ever-improving Italy in Lille, but eventually streaked away to win 33-8, aided by another classy display from star scrum-half and captain Antoine Dupont.\n\nA brilliant kick set up the opening score for Louis Bielle-Biarrey, before Dupont then showed his defensive strengths during a dominant second-half spell from the visitors.\n\n\"It's perhaps unfair that we expect him to do outrageous things every week,\" said Barclay.\n\n\"He is coming back from a knee injury and was maybe a bit quiet in the first two games, but he really stepped up.\n\n\"You have to admire his ability to scan the play under pressure, see space and deliver the skill for France to score that first try. His physical side of the game is impressive, he makes tackles and does so much good stuff.\n\n\"He had a huge influence on the game which is what we have come to expect.\n\n\"France will be heavy favourites in Scotland but that is an exciting game. Perhaps only South Africa can match them for power at the moment.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bielle-Biarrey became the first player in Six Nations history to score in eight successive matches. He has scored 13 tries in 12 Six Nations games and 24 in 25 overall. Quite the strike-rate.\n\nFrance maintain Grand Slam dream with Italy win\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nWhile Scotland's campaign has been revitalised by back-to-back victories, England's has been utterly derailed by two losses.\n\nThey were blown away by Ireland at Twickenham as the men in green ran in five tries to embarrass Steve Borthwick's side 42-21.\n\nEngland entered the tournament with a settled-looking side, but now look a muddle with Matt Dawson calling for Fin Smith to replace George Ford at number 10.\n\nWarburton was confused by Ford's kicking - or lack of - against Ireland.\n\nHe said: \"England are normally patient in their kick battle but Ford missed some kicks that were a real momentum killer.\n\n\"England are a kicking team and when they do it well they look really good. He won so much territory against Wales and in the last two games it's been the other end of the spectrum.\n\n\"Ford is an exceptional tactical kicker but he has not been kicking in the last two games and they have struggled as a result of it.\"\n\n\"I am surprised by England,\" added Barclay.\n\n\"We thought it was a shootout between them and France for a Grand Slam before the tournament. The most concerning thing is the nature of the defeats. Where are England now? We don't really know.\n\n\"The last two performances have thrown up a lot of question marks about selection. What's the best back three, who should play at centre, is George Ford the man at 10?\n\n\"Rewind a few weeks and you could name the team. It seems to have fallen apart a bit.\"\n\nNext up for England is a trip on Saturday, 7 March, to Rome that looks anything but inviting.\n\n'England need players able to change tactics during games'\n\nIs Borthwick under pressure after nightmare defeat?\n\nIreland's resurgence was personified by Robert Baloucoune.\n\nThe 28-year-old had not featured for Ireland since November 2022 because of injury, but he started and scored against Italy before scoring again in an all-action performance against England.\n\nThe wing thought his international career was over but instead played a huge part in a famous win, troubling England speedster Henry Arundell with his work-rate.\n\n\"He was unbelievable,\" said Barclay. \"His willingness to work off the ball is how you win games.\n\n\"He put in dominant tackles, won turnovers. The mindset and energy he bought to the game away from home set the tempo.\"\n\n\"Ireland's desire and work-rate off the ball won them the game,\" added Warburton.\n\n\"Paul O'Connell's quote when I was on Lions duty with him was, 'Be the best at everything that requires no talent' - and Ireland were that.\n\n\"Their attack looks like the one of old. They were super-organised and their aerial dominance was a launchpad. They were so efficient in the red zone and their speed of ball was too good, England couldn't recover from it.\"\n\nIreland face Wales next in a Friday night feast in Dublin on 6 March.\n\n'Ireland show they're far from done with record-breaking win'\n\n'Special day' - Farrell revels in record Irish win\n\nWales' dismal run continued with a painful defeat that was summed up by Tomos Williams giving away a costly penalty for a croc roll.\n\nWales have lost 24 of 26 internationals since October 2023 and the latest defeat was a 14th successive Six Nations loss in a record stretching back three years.\n\nBarclay added: \"Wales will be gutted. They had that game.\n\n\"In Test Match rugby the margins are tiny and in the last 15 minutes they gave away five penalties and a huge one was the croc roll.\n\n\"You might think that has to be grabbing someone around the head and neck and twisting them, but it's also about lateral movement. It's something they are trying to get out of the game.\"\n\nThe penalty was costly and Scotland and Russell took full advantage, with their misery being compounded by the nature of George Turner's match-winning try.\n\nScotland number eight Matt Fagerson was offside and obstructing Wales replacement prop Archie Griffin in the build-up to the score from a driving maul.\n\nSmall margins - but can Wales now build on an improved display across the Irish Sea?\n\nAgony and hope for Wales after Scotland loss",

    "fullText": "In a race filled with attrition, Tyler Reddick battled through a double overtime finish to open the NASCAR Cup Series 2026 season with back-to-back victories, winning at Echo Park Speedway Sunday night.\n\n23XI Racing currently has its two drivers at the top of the points standings through the first two races, as Reddick wins the Daytona 500 and Autotrader 400, and Bubba Wallace matches his Daytona 500 performance with a top ten finish and a stage win.\n\nTyler drove his ass off today,\" 23XI Racing owner Michael Jordan said.\n\n\"I know we had our little ordeal, but they never gave up, they kept working hard, and this is the fruit of their labor,\" Jordan said on 23XI Racing's performance to start the post-law suit year. \"For us to come out and win the first two races says a lot about our team.\"\n\nFellow Toyota driver Christopher Bell led on the lap 17 restart, looking to back up his win in the race last year that sent him on his three-race streak. Bell was in the battle with Wallace, with Wallace taking the lead with 12 laps to go. As Wallace battled up front, his teammate Reddick, sans right front fender, made the run from 18th to fourth before a caution and red flag set up the first overtime finish.\n\nReddick, who rose through the Late Model ranks, won without a fender.\n\n\"That’s crazy isn’t its it,\" Reddick said on winning without a fender. \"This place over the years, man. It just puts on some amazing racing. Handling matters here, but I don't know, apparently determination outweighs handling.\"\n\nThe caution was called after William Byron had a tire go down, sending the Hendrick driver into the wall. He collected six cars with four laps remaining to set up an Overtime finish.\n\nCarson Hocevar, still chasing his first win, led last week on the white flag lap before crashing. He also matched performance this week, as a few aggressive moves in the closing laps nearly secured him the win. Known to make bold decisions and enemies, Hocevar and his spotter tried to negotiate with the leading Toyotas to push on the restart. Asking Wallace to 'Shake and Bake' and have the Reddick line up behind in the third row. Wallace instead opted to start on the bottom with Reddick lining up behind him, unsure if Reddick's damaged race car would be able to successfully push the teammates in tandem to the front.\n\nOn the overtime restart, Hocevar dove to a pocket in the middle of Bell, and Wallace bailed on pushing Bell when he got a major push from Ross Chastain. Hocevar crashed into Bell, and the Joe Gibbs Racing driver hit the wall, sustaining major front right damage.\n\nThe second overtime attempt saw Wallace and Reddick linked up again, now with JGR's Chase Briscoe behind for a three-car Toyota chain on the bottom against three Chevrolets on the top.\n\nIn the closing two laps, Wallace went high to block Hocevar and lost momentum, falling back through the field as his teammate passed on the bottom. In clean air, Reddick was able to hang on through the rough handling of his damaged race car to claim his second win ahead of Briscoe, Chastain, Hocevar, and Daniel Suarez.\n\nShane van Gisbergen, who was involved in two incidents in stage two, rebounded for a sixth-place finish, his best finish on an oval track.\n\nZane Smith, Wallace, Ryan Preece, and Ryan Blaney completed the top ten.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Minnesota Twins suffered a huge loss ahead of the 2026 season when they announced Pablo Lopez, their No. 2 starting pitcher, had to have Tommy John surgery. Now, they need to find his replacement.\n\nFansided’s Zachary Rotman predicts the Twins could be a dark horse for a veteran All-Star in Lucas Giolito. He eats innings, and he had a pretty productive 2025.\n\nMORE: Padres predicted to be dark horse candidate for $9 million three-time Cy Young, two-time World Series champion ace to replace Dylan Cease\n\n“Another team that should be desperate for a starting pitcher is the Minnesota Twins, which just lost Pablo Lopez for the season. With Joe Ryan and Bailey Ober being their only semi-reliable starters, Giolito would be a valuable addition as an innings-eater. Worst case, he wouldn't cost much, and if the Twins are out of it at the trade deadline, he can fetch them a prospect or two in a deal,” Rotman wrote.\n\nGiolito finished 2025 with a 10-4 record, a 3.41 ERA, 121 Ks, and a WHIP of 1.290 over 145 innings pitched. He’d round out a decent front end to a rotation, giving the Twins a 1-2-3 punch with him, Joe Ryan, and Bailey Ober.\n\nMORE: Blue Jays predicted to re-sign $9 million three-time Cy Young, two-time World Series champion ace to provide depth to Kevin Gausman-led rotation\n\nGiolito’s projected to receive a three-year, $61 million deal; however, considering that Spring Training has started, the Twins could get him for way cheaper than that.\n\nHopefully, the Twins consider this as they still have a chance to be a contender this year, and Giolito would help them with that.\n\nDiamondbacks predicted to be dark horse landing spot for $6.7 million All-Star, would temporarily replace Lourdes Gurriel Jr.\n\nAstros predicted to be top destination for $6.7 million All-Star outfielder, would be upgrade from Zach Cole\n\nPadres predicted to be most likely destination for $39 million 3.81 ERA starting pitcher, would replace Dylan Cease in rotation",

    "description": "On the day his statue was unveiled outside Crypto.com Arena, Showtime era coach Pat Riley urged the Lakers to fight to create legacies worth chasing.",
    "fullText": "The fans never got an opportunity to give a grateful goodbye, Pat Riley resigning on an early summer afternoon 36 years ago after the end of a lost season.\n\nEveryone will have that chance now.\n\nWhen Riley left town at the wrong end of grumblings from players and fans, he was the greatest coach not only in Lakers history but also in basketball history, his .730 winning percentage and 102 playoff victories both NBA records at the time.\n\nHe has been Showtime’s forgotten kingpin, its lost leader, its missing warrior, a stylishly distant legend who had been overshadowed by the seven Lakers whose statues stand watch over the plaza outside Crypto.com Arena.\n\nRiley finally is coming home, returning Sunday with the unveiling of a long overdue statue in whose bronze reflection a couple of wistful realizations can be found.\n\nRiles has been terribly, terribly missed.\n\nThe Showtime era seems terribly, terribly distant.\n\nRiley hasn’t been with the Lakers in 36 years. The Lakers haven’t won an asterisk-free NBA title in 16 years. Maybe because Shaquille O’Neal spoke only via video Sunday, the greatness of this organization never felt further away.\n\nMark Walter, were you watching?\n\nThe Dodgers group that now owns the Lakers was granted a compelling history lesson during an hourlong ceremony that culminated in a theatrical unveiling of a Riley statue smartly situated between the bronzes of Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nLike Riley himself, his statue looked darn near perfect. There was the raised fist that was once a signal for Magic to pass to Kareem for a sky hook. There was the neatly coiffed hair, the nicely fitting suit, the smartly positioned tie, even the painfully stern expression from a guy who left no doubt who was running the show.\n\n“When I was told that the kid from Schenectady, New York, would be honored with a statue here ... I fell to my knees, humbled. I sobbed. ... Tears of joy and gratitude,” Riley said during his acceptance speech, adding “That statue right there … is loaded up with all of us who took that magical journey.”\n\nIt was a Showtime magic born of a commitment found in one of the two inscriptions on the statue.\n\n“There will come a time when you are challenged, and when that time comes, you must plant your feet. You must stand firm. You must make a point. About who you are, what you do, and where you come from. When that time comes, you do it.”\n\nRiley used those words to earn six Laker championship rings, four as a coach, one as an assistant coach and one as a player.\n\nAfter leaving town in 1990 and making a stop in New York, Riley carried those words with him to Miami, where he led the Heat to one title as a coach and two more as an executive, and where he still serves as president at age 80.\n\n“There will come a time when you are challenged …”\n\nFor the new Laker bosses, that time is now, as they find themselves with a product that is light years from the teams that Riley referenced during what amounted to a 30-minute sermon/history lesson prior to the unveiling.\n\nThis Laker organization is a bit of a mess, as evidenced by the speakers who joined Riley on the stage.\n\nThere was Magic and Kareem and Jeanie Buss, who all gave compelling talks, very appropriate. But oddly also speaking was Dwyane Wade, who played for Riley in Miami but was never a Laker. The group was interestingly joined by Michael Douglas, who spoke as Riley’s friend, while several Lakers Showtime greats watched from the audience.\n\nIt was all a bit disjointed, which is similar to the Lakers' current situation. They’re so defensively challenged they’re surely headed for an early playoff exit even though they have the stunningly great scorer Luka Doncic, and what happens next?\n\nDo they keep LeBron James? (Say no!) Do they pay Austin Reaves (Say yes!) Do they try to trade for Giannis Antetokounmpo (Go for it!).\n\nAll these are questions not unlike the one faced by the late Jerry Buss in 1981 when pondering the notion of hiring a kid who had never coached at any level. Buss trusted his instincts and went for it, the enlistment of Riley fashioning a culture that remained strong until his death in 2013.\n\nIt is a culture that Riley described when he left in 1990, quoting the late author Ernest Becker.\n\n“Man's greatest fear — and you've probably heard this before — is his fear of extinction,” he said in his farewell news conference. “But what he fears more than that is to become extinct with insignificance.”\n\nThe Showtime Lakers faced those fears and overcame them.\n\n\"What we accomplished was not insignificant,” he added in his farewell address. “All anybody ever wants to do is have the feeling that what they do counts and matters. I've always told the players that they don't just want to be the best of the best. There's nothing wrong with being unique. We were unique.\"\n\nRiley repeated many of those same words Sunday, and added some more wisdom about life with the legends.\n\n“That’s where I learned about commitment … there are only two options” he said. “You’re in or you’re out. Either you’re with us or against us. There’s no other way, there’s no life in between.”\n\nRiley said that through that commitment, the Lakers legacy had been formed.\n\n“The biggest footprint in Laker history had been planted,” he said, later adding, “You begin by chasing footprints, you grow by honoring them. And if you’re committed enough, you leave giant steps of your own.”\n\nHe then challenged today’s NBA players, even the ones getting dressed down the hall.\n\n“I ask even the players who play for the Lakers today, I ask you, whose footprints are you chasing today?” he said. “More important, what footprints are you leaving?”\n\nHe continued, saying, “When it comes time to kick some ass, you do it. And one day someone will follow the path you left behind and say, ‘Those are footprints worth chasing.”’\n\nRiley ended his talk with what was essentially an inspirational pregame speech as the Lakers prepared to play the rival he finally conquered, those Boston Celtics.\n\n“As my father’s words to me, they ring out loud and clear today,” he said with the sort of verve that is rarely heard around the team these days. “The time has come to kick some ass. To kick some Boston ass.”\n\nMark Walter, were you listening?\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Tyreek Hill next team odds. Chiefs drawing shortest NFL odds to land All-Pro wide receiver after release from Dolphins.",
    "fullText": "Want to get more Covers content? Add us as a preferred source on your Google account here.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins released wide receiver Tyreek Hill on Monday, February 16, finally ending a union that seemed destined for a breakup sooner rather than later.\n\nThe eight-time Pro-Bowler played in just four games in 2025 before suffering a season-ending ACL injury. What began as a perfect match, and briefly looked like the best offense in football alongside Jayden Waddle as Tua Tagovailoa's primary weapons, Hill's time in Miami appeared to sour by the end of 2024.\n\nNow, the hapless Dolphins and the 31-year-old receiver are embarking on different paths. Below, we'll look at the latest NFL odds for Hill's next destination — and why a reunion with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs feels inevitable.\n\nFrom 2016-21, Tyreek Hill was a mainstay in the Kansas City Chiefs offense, racking up 6,630 receiving yards and 56 touchdowns over 91 games. He made the Pro Bowl every season in Kansas City and was one of quarterback Patrick Mahomes' favorite targets.\n\nA reunion would make a ton of sense, especially after the Chiefs just missed the postseason for the first time since before either Hill or Mahomes debuted. The Chiefs struggled to establish a deep-ball threat this season, and an ancient Travis Kelce led the team in receiving.\n\nBringing Hill back into the fold immediately gives Mahomes an established weapon who, if he's 100%, can burn defensive backs better than almost anyone. And their familiarity should help him, figuratively and literally, hit the ground running in September and beyond.\n\nWhile the Chiefs are the logical landing spot based on \"narrative,\" the Buffalo Bills need a big-time receiver just as much. Quarterback Josh Allen relied more heavily on his tight ends in 2025, and giving him another option alongside top WR Khalil Shakir (who led the team with 72 receptions, while Dalton Kincaid was next with 39) would solve a glaring issue and take some of the pressure off.\n\nThe Bills' window isn't closed, but they did move on from head coach Sean McDermott this offseason, showing a desperation to get over the hump from \"great regular season team\" to \"legitimate Super Bowl contender.\" Hill would be a major upgrade.\n\nFresh off a disappointing showing in the Super Bowl, could the New England Patriots target Hill? Stefon Diggs is a $26.5-million cap hit next season, and is already being bandied about as a potential cut candidate.\n\nIt's doubtful that the Pats would employ both Diggs and Hill for a variety of reasons — both have had character and legal issues in recent years — and it may not make a lot of sense to replace Diggs with Hill, especially if the latter has questions about his health in the wake of his ACL tear and dislocated knee.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens committed to quarterback Lamar Jackson in moving on from head coach John Harbaugh, and bolstering the wide receiver corps may be a way to kickstart a new era.\n\nHe would help form a formidable duo with Zay Flowers, who had nearly 800 more receiving yards than his closest teammate in 2025. Veteran DeAndre Hopkins is a free agent, and Hill would be a significant upgrade at their respective points in their careers.\n\nFinally, this is an interesting option after Hill's former Miami Dolphins head coach, Mike McDaniel, was hired to serve as Jim Harbaugh's offensive coordinator. When Miami's offense was at its best before Tua Tagovailoa's concussions, the Dolphins looked virtually unstoppable.\n\nAssuming there's no bad blood, giving Justin Herbert a target of this caliber may unlock another level for the Los Angeles Chargers quarterback.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here and view our best betting sites or check out our top sportsbook promos.",

    "title": "The quirk of fate that saw sluggish Liverpool beat Forest and close in on Champions League places",
    "description": "Nottingham Forest 0-1 Liverpool: Alexis Mac Allister’s late, late winner snatched all three points for the champions",
    "fullText": "Perhaps it was football at its most illogical. Liverpool were triumphant after a first-half performance Arne Slot felt was their worst in his time at the club. They got a goal from a player who may have only been in a goalscoring position because one of his teammates was injured and after he had struggled in his original role, amid a collective malaise.\n\nA team who have been aggrieved by refereeing decisions of late saw a seeming winner disallowed in contentious fashion and yet made off with three points. And Vitor Pereira, who seemed to have had an immediate impact with Nottingham Forest, reacted to his first home game in charge by saying: “I am frustrated, angry with football. Very, very unfair.”\n\nHe had a point in his argument, if not in the result. For Liverpool, Florian Wirtz’s back injury produced a benefit. Their supporters ended up celebrating just their second win at the City Ground in more than four decades by chorusing the name of their resident World Cup winner.\n\nAs his habit of scoring against Real Madrid shows, Alexis Mac Allister can supply major moments. Twice it seemed he had a decider against Forest. The first was disallowed and yet perhaps Liverpool’s sense of injustice provided the platform for the second.\n\nBut he did so twice from a position within the Forest penalty box. Which, when Slot drew up his plans, was not his. Wirtz should have been there. When he withdrew, Curtis Jones was the emergency No 10. He floundered there, as Mac Allister did in midfield. So Jones was redirected to right-back, Dominik Szoboszlai and Mac Allister given more advanced roles. And an hour later, the Argentinian, who had started as a passenger, ended as the match-winner.\n\nAnd so Slot, who believes that decisions and fortune have gone against Liverpool this season, instead argued his side got lucky. “We have been on the wrong side of the score after a good performance too many times,” he said. “Today we got more than we deserved. A draw would have been a fairer result. The first half was really poor, the worst we have played. We lost almost every ball we touched.” The second period was better and, eventually, Slot could say: “My emotions were emotions of happiness and relief.”\n\nWhich came from Mac Allister’s late show. He had the ball in the Forest net twice: once seemingly inadvertently, once deliberately. The first was chalked off. The second also went to VAR, but this time the replays could not quash Liverpool’s joy.\n\nPaul Tierney, long Jurgen Klopp’s least favourite official, disallowed what seemed the breakthrough goal. It went in off Mac Allister’s upper arm and back. Not that there was any sense the Argentinian knew anything about it. After Hugo Ekitike should have scored, but met Rio Ngumoha’s cross with a header that Stefan Ortega saved, Mac Allister’s back was turned as Ola Aina’s clearance struck him and rebounded into the Forest net. He knew it had hit his elbow. “I feel like it's a bit harsh,” he said. “It's a bit of both but I understand the rules.”\n\nWhen it was ruled out, it seemed to cement Forest’s status as Liverpool’s bogey team. Until Szoboszlai, the one man taking his time as the clock ticked down, jinked to make a yard of space, whipped in a lovely cross and Virgil van Dijk’s goalbound header was blocked by Murillo. Mac Allister was the predator in the box again. “It was not a surprise to me that Macca was both times the goalscorer, he played with the mentality you need in these games and he was twice in the situation to finish,” said Slot.\n\nMeanwhile, Wirtz was only visible beneath his hood in the stands. It was a game when Liverpool missed the German when they were shorn of creativity and chemistry. They looked a prosaic outfit with the £100m man and yet found a way to record just their second victory at the City Ground in more than four decades. The first required a 99th-minute decider by Darwin Nunez. This was only slightly earlier, similarly dramatic.\n\nIt was a remarkable end to a forgettable game. Seasons can turn on such moments. Liverpool are now level on points with Chelsea and Manchester United, their immediate rivals for a Champions League spot. Forest, meanwhile, were seemingly making an auspicious start to Pereira’s reign but were nudged closer to the Championship by Mac Allister. They started superbly yet fell apart at the last.\n\nForest had won 3-0 at Anfield under Sean Dyche; yet Liverpool began worse in the rematch, slow and sluggish, off the pace and out of sorts. Meanwhile, Forest looked liberated, a group of talented players freed from Dyche’s restrictive tactics. Omari Hutchinson was excellent. Callum Hudson-Odoi almost scored in the third minute, when Alisson denied him. Elliot Anderson drove a shot wide. “The first half was just missing the goals,” said Pereira, but that has been a theme of Forest’s campaign.\n\nLiverpool had threatened only when Stefan Ortega made a close-range block from Jones; but part of Slot’s half-time message was that Forest, who had beaten Fenerbahce in Istanbul three days earlier, might tire. They did. “Our capacity to press them was not the same and in the end, we conceded,” rued Pereira. “But if we keep this mentality and organisation, we will get points, for sure.”",

    "title": "Miami Dolphins Fans Weigh In On De’Von Achane’s Future",
    "description": "Miami Dolphins fans share what they think or want to happen with star running back De’Von Achane going forward.",
    "fullText": "Following the kick-off of our Miami Dolphins roster purge this past week, I pointed out that the team also had a decision to make on star running back De’Von Achane as he enters the final year of his rookie contract. I then asked the following question:\n\nWhat do you think that the new coaching staff and front office should do with De’Von Achane going forward? Should they extend him right now/before the season begins, should they allow him to play on the final year of his deal before deciding if they want to re-sign him to a new deal, or should they consider trading a player that they took in the third round who could now garner a first-round draft pick?\n\nBelow are some of your thougths and answers-\n\nNeenerWhacker wonders what a change in coaching and scheme will have on Achanes numbers in 2026.\n\nSide note on Achane: his stats and analytics are off the charts. How much credit are we going to give Mike McDaniel for Achane’s success?\n\nThere is a high probability that Achane regresses next year with a new play caller. McD had his flaws, but he knew how to scheme for Devon\n\nMiamiItaliano says trade him away if he doesn’t give the Dolphins a generous hometown discount on any extension.\n\nIf they get Malik Willis, that might take touches away from Achane since he’s a run first type of QB. Also, Achane might want too much money. Maybe trade him if he doesn’t agree to a team friendly contract. I don’t want him to go, but it’s better than him holding out throughout training camp.\n\nOldfinfan says he’s the best since Ricky and is a building block, not trade bait.\n\nBest Dolphins player we have seen since Ricky Williams. We do not trade him, we build around him. He has game breaking abilities you don’t just find every draft.\n\nkrammm is out on him, it seems.\n\nTrade him. He never wins the big game.\n\nFLexile seems to have two arguments for you.\n\nExtend him. If he is not the fastest guy in the NFL, he’s top 3. He can score ANY time he touches the ball.\n\nCome trade deadline, do the best thing for both parties and trade him. The Dolphins get a 1st rounder and Achane gets a ring and a Super Bowl MVP for whatever team is an electric RB away from a Lombardi trophy.\n\nSuperG! says extend him unless someone offers a first, and maybe more, for him.\n\nCould he garner a first-round pick? I’ve been told by super smart people on here that teams don’t offer a first round pick in a trade scenario for a running back. Especially a running back on the final year of his rookie contract. A first and a third would be considered a Godfather deal. Other than that, I wouldn’t trade him. I’d extend him instead.\n\ngo_canes who has a VERY solid screen name, says keep him because seeing him play is worth the admission!\n\nThe guy is one of those rare “worth the price of admission” players. I hope they keep him in a Dolphin uniform. It is worth the risk. There is also a risk to the complete tank approach – you could develop a loser mentality.\n\nUSMCFinzFreak lays out a 2-3 year plan for the team.\n\n1) Build the trenches through the draft.\n\n2) Obtain competent WRs and TEs.\n\n3) Get a bridge quarterback (I still have hope in Ewers).\n\nOnce those pieces are in place, go and get a young quarterback (if Ewers doesn’t cut the mustard).\n\nMIAMI235 believes it comes down to affordability.\n\nIf he stays healthy, a dynamic presence, when utilized properly. As others have stated, it may simply comedown too affordability.\n\ndavidson11 says if Tua’s gone, then just clean house.\n\nIf they’re not going to keep Tua, they might as well trade Achane and Waddle. Either tank or don’t.\n\nfinfanfromsiam believes in the build via the draft concept.\n\nVery good player that we drafted. Extend him to a decent contract. Keep our own when possible.\n\nMonix22 wants him traded based on an assumption of future injury.\n\nTrade him. Let him get hurt on another team.\n\nUpInPensacola wants to make it a package deal. Might be the only way to get a good package in return for Tua.\n\nIs it possible to trade him in a deal where Tua goes with him?\n\nPA phinphan say’s the idea of a team-friendly deal is unlikely, so maybe look for a first for him in trade.\n\nTo me this is tough decision. I would love to keep him on a team friendly deal but is that even a thing anymore? It seems like it’s all about making as much as you can with little loyalty. I get it. It’s like any other business.\n\nWith that said, if he could bring a first round pick maybe it’s best to trade him and give the new regime more picks to build their type of roster.\n\nThe Earl is a man of few words.\n\nWell, that’s our random 15 comments this evening. It seems there is no consensus on what should happen with Achane going forward, which means whatever happens with him will make some portion of the fan base unhappy. As always, thank you to each of you who took the time to join in on our question of the day and contribute to this and the prior post.

    "fullText": "The college football offseason overall is pretty quiet this time of year. In 2026, it has been a little bit louder with recent court rulings and ongoing battles.\n\nThis is also the time, however, that the NCAA works with college football programs to make changes to the game. Most recently, the running clock rule was changed, and a two-minute warning was also added.\n\nMORE: NCAA may appeal judge’s Trinidad Chambliss decision due to concerning details\n\nThe NCAA is looking to make a big change to a controversial college football rule: targeting. Targeting, of course, is when a player leads with the crown of their head for intentional contact with another player’s head or neck area.\n\nThe rule’s purpose is understandable. They want to protect all players from unnecessary hits and also protect those who tend to deliver those hits.\n\nWhat makes things controversial is the review, execution, and punishment of targeting. It can be difficult to determine if targeting in college football is malicious in nature or not intentional.\n\nMORE: Indiana gives head football coach Curt Cignetti a nice championship reward\n\nThe punishment is ejection and can also roll over into the next game for those penalized. The NCAA is reportedly aiming to change at least the rollover suspension aspect of targeting.\n\nThis is a relatively big step in addressing the difficult call to make in targeting. While some calls are very obvious–one way or another–it is still also difficult for other calls.\n\nCould the NCAA eventually change the punishment of targeting altogether? It’s a long shot at this moment, but it might be on its way to big changes.\n\nOLYMPICS: Team USA flag bearers revealed for 2026 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony\n\nNFL: Predicting the 2026 NFL free agent signings\n\nMLB: Detroit Tigers drop unreal alternate jerseys for 2026 MLB season\n\nNBA: Charlotte Hornets share update after LaMelo Ball’s car crash\n\nNHL: 2026 Winter Olympics men’s hockey, NHL payrolls for final four teams\nSPORTS MEDIA: Olympics reporter apologizes for drinking, slurring words during live segment\n\nThe post NCAA to review controversial college football rule for huge changes appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Your $1,000 laptop deserves a protective home on the road. A tech journalist and frequent traveler recommends his nine...",
    "fullText": "Your $1,000 laptop deserves a protective home on the road. A tech journalist and frequent traveler recommends his nine favorites\n\nThe four best personal-item backpacks that fit under US airline seats\n\nWhether you’re flying across the country on vacation, meeting with an important client downtown or just heading to your local coffee shop for work, there is a good chance you’re bringing a backpack along, with a laptop squirreled away inside.\n\nWhile you can toss a laptop into just about any bag, the best laptop backpacks are specially tailored to pamper what is probably one of your most expensive (and delicate) possessions. That means a padded pocket lined with soft non-scratch material, easy access to your computer without unpacking everything and lots of extra pockets for portable mice, chargers and other accessories. Add in all of the standard backpack considerations such as capacity, comfort and durability, and you have a lot of factors to consider.\n\nTo find the very best laptop backpack, I rounded up 11 of the top models and tested them over several months and many miles.\n\nBest overall: \n\n Mission Workshop Meridian backpack\n\nBest for travel:\n\n Peak Design Travel Backpack\n\nBest budget: \n\n The North Face Vault\n\nBest sling bag: \n\n Tomtoc Navigator – T24 Sling Bag (Small)\n\nBest rugged bag: \n\n Pelican PX25 Aegis Travel Pack\n\nI’ve been a tech journalist for 13 years, and a frequent traveler – in 2025 I flew more than 70,000 miles, across 41 flights and a total of seven days and six hours in the air. I visited 12 airports and six countries, to say nothing of countless steps, ride shares and hotels.\n\nAs someone who tends to pack more than I really need and has a bad back, I’m uniquely motivated to find the perfect backpack, and it’s been an obsessive quest of mine for years. Backpacks also speak to my love for planning and organization, which the testing process let me fully indulge.\n\nThe first thing I did to test these 11 backpacks was to pack for a trip. I put everything I typically carry for a work trip on to a table: a laptop that is anywhere from 13 to 16in, a tablet, several phones – because I have a weird job – multiple plugs, chargers, batteries and, of course, plenty of bungee cords. My loadout also includes three tech bags: one with video gear like a selfie stick and lav mics, one with flight essentials like snacks and battery packs and one with chargers, cables and adapters.\n\nThen, I packed up each backpack using the various compartments and pockets as designed, threw each backpack on to my back and I walked a half mile each. Since water is the mortal enemy of laptops, I also tested each backpack (empty – and thank goodness!) in my shower for one minute to simulate getting caught in the rain. I fully let out all the straps and donned the backpack to see how easily the straps adjusted. I zipped and unzipped each zipper 25 times to see how easy it was to use. Finally, I put a deck of playing cards in an easy-access pocket (if there was one) and timed how long it took for me to get it off my back and the cards in hand.\n\nMany manufacturers provided samples to test for this article, which I donated to my local library upon completion. It’d be a treat to see a school kid or even an adult strutting around town with one of these.\n\nMission Workshop’s Meridian backpack has pockets for days, a semi-modular design that lets you customize it with add-ons and tons of space.\n\nWhy we love it\nThis bag easily held everything I wanted to pack with room to spare, and a home for everything. All three of my tech bags fit in the main compartment, and everything else had its own pocket, making it very clear where everything lives. The sample I received included two add-ons: a slim side pouch that’s perfect for phones, battery packs or even a slim flashlight, and a bottle pouch. Laptop access on this bag is particularly nice because it has its own compartment, separate from the main compartment. It scored the highest on our waterproof testing, as well – everything inside was bone dry. The straps didn’t rest along my rib cage as well as I’d like, but it was definitely wearable.\n\nThis bag is probably overkill for a student just looking to tote a laptop and some books around campus, but it’s great for a professional who needs to schlep a bunch of gear comfortably and with easy access to everything.\n\nIt’s a shame that … It’s so big it might strain the personal item rules on most airlines. And there are no locks or hidden pockets if you’re worried about security. While it has a sleeve to slide over the handle on a roller bag, it’s situated sideways, which interferes with the side pouches and struck me as a silly design choice.\n\nMax laptop size: 17in\nCapacity: 28 litres\nEmpty weight: 2.74lbs\n\nThis bag has an unusual design: to pack it you need to rest it on its face and open the back, which hinges 180 degrees and gives you easy access to the whole main compartment.\n\nWhy we love it\nIf you’re headed out for a weekend, this is a lovely bag to comfortably bring a few changes of clothes, your laptop and all the goodies that go with it. Aside from the large main compartment, you’ll find a good amount of organization around the periphery of the main pouch, smaller zipped pockets along the side and two larger zipped pockets on the inside of the front of the bag.\n\nLoops along the periphery of the bag inside and out allow you strap even more gear to the bag, and Peak even includes tie-downs. With 30 litres of capacity, you probably won’t need to, though.\n\nIt’s a shame that … The unique design takes some getting used to. Adjusting the straps and fit is very difficult, and waterproofing was just OK. There was some water ingress, making the paper towels inside the bag damp, but not wet. The lining is also not absorbant, so it dries quickly.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 33 liters\nEmpty weight: 3.17lbs\n\nWhile it’s the most basic bag I tested, the North Face Vault is a perfectly competent laptop hauler at a fraction of the cost of most other bags on this list.\n\nWhy we love it\nBeing basic isn’t necessarily a bad thing – not every backpack needs 700 pockets for every little item. The Vault has a generous main compartment and a smaller top compartment with a few pouches and pockets for very small items, such as pencils and thumb drives. The top pouch takes away a bit of room into the main pouch, but the latter opens wide enough to easily work around it if you’re digging around for something.\n\nThis bag is deceptively deep, and it holds a lot, if pressed into service. I found it very serviceable for most tasks – the Toyota Corolla of backpacks. It will get you from A to B with no complaints. Just please don’t get caught out in the rain.\n\nIt’s a shame that … It’s not waterproof at all – water quickly works its way inside. It’s also not terribly comfortable for extended periods due to thin straps and little padding on the shoulder straps and back.\n\nMax laptop size: 15in \nCapacity: 27 liters\nEmpty weight: 1.68lbs\n\nThis isn’t technically a backpack – it’s a sling bag, but it’s delightfully small, it holds a ton of gear, and yet has enough space for a 14in laptop.\n\nWhy we love it\nThis is a great day pack, if you’re heading out for a day on the town. It only holds 7 liters, but those 7 liters are impeccably organized: there are pockets for your laptop, tablet and e-reader, plus smaller pockets for additional organization. An outer pocket is perfect for things you need to grab on the go, and a security pocket facing your back lets you safely stow your wallet, keys or passport in a tough-to-swipe location.\n\nIt’s a shame that … Adjusting the strap is very hard with the overengineered buckle. This is also the smallest bag on the list by a lot, and probably won’t hold everything you’ll want for plane rides.\n\nMax laptop size: 14in\nCapacity: 7 liters\nEmpty weight: 1.23lbs\n\nPelican is perhaps best known for its hardened cases used to carry delicate equipment, and the Aegis stays true to its roots with a super tough hard-shell design.\n\nWhy we love it\nUnlike all the soft options on our list, this model has a rigid exterior built to shrug off impact and general roughhousing. I didn’t drop the bag from my roof or anything, but if you find yourself in a harsh environment with gear that doesn’t take kindly to impact, this should be your first choice.\n\nThe backpack is essentially one large compartment, except for one small compartment at the top for odds and ends, and a laptop sleeve. If you want to more, Pelican sells stick-on Velcro “ModPaks” that add various pockets. Personally, I would need three or more, but if you want a lot of open space to work with, this is a good bag to consider. Like the Peak Design bag, it has tie-down loops inside to ratchet down your gear with cord or bungees.\n\nIt’s a shame that … There is virtually no organization in the bag – plan to use packing cubes. It also has almost no water resistance. Also, if you have a dog with not-black fur, carry a lint roller with you!\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 25 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.9lbs\n\nI prefer a messenger bag (AKA sling bag) when I need to dig into it frequently, like at a trade show, but a backpack is more comfortable for extended wear. Since I switch between them frequently, this convertible bag piqued my interest. It offers the best of both worlds: when you want to convert it, the backpack straps zip up into their own pocket, and you attach the shoulder strap to two loops and just like that, you have a messenger bag.\n\nThe main pocket is surprisingly large, and the two auxiliary pockets also hold a lot. When I was done packing in the items I used to test these bags, this one had a lot of space left over. But it didn’t reign in any one category, which knocked it down a few pegs from its competitors.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … There is no organization nor security in the bag.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 25 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.09lbs\n\nThe Knack Medium Backpack has a highly unusual design that expands out to leap from 24 to 35 litres. You actually access the laptop sleeve from the side, rather than the top, which is a novel approach. While there are some smaller pockets around the periphery of the bag, the main pocket is just one big open space with a divider, which is designed to separate clothes from other gear.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … It felt like the designers had a few clever ideas, but couldn’t quite bring them together coherently. It’s also not water-resistant at all.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in \nCapacity: 35 liters \nEmpty weight: 3lbs\n\nIf you’ve ever found yourself with the unexpected need to check a bag for a flight as I have, a lockable backpack provides welcome piece of mind. This Tomtoc has lock latches – holes where you can insert a lock to attach the zippers to each other – on both of its sets of zippers. You can’t lock up the front pockets, which is unfortunate, but you can secure the main pouch, which is probably where your most expensive goodies live.\n\nTwo zippers access the main pocket: one in the back that facilitates slipping a laptop into the sleeve, and a second one at the front that gives you a wide mouth to put other items in. They both open to the same space, which seemed a bit redundant.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … It has terrible water resistance, and it’s not terribly comfortable to carry.\n\nMax laptop size: 17.3in\nCapacity: 24 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.2lbs\n\nIf you’re a new parent, this bag is a no-brainer, but it’s also great for travelers. I’ve taken it on several trips with no screaming babies in tow and I really dig it. It offers tons of places to stick items like phones, a top pocket for quick-access items and a large stretchy pocket on the front of random odds and ends. If you’re using it as intended, there’s a space at the bottom designed to hold dirty diapers and one pocket designed for baby wipes.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … There’s no security in the bag at all, and the baby features waste a bit of space for non-parents.\n\nMax laptop size: 17in\nCapacity: 20 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.1lbs\n\nPeak Design Everyday Backpack 20L\n\nThink about capacity, organization, security, waterproofing and comfort. To prioritize, consider what you’ll be carrying and in what circumstances. A bag for day tripping to the coffee shop requires less capacity than a weekend travel bag, for instance.\n\nObviously, nothing beats trying it on. Fully extend out the straps, put it on your back and then adjust the straps to fit. If you can, toss in some dummy weight.\n\nIf you’re shopping online, examine how the straps are sewn to the backpack. If they attach vertically, they’ll run along your torso more comfortably than those attached horizontally. Also, consider the zipper pulls. As you get older, zippers with fabric or cord loops can be much easier to pull than bare metal tabs. Also look for retailers with a good return policy in case reality doesn’t match expectations.\n\nBottom padding matters more than anything. Backpacks will be slung down off your back and on to the floor hundreds, if not thousands, of times, and bottom padding is the only thing between your $2,000 laptop and a concrete floor. Also consider waterproofing – if the bag isn’t very waterproof and you get stuck out in the rain, the padding of the sleeve might absorb water and take a long time to dry out.\n\nWhile I prefer a backpack with a pocket for everything, others prefer the versatility of an open compartment. To prevent all your gear from mixing together, use packing cubes and specialized tech bags, like the Peak Design Tech Pouch I use, to hold cables and chargers. Many companies offering backpacks with open compartments also sell organizational packs to go inside.\n\nSome high-end backpacks shed water like ducks; others may as well be made of gauze. If you’re stuck in the rain with the latter, find a garbage bag to put over the backpack, making a slit for the straps if necessary (or just carry it by the handle if it has one, and most all of the bags in this list do). A friendly business may even let you have one if you ask nicely.\n\nWhen you get home, empty the backpack completely, place it in a room with a lot of air circulation and place something inside the laptop sleeve to prop it open so it can dry out. If you don’t, water can get trapped in there for days.\n\nAdam Doud is a freelance product journalist and frequent traveler who carries a ton of tech with him wherever he goes. He’s been on a low-key quest to find the perfect bag/backpack since 2020, and he has strapped more gear to his back than Hannibal’s elephants – though not all at one time. He is also a compulsive organizer, so the more pockets the better",

    "description": "A mom explains why she pulled her high school son out of school for a three-week trip to Antarctica to ease college anxiety and gain perspective.",
    "fullText": "My high school son, Jack, was overwhelmed with college anxiety — SAT prep, AP classes, acceptance rates, and all the pressure that comes with being a New York student.\n\nIt was hard to quiet the noise, so I decided to make a radical — and unconventional decision: I pulled him out of school and took him to Antarctica for three weeks over winter break.\n\nEveryone told me it was a terrible idea, but I thought it was exactly what he needed.\n\nJack and I have been traveling together since he was 3 months old. I'm a huge traveler, and when I had my first son, I decided to take him along for the ride.\n\nIn elementary school, I didn't think twice about pulling him out in order to explore the world (Costa Rica, Mexico, Nevis, Finland). Against the judgment of some parents (and some school officials), I thought it was important to expose him to travel — different cultures, different ways of doing things, different ways of thinking. He quickly became my favorite travel companion, and I often thought travel Jack was the best version of himself.\n\nIt became more difficult to pull him out in middle school (but I still did — he missed eighth-grade graduation — to go on a trip to Sri Lanka). Once he entered high school (where, according to him, grades matter), it became really difficult to make up the work if I pulled him out.\n\nThen came junior year and all the stress that comes with college prep settled upon us. Not only was he balancing a bunch of AP classes, but he was also studying for the SAT and doing all the college prep work. Basically, he (and therefore I) became slightly unhinged.\n\nSo when I floated the idea of going on a trip — just the two of us — Jack was instantly in, but I got tons of pushback from everyone else. Junior year is the most important year for college prep; he's in AP classes, and it's super hard to make up the work. Did I have my priorities straight? Now is the time to lock in, not travel.\n\nBut I ignored the noise and booked us on a three-week cruise to Antarctica — he had two weeks off for the holiday break and would miss one week of school. I had him talk to all his teachers about missed work and make-up, and, surprisingly, while a lot of parents thought I was nuts, the teachers were supportive of this once-in-a-lifetime trip.\n\nAnd off we went on a three-week trip to Antarctica, South Georgia, and the Falkland Islands. I purposefully chose this cruise itinerary because it included South Georgia, which everyone says is a must if going to the white continent. It definitely made the trip long (by a week), but it turned out South Georgia was both Jack and my favorite part of the cruise (we saw thousands of king penguins in their beautiful orange plumage, alongside their baby chicks, which looked like they were wearing lush fur coats).\n\nEvery day was a different adventure: hiking up snow-capped peaks; kayaking among icebergs looking for whales and seals; getting face-to-face with several types of penguins (we quickly learned the difference between rockhopper, macaroni, gentoo, Adelie, and chinstrap varieties).\n\nFar from GPAs and college chatter, surrounded instead by penguins, elephant seals, and endless ice, Jack's perspective started to shift. College stopped feeling like the entire world — and started looking like just one chapter.\n\nOne night we had dinner with Rich Pagen a naturalist and Kristen Wornson the Young Explorers guide. When Jack asked them how they knew what they wanted to do with their lives, they shared their experience of trying to find the right college and then moving into different career circles. It was great for Jack to hear that their path wasn't always straightforward, but they ultimately found jobs they loved.\n\nFor Jack to see people loving their jobs — and to realize that no one thought they'd end up where they did, leading expeditions in Antarctica — was a great wake-up call.\n\nAlso, because this was the family holiday cruise, several other families with teens were on board. It was great for Jack to get out of his comfort zone and talk to teens from all over the world. One was taking a gap year before college, and it really got him realizing that there are so many paths out there.\n\nThe trip also brought Jack and me closer together; away from the distractions of everyday life, we connected in a way that's rare during the teenage years.\n\nOn this trip, Jack and I always did the excursions together, and we ate dinner together every night. But on sea days, I attended every lecture, and he opted to go to the gym or sleep. By giving each other space, we really enjoyed the time we did spend together. I didn't nag him, and he, in turn, didn't give me an attitude.\n\nIt was one of our favorite trips together.",

Trump has suggested the US could buy Greenland or even take it by force.\n\nThe president says Greenland's location makes it strategically important as the melting of Arctic ice opens up new shipping routes and intensifies competition with Russia and China.\n\nThe island is also rich in critical minerals and already hosts a key US military base, which American officials say is vital to missile defense and Arctic security.\n\nMajor European leaders, including those from France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Denmark, released a joint statement last month defending Greenland.\n\n\"Greenland belongs to its people,\" the statement said. \"It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",

    "fullText": "Netflix wants President Donald Trump's stamp of approval as it maneuvers to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNow, Trump has a demand for Netflix: unseat board member Susan Rice.\n\nIn normal times, we would all be marveling at the spectacle of the US president telling a company in the midst of a merger fight (Paramount also wants to buy Warner Bros. Discovery) how to structure its board. During Trump 2.0, though, this has become standard stuff. Trump routinely tells companies to fire someone he doesn't like or do something he does like.\n\nThat doesn't mean Trump always gets what he wants. The demands alone, however, are an extraordinary use of power. We should make sure we don't become inured to it.\n\nTrump's Truth Social post is a reminder that the future of Warner Bros. Discovery will run through the White House, no matter what Trump says at any given moment. (Refresher: In December, Trump said, \"I'll be involved\" in the fight between Netflix and Paramount. Earlier this month, he announced that \"I've decided I shouldn't be involved.\" Now he's telling Netflix it will \"pay the consequences\" if it doesn't fire Rice, which sure seems like he's involved again.)\n\nTrump himself doesn't have the authority to stop Warner Bros. Discovery from selling itself to Netflix or Paramount, which is controlled by David Ellison and his father, the prominent Trump supporter, Larry Ellison. He can, however, instruct Attorney General Pam Bondi to sue to stop a deal on antitrust grounds.\n\nModern presidents have traditionally assumed an arm's-length distance from federal law enforcement. And it's entirely possible that any other president's Department of Justice would also look into an antitrust case against Netflix, given its enormous market power.\n\nTrump, however, has made it clear that he expects Bondi to act on his behalf. So if he doesn't want Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, he can certainly make it more difficult for them.\n\nWhich makes it puzzling that Rice, who held senior roles in the Clinton, Obama, and Biden administrations, would sound off on a podcast, announcing that \"elites\" and \"corporate interests\" who accommodated Trump would one day \"be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\"\n\nThis wasn't a mere gaffe or misstatement. She went on at length. It was, regardless of how she intended it, a provocation aimed at the Trump White House — at the exact moment the company she's supposed to help govern is seeking Trump's approval.\n\nI've asked Netflix for comment on Rice's comments and Trump's response.\n\nWe should also note that Trump's most consistent trait is his inconsistency and that he frequently reverses himself. Last summer, for instance, he announced that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was \"highly CONFLICTED\" and must resign. Days later, Trump met with Tan and described him as a \"success.\" Weeks after that, the US government acquired 10% of Intel.\n\nNor does Trump always follow through. Last fall, he demanded that Microsoft fire Lisa Monaco, an executive who had also worked for Clinton, Obama, and Biden. Monaco still works for Microsoft.\n\nHowever, just because we don't know how serious Trump is about pushing Rice out of Netflix — or how his administration will ultimately rule on the Netflix/Paramount race — doesn't mean we should shrug this off.\n\nWe're in a place where the president routinely tells companies how to run their businesses and threatens them if they don't comply. If we get used to that, we shouldn't be surprised when future presidents decide they can do it, too.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "The Monday morning commute won't be messy in New York City. It will be nonexistent.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declared a state of emergency and a travel ban during a press conference on Sunday as a giant winter storm bore down on much of the Northeast.\n\nThe National Weather Service said to expect blizzard conditions and up to 20 inches of snow over the next 24 hours. Parts of New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts could get up to 25 inches.\n\n\"The state of emergency closes the streets, highways, and bridges of New York City for all traffic,\" Mamdani said. The travel ban begins at 9 p.m. Sunday and lasts until 12 p.m. on Monday. DoorDash, notably, also said it was suspending deliveries Sunday night.\n\nUS airlines, meanwhile, are canceling and delaying thousands of flights. As of Sunday afternoon, airlines had canceled over 3,000 flights and delayed over 2,900, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nNew York City's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports have the highest number of cancellations, followed by Newark Liberty International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and Boston Logan International Airport.\n\nAnyone hoping to catch a flight in the region on Monday can also expect major disruptions, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. At LaGuardia Airport, for example, 82% of flights scheduled for Monday have been canceled.\n\nAdding to what will likely be a chaotic 48 hours for travelers, the Department of Homeland Security announced Saturday night that it was suspending TSA PreCheck and Global Entry due to the partial government shutdown.\n\nDespite the announcement, however, TSA Precheck and Global Entry lanes remained open at major airports on Sunday. In a statement, the Transportation Security Administration said it is evaluating the situation \"case-by-case.\"\n\n\"At this time, TSA PreCheck remains operational with no change for the traveling public,\" a spokesperson said. \"As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case-by-case basis and adjust operations accordingly.\"\n\nThe federal government entered a partial shutdown earlier this month, delaying funding for some agencies, like DHS. TSA agents are essential workers, so they're still working — for now. During the full government shutdown earlier this year, TSA agents and air traffic controllers went 43 days without a paycheck.",

    "fullText": "The US and Canada urged their citizens in parts of Mexico to \"shelter in place\" on Sunday as a Mexican cartel retaliated for the death of its leader.\n\nIn videos shared online, burning vehicles and plumes of smoke could be seen rising from Puerto Vallarta and other cities in Mexico. Flights already on their way to the region from the US turned around, and Air Canada said it was suspending operations to Puerto Vallarta.\n\n\"While no airports have been closed, roadblocks have impacted airline operations, with some domestic and international flights canceled in both Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta,\" the US State Department said. \"Seek shelter and remain in residences or hotels.\"\n\nAs the violence spread, the State Department updated its travel warning to include other popular tourist destinations in Mexico, including Cancún and Tulum.\n\nPuerto Vallarta is one of Mexico's most popular tourist destinations for Americans and Canadians. The area gained fame from the 70s and 80s show \"The Love Boat,\" which was often set there.\n\nThe Mexican government said the retaliatory violence came after it killed Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes, the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, on Sunday.\n\nThe State Department announced last week that it had sanctioned Kovay Gardens — a Mexican timeshare resort — and 17 other companies and five individuals linked to \"timeshare fraud schemes\" organized by the Jalisco cartel.\n\n\"Many of these individuals and entities are based in or near Puerto Vallarta, a popular tourist destination that also serves as a strategic stronghold for CJNG,\" a press release from the Treasury Department said.\n\nIn 2024, the US State Department said it would pay a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Cervantes. The department said that under Cervantes, the cartel has killed rival trafficking groups and law enforcement.",

    "description": "Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality increasing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Imageless electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) provides a non invasive alternative to electrical mapping from body surface potentials, but conventional ECGI is confined to epicardial reconstructions and can miss arrhythmias originating in deeper myocardium. We address this by reconstructing three dimensional cardiac activity with a volumetric formulation that solves an inverse source problem via Green's functions, enabling full volume activation mapping and improved localization in anatomically complex regions. We evaluate the approach on simulated premature ventricular beats and on four challenging patient cases, a right ventricular outflow tract premature ventricular contraction, a left bundle branch block, a ventricular tachycardia, and Wolff Parkinson White, and additionally assess performance on an open source myocardial infarction dataset. Results show that volumetric ECGI recovers 3D activation and sharpens arrhythmia origin localization, achieving a 59.",

    "fullText": "Oliver Glasner says it is \"absolutely OK\" to \"face criticism\" after some Crystal Palace fans again questioned his immediate future as manager.\n\nGlasner, who led the Eagles to their first major honour last May, said last month that he will leave the club when his contract expires in the summer.\n\nSome fans called for him to leave now during their Europa Conference League draw at Zrinjski Mostar in midweek, and a banner held during Sunday's Premier League win over bottom club Wolves said he is \"finished\".\n\nThat was the Eagles' first home win since early November and just their second overall since early December.\n\nAnother banner called the club's board \"inept\" as there had been \"opportunities missed\" since last season's FA Cup triumph.\n\nGlasner told Sky Sports after Sunday's 1-0 victory that he saw the banners and said: \"It's OK. The fans are as disappointed as we are and they can't talk to us directly, so it's their opportunity to express their mood.\n\n\"That's what we have to accept. On the other side, they supported the team right until the end and that's why I think they helped [us] to win the game. But when we face criticism, it's absolutely OK.\"\n\nAlthough Palace claimed their first win in 13 at Brighton two weeks ago, they then let a 2-0 lead slip to lose 3-2 at home to second-bottom Burnley.\n\nIn a news conference after Thursday's 1-1 draw in Bosnia, Glasner told disgruntled fans to \"stay humble\" and was far from convincing when asked whether he wants to stay at Selhurst Park until the summer, saying \"let's see what the future brings, you never know.\"\n\nOn if he has the drive to continue leading the club, he replied \"yes, I think so\" before adding \"I'm just not good enough to replace the players we sold. I'm just not good enough to integrate the new players to play the same way like we did, and I'm not good enough that we can cope with the schedule we had.\"\n\nBut Glasner provided more clarity after Sunday's game, stressing he remains committed to the club.\n\n\"For me, Oliver Glasner is not important,\" he told the BBC's Match of the Day. \"If the club had thought they need a change, then I don't want to be in the way. That is what I meant.\n\n\"I spoke to the board, to the chairman, to the sporting director and they said 'no, we think you are the right one'.\"\n\n'Stay humble' - Glasner reacts to fan backlash as future in doubt\n\nThe Austrian added: \"The most important thing is Crystal Palace, and I am here 100% to be successful for Crystal Palace.\n\n\"I need the players. It's important that the players are believing in what we are telling them - I and the staff. It's important that the club is believing in us, that we can get this turnaround and end this season successfully.\"\n\nThe Eagles were fortunate to beat Wolves, with Evann Guessand scoring a 90th-minute winner after the visitors missed a first-half penalty and spent more than 30 minutes with 10 men.\n\n\"Of course, the fans are like us all, disappointed with some results and some parts of the game. That's normal,\" said Glasner.\n\n\"I don't expect them to celebrate us when we don't win, when we don't perform right, but on the other side, since I was here, I felt support from the first day.\n\n\"Hopefully we face more wins and the mood around the club will be better and we will enjoy our life much more.\"\n\nLatest Crystal Palace news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Crystal Palace - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "For those who have followed Eberechi Eze's career, the sight of him wheeling away to celebrate an important goal towards the end of the season will not come as a surprise.\n\nTottenham Hotspur fans, though, will be happy not to come up against the Arsenal forward again until next season.\n\nEze has scored 40 Premier League goals in his six league seasons, with 19 coming from the 30th game onwards.\n\nBasically, the England international has a record of netting goals late in the campaign, when it matters most.\n\nEze, who scored the winning goal for Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final last season against Manchester City, has tormented Spurs since turning them down last summer to sign for the Gunners.\n\nHaving netted a hat-trick in the 4-1 north London derby win back in November, another two followed in Sunday's crucial encounter at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\n\"He had that belief and I'm really happy with him. He's really trying to mould and adapt into what we want from him,\" said boss Mikel Arteta.\n\nIronically, Eze's other league goal this season came against his former side Palace in a 1-0 win in October, which means all his league goals this term have come against those two teams.\n\nAnd after his brace in Arsenal's latest thumping of their rivals, only Robert Pires (seven) and Emmanuel Adebayor (six) have more Premier League goals for the Gunners against Tottenham than Eze's five.\n\nHe is also the first Arsenal player to score five or more goals against an opponent in the same top-flight season since Adebayor against Derby in 2007-08 (six).\n\nSupporters had already taken to the 27-year-old because of the way he signed for the club, turning down Spurs to join them instead in a £60m deal, but the goals he has scored are the icing on the cake.\n\nArsenal pass derby test of nerve as title race looks set to go to wire\n\nEze Arsenal's derby hero again as leaders sink Tudor's Spurs\n\n'Who's going to get this fine?' - Arteta on derby technology delays\n\nIt's been a difficult period for Eze, who has found minutes in the league hard to come by and this was was only his second start in the league since December.\n\nHe has a tough route into the team with captain Martin Odegaard a key part of Arteta's first-choice midfield when he is fit and Leandro Trossard being in good form on the left wing, which is the other position Eze might feature.\n\nThe Arsenal boss did trial Eze on the left, but he switched off when Matty Cash scored Aston Villa's opener in their 2-1 defeat in December and, despite starting the following game, he was left on the substitute's bench for the next four league matches.\n\nArteta opted to play England winger Bukayo Saka from the start in the disappointing 2-2 draw with Wolves in midweek as a number 10 - ahead of Eze, who started on the bench.\n\nAnd the Spaniard admitted: \"He was upset, even with me, because I didn't play him the other day from the beginning, and some of the decisions that I made. And I just have to understand how we're going to get the best out of him now.\"\n\nArteta was asked by BBC Sport whether Eze's record of producing goals at the end of the season was one of the reasons they signed him.\n\n\"We looked at every stat, but that one, to be very honest, no,\" he added while laughing.\n\n\"He scored five goals in the last few games against them, which is extremely difficult to do. But I could see that he wanted to prove something.\"\n\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel was in attendance at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Eze will have hoped to have caught his eye after a recent lack of game time to boost his World Cup hopes this summer.\n\n\"Today it's worked out, we thank God for it,\" Eze told Sky Sports. \"We put in a good performance. We did what we needed to do, which was the main thing.\n\n\"I'm always trying to get in those positions to be ready and to find the space and to work hard to get those opportunities. It takes a lot to get there and it's worked out today.\"\n\nIt was also an important day for Eze's team-mate Viktor Gyokeres.\n\nThe Swedish international has been criticised at times this season for his performances but since the turn of the year has started to find some form.\n\nAnd after a double himself at Spurs, no Premier League player has scored more goals in 2026 across all competitions than Gyokeres with eight of his 15 for his club coming in this calendar year.\n\nThe 27-year-old linked up with Eze and played a big part in Arsenal's third goal, while he seemed to visibly grow in confidence after scoring.\n\n\"For me, the best, the most complete, and especially when we need him most and that is when big players and big clubs have to stand up when you are needed,\" added Arteta when asked about his £64m summer signing from Sporting.\n\nArsenal are now five points clear of Manchester City, although they have played one more game and visit Pep Guardiola's men at Etihad Stadium in April - and Eze and Gyokeres look like they are starting to find the net at just the right time.\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Luke Littler won the Poland Darts Open title despite a nine-dart finish in the final from Gian van Veen.\n\nWorld champion Littler was in devastating form as he hit seven 180s on his way to an 8-4 victory and the £35,000 first prize.\n\nVan Veen, who also lost to Littler in the final of the World Championship, hit his first ever televised nine-darter but it was in vain as the Briton averaged just over 108 to overcome the Dutchman.\n\nVictory sees Littler become the inaugural champion at the tournament which is the first European Tour event to be held in Poland.\n\n\"It's been a very good weekend for myself,\" said Littler, who won his fifth European Tour title.\n\n\"I felt really good throughout the tournament. In the first three weeks of the Premier League I've not felt the best, so I definitely needed this one.\n\n\"I wanted to come here and win the title and that's what I've done. Most importantly it was about playing well, getting that average up and hitting my doubles.\"\n\nLittler beat Ross Smith, Josh Rock and Chris Dobey on Sunday to make the final, while Van Veen got past Nathan Aspinall, Wessel Nijman and world number two Luke Humphries.\n\nVan Veen took control of the match to go 3-2 up in the fifth leg when two 180s were followed up by a 141 finish in a perfect nine-dart leg.\n\nThe moment sparked Littler into life, however, who won the next four legs to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nVan Veen showed some resistance to claw a leg back, but Littler regained his composure to win the next two legs in just 28 darts to seal an 8-4 victory.\n\nThe European Tour will continue with the European Darts Trophy on 13 March as Aspinall bids to retain his crown in Gottingen.\n\nGian van Veen 7-5 Luke Humphries\n\nLuke Humphries 6-1 Stephen Bunting\n\nGian van Veen 6-2 Wessel Nijman\n\nMichael Smith 6-4 Jonny Clayton\n\nLuke Humphries 6-1 Boris Krcmar\n\nStephen Bunting 6-1 Jermaine Wattimena\n\nGian van Veen 6-5 Nathan Aspinall\n\nWessel Nijman 6-1 Cameron Menzies\n\nLittler thrashes De Decker at Polish Darts Open\n\nPremier League Darts 2026 fixtures, results and table",

    "fullText": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, launching a book tour widely seen as a prelude to a presidential run, discussed with CNN the possibility of running against former Vice President Kamala Harris, another longtime figure in California politics.\n\n“What happens if and when those parallel careers intersect and collide?” CNN’s Dana Bash asked Newsom in an interview that aired Sunday.\n\n“Well, I’m San Francisco now, she’s LA,” Newsom said at first. “So there’s a little distance between the two of us. You know, fate will determine that.”\n\n“I’ve never gotten in the way of her ambition, ever,” he added. “I haven’t. And I don’t imagine I would in the future.”\n\n“But if you run against each other for president,” Bash followed up. Newsom responded, “Yeah I just – that’s fate. I don’t – you know, you can only control what you can control.”\n\nNewsom has been forthright about his interest in the 2028 presidential race. Harris opted out of running to succeed Newsom as California governor but has left open the possibility of a third presidential bid.\n\nHarris served as district attorney in San Francisco before being elected the California attorney general and then a US senator before serving as vice president. Newsom was San Francisco’s mayor prior to becoming lieutenant governor and then governor.\n\nThe two have collided at times – Harris wrote in her most recent book, “107 Days,” that when she called Newsom to ask for his support after former President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid, Newsom texted back, “Hiking. Will call back,” and never did. (Newsom, who did endorse Harris quickly, later told reporters the call came from an unknown number.)\n\nSpeaking to Bash, Newsom emphasized that he would carefully weigh the decision with his family. Asked if his family was on board, Newsom responded, “I don’t know. It depends on the day.”\n\nAnd he shared concerns from one of his sons about a potential presidential bid.\n\n“My son … it was very powerful, texted me a few months ago when there was some headline that suggested that I made some decision, and he goes, ‘Dad, are you running (for) president?” Newsom said.\n\nHe continued, “I said, no, we’ll make this decision as a family. And he goes, you can’t. And I said, why? He goes, ‘I’m too young. You need to spend more time with us.’\n\n“I mean, how do you deal with that one?” he said.\n\n“How do you deal with that one?” Bash responded.\n\n“Exactly – I’m asking you,” Newsom replied with a smile.",

I think he'll be the man to beat at the World Championship this year.\"\n\nIn a first session with multiple swings of momentum, Higgins opened up a 2-0 lead before Zhao drew level.\n\nZhao went ahead for the first time to go 4-3 up, before Higgins won the next frame with a score of 90 to even the contest.\n\nThe pair continued to trade frames into the evening session before Zhao took control with successive centuries from 7-6 down as he went into the lead, before going on to see out the match with ease.",

    "description": "I chose a hypothetical scenario and asked ChatGPT to construct a retirement plan that would allow a retiree to live on $100,000 a year.",
    "fullText": "People use artificial intelligence (AI) for many things: meal planning, budgeting and interior design. But can you use a platform like ChatGPT for tasks that normally require a professional, like financial planning? \n\nI chose a hypothetical scenario and asked ChatGPT to construct a retirement plan that would allow a retiree to live on $100,000 a year. I assumed an annual income of $125,000 for a 40-year-old who wants to retire in a fully paid-off home in Tennessee at age 65. After setting the parameters (and asking ChatGPT if they were realistic) I asked the generative AI to create a retirement plan.\n\nThen, I asked Eric Franklin, CFP, managing principal at Prospero Wealth to review and assess it.\n\nWhen I first reached out, Franklin said it sounded interesting; he’d never been enlisted to critique an AI system before. With 23 years of tech experience, he was the perfect choice.\n\n“I had no idea what I was going to get,” he said.\n\nThe results were alarming. Not because ChatGPT’s output was immediately, obviously awful or right on the money.  It was scary because it fell into a gray area that artists call “the uncanny valley.”\n\nAt first glance, ChatGPT didn’t seem to be completely wrong.\n\nFind Out: Here’s How Much You Need To Retire With a $100K Lifestyle\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\n“I read it through and, at first, at the top level, it passed the sniff test. It looked fairly realistic,” Franklin said. “If I weren’t pushing on it too hard, I’d probably feel like it was somewhat accurate. Those were my first impressions.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the plan I presented was only one aspect of what financial advisors at Prospero Wealth offer clients. “It doesn’t include a lot of the things we’d normally include, like stress tests, accounting for changes in your career, changes in your family or possible relocations.”\n\nBut as Franklin dove deeper, he realized something that could be dangerous for anyone trying to use ChatGPT as a retirement planning tool without knowledge and experience to back it up.\n\nIt started with false premises, failed to adjust for inflation and created an unrealistic scenario. Granted, there were limitations in the exercise because the prompt was designed to be broad and concise. It was written by someone who is not a financial planner and intentionally didn’t flag anything that seemed off throughout the process. This prompt was designed for someone who thinks they can use ChatGPT to help them plan for retirement, plugging in basic information and expecting actionable insights. That probably describes a lot of people using ChatGPT.",

    "description": "General Caine warned Trump an attack on Iran would be \"far more difficult\" than the operation that captured Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is weighing options to avoid a major military conflict with Iran if the country does not ditch its nuclear program after General Dan “Raizin” Caine told him an attack would be “far more difficult” than the operation that captured Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, The New York Times reported on Sunday evening.\n\nThe report said Trump and key members of his administration are heading to Geneva on Thursday to meet with Iranian negotiators; the meeting appears to be a “last-ditch” effort to avoid a military conflict.\n\n“President Trump has told advisers that if diplomacy or any initial targeted U.S. attack does not lead Iran to give in to his demands that it give up its nuclear program, he will consider a much bigger attack in coming months intended to drive that country’s leaders from power,” the report said, based on “people briefed on internal administration deliberations.”\n\nThe Times story has four reporters on the byline — Julian E. Barnes, David E. Sanger, Tyler Pager, and Eric Schmitt.\n\nMembers of Trump’s team and on the Iranian side are both considering an “off-ramp to military conflict,” which would include a “very limited nuclear enrichment program” that would only be used for medical research, the report said. That is because some members of the administration have expressed “doubts” a full dismantling of Iran’s nuclear program occur, if the U.S. only conducts airstrikes.\n\nHere is a key section on Caine warning Trump that attacking Iran could be harder than first expected:\n\nDuring the discussions of the operation last month to seize President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, General Caine told Mr. Trump there was a high likelihood of success. But General Caine has not been able to deliver the same reassurances to Mr. Trump during the Iran discussions, in large measure because it is a far more difficult target.\n\n[Vice President JD] Vance, who has long called for more restraint in overseas military action, did not oppose a strike, but he intensely questioned General Caine and Mr. Ratcliffe in the meeting. He pressed them to share their opinions of the options and wanted more of a discussion of the risks and complexity of carrying out a strike against Iran.\n\nThe report comes a few days after CBS senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs reported top military officials told Trump the military is ready for a potential strike as soon as this weekend. And Axios’s Barak Ravid reported on February 18 that “a U.S. military operation in Iran would likely be a massive, weeks-long campaign that would look more like full-fledged war than last month’s pinpoint operation in Venezuela, sources say.”\n\nAll of this comes amid months of protests against Iran’s theocratic regime inside the country.\n\nThe Times report added Trump is leaving open the possibility for a “military assault later this year intended to help topple Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It appears this could go a number of ways heading into the big summit this Thursday.\n\nThe post US Mulling an ‘Off Ramp’ On Iran As Top General Advises Trump Iran Attack Would Be ‘Far More Difficult’ Than Venezuela: NYT first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Arsenal passed the north London derby test with flying colours as Premier League title race looks likely to go to the wire, says chief football writer Phil McNulty",
    "fullText": "Arsenal answered questions posed about their nerve under pressure in the most emphatic fashion in the north London derby to suggest this is a Premier League race that will go down to the wire.\n\nThe manner in which Mikel Arteta's side collapsed in losing a two-goal lead at doomed Wolverhampton Wanderers saw old uncertainties and past pain resurface as hunters Manchester City scented blood.\n\nIt made the meeting with arch-rivals Spurs even more hazardous, especially with the toxic air around this dysfunctional club partly cleared by the sacking of unpopular head coach Thomas Frank and his replacement by Igor Tudor.\n\nArsenal need not have worried as, even with the imposing figure of the giant Croatian prowling his technical area clad in black, they were the beneficiaries of the latest cure prescribed by \"Dr. Tottenham\", always on hand to provide help to any opponent in times of strife.\n\nThe Spurs stadium announcer attempted to rally the crowd with a growled pre-match message delivered at ear-splitting volume, bellowing: \"They are worried. They are nervous as hell. We are calm. We are ready. The fire is ready to be lit.\"\n\nSadly for Spurs, the final score on that one was zero out of five.\n\nArsenal were the furthest thing from \"nervous as hell.\" Spurs were the furthest thing from calm and ready. No fires lit here.\n\nSpurs were almost cruelly outclassed as Arsenal's advantage at the top of the table returned to five points, although Pep Guardiola's City have a game in hand.\n\nEze 'wanted to prove something' as he torments Spurs again\n\nEze Arsenal's derby hero again as leaders sink Tudor's Spurs\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nTo sum up this latest Premier League weekend, Manchester City threw down the gauntlet by closing the gap to two points with a tension-filled win against Newcastle United. Arsenal picked it up with relish in this thumping 4-1 win.\n\nIt means that even before the end of February, sights are starting to turn to what might just be a title decider between City and Arsenal at Etihad Stadium on 18 April.\n\nIn the interim, Arsenal have home games against Chelsea, Everton and Bournemouth, along with a visit to Brighton. City travel to Leeds United, West Ham and Chelsea, with relegation strugglers Nottingham Forest to come to the Etihad.\n\nAnd, of course, there might just be a psychological blow to be struck when Arsenal and City meet in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on Sunday 22 March.\n\nArsenal are now 10 games from the glory that has eluded them since Arsene Wenger's \"Invincibles\" in 2003-04. Destiny is their hands. The twist in the tale is that the same applies to Manchester City.\n\nFor all Arsenal might have wished to play down the significance of this single game in the title context, it was a win and performance they needed desperately to calm concerns on and off the pitch.\n\nAnd this was a consummate display, cool and measured with a ruthless edge, even if it came against this dreadfully poor Spurs side.\n\nEberechi Eze picked the perfect time to return to his best, playing his part as derby tormentor again with two goals to add to the three he got in the 4-1 win at Emirates Stadium in December.\n\nSince that hat-trick, Eze had featured in all 15 of Arsenal's subsequent league games, but had made only four starts and played just 360 minutes before this derby.\n\nIn his last start he was substituted at half-time against Brentford, so credit to Arteta for having the instinct to feel that this was the sort of occasion to suit him, deploying him in the \"number 10\" role against the club who thought they had signed him until Arsenal stepped in to clinch a £60m deal with Crystal Palace.\n\nAnd there was more good news with much-criticised striker Viktor Gyokeres also scoring two fine goals on a perfect day for the Gunners and their ecstatic fanbase.\n\nArsenal were not knocked out of their stride, even after Randal Kolo Muani's bustling equaliser for Spurs two minutes after Eze struck the first blow. This was a confident, reassuring performance.\n\nArteta told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"This was outstanding. I think you have to bring context to the situation and this is the beauty of football.\n\n\"You go to Wolves and you drop two points in the last kick of the match. Watching it back, there is no understanding from my perception how the hell that happened.\n\n\"It feels like the end of the world, but then you have another opportunity and that is the beauty of it. In a difficult stadium, against our rivals, and seeing how much it means to us in the league and all our supporters.\"\n\nHe added: \"This chapter we wanted to write. We have managed it.\"\n\nBBC Sport pundit Danny Murphy expects the race between the two to go right to the finishing line.\n\nHe said: \"The title race is still on massively for both. It's in both their hands, that's unusual. Normally it's in one team's hands and you are just waiting for them to slip up.\n\n\"I have been very much in the Arsenal camp in terms of my eyes telling me they are the best team. The last couple of results have given Man City that little bit of hope. They have a lot of players in the squad who have been there and done it.\n\n\"Speaking from experience, when you have got over the line, the next couple feel easier. Every time Arsenal go on the pitch the pressure is on at the minute. It's great for us and I hope it goes to the wire. I don't see any winning all games from now until the end of the season.\"\n\nArsenal's nerve was put the test. They passed - and more tests will come for the Gunners and Manchester City as the Premier League pursuit reaches its climax.\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team",

    "description": "Liverpool's late 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest puts the Reds firmly in the Champions League hunt after a \"robbery\" of a victory at the City Ground.",
    "fullText": "Carnage would be an understatement to describe the closing moments of Liverpool's victory at the City Ground, but it would not be over the top to call the win a heist - one that puts Arne Slot's side firmly in the Champions League hunt.\n\nThe fact that Nottingham Forest boss Vitor Pereira said he was \"angry with football\" summed it up. Forest did not deserve to lose.\n\nFor large parts of the afternoon, the home fans chanted \"In your head, Arne, Arne, Arne\" to the tune of Zombie by The Cranberries as Pereira's side dominated the defending champions.\n\nBefore today, Slot had failed to beat Forest in any of his previous three attempts as Liverpool boss.\n\nYet as the Liverpool players made their way to the away end after snatching a remarkable victory through Alexis Mac Allister, the same chant came from the travelling support, who could hardly believe their luck.\n\nLiverpool were dull for most parts but deserve praise for their resilience and the importance of Mac Allister's 97th-minute winner cannot be underestimated in the sense that it took Liverpool level on points with Chelsea and Manchester United, in fourth and fifth.\n\n\"It's one of the biggest robberies I've seen in the Premier League this season,\" said Jamie Carragher on Sky Sports.\n\nFor Slot, who has regularly insisted that Liverpool have been unfortunate on many an occasion this season, there was an acceptable that his side had finally got the rub of the green.\n\n\"My emotions were emotions of happiness and relief because this is the first time I have to do a different post match press conference,\" said Slot.\n\n\"We did not play a good game. We have been on the wrong side of the score after a good performance too many times.\n\n\"We got more than we deserved. A draw would have been a fair result. We needed to be on the right side of things once in a while. It felt we have been lucky.\"\n\nThe first was his disallowed goal that came after Stefan Ortega had made a great save to deny Hugo Ekitike. As Ola Aina tried to clear the ball, it hit Mac Allister and flew into the net. But what would have been a fortuitous goal was chalked off because the ball was deemed to have hit his elbow, which was tight to his body.\n\n\"It hit my back and my elbow. I understand the rule but if you understand football, that goal should have stood,\" Mac Allister told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The first half wasn't good at all; positioning, pressing, intensity. It was not our standard. The second half, I wouldn't say it was good but it was better,\" he added.\n\nMac Allister scores late winner in frantic finish at Forest\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nFor Liverpool, the journey back to Merseyside will be sweet. There really is nothing like a late winner, particularly in extra time of extra time as Slot stated, but the Dutchman will know that his team must improve.\n\nMohamed Salah had an off day and though he has upped his workrate off the ball since returning from the Africa Cup of Nations, he has now gone nine Premier League games without a goal.\n\nAgainst Forest he was replaced by Rio Ngumoha, who put in the cross that led to Mac Allister's disallowed goal, and once again showed exactly why he's so highly rated with an energetic performance.\n\n\"Ngumoha came on and had a bigger impact than Salah,\" was the verdict of BBC pundit Pat Nevin on Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"He absolutely changed the game, this kid,\" said Carragher.\n\nSlot added: \"He has incredible potential, otherwise, at 17 years of age, you don't play as many minutes as he does in the Premier League, let alone at Liverpool.\n\n\"I don't think there is any other 17-year-old who has played as many minutes in the Premier League.\n\n\"That tells you how much of a talent we think he is. He is making progress and that's why you see him playing more and more.\"\n\nNgumoha is yet to start a Premier League game for Liverpool but surely the wait won't be long now.\n\n\"He gets stronger and stronger,\" added Slot. \"Apart from his moment when he had his one-v-one, there were also one or two other moments where he stood his ground.\n\n\"For him to show this already at 17 years of age, it says something about his talent.\n\n\"But as we all know, talent is only the start of his career, you need so many other things. Macca is a great example of mentality and that is something you need to have a career at this level.\"\n\nLiverpool certainly didn't scintillate with their display in the Midlands but they showed the resilience of champions.\n\nAnd there is still plenty of life in their season yet.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Grounded until at least April, NASA’s giant moon rocket is headed back to the hangar this week for more repairs before astronauts climb aboard.\n\nThe space agency said Sunday it’s targeting Tuesday for the slow, four-mile (6.4-kilometer) trek across Kennedy Space Center, weather permitting.\n\nNASA had barely finished a repeat fueling test Thursday, to ensure dangerous hydrogen fuel leaks were plugged, when another problem cropped up.\n\nThis time, the rocket’s helium system malfunctioned, further delaying astronauts’ first trip to the moon in more than half a century.\n\nEngineers had just tamed the hydrogen leaks and settled on a March 6 launch date — already a month late — when the helium issue arose. The helium flow to the rocket's upper stage was disrupted; helium is needed to purge the engines and pressurize the fuel tanks.\n\n“Returning to the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy is required to determine the cause of the issue and fix it,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\nNASA said the quick rollback preps preserve an April launch attempt, but stressed that will depend on how the repairs go. The space agency has only a handful of days any given month to launch the crew of four around the moon and back.\n\nThe three Americans and one Canadian assigned to the Artemis II mission remain on standby in Houston. They will become the first people to fly to the moon since NASA's Apollo program that sent 24 astronauts there from 1968 through 1972.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "Wayne Gretzky is on hand for the men's gold medal game between the United States and Canada on Sunday.\n\nYou would think that it would be obvious that Gretzky, the Chosen One, would be rooting for Canada. Gretzky was born and raised in Canada. He's widely considered the greatest hockey player of all-time. But in recent years, Gretzky has been friendly with President Trump, who has threatened Canada and suggested that it could become America's 51st state.\n\nGretzky was asked who he'll be rooting for on Sunday. He's making it clear he's rooting for Canada.\n\n“I’m a hockey player. I’m a Canadian, a true Canadian. I want Canada 🇨🇦 to win a gold medal. I’ve never wavered from that. I’ve been friends with prime minsters and presidents. Somehow there’s been a little bit more tension than normal. At the end of the day, Canada and the US are like brothers and sisters, they’re gonna fight and argue but eventually they’ll come together. That’s the way I see it,\" he said.\n\nGretzky has faced criticism for his friendship and relationship with President Trump, amid the ongoing U.S.-Canada tensions.\n\nBut while Gretzky has faced criticism, he hasn't backed down.\n\n“People are going to say and believe what they want,” Gretzky said on an episode of the “100% Hockey” podcast co-hosted by Darren Millard and John Shannon. “The bottom line is, I know in my heart I’m Canadian, I’ve stayed Canadian and I’m a Canadian for life.”\n\nGretzky has been booed by some Canadians, which he's glad his late father hasn't been around to see.\n\n“You’ve got to take the good with the bad,” Gretzky said. “I’m glad he didn’t have to see it.”\n\nWhile Gretzky has been friendly with President Trump, he claims he's not really into politics.\n\n“I’m Canadian,” Gretzky said. “I can’t vote in the U.S. because I live in the U.S. and I’m Canadian. I can’t vote in Canada because I don’t live in Canada.\n\n“I’m not into politics. And so I can’t stop the prime minister from saying something. I can’t stop the president from saying something. I just kind of like, well, I’m just a hockey player, simple as that.”",

    "fullText": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. (AP) — Over and over, the Republicans and former Republicans who gathered just outside Washington this weekend warned that President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress are tearing at the very fabric of American democracy.\n\nA former congressman described the president's party as an “authoritarian-embracing cult.” A prominent conservative writer said Trumpism is an \"existential threat.\" And a retired Army general, his voice shaking with emotion, cited post-Nazi Germany as a roadmap for the nation's post-Trump recovery.\n\nIt's unclear how many people are listening.\n\nThe main convention hall at the sixth annual Principles First summit on Saturday and Sunday was half empty. About 750 chairs were set up in a room that could have fit thousands, and many were unfilled. Not a single current Republican elected official participated in the two-day program.\n\nThis is what remains of the Grand Old Party’s Never Trump movement, a coalition of Republicans, former Republicans and independents who banded together as Trump consolidated power. They largely remain political exiles — not quite at home among Democrats yet disgusted by how the president has abandoned Republicans' longstanding commitments to free trade and limited government.\n\nJohn McDowell, 69, who was a lifelong Republican before Trump’s emergence, acknowledged that the diminished group had virtually “zero” political clout within his former party.\n\n“It’s just a fact. We’re losing good people,” said McDowell, a former Capitol Hill staffer and county Republican official from San Carlos, California. “The party is becoming more and more MAGA-fied.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson dismissed all the criticism from what she called “a bunch of deranged has-been politicians.”\n\n“The only people who will pay attention to this event are the journalists who are forced to cover it,” she said.\n\nVirtually everyone who gathered at the hotel in National Harbor, Maryland, said they are rooting for Democratic victories in this fall's midterm elections. One of the only Democrats there was Conor Lamb, a former congressman from Pennsylvania who lost his party's primary to John Fetterman four years ago.\n\nDespite dire concerns, there was a slight sense of optimism among the half-empty convention hall and quiet hotel hallways.\n\nSeveral people cheered last week’s Supreme Court decision to strike down Trump’s tariffs, the economic tool he has wielded without congressional approval in his attempt to force friends and foes around the globe to bend to his will. Trump insisted he would implement a new round of tariffs despite the ruling.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a former Trump adviser, highlighted recent AP-NORC polling showing that 1 in 4 Republicans nationwide do not approve of Trump's job performance.\n\n“It’s like any show that’s on TV for a long time — the ratings start to go down. And the ratings are going down,” Christie said. “I am willing to bet you that by next February, this room is going to be twice the size of what it is now. After the midterms, you watch.”\n\nEx-MAGA diehard Rich Logis, wearing a red “I left MAGA hat,” hopes to see “an electoral revolt against MAGA” in the midterms.\n\n“I think there’s a shift in our country right now,\" he said. \"It happens slowly.\"\n\nLogis was promoting support groups for friends and family of Trump loyalists at a table outside the convention hall. Nearby, someone was selling books about how to escape cults.\n\nAt the podium, former Republican Rep. Joe Walsh implored Trump's critics not to downplay the seriousness of the threat the president poses to the nation.\n\n“He’s everything our founders feared. Say it. Believe it,” Walsh said. He said his former party is “an authoritarian-embracing cult\" and \"a threat to everything I love.”\n\nRetired Gen. Mark Hertling, who once commanded the U.S. Army's European forces, said he's “haunted” by allies who ask him “whether American institutions ever can be trusted again.”\n\n“Our nation's institutions have been shaken. Our alliances have been strained. Our credibility has been damaged. And our nation’s values have been cast aside,” Hertling said. He suggested the U.S. should look to the reconstruction of Germany after the defeat of Nazism if it hoped to to restore the damage caused by Trump and his allies.\n\nThe nation's recovery, he said as his voiced cracked, would be something people have to earn over many years.\n\nBill Kristol, who worked in previous Republican administrations and helped found the Weekly Standard magazine, described Trump and his Republican supporters in Congress as “an existential threat” to the nation. But he was also optimistic about the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nKristol said Democrats are “almost certain to win the House,” “could possibly win the Senate,” and have “a good chance to win the presidency” in 2028.\n\nBrittany Martinez, executive director of the host organization Principles First, also tried to cast an optimistic tone, even after describing the many reasons why she couldn't bear to continue her career as a Republican staffer on Capitol Hill.\n\n“I hope that Republicans continue to wake up,” she said. “I do think that those folks exist. And I hope that they exist in greater numbers.”",

    "description": "MOTD pundit Danny Murphy explains why, as well as Arsenal's superior quality in Sunday's north London derby, they exploited Tottenham's tactical weakness too.",
    "fullText": "Arsenal's superior quality ultimately showed in their 4-1 north London derby win, but they were also very clever with the way they exposed Tottenham's tactical weaknesses too.\n\nSpurs' 3-5-2 shape under new boss Igor Tudor, and the fact they did not just sit in, left space for Arsenal to exploit in forward areas on Sunday.\n\nThe Gunners ran away with the game in the end but, in the first half, when it was still in the balance, the area where they had the most attacking edge was down their right-hand side, where Bukayo Saka and Jurrien Timber were dominant.\n\nIt's never easy to stop a team like Arsenal when so many of their players are playing well, but what the Gunners did really well was produce moments of quality or skill in attack when it mattered.\n\nThey looked back to the levels we have seen them perform at for so long this season - this was a great performance by them, not just a brilliant result.\n\nArsenal pass derby test of nerve as title race looks set to go to wire\n\n'Who's going to get this fine?' - Arteta on derby technology delays\n\nEze 'wanted to prove something' as he torments Spurs again\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nTimber is one of the best attacking right-backs in the Premier League, if not the world, and I have seen him cause many teams problems with the way he mixes his runs up - sometimes he supports, sometimes he overlaps and he can make runs inside too. He is an intelligent footballer.\n\nSaka has had a few people question him recently, but against Spurs he was back on it and back to his confident best.\n\nWith the understanding those two have got, it was always going to be difficult to stop them down Arsenal's right but it was even harder for Spurs because they were reactive rather than proactive in dealing with the danger.\n\nAt times Xavi Simons, who was playing as a second striker, was having to run back to the left-back position to help. On other occasions it was Pape Matar Sarr coming over from midfield, or Mickey van de Ven covering from centre-half.\n\nSpurs' system saw Simons and Sarr left to cover long distances to get back and it also meant there was often a mixture of someone who is not used to defending in those areas - as Sarr was when he was left one-on-one with Saka for Arsenal's first goal - and also not being sure who was doing what, and when.\n\nThat's not ideal against any team, let alone one as good as Arsenal, and Mikel Arteta's side started getting more and more joy down that flank, with Timber often having time on the ball to pick his passes - like he did to find Viktor Gyokeres for their second goal.\n\nTottenham battled really well in the first half and, although the game got away from them after the break, it wasn't through any lack of effort.\n\nThey were set up okay too, but I think it did help Arsenal that Spurs were at home and under a new manager because they were expected to have a go rather than just park the bus.\n\nSpurs tried to press Arsenal at times which leaves you open to counter-attacks and also leaves space in behind, which the Gunners are good at exploiting.\n\nIn the second half, Arsenal's quality shone through and Tottenham looked tired - their lack of numbers because of injuries began to show.\n\nStill, what was impressive from Arsenal when they were 2-1 up is that they did not sit back and try to see out time.\n\nInstead, they were quite ruthless and kept coming forward. That's understandable when you think about what happened to them on Wednesday when they were pegged back by Wolves after leading 2-0.\n\nI wondered what would happen if they got in front this time, and they had obviously talked about what they would do differently.\n\nSo, from that point of view, because of the doubts over their mentality after their past couple of results, it was important to see them play so positively.\n\nThe same applies for some of their individual players, as well as the whole team.\n\nAs well as his two goals, Eberechi Eze had a great game overall. I was pleased for him because he has had a few question marks over his form recently, and we know he is a super talent.\n\nWith him playing so well in the central areas as a number 10, Tottenham's midfielders had something else to worry about - and being busy there meant they could not easily help deal with Saka and Timber out wide.\n\nDeclan Rice was making all these runs too, bursting forward to try to make amends for his mistake for Tottenham's equaliser, so there was all sorts going on.\n\nRice is always influential, of course, but he was especially impressive here. Instead of dwelling on his mistake, he used it to focus and bring more energy and clarity to what he was doing.\n\nWhen he dropped into defence after that, he played it simple and quick with his goalkeeper or centre-half - he didn't risk anything again.\n\nBut when he was going the other way, he was trying everything - making runs, getting on the end of knockdowns, bombing forward and occupying defenders.\n\nHe is always totally focused anyway so it is hard to judge exactly how much difference that mistake made to his performance but it felt to me like he actually upped his game, which takes great mental strength.\n\nThere have been times in the past where, when you are playing Arsenal, Saka and Odegaard are the two players you know you need to stop.\n\nTeams would think, if you can condense play in their areas, you can control them - and if it goes over to another part of the pitch, you can cope with it.\n\nOn Sunday, however, it felt like Arsenal were coming from every angle in the end. Eze, especially, was getting on the ball in these pockets of space in front of the Spurs defence.\n\nThat helped Gyokeres too, because it meant there was more room for him as well.\n\nGyokeres had started well anyway, and had a great early chance which he made himself, but this ended up being one of his best games in an Arsenal shirt.\n\nIt probably helped that he had a yard of pace on Radu Dragusin, who is not the quickest defender, but he played on him nicely and it was clever of him to stay on the left side.\n\nI remember watching a lot of Gyokeres' goals for Sporting and he liked to come off that flank a lot, and we have not seen him do it enough this season.\n\nThat might change now and, when he got his first goal, it was like the weight had been lifted off his shoulders.\n\nSome of the Arsenal fans who are not convinced by him are going to be more on his side now he has scored twice against Tottenham, and his goals were top quality too.\n\nI'd say that was one of his best games in an Arsenal shirt and to do it in a north London derby will do him the world of good.\n\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "description": "Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare and Sunderland winger Romaine Mundle have become the latest Premier League players to be sent racist abuse on social media this weekend.",
    "fullText": "Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare and Sunderland winger Romaine Mundle have become the latest Premier League players to be sent racist abuse on social media on an \"appalling weekend\" when four footballers from the top tier of the English game were targeted.\n\nArokodare and Mundle detailed their experiences on Sunday, a day after Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri and Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana both received racist abuse on Instagram after their sides drew 1-1 at Stamford Bridge.\n\n\"This has been an appalling weekend after four players called out the racist abuse they've received on social media,\" anti-discrimination group Kick It Out said on Sunday evening. \"But the sad fact is, we know it happens regularly.\n\n\"The message from them is loud and clear: action must follow. Players cannot be expected to tolerate this behaviour, and nor should anyone else.\"\n\nWolves said they were \"disgusted\" after Arokodare was sent abuse by \"multiple perpetrators\" following his side's 1-0 loss at Crystal Palace and they condemned the \"abhorrent and unlawful behaviour in the strongest possible terms\".\n\nBoth the Nigeria international and Wolves shared a number of screenshots of private messages the 25-year-old received after the game in which he had a first-half penalty saved, before Evann Guessand scored an injury-time Palace winner.\n\n\"It's still unbelievable to me that we're playing in a time where people have so much freedom to communicate such racism without any consequences,\" wrote Arokodare on his Instagram story.\n\n\"These individuals should have no place in our game and collectively we have to take action to punish everyone who taints the sport like this, no matter who they are.\"\n\nIn a statement, Wolves added: \"Tolu has our full and unwavering support. No player should be subjected to such hatred simply for doing their job.\n\n\"We stand firmly alongside him, and alongside all footballers who are forced to endure this abuse from anonymous accounts acting with apparent impunity.\n\nSunderland said they are \"appalled by the vile\" abuse Mundle received after his substitute appearance in the 3-1 home defeat by Fulham.\n\nThey said: \"The abhorrent behaviour displayed by multiple individuals is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the club under any circumstances.\n\n\"These individuals do not represent Sunderland AFC, our values, or our community - and they are not welcome on Wearside.\"\n\nThe Sunderland Echo reported the 22-year-old English forward has since deleted his Instagram account.\n\nIn February 2025 while playing in the Championship for the Black Cats, Mundle shared a discriminatory post sent to him on his Instagram account.\n\nWolves and Sunderland said they are working with the relevant authorities and online platforms to identify those responsible.\n\nThe Premier League condemned the abuse and said there are \"serious consequences for anybody found guilty of discrimination and we will offer our full support with their investigations\", which can include club bans and legal prosecution.\n\nOn Saturday, Frenchman Fofana wrote: \"2026, it's still the same thing, nothing changes. These people are never punished.\n\n\"You create big campaigns against racism, but nobody actually does anything.\"\n\nTunisia international Mejbri, 23, called on people to \"educate yourself and your kids\".\n\nThese latest incidences of racist abuse towards players follow the alleged racial abuse of Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr during last week's Champions League knockout round play-off tie at Benfica, which Uefa is investigating.\n\nIn a statement earlier on Sunday, Kick It Out said: \"Players are standing up to discrimination, and we've had record reports to Kick It Out from across football this season, but we recognise the frustration in how it continues to fester online.\n\n\"Words matter, but actions are more important. Football is working together to tackle this issue alongside the UK Football Policing Unit and Ofcom, but social media companies must do more to offer protections to players and help improve accountability when incidents occur.\n\n\"Those who face this disgusting abuse must always be the priority.\"\n\nResponding to the Fofana and Mejbri abuse, a spokesperson for Meta told BBC Sport: \"No-one should be subjected to racist abuse, and we remove this content when we find it.\n\n\"No one thing will stop racist behaviour overnight, but we'll continue working to protect our community from abuse and co-operate with police investigations.\"\n\nLast November, a BBC investigation found more than 2,000 extremely abusive social media posts - including death and rape threats - were sent about managers and players in the Premier League and Women's Super League in a single weekend.\n\nThe season-opening Premier League game between Liverpool and Bournemouth last August was stopped in the first half after then-Cherries forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by someone in the Anfield crowd.\n\nA Liverpool man has denied the abuse and his trial is scheduled to take place in April.\n\nIn January, Newcastle United said they had contacted the police after midfielder Joe Willock was the subject of \"disgusting\" racial abuse and \"deeply disturbing threats\" on social media.\n\nTottenham forward Mathys Tel was also the subject of racist abuse on social media after being one of two Spurs players to miss in their Super Cup penalty shootout defeat by Paris St-Germain in August.\n\nEngland defender Jess Carter was another target of racist abuse during Euro 2025 in July.\n\nAnd England internationals Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were all subjected to racism in the aftermath of the Euro 2020 final, which the Three Lions lost to Italy in a penalty shootout.\n\nLatest Wolves news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Wolves - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "The Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics have officially ended following the closing ceremony in northern Italy.\n\nIt took place at Verona Olympic Arena, despite none of the sporting events happening in the city, which is 75 miles from Milan.\n\nAfter beginning with a tribute to classic Italian opera, flagbearers representing the 92 competing nations entered the stadium through large props from Aida and accompanied by a tribute to Italian film music.\n\nThe 'Drop of Fire' – the Olympic flame carried in a small glass vessel – was brought into the ancient arena to light up the rings before the parade of athletes.\n\nWhile athletes are supposed to come in all mixed together, here they were still largely in national groups.\n\nThe final medals from Milan-Cortina 2026 were awarded in the women's and men's 50km mass start cross-country skiing events, before a tribute to the Games volunteers.\n\nThe ceremony finished with performances from popular Italian musicians Major Lazer and singer-songwriter Achille Lauro.\n\nIn her speech to close the Games, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Kirsty Coventry said: \"You have been incredible – every one of you. Brave. Fearless. Full of heart and passion. You left it all on the snow and ice.\n\n\"Two unforgettable weeks, living every moment to the fullest. You gave everything – and you shared it with all of us.\n\n\"This is the true Olympic spirit: competing, embracing, lifting each other up, whatever the result. You showed us what excellence, respect, and friendship look like in a world that sometimes forgets these values.\n\n\"You showed us that the Olympic Games are a place for everyone. A place where sport brings us together.\"\n\nIt ended a Games which saw 116 medal events, and historic sporting success for several of the competing nations – including Great Britain.\n\nTeam GB won five medals, including three golds, to finish 15th in the table. Britain has never previously won more than one gold at a Games before.\n\nMatt Weston, the male flagbearer, won two golds in skeleton – the men's event and the team competition with Tabby Stoeker.\n\nThe female GB flagbearer was Charlotte Bankes, who won gold in the team snowboard cross with Huw Nightingale; it was the first Olympic event on snow won by British athletes.\n\nTeam GB also won silver in the men's curling, while Zoe Atkin claimed bronze in women's ski halfpipe on the final day.\n\nBrazil's Lucas Pinheiro Braathen took the men's giant slalom title to register a first Winter Olympic gold won by a South American nation.\n\nWhy 2026 marks a Winter Olympic turning point for Team GB\n\nWeird and wonderful stories from the Winter Olympics\n\nUSA win men's Olympic ice hockey gold for first time in 46 years\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nGeorgia earned their first Winter Olympic medal with silver in pairs figure skating, while Spain collected their first gold medal for 54 years in the men's ski mountaineering. Benin, Guinea-Bissau and United Arab Emirates competed in their first Winter Games.\n\nFor hosts Italy, Milan-Cortina marked their best Winter Games with 10 golds among 30 medals to put them fourth in the table.\n\nNorway topped the medals table for the fourth successive Games. They collected 18 medals, including six for Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo, the king of cross-country skiing.\n\nHad Klaebo, who set a record for the most golds won by an individual athlete at a single Games, competed as a nation on his own, he would have been ninth in the medal table. Fittingly, his sixth gold - in the men's 50km cross-country skiing - was presented at the closing ceremony as the final medal awarded at the Games.\n\nThe oldest individual medallist was Elana Meyers Taylor of the United States, who broke the Games record by winning monobob gold, aged 41.\n\nSkiing great Lindsey Vonn saw her Olympic career end with a broken leg.\n\nThe Games also had controversial moments.\n\nUkraine's Vladyslav Heraskevych wished to compete in the men's skeleton while wearing a remembrance helmet featuring artwork depicting athletes killed during the Russian invasion of his country.\n\nBut the IOC said this contravened Games rules and, after Heraskevych refused to back down, disqualified him from competing.\n\nThere was also a silver medal, in men's ski mountaineering, for Russian athlete Nikita Filippov. He competed as an Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) because Russia were banned from the Games because of their aggression in Ukraine.\n\nFilippov, along with other AIN competitors, was allowed to take part in the closing ceremony having been banned from the opening event.\n\nMen's curling gold medallists Canada had their campaign dogged by allegations of cheating.\n\nThe ceremony included the handover of the Olympic flag to the delegation representing the French Alps, which will host the next Winter Games in 2030.\n\nThe presidents of the two French regions to host the Games, Renaud Muselier and Fabrice Pannekoucke, enthusiastically accepted the flag from Coventry.\n\nThere was a performance of the sixth verse of La Marseillaise, the French national anthem, as it was deemed to be more universal and less patriotic. The arrangement changed throughout into a more contemporary style with an electronic base.\n\nAs well as a video showcasing the Alps, there was also a performance by 25 musicians and 24 athletes – the first time Olympians have featured in the artistic elements of the closing ceremony.\n\nRelive the 2026 Winter Olympics on BBC iPlayer (UK only)",

    "description": "After a defeat for Celtic and surprise draw for Rangers, where does the latest weekend of drama leave the Scottish Premiership title race?",
    "fullText": "\"The two teams from Glasgow have buckled under the pressure.\"\n\nThat was the assessment of former Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart after the Scottish Premiership title race delivered yet another weekend of high drama.\n\nWith Rangers held to a 2-2 draw at bottom club Livingston and defending champions Celtic beaten at home by Hibernian on Sunday, Hearts boss Derek McInnes must have been watching on with a big grin.\n\nHaving eked out a narrow win over Falkirk 24 hours earlier his side now lead Rangers by four points and Celtic - who have played a game fewer than the teams above them - by six with 10 matches left.\n\nThe other big winners over the weekend were fourth-placed Motherwell, with their 5-0 thumping of St Mirren.\n\nJens Berthel Askou's side also have a game in hand on the top two, trailing Hearts by 10 points.\n\nThey have only conceded three goals in their past 15 matches and lost once in 19, all while playing the most expansive football in the top flight.\n\n\"Motherwell win emphatically, Hearts win as well and that applies pressure,\" Stewart said.\n\n\"The two teams from Glasgow have buckled under the pressure.\n\n\"It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Motherwell could finish above Celtic or Rangers, maybe both of them.\n\n\"Celtic and Rangers could be third and fourth in the table.\"\n\nNext weekend follows a similar pattern as Hearts and Motherwell play at home on Saturday - against Aberdeen and Dundee United respectively - before Rangers host Celtic in the derby on Sunday.\n\nMotherwell could be just one point behind Celtic by then, while Hearts could be seven clear of Rangers and nine above Martin O'Neill's side.\n\n\"It looks like Hearts are the team that can only throw it away,\" former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner said. \"They are in an unbelievable position.\"\n\nStewart added: \"Everything is on the line. The permutations from all these games are incredible. That's what makes this season so exciting.\"\n\nPodcast: Reaction to day of title drama as Celtic lose & Rangers draw\n\nRangers scramble draw at 10-man Livingston\n\nHibs stun Celtic with late Andrews winner\n\nIt is no secret things are far from rosy at Parkhead, with fan protests during almost every home match.\n\nO'Neill is in charge until the end of the season - his second interim spell in this chaotic campaign - and cracks are starting to appear despite the Northern Irishman's legendary status at the club.\n\nSupporters continue to demand boardroom change, there are obvious holes in O'Neill's squad and they have now lost seven league matches. That's as many as they lost in the previous two seasons combined.\n\nCeltic fell behind to Felix Passlack's header and rallied to equalise through Benjamin Nygren's 18th goal of the season, but went down to 10 men when centre-back Auston Trusty was sent off for violent conduct.\n\nKai Andrews fired in a late winner for Hibs, making it successive defeats for Celtic after Thursday's Europa League reverse against Stuttgart.\n\n\"It's a setback, that's all it is,\" O'Neill said. \"We're still in the race.\n\n\"I thought we were absolutely terrific. The players put heart and soul into the game. No complaints on that side whatsoever.\n\n\"We've been chasing for months now. There's not much room for error but we can still fight back. The players are disappointed but it's not over.\"\n\nDespite O'Neill's defence of his players, others were less complimentary.\n\n\"It all changed with Trusty's sending off,\" Bonner said. \"Hibs handled the game very well after that.\n\n\"Celtic couldn't get any momentum and it's a brilliant goal from Kai Andrews. Celtic didn't create anything. They ran out of luck.\"\n\nO'Neill brought in Tomas Cvancara, Junior Adamu and Joel Mvuka to bolster his attacking options in January, but Adamu was an unused substitute against Hibs and Mvuka wasn't in the matchday squad.\n\n\"Without doubt, there is a lack of cutting edge at Celtic,\" Stewart said.\n\n\"What's up with Adamu? They need a goal and they put on [Daizen] Maeda, who is nowhere near the levels he was at before.\"\n\nWhile some would have tipped Hibs to get a result at Celtic Park, Rangers were expected to continue their excellent recent form at Livingston, who have won only once in the Premiership all season.\n\nHowever, Marvin Bartley's side profited from two set-pieces to take a two-goal lead.\n\nGoalkeeper Jerome Prior made a string of superb saves and there were several last-ditch challenges as the West Lothian outfit kept Rangers at bay.\n\nBut Cristian Montano's sending off on the hour mark sparked a Rangers onslaught and they drew level through Emmanuel Fernandez's strike and Mikey Moore's header.\n\nThere was late controversy too as Moore was wiped out by Cammy Kerr when through on goal.\n\nReferee Ryan Lee gave no foul and video assistant referee David Dickinson ruled the incident to be outside the box and not denying a goalscoring opportunity.\n\n\"It had a bit of everything,\" former Rangers midfielder Kevin Thomson said.\n\n\"Livingston were terrific. Marvin Bartley will be delighted - he would have taken a point before the game.\n\n\"For Rangers - too much huffing and puffing, they lacked a little bit in the final third.\"\n\nHead coach Danny Rohl was baffled his side were not given the chance to take all three points from the penalty spot.\n\n\"I can't understand when you see the replay and it's a clear foul, then the decision. In my view it was on the line and it's a penalty,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a clear foul. Mikey said to me and you see on the replay. It's a pen but we have to move forward.\"\n\nWith next Sunday's Old Firm derby looming large, Rohl is relishing the run-in.\n\n\"We showed again our comeback character,\" he said. \"Ten games to go and it is an exciting race.\n\n\"We are disappointed but we go again. We have to carry on. We cannot think too much about the past and I totally believe, the players believe, the club believe and the supporters believe we can do it.\n\n\"We showed against Hearts that we can beat top of the league. Next week we have the next challenge. We will hunt again and again.\"",

    "fullText": "McDonald’s Big Arch burger is rumored to finally make its way to the U.S. after appearing on overseas menus.\n\nThe burger is described as two Quarter Pounder patties, three slices of white cheddar, two types of onions, and a new Big Arch sauce.\n\nFans in the comments are hyped to try it, with reports pointing to an early March rollout.\n\nSomething very large may be heading to McDonald's menus in the U.S., and the internet has already started planning accordingly.\n\nFood blogger Snackolator recently posted about a rumored new burger called the Big Arch, describing it as a stacked situation with two Quarter Pounder patties, slivered onions, crispy onions, three slices of white cheddar, and an all-new Big Arch sauce. The comment section is already sold (and likely drooling on their screens). \"I've been eyeing this one! Happy is finally coming!\" one person wrote, while another skipped straight to logistics with a simple \"Let's go.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time the Big Arch has popped up, though. McDonald's had already been testing a larger-format burger in three international markets as far back as 2024, including Portugal and Canada. Since then, it's shown up on menus overseas—and in the U.K., it's not even a test anymore. It's a permanent item.\n\nWhich might explain why some people seem a little too ready for it to land here. \"Just what I been waiting for!! 😋” one commenter said, while someone else admitted, \"I'm embarrassed by how excited I am.\"\n\nAs for whether it's actually headed stateside soon, Snackolator claims a March 3 drop. And judging by the replies, at least a few people already know exactly what they're doing if it shows up. My advice? Wear a dark shirt and maybe bring some extra napkins from home.\n\nInsanely Easy Weeknight Dinners To Try This Week\n\n29 Insanely Delicious Vodka Cocktails",

    "fullText": "PEORIA – The Eddie Bauer store situated in The Shoppes at Grand Prairie has shut down.\n\nA “store closed” sign hangs in the windows, and up above, only a faint shadow of the brand’s moniker remains.\n\nThe Shoppes at Grand Prairie management did not return multiple Journal Star phone calls or emails regarding future plans for the space.\n\nThe fate of the company’s remaining storefronts currently hangs in the balance. Earlier this month, Eddie Bauer LLC voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement with secured lenders.\n\nA press release about the development said the company planned to “conduct liquidation sales at its stores while continuing to pursue an ongoing sale process.” Storefronts in the United States and Canada will continue operating for now, and the company said it may “depart from a full wind down of operations” if there is a sale.\n\nCatalyst Brands CEO Marc Rosen said the company has faced supply chain issues, declining sales and other challenges.\n\n“Over the past year, these challenges have been exacerbated by various headwinds, including increased costs of doing business due to inflation, ongoing tariff uncertainty, and other factors,” Rosen said. “While the leadership team at Catalyst was able to make significant strides in the brand, including rapid improvements in product development and marketing, those changes could not be implemented fast enough to fully address the challenges created over several years.”\n\nOnline operations and wholesale will continue, the press release said, as it is handled by a separate LLC. Storefronts outside the US and Canada are also separately operated.\n\nMore: Prominent spot next to popular Peoria restaurant listed for sale\n\nThis article originally appeared on Journal Star: Clothing brand closes Peoria store, fate of other locations uncertain",

    "description": "Mexican drug lord Nemesio Oseguera, commonly known as 'El Mencho,' infamous for the bloody trail of bodies he left behind in battles with government",
    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Mexican drug lord Nemesio Oseguera, commonly known as 'El Mencho,' infamous for the bloody trail of bodies he left behind in battles with government forces and rival gangs, died in a military raid on Sunday.\n\nAn ex-police officer, Oseguera, 60, was the shadowy leader ‌of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), an international criminal enterprise widely viewed as one of Mexico's most powerful.\n\nOver a relatively short period of time, Oseguera masterminded ‌the CJNG's emergence as a criminal empire rivaling his former allies in the Sinaloa Cartel. He managed to evade arrest for years despite a $15 million bounty from the U.S. for information leading to his arrest or ​capture.\n\nCJNG has been blamed for smuggling vast quantities of drugs into the U.S., including the synthetic opioid fentanyl, which has been linked to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths in recent years.\n\n\"Apart from the heads of the Sinaloa cartel, 'El Mencho' has been the biggest prize for many, many years,\" said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a security expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"And it’s really stunning, just like the heads of the Sinaloa cartel, how long he managed to evade U.S. and Mexican law enforcement gunning for him.”\n\nArguably Mexico's most influential crime boss after captured ‌kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, now in a U.S. prison, Oseguera diversified ⁠into rackets such as stolen fuel, forced labor and human trafficking.\n\nBut unlike Guzman, who became a media celebrity, El Mencho preferred to remain in relative obscurity. He achieved notoriety for expletive-laden recordings leaked on social media in which he threatened enemies and officials.\n\nOseguera was also known ⁠for evading capture in spectacular fashion. In May 2015, as Mexican forces closed in on him, his tipped-off henchmen shot down a military helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade to give their boss time to escape.\n\nTargets of his hit men were rarely so lucky. His gang routinely employed beheadings and other gory means of intimidation.\n\nIn one six-week period in 2015, the gang killed two dozen police in ​western ​Mexico as a warning to authorities.\n\nIn 2020, Mexico City's then chief of police Omar Garcia Harfuch survived ​an assassination attempt that killed two of his bodyguards in an ‌attack authorities blamed on the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Harfuch is now the country's security chief and helped oversee the operation against Oseguera.\n\nOseguera was born in 1966 in a poor village in the mountains of the rugged and notoriously lawless western state of Michoacan. There, cultivation of opium poppies and marijuana have competed with avocado production for decades.\n\nAs a boy, he worked the fields, and later went to seek his fortune in the U.S., where prosecutors said he got into the heroin trade. After a few years, he was arrested and served time in a U.S. prison.\n\nHe was deported back to Mexico, where he joined the police before entering the Milenio Cartel, a satellite of the Sinaloa Cartel. Eventually, he ‌became a top enforcer after stints as a sicario, or cartel assassin.\n\nAfter a failed attempt at taking ​over the Milenio Cartel, he struck out alone, declared war on Sinaloa, and founded the CJNG in alliance ​with a local gang of money launderers.\n\nThe cartel is named for the western ​state of Jalisco, home to one of Mexico's largest cities, Guadalajara.\n\nThe CJNG mixed Sinaloa-style drug trafficking and community outreach with the ultra-violent methods ‌of the Zetas Cartel, a gang that used paramilitary tactics to diversify ​into criminal enterprises such as extortion and ​kidnapping.\n\nFor years, Oseguera paid off police to cover his back as he operated with near-total impunity inside Jalisco. He also sought political protection.\n\n\"El Mencho's Jalisco New Generation Cartel was one of the biggest buyers of politicians and political campaigns, which has given it an enormous social base,\" said Edgardo Buscaglia, an organized crime expert at ​Columbia University.\n\nNoting El Mencho's ability to win public support, ‌Buscaglia pointed to footage broadcast during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic of people lining up for CJNG-stamped food packages handed out by cartel gunmen, not government ​workers, to help cushion the economic blow of lockdowns.\n\n\"Compared to the Mexican government,\" said Buscaglia, \"he was the least bad option.\"",
