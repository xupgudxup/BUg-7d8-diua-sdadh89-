    "fullText": "Formula E is aiming to expand the calendar further for the arrival of Gen4 cars in the 2026-27 season, which is set to feature 18 to 19 races.\n\nThe ongoing 2025-26 campaign already features a record 17 races across 11 venues with the addition of Madrid and Sanya, although Jakarta has been dropped.\n\nWhile the final 2025-26 calendar wasn’t announced until October last year, Formula E is working hard to finalise the schedule for the first season under Gen4 regulations.\n\nWith the new breed of Formula E cars set to be both bigger and more powerful than their predecessors, the championship is holding talks with various promoters to ensure the track layouts are both safe and conducive to racing.\n\nFormula E is planning to submit the calendar to FIA’s World Motor Sport Council for approval in March, a month before it officially showcases its Gen4 car to the public as part of a mega launch event.\n\nAsked how many cities Formula E is expected to visit in 2026-27, Formula E’s chief championship officer Alberto Longo told Motorsport.com: “If I have to tell you a figure, I would most likely go for 18, 18 to 19 races. That would mean 12 to 13 venues.”\n\nFormula E CEO Jeff Dodds reiterated the series’ plan to gradually expand its schedule, saying it aims to stage as many as 22 races a year by the end of the decade.\n\n“I've always said we aim to add at least one race a year out to 2030, and if we do that, we'll have between 20 and 22 races by the time we get to 2030, which I think is about the right number for us,” Dodds told Motorsport.com.\n\nSince the inception of the championship, Formula E has held races at six different venues in the United States, including three different circuits – permanent or temporary – in Miami alone.\n\nWhile Miami Autodrome is expected to again feature on the 2026-27 calendar after making its debut in January this year, Formula E has also been holding talks  for up to four years for a second venue in the US.\n\nBoth Longo and Dodds say negotiations have reached a stage where hosting two races in the US now seems realistic, with North America remaining an important market for Formula E.\n\n“I would say we are 70-80% there, so most likely it will happen,” Longo said when asked about the chances of another US city joining Miami on the calendar.\n\n“We are talking with six cities at the moment in the US. We have had conversations with 11, but at the moment we are talking to six different cities.”\n\n“A second race in the US is very realistic,” Dodds added. “I've always said two races in China and two races in North America. There's a slight difference between North America and the US because they're different things.”\n\nFormula E is understood to be evaluating both street circuits and permanent tracks in North America, including Toronto in Canada, as it moves to finalise the calendar over the next month.\n\n“We like Phoenix as a street circuit, we've met the team there many times; we looked at Atlanta as a street race, we've talked to Detroit, we've talked to Denver, we've talked to Toronto, CoTA in Austin, Laguna Seca we've looked at,” Dodds revealed.\n\n“The beauty of the US is it's got so many good locations, we're looking at lots of them.\n\n“We've got a narrowed-down list of two or three [venues], but I'm pretty confident we would want Miami on the calendar for next year.\n\n“We learnt a lot from the first Miami race, we'd love that to be a home and then to introduce a second long-term home as well.”\n\nFormula E to adopt WEC-style ‘joker’ upgrade system for Gen4\n\nMahindra to begin Gen4 testing in May after delayed board approval\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Yankees trade may pay delayed dividends in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJake Bird did not hit the ground running with the New York Yankees.\n\nHe was one of the relief pitchers the Yanks acquired at last season's trade deadline, coming over from the Colorado Rockies with a lot of reasons to believe in him. And then he got shelled.\n\nThe good news for the Yankees and Bird, though, is that he's still with their organization. He has a shot at redemption.\n\nMLB.com's Bryan Hoch goes so far as to predict Bird as the ideal dark horse to find his way onto the Opening Day roster.\n\n\"Bird allowed seven runs (six earned) in two innings after being acquired from the Rockies last July, then spent the rest of the year in Triple-A,\" Hoch writes. \"That wasn’t the best first impression, but the 30-year-old looks different early in camp, crediting a full offseason working with the Yankees' pitching department. If he continues to generate ground balls and whiffs, Bird could be a nice bullpen find.\"\n\nMORE: Yankees making history not done since 1889 Chicago White Stockings\n\nThat had been of a surprisingly bad small sample size for Bird.\n\nHe had a 4.73 ERA with the Rockies before being traded to the Bronx, which you'd think is at least a little inflated by playing at Coors Field. Bird was also striking out 10.5 batters per nine innings in 2025.\n\nHis strikeout metrics last season were by far the best of his career, so the fear for Yankees fans would be that he was pitching over his head and simply regressed to who he had been before.\n\nBird was desired by more than just the Yanks at the deadline, though.

    "fullText": "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford has been dealt a major setback in his bid to complete a permanent move to Barcelona after a candid admission by presidential candidate Xavier Vilajoana.\n\nRashford has enjoyed a dramatic uptick in form and fortunes since he left United last summer and sealed a season-long loan switch to Barcelona.\n\nHaving been exiled from the first team by now-sacked head coach Ruben Amorim, Rashford faced an uphill task to get back into form, but he certainly made light work of it. He wasted no time in breaking into the Barcelona team and becoming a key player in their push to defend their La Liga crown.\n\nThe England international has made 21 top-flight appearances this term, contributing an impressive four goals and eight assists. He has notched 10 goals and 13 assists across all competitions.\n\nBarcelona retain the option to keep him permanently for £26million. There had been suggestions that the Blaugrana wanted to negotiate a fee reduction but United have made it clear that they will not slash their asking price.\n\nMeanwhile, Rashford has made no secret of his desire to stay at Camp Nou. However, a report covered by The Peoples Person relayed that a deal is contingent on Joan Laporta winning the upcoming presidential elections. Laporta, who sanctioned a swoop for Rashford last summer, has made keeping the forward a cornerstone of his re-election agenda.\n\nNow, another candidate has dealt a blow to Rashford, indicating that if he wins, he is likely to prioritise a move for Jan Virgili ahead of Rashford.\n\nBarcelona sold Virgili to Mallorca a year ago. He has done well there, currently boasting six assists for them in La Liga during his first season of senior football. Rashford boasts better numbers but is nine years older.\n\nVilajoana, who was head of La Masia while Virgili was coming through the ranks, said [as quoted by the Manchester Evening News], “I am someone who believes you should always look in-house first, as I’ve always said, and then look outside depending on the characteristics of the players you have.”\n\n“For example, I want to give the example of Jan Virgili, who is currently playing for Mallorca. He’s a great winger. I would maybe look at [exercising the clause to re-sign him] as an option, for example, rather than paying the Rashford clause.”\n\n“That said, it’s not just the president who arrives and makes the decision. The president arrives, puts things on the table, alternatives are considered, it’s discussed, and a decision is made.”\n\nHe added, “What I am clear on is that if [signing Rashford] is considered to be the best decision from a sporting point of view, the money will be there to make it happen.”\n\nMeanwhile, United return to action this evening when they face Everton at the Hill Dickinson Stadium. Kick-off is at 8pm.\n\nFeatured image Mike Hewitt via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Jacob Bridgeman has opened up on what Tiger Woods said to him after he won the Genesis Invitational at Riviera on Sunday, picking up his first-ever PGA Tour win.\n\nIf you had told viewers before the final round of the Genesis Invitational that it would be decided by a single shot, they might have assumed Jacob Bridgeman had let it slip.\n\nThe 26-year-old entered the final day at Riviera with a six-shot lead and was rarely under serious pressure until late in the round.\n\nIt came down to a four-foot par putt on the last, which he rolled in to hold off Kurt Kitayama and Rory McIlroy and got to shake hands with Tiger Woods afterwards.\n\nHolding his nerve, Bridgeman successfully secured his maiden victory at one of the PGA Tour’s most iconic venues.\n\nRiviera has proven a tough venue for even the biggest names in golf. Jack Nicklaus, Scottie Scheffler, and McIlroy have all left without a trophy there.\n\nAnd even Woods never got his hands on that title. After the final round, Bridgeman shared what the 15-time major champion said to him about it during their conversation.\n\n“I don’t know what he said when I first walked up the hill, but walking down the hill he was saying kind of how amazing walking down and seeing the amphitheater and all the people, how amazing the 18th hole is here and how cool it is to win here. And he said, You’ve got one on me. So I guess he’s never won yet. I got one thing. He’s got all the other ones, but I got one,” the 26-year-old said.\n\nIt would have been a huge boost for the PGA Tour had Woods been able to play this week. Even though he is no longer at his peak, his presence still draws more attention than anyone else in the sport.\n\nPlayers around the tour still seem to be in awe of the 50-year-old, and Bridgeman spoke about what it meant to win at an event hosted by Woods.\n\n“Knowing he was the one to be waiting to shake the winner’s hand made it definitely a little bit more nerve-racking just because when I was growing up, my youngest golf memory was watching him on TV. When he was in his prime, I was learning to talk and walk and play golf.\n\n“He’s the best player of all time by far. I think some of the things that he’s done on the golf course are incredible, will never be beaten. I’m still kind of in awe of him, and if you ever wanted to pass some time, just look up some Tiger Woods highlights, it’s pretty incredible,” he concluded.\n\nJacob Bridgeman reacts to Trevor Lawrence and Dabo Swinney messages after Genesis Invitational win\n\nJordan Spieth makes firm vow to avoid repeat on PGA Tour after controversy in 2025",

    "fullText": "Viktor Gyokeres was the star of the show and the Player of the Match winner in Arsenal’s 4-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, scoring a brace to reach double figures for Premier League goals this season.\n\nSpeaking after the game, former Arsenal forward Theo Walcott praised Gyokeres’ performance as one of the best he’s seen from the player this season.\n\n“Not just the goals, I felt today he really commanded that position,” Walcott told Sky Sports. “What was smart, at no point did he go see van de Ven. He knew where the weakness was in that Tottenham team.”\n\n“He showed everything that we expect him to bring to this league,” Walcott added. “He brought the best out of the other players around him as well. And that’s what we want to see, that’s what we expected to see coming into this league.\n\n“Massive signing, it’s one of those where you want to give him time, but if they want to win the league he hasn’t been fortunate to have that time. For me, that was the best performance I’ve ever seen from him.\n\n“They played to his strengths today and I think that’s when you’re going to get the best out of Gyokeres. Very confident right now, and that’s what they’re going to need.”\n\nWalcott is right to suggest it wasn’t just Gyokeres’ two goals that made it a good display.\n\nThe striker had an early header well blocked, he went close with a curling effort towards the far post, he set up a great chance for William Saliba with a clever corner routine, and his lay-off to Bukayo Saka ultimately led to Arsenal’s third goal – scored by Eberechi Eze.\n\nGyokeres has certainly had games this season where he’s been less impactful, but he easily could have been involved in three or four goals on this occasion. As for the two he did score, they were both very well taken and well deserved.",

    "fullText": "American hockey history isn’t just a collection of wins and losses — it’s a story about belief, identity, and moments that seemed to stop time. For many fans, everything begins with the stunning triumph at the 1980 Winter Olympics, when a team of young, largely unknown Americans shocked the world under the leadership of Herb Brooks. That victory didn’t just elevate a program — it transformed how the country saw itself on the ice. Suddenly, hockey wasn’t a niche northern pastime; it was a stage where American grit and possibility could shine.\n\nIn the decades since, the sport has evolved dramatically. New generations of players — men and women alike — have pushed the United States into consistent global contention. Rivalries intensified, particularly with Canada, and Olympic tournaments became emotional touchstones that fans still replay in their minds years later. Each era has delivered moments that felt defining in their own way: heartbreaking near-misses, redemptive victories, and performances that inspired young players across the country to lace up skates for the first time.\n\nThat long arc of growth reached a remarkable milestone at the 2026 Winter Olympics, where American hockey achieved something once almost unimaginable. By then, the sport in the United States had matured into a powerhouse — deeper, faster, and more confident than ever before.\n\nLooking back across these moments reveals more than highlights. It shows how a program grew from a miracle into a sustained force — and how certain games became shared national memories.\n\nLong before Olympic spotlights and sold-out arenas, this was where American women’s hockey first proved what it could become. The team played with the quiet confidence of pioneers — athletes who knew they were building something bigger than one tournament. Winning the inaugural title didn’t just earn a medal; it established belief, identity, and momentum. In hindsight, it feels like the first brick in the foundation of everything that followed.\n\nThis team felt young, fast, and just a little fearless — the kind of group that grows on fans game by game. Their run to the final built a sense that something special might be unfolding, especially as they kept rising to every challenge. The championship game ended in heartbreak when Sidney Crosby scored in overtime, a moment that stung instantly. Still, it felt less like an ending and more like a signal that American men’s hockey had fully rejoined the world’s elite.\n\nPlaying at home brought enormous energy — and enormous pressure. Every shift felt magnified, every bounce louder, every mistake heavier. Falling short in the gold medal game hurt deeply, especially in front of a home crowd that believed all the way. But that loss hardened the program, sharpening a competitive edge that would define the next two decades.\n\nYears of frustration finally found release in one of the most dramatic finishes the sport has seen. In the shootout, Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson skated in with patience and pulled off a move so smooth it looked almost unreal. Then Maddie Rooney held steady under crushing pressure, sealing the win with calm composure. The celebration felt less like a party and more like a collective exhale after years of chasing redemption.\n\nEverything about this moment felt brand new — the Olympic stage, the spotlight, the chance to define a sport’s future in real time. The Americans embraced that pressure and played like they intended to set the standard from day one. Winning the first Olympic gold in women’s hockey instantly gave the program identity and confidence. It felt like watching a rivalry — and a legacy — begin right before the world’s eyes.\n\nThis was the kind of achievement people used to imagine but never quite expect to see — total Olympic supremacy in both tournaments. The men delivered a tense overtime victory, finished by Jack Hughes and preserved by a brilliant performance from Connor Hellebuyck. The women matched the drama, rallying late as Hilary Knight forced overtime before Megan Keller struck the championship winner. Taken together, the wins felt historic not just for the medals — but for what they said about how far American hockey had come.\n\nFew sporting moments feel frozen in time the way this one does. A group of young Americans, many barely known outside hockey circles, faced a global powerhouse and simply refused to be intimidated. Guided by coach Herb Brooks, they played with relentless belief until the impossible became real. When the clock finally ran out, it felt like an entire country had experienced the same surge of joy all at once.\n\nFrom improbable beginnings to historic dominance, the biggest moments in American hockey trace a powerful evolution. What started as a single, unforgettable shock to the world gradually became a pattern of excellence built over generations. Together, these milestones don’t just mark victories — they tell the story of how belief turned into legacy.\n\nOLYMPICS: Team USA flag bearers revealed for 2026 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony\n\nNFL: Predicting the 2026 NFL free agent signings\n\nMLB: Detroit Tigers drop unreal alternate jerseys for 2026 MLB season\n\nNBA: Charlotte Hornets share update after LaMelo Ball’s car crash\n\nNHL: 2026 Winter Olympics men’s hockey, NHL payrolls for final four teams\nSPORTS MEDIA: Olympics reporter apologizes for drinking, slurring words during live segment\n\nThe post From ‘Miracle on Ice’ to 2026: Ranking America’s biggest hockey moments appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Alas, nothing he could do to stop either goal, nor the skullduggery from the vermin ‘officiating’.\n\n22.02.2026 Celtic v Hibernian, Scottish Premiership. Kieran Tiierney.

If only his enthusiasm for the conflict was more infectious. Stalwart defending and dynamic attacking intent are the defining characteristics he possess to make him a bhoy worth keeping. Great mentality in adversity.\n\n22.02.2026 Celtic v Hibernian, Scottish Premiership. Liam Scales rages at Matthew MacDermid after being fouled at a corner but no penalty given.

Only until we went to ten, ironically, and he shook off his ennui to get in about them and conduct a verbal sparring match with that insipid wee guy with the whistle.\n\nAuston Trusty and Miguel Chaiwa.

Then… You’ve got to be kidding. A slap on the wrist of that simping-pussy McGrath now rates a red? Austin was the one being fouled, for heaven’s sake! I’m pinning no blame on the big man.

Did you see how much of the ball he had? And did you see how little forward options he had at the first touch of possession? THAT’S the difference between this lack of rotation and Angeball; no willing recipients for the wall-pass or first-touch layoff. Negan doesn’t play that type of game – he appears intermittently if at all, like Sweden’s Brig O’ Doon. To be fair, The Ox did help Calmac stage some of our best football of the game. But he needs legs around him to sustain that and once we were down a man, chasing the ball, chances of recovering control slipped away.\n\n22.02.2026 Celtic v Hibernian, Scottish Premiership.

Ox needs his game legs working at full capacity and then we’d have a great complement to Calmac dead centre that would bring back game domination. Not too late yet.\n\nHyunjan Yang.

Wanted to see how he stood up to big Rocky today and his appetite for the fight was what we required. But we need to improve his service to see what he’s really made of. Missed a great snap-chance, though he should be on the receiving end of far more clear-cut opportunities.\n\nSebastian Tounekti of Celtic.

Only grim late, and crucial, loss for the first time since his return, sabotaged by the ludge scum. Only quibble I had was Tut off and Yang getting extended minutes when he was hapless as an attacking force. But we’ll never know really if – on a level playing field – that would have borne fruit.\n\n22.02.2026 Celtic v Hibernian, Scottish Premiership.

And that insidious mob hiding in their VAR dungeon will hopefully come down with a terminal farmyard dose after their goatfest celebrations last night. When I look at that wee guy with the whistle I usually subdue my inner voice (one of…) which muses that there has not been enough brutal bullying in schools for the past quarter century.

And THIRTEEN minutes of injury time are added… Celtic back in it, dominating, seeking a winner… A red conjured out of nowhere as some effete reprobate goes down like a dive into the hold of a fishing trawler, and those scurrilous lot seize their chance for the most vile bit of connivery and cheating we’ve seen in years. Make no excuses for them. Don’t fall for any SMSM sophistry that would excuse their craven deceit – those mobsters seized on, distorted and exploited a nothing incident to derail a Celtic title bid. To hell with  their duplicity, their pretensions to rationale. A venomous curse on their bloodlines.\n\nA view of Celtic Park Celtic v Hibernian, Scottish Premiership, 22 February 2026. Photo Mark Runnacles IMAGO/Shutterstock\n\nOVERALL – 5/10 – A defeat. At the worst time. For many reasons? Mainly for the obvious. As mentioned briefly above…Hibs are decent and we fell to a mental lapse for the opener. But the recovery and focus was good, the pressure from half-time to the ridiculous underhand sabotage was staging a win. I thought had we nailed the second, a third would surely have followed as Hibs resilience crumbled…\n\nA view of Celtic Park Celtic v Hibernian, Scottish Premiership, 22 February 2026. Photo Mark Runnacles IMAGO/Shutterstock\n\nNot to be. But as a performance versus a capable SPL opponent with a full complement, I’m not condemning anyone; after a tussle, the game was looking like ours or a frustrating point at least. Now we find ourselves on the back foot after a chance to take the top. And Hibs find themselves the architects of their greatest rivals’ most joyous Sunday of the season. Only Hibs could win at Celtic Park and still be Hibsing-it beyond anything they’ve ever done before…\n\nAnte Suto of Hibernian with Daizen Maeda of Celtic and Marcelo Saracchi of Celtic Celtic v Hibernian, Scottish Premiership, Celtic Park, 22 February 2026.

A win there will do nicely and mentally finish the Zombies as a hapless title challenger, while we can rack up the points waiting for the Replicants to implode – which they will – and help us pip the real title contenders to our trophy…\n\nCeltic in the Thirties by Matt Corr.

    "fullText": "Jack Hughes drops Connor McDavid 'greatest player ever' praise after Olympics win originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWith the Olympics gold medal match loss, Connor McDavid has yet again fallen short of winning the ultimate prize at a tournament. Fans started buzzing about how the Edmonton Oilers legend was 'always the bridesmaid, never the bride'. While these chirps may have come at the height of the Americans winning the gold medal after 46 years, Team USA and New Jersey Devils' Jack Hughes knew that McDavid was still the best player out there.\n\nHughes ended up scoring the gold medal-winning goal against Team Canada. He will always remain as a legend in all of America and with the Devils. But, he was tasked with a really tough task of guarding McDavid all night. Prior to his insane goal, he had to shut the Oilers legend one last time too.\n\nHe got real on how difficult the task was because of the Canadian star's prowess on the ice, via Dan Rosen of NHL.com.\n\n\"When the best player in the world, maybe ever, comes down on you in overtime in the gold medal game and you’re a forward, my first thought was ‘I  have got to gap up. Then I was like, ‘I can’t gap up, he’ll just blow right by me.’ So, I just sunk in and hopefully he can’t get around me because there’s not enough space in between me and the net. And that’s honestly kind of what happened,\" he declared.\n\nHughes' effort only came out of instinct because of what was at stake and who skated down towards him. McDavid was eventually named the Most Valuable Player for men's hockey at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics. This came after he ran the Canadian offense as much as he could up until the gold medal game. The Oilers legend scored two goals while also dishing out 11 assists in the tournament.\n\nThe bane of the best players in their field is the constant challenge of opposing players leveling up when coming across them. Hopefully, McDavid is able to dispel the 'always the bridesmaid, never the bride' narrative once he returns with the Oilers.",

    "fullText": "German public-service broadcasters ARD and ZDF registered record numbers of viewers during the Milan/Cortina Winter Olympics, which closed on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the broadcasters, never before have so many people followed the TV coverage of the Winter Games in the country.\n\nAn average of 3.173 million people watched the live broadcasts on the two free-to-air TV channels, representing a market share of 23.2%.\n\nThe reach is almost twice as high as in the previous Games in Beijing in 2022 (1.67 million), which, however, took place in a different time zone.\n\nBut all the relevant figures are also significantly higher than those for Turin, where the last Winter Games in Germany's time zone took place 20 years ago.\n\n\"In times like these, people are particularly receptive to the Olympics. People love emotional moments,\" ARD sports coordinator Axel Balkausky said.\n\nThe men's doubles in luge had the largest audience as 6.79 million people watched the event live. The biathlon, Germany's most popular winter sport, was shortly behind with 6.63 million fans tuning in to watch the mixed relay.\n\nDuring the Olympics, millions of sports fans are also enthusiastic about disciplines that are usually hardly noticed.\n\n\"Every four years, people specifically search for curling,\" Balkausky said.\n\nParticularly striking was the reach among young people: according to the broadcasters, some 35% of viewers were between 14 and 29 years old.\n\nParallel to the large number of viewers watching traditional television, there was also enormous reach on the internet with up to seven live streams.\n\nARD recorded more than 85 million video views, while ZDF had more than 50 million views by Saturday.\n\n\"The digital figures are going through the roof.

    "fullText": "Mexican star Julian Quinones didn’t just shine on Matchweek 23 by claiming his unrivalled 10th Man of the Match award, he also led a midfield takeover in Roshn Saudi League Fantasy. Midfielders dominated the scoring charts, occupying a remarkable seven of the top 10 spots.\n\nWith players in that position consistently delivering the highest Fantasy returns, choosing the right ones can make or break your line-up.\n\nWith that in mind, here’s our recommendations for the postponed Matchweek 10, laid out nicely in a first XI, all while sticking to a budget of SAR 80 million.\n\nNot already playing? Well, what are you waiting for: sign up at https://en.fantasy.spl.com.sa now!\n\nEdouard Mendy - Al Ahli (6.6 million)\n\nThe league’s top goalkeeper this season, with 9 clean sheets, the Al Ahli captain travels to Abha to face a Damac who’ve dropped into the bottom three. Mendy currently sits on 98 Fantasy points and is expected to break the 100-mark in this round.\n\nMuhannad Al Shanqiti - Al Ittihad (5.2m)\n\nDespite playing fewer matches this season, Al Shanqiti is enjoying his most productive campaign yet. He has already scored 3 goals - a personal best - and added 6 assists. He’ll look to continue that form for the RSL champions at Al Hazem.\n\nMohamed Simakan - Al Nassr FC (5.7m)\n\nA smart differential pick, Simakan is selected by only 18.9 percent of managers despite being among the top-five defenders in total points. He has kept six consecutive clean sheets and even scored during that run. Next up? An away match at bottom club Najmah.\n\nZakaria Hawsawi - Al Ahli (4.2m)\n\nFor the second straight season, Hawsawi is contributing both defensively and offensively. He recently assisted Riyad Mahrez at Al Shabab and even scored against Al Taawoun. Trusted by Al Ahli manager Matthias Jaissle, Hawsawi has been part of six clean sheets in nine appearances.\n\nJulian Quinones - Al Qadsiah (10.4m)\n\nThe game’s in-form star made his seventh Team of the Week appearance in Matchweek 23, scoring 25 points. Remarkably, he’s the only Fantasy player to hit 25+ points in three different rounds this season. Al Qadsiah host Eastern Derby rivals Al Ettifaq.\n\nEven in defeat to Al Ettifaq, Batna delivered 19 Fantasy points, second only to Quinones for the round. While Khalid Al Ghannam earned 13 points in the same match, Batna’s individual performance stood out. Al Fateh welcome second-from-bottom Al Okhdood.\n\nYannick Carrasco - Al Shabab (7.2m)\n\nThe brilliant Belgian has been instrumental in Al Shabab’s revival, scoring and assisting last time out in the win at Damac. The side goals-per-game average has climbed to 1.09, avoiding what could’ve been their worst scoring season (2015-16 and 2016-17). They face relegation battlers Al Riyadh.\n\nThe Algeria superstar has contributed to four goals in his past two matches and remains central to Al Ahli’s title bid. Since December 29, Al Ahli have collected 34 points, more than Al Qadsiah (32), Al Hilal (28), and Al Nassr (25). Mahrez has been key.\n\nFashion Sakala - Al Fayha (8.0m)\n\nAl Fayha’s man of the moment is in red-hot form, matching Ivan Toney for the best scoring streak over the past three rounds. Sakala has netted eight goals in seven of his past eight outings yet is selected by fewer than 5% of managers - a high-risk, high-reward option. Al Fayha host NEOM Sports Club on Wednesday.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette - NEOM SC (6.8m)\n\nThe firing Frenchman earned nine points last time out after scoring the winner at Al Khaleej. Lacazette averages 8.5 points per game over his past four matches and now takes that hot streak to Al Fayha in the postponed fixture.\n\nAbderrazak Hamdallah - Al Shabab (9.0m)\n\nAfter missing 11 rounds (16 matches total), the RSL’s all-time second-highest scorer is gradually returning to form. Hamdallah came off the bench against Al Ahli and then scored on Friday when starting at Damac.\n\nWith only 30 total points and a 10.4% selection rate, the mighty Moroccan could become a valuable differential if he regains his scoring rhythm. Especially with new manager Noureddine Ben Zekri in charge.\n\nMidfielders continue to dominate RSL Fantasy scoring so, with several players in exceptional form and postponed fixtures creating unique opportunities, this round could reward bold-but-calculated selections.\n\nChoose wisely - and don’t underestimate the power of an in-form middle man!",

    "fullText": "Jacob Bridgeman beat Rory McIlroy by one stroke to win the Genesis Invitational on Sunday.\n\nDespite having a six-shot lead before the final round, Bridgeman came under pressure from McIlroy and Kurt Kitayama.\n\nThe 26-year-old did not perform as well as he did in the first three rounds, but it was still enough for the victory at Riviera.\n\nAfter playing alongside Bridgeman in the final group, McIlroy explained how the first-time PGA Tour winner impressed him.\n\nBridgeman’s one-over-par 72 in the final round was just enough to finish ahead of McIlroy and Kitayama.\n\nHe looked nervous at times on the back nine, but he also played some high-quality shots and made several clutch putts.\n\nMcIlroy recognised the difficulty of winning your first PGA Tour event and was impressed by Bridgeman’s mentality.\n\nHe even suggested that Bridgeman’s score (+1) was not a true reflection of the solid golf he played throughout the day.\n\n“I thought he handled everything really well,” McIlroy reflected. “As I said at the start, because I wasn’t putting pressure on him, it probably felt to him like he didn’t need to do that much, but he played very well.\n\n“I was surprised he was even par because I felt he was very much in control of his golf ball. He drove it great; he hit his irons well. But it’s hard, it’s hard to close out big tournaments.\n\n“Even though he was a little shaky coming down the stretch, he held it together when he needed to. He holed a clutch comeback putt on 13 for par.\n\n“He played smart on 16 when he missed it in the bunker. That putt on the last isn’t easy. Leaves it a little bit short, and the crowd reacts, and you’ve got to take your time a little bit.\n\n“I give him all the props; he did what he needed to do, and I’m happy for him.”\n\nMcIlroy will feel like he missed a golden opportunity to defeat Bridgeman and win the Genesis Invitational on Sunday.\n\nThe Northern Irishman was excellent from tee to green in the final round, but he did not make enough putts to catch his playing partner.\n\nMcIlroy lost 1.88 strokes to the field on the greens on Sunday, the second-worst putting performance of the top 20 players.\n\nHad he converted one more of his many birdie chances, he would have faced Bridgeman in a playoff for the title.\n\nStill, McIlroy can be delighted with his improved performance ahead of the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the Players Championship next month.\n\nJordan Spieth makes firm vow to avoid repeat on PGA Tour after controversy in 2025\n\nRory McIlroy’s bunker magic leaves Jordan Spieth stunned at the Genesis Invitational\n\n‘It’s a big deal’ – Jordan Spieth reveals the ‘weapon’ he’s finally got back after the Genesis Invitational",

The Albiceleste player’s intentions remain unclear.\n\nDybala is in his fourth season with Roma and will soon become a father: the player is currently struggling with a knee problem that has kept him from the Giallorossi’s recent fixtures.\n\nIn the coming days, it will be clear whether Dybala will actually be available for the big match on Sunday, March 1st, against Juventus. The match against the Bianconeri could be one of the number 21’s last high-profile matches in a Roma jersey.",

    "description": "Liverpool got an undeserved and much needed win at relegation-threatened Forest on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Liverpool were not the better side on Sunday afternoon when they headed off to face a Nottingham Forest side in the midst of crisis in a season that has rather seemed non-stop crisis for the West Bridgford that are currently on their fourth (and maybe not their last) manager of the 2025-26 campaign.\n\nThe Reds’ relegation-threatened opponents (who are on their fourth manager of the season) had more shots, created more expected goals, and even managed to appear to have more well-drilled patterns of play—of passing, pressing, and buildup. In the end, though, Liverpool managed to end up with all three points.\n\nIn the end, of course, that’s the point of the game and what matters most. Especially if you’re a Liverpool side who themselves have been at seemed on the verge of crisis for most of the season and are in a tough fight to finish in the Champions League places. The question, as always, is what comes next.\n\n“We want to play our best football and I think at times we are doing that,” captain Virgil van Dijk reflected after everything was said and done in Sunday’s 1-0 victory. “Obviously we are still looking for improvements and we are not perfect, but we are human beings and want to do our best for the club.\n\n“We want to perform at the absolute highest levels, and we need everyone to be at their best so that’s a process, but we keep going and now the focus is on the next one. It feels definitely nice to win here, it’s a difficult ground and it was a very poor first half from all of us with and without the ball.”\n\nThe silver lining is perhaps that for as bad as Liverpool were early, they did improve as the game went on, at least relative their early struggles. And of course in the end a win is a win is a win—which puts them level on points with fifth-place Manchester United, at least until they take on Everton today.\n\nOn paper, too, Liverpool have one of the easier schedules of the sides battling to finish in the Champions League places in a season where top five are all but guaranteed of that. And for that, they need more wins. And for that, they’ll need to improve on Sunday’s performance, eventually victory or not.",

    "description": "Another night at Unrivaled. Another Chelsea Gray record. Gray’s 10 3s helped Rose clinch a playoff berth.",
    "fullText": "The Point Gawd Chelsea Gray is known for her dazzling passes and her ability to be almost unguardable when she gets on a hot streak.\n\nOn Sunday night, she delivered one of those kinds of performances, matching Marina Mabrey’s Unrivaled record for 3-pointers in a game with 10. The number is gaudy, but it was also necessary. Rose needed every one of those points as they squeaked out a 70-66 victory against Laces.\n\nGray ended the game with a whopping 38 points, along with seven rebounds and four assists.\n\nFrom the opening quarter, Gray was explosive. She scored 17 points in the first and knocked down half of her 3s within the first seven minutes. Thanks to her play and her contributions to Rose’s 12-4 run, they were in front of Laces 23-16.\n\nIn the second, Laces responded with a 12-5 run to even the game. Gray countered with yet another 3 as both teams exchanged baskets. Brittney Sykes was the engine that kept the Laces running with her 20-point first-half performance. Gray hit a 3-pointer to end the half, which gave Rose a 3-point lead, 42-39.\n\nAt this point, what can't Chelsea Gray do?! 🤯 pic.twitter.com/iZBB5qOOYY\n\n— Unrivaled Basketball (@Unrivaledwbb) February 23, 2026\n\nLaces had some offensive struggles in the third, shooting 6-for-18 from the field. Rose took advantage as Gray continued to pile on, allowing Rose to carry a somewhat comfortable six-point lead into the fourth, 59-53.\n\nLaces and Rose exchanged baskets, but with Rose ahead, they were able to hang on and not only win the game but also punch their ticket into the postseason.\n\nGray, who also hit the game winner, was far and away the best player for Rose. However, Kahleah Copper had a respectable game, scoring 10 points to go along with three rebounds and three assists.\n\nLaces were led by the trio of Jackie Young, Alyssa Thomas and Sykes. Young had 17 points, Thomas scored 12 points and grabbed nine rebounds, and Sykes scored 24. While the loss was a disappointing one for Laces, the good news is they are still the No. 2 seed in Unrivaled, and their odds of staying in a top slot, and earning a bye to the semifinals, are still very high and in their control.\n\nBefore Laces’ loss, Phantom strengthened their claim to the No. 1 seed thanks to their 84-66 win over Hive. The win also earned Phantom a first-round bye, meaning their chase for the championship will begin in the semifinals in Brooklyn.\n\nAs usual, Phantom was led by its duo of Aliyah Boston and Kelsey Plum. Boston scored 25 points and grabbed eight rebounds, leading the team in both categories, while Plum had 23 points along with six assists. With these two on the floor, any three-player combo Phantom rolls out will be one of the best in Unrivaled.\n\nDue to the absences of Azurá Stevens and Natisha Hiedeman, developmental player Aziaha James got the call up, and she did all she could to try to help Hive win, leading the club with 22 points. During the game, Hive also lost Sonia Citron due to an injury scare, which put them down to only four players for all of the second half.\n\nZaza is doing her things out here 🫡 pic.twitter.com/IeY6sK202j\n\n— Unrivaled Basketball (@Unrivaledwbb) February 23, 2026\n\nEven with this loss, Hive still has hope for the sixth and final playoff spot, but Vinyl is a half game in front of them for that position, and the Lunar Owls are right behind them, just a game back.\n\nIt’s looking like the playoff picture won’t get finalized until the very end of the regular season.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona midfielder Gavi is entering the most important phase of his recovery and his eyes are already fixed on the next World Cup.\n\nAccording to SPORT, the 21-year-old is highly motivated to return in time to fight for a place in Spain’s squad.\n\nAfter months of frustration on the sidelines, the young midfielder is finally back training with the group, taking careful steps toward full fitness.\n\nGavi has been out of top-level competition for nearly five months following surgery on his right knee meniscus on September 23.\n\nThe procedure forced him into a long rehabilitation process, but now he is gradually reintegrating into team sessions.\n\nHis workload remains controlled, with both the medical department and coaching staff keeping a close watch on every movement.\n\nWithin Barcelona, it has been made very clear that there will be no shortcuts.\n\nThe club believes it would make little sense to rush his return after showing patience for months.\n\nThe priority is to help Gavi regain confidence, rhythm and match sharpness without risking setbacks.\n\nGavi wants to play the World Cup. (Photo by Florencia Tan Jun/Getty Images)\n\nA knee injury is delicate, and Barcelona want him to feel completely secure before stepping back into competitive action.\n\nAs such, optimism is growing internally, as the upcoming international break could actually benefit him, giving him uninterrupted weeks of training without the pressure of immediate match demands.\n\nThe plan is for him to complete full sessions consistently, increase intensity step by step, and reconnect with the feeling of being a competitive footballer.\n\nFor Gavi, the past months have been difficult and now, feeling useful to the team again before the end of the season is his short-term objective.\n\nMeanwhile, Luis de la Fuente has maintained regular contact with him.\n\nThe Spain coach is closely following his progress and understands both the risks and the potential reward.\n\nDe la Fuente has never hidden his admiration for the Barcelona midfielder and believes he could still play a role if he reaches the required level in time.\n\nReaching the World Cup will not be easy, as competition in Spain’s midfield is fierce. Despite that, if Gavi regains his rhythm and intensity, the door will not be closed.",

    "description": "Where do the Indianapolis Colts rank in free agent spending since the 2020 NFL season?",
    "fullText": "Since 2020, the Indianapolis Colts have been one of the least active teams in NFL free agency.\n\nJason Fitzgerald of Over the Cap recently ranked each team by how much they've spent in free agency between 2020 and 2025 and how many free agents they've signed.\n\nA few caveats to note as Fitzgerald put together this list were that only free agent signings in the months of March and April counted, and the deal had to be for at least $2 million. This data also only included new additions and not any re-signings.\n\nDuring that span, the Colts' 15 free agent additions that qualify for this list are tied for the sixth-fewest in the NFL. Indianapolis is also the eighth-lowest spender in average free agent dollars each offseason at $125.98 million.\n\nHowever, when GM Chris Ballard has made signings, he has spent big, with the Colts average contract per player ranking near the top of the league at $8.39 million.\n\nOverall, the Colts are ranked 27th in Fitzgerald's rankings.\n\n\"We like our guys,\" is a familiar phrase that Ballard has said over the years, which is, in part, why the Colts rank near the bottom of this free agency spending list.\n\nLast offseason, however, we saw a more aggressive approach. This included signing Daniel Jones and spending fairly big on Charvarius Ward and Cam Bynum.\n\nBallard seemingly acknowledged that continuing down that path was going to be the plan this offseason.\n\nThe Colts are positioned relatively well from a salary cap standpoint to do so as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: NFL free agency: Where do Colts rank in free agent spending since 2020?",

    "fullText": "UFC fighters with visa problems just learned something in Houston over the weekend: ask and ye shall receive.\n\nUros Medic won his co-main fight against Geoff Neal via violent first round knockout (watch it here) and then followed that up not with a request — not for a $100,000 bonus (which he got anyway) but for help with his immigration issues.\n\n“Now I got one little problem,” Medic declared in the cage. “Immigration’s been holding me up and I can’t travel just yet. So this is my plea for help. President, Mr. President, if you can see this, please, we gotta go to Belgrade, Serbia for the UFC this summer.”\n\nWe have our doubts the UFC will make the trip to Serbia any time soon, but Medic now can because UFC CEO Dana White got U.S. president Donald Trump on the phone to take care of his issues.\n\n“I’m back in his office and Dana’s got president Donald Trump on speaker phone,” Medic said at the post-fight press conference. “I’m just standing there and I cannot believe what’s happening. I’m talking to the president, and he said, ‘You’re good to go wherever you please. You can travel. Just give Dana documentation, the information that you need.'”\n\n“I’m just blown away. I mean, I love Mr. President, and his wife is from Slovenia, First Lady Melania … It was just amazing for me to be able to tell him about the situation and how big of a fan I am of him. And obviously, his wife, who is from where I’m from – or I’m considering where I’m from, even though it’s a different country. It’s like a five-hour drive. That’s nothing for America. Like, you can’t even get out of Texas in five hours.”\n\n“So yeah, I’m still processing all of it.”\n\nThat’s great news for Medic, who has been unable to travel back to his home country for three years now. Between the knockout of the year candidate, his $100,000 bonus, and getting his visa fixed, it’s been a pretty good weekend for the Serbian fighter.",

    "description": "Connor Zilisch says he always knew Kimi Antonelli was destined for Formula 1 after racing him in karting",
    "fullText": "19-year-old NASCAR Cup driver Connor Zilisch said he could always tell that Kimi Antonelli would get into Formula 1 after karting together.\n\nThe two grew up karting together when the American driver would spend his summers in Europe to gain experience other forms of racing. During an appearance on the Gypsy Tales podcast, the Trackhouse Racing driver explained that Antonelli was \"one of the best drivers\" he had raced against.\n\n\"I spent a lot of time in Europe. Those were some of the coolest moments of my life. I went to Europe as an 11, 12, 13, 14-year-old. I spent a couple of summers over there when I was not in school. I would go over there for three months at a time, racing against guys like Kimi Antonelli.\n\n\"I spent three or four years racing against him. I always knew he was going to make it to F1. I always knew. He's one of the best drivers, top three drivers I've ever raced against, just talent-wise. So I always knew he was one of the guys that was going to make it and then guys like Arvid Lindblad, he's going to race for VCARB.\n\n\"It's crazy to see that they've gone on to race in F1 and that kind of thing. But karting is such a cool sport. I didn't realise it at the time, but those days and months that I spent in Europe, without my parents, growing up, I would ride my bike to dinner alone. Those were the coolest days of my life, and I didn't realise it at the time, how cool it was.\n\n\"The memories that I have of it, looking back at it, I grew up and learned so much as a kid and matured. I definitely look back on those days as some of the coolest days I'll ever have.\"\n\nAsked to elaborate on what he saw in Antonelli, who is about to enter his second F1 season with Mercedes, Zilisch added: \"He's the guy that no matter what his set-up is, no matter what the track is, no matter what the conditions are, there's guys who just always persevere and are always at the front.\n\n\"And he was one of those guys that no matter what the situation was, if it was practice or if it was a heat race or, whatever it was, he was always at the front. He could just maximise his kart.\n\n\"And it's funny, I have a story. He came to race in America. He did a race at Miami, and one of my best friends was team-mates with him, and him and his dad thought that it was all his motor. And so he was team-mates with Kimi, and Kimi switched engines with him because the kid was like 'Man it's got to be his engine.'\n\n\"So Kimi literally switched motors with this kid. Kimi went faster and he slowed down, and that was just one of the things where it's a situation of you don't realise how much of a difference he's actually making until you do something like that.\n\n\"You just assume that it's the equipment and for him to be like, 'OK, let's switch then.' And they switch, and Kimi goes faster. That's something that I've always pointed to when I've thought about Kimi. He makes the most of everything he gets in.\"\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Michael Carrick addressed Marcus Rashford’s absence from the Manchester United first-team after the England star signed for Barcelona last summer.\n\nThe 44-year-old, now back in a coaching role at United, had played alongside Rashford during the later years of his own career at Old Trafford.\n\nCarrick also worked with the 28-year-old England international during his coaching stints under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Jose Mourinho.\n\nWhile Rashford was part of Carrick’s squad during his caretaker spell in 2021, that has not been the case since he returned as interim manager this season.\n\nThe British forward left the club in 2025 and has spent this season on loan at Barcelona.\n\nRashford fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim during the 2024-25 season and spent the second half of the campaign on loan at Aston Villa.\n\nAston Villa chose not to make his move permanent, so Rashford returned briefly to Old Trafford during Amorim’s time in charge.\n\nBut it was Barcelona who offered him a fresh start, making the decision to sign him from United during last summer’s transfer window.\n\nAt his pre-match press conference, Carrick was asked whether he felt it was unfortunate that Rashford had left United, given their history as teammates and coach-player.\n\n“It’s difficult to say, you know, because circumstances at certain times, that I haven’t been involved in,” the Englishman said, according to Manchester United’s official website.\n\n“It’s difficult for me to comment, really. I think the fact he’s come through the academy and had such a big impact here is a positive and as a club, he’s had some really big moments, and good moments, and I’ve shared some with him in the past, you know?”\n\nThe former Manchester United forward has found new life away from Old Trafford and has been playing well under Hansi Flick at the Camp Nou during the 2025-26 season.\n\nCarrick pointed to Rashford’s career path as a good example of how unpredictable football can be these days.\n\n“So, football throws up certain things and obviously certain players, you can’t stay here forever and things happen.\n\nThis season, Rashford has made 34 appearances for Barcelona in all competitions, scoring 10 goals and providing 13 assists so far.\n\nWhy Man United legend Patrice Evra brutally slammed ‘delusional’ Arsenal fans\n\nManchester United vs. Everton preview, kick-off time, how to watch, and team news",

    "fullText": "It was an exciting week made up of unforgettable moments for the girls at Inter Academy New England, who took part in a fully immersive journey into the Nerazzurri world.\n\nThrough visits to the stadium, training ground, and the Club's headquarters, the American delegation had the opportunity to experience the passion, history, and values that define Inter.\n\nOn the night of Inter vs. Juventus, which ended with the Nerazzurri winning 3-2, the young Academy players experienced firsthand the intensity of one of the most legendary rivalries in Italian football.\n\nBefore kick-off, the girls took part in activities and fan interactions in the Museo LED area, taking photos and creating content for social platforms, which added to the atmosphere. They then took to the stage of the Inter Live Show in a night made even more memorable by the Nerazzurri's victory.\n\nTo close out the stadium experience, the Academy had the chance to watch the squad's warm-up up close, soaking in the moments leading up to kick-off from a unique perspective in a crucial match.\n\nThe journey continued at the Konami Football Centre, where the girls participated in training sessions throughout the week, led by the technical staff of the Nerazzurri Youth Sector. It was an incredible and educational experience that allowed the young participants to interact directly with the Club's ideology.\n\nOn Friday, two players from the Inter Women's squad and coach Gianpiero Piovani came onto the pitch and made the week even more memorable. Through moments of connection and the presentation of final participation certificates by Bugeja, Bowen, and the coach, the girls at the Academy felt a sense of belonging to the Nerazzurri family.\n\nThe visit came to an end at Inter HQ, with an exclusive Trophy Room Tour. It served as a journey into the Club's history through trophies and achievements that tell the story of the Nerazzurri's glories and inspire future generations.\n\nIt was a week that will stay in the hearts of the young Inter Academy New England players, highlighting the strength of the Inter Academy project globally. It is a connection across cultures, brought together by the same colours and Nerazzurri passion.",

    "fullText": "Former England striker Gary Lineker has just compared Chelsea’s Joao Pedro with Arsenal striker Kai Havertz.\n\nLineker has been reviewing the latest round of Premier League games on his Podcast this morning, and he has looked at what he believes to be some clear comparisons with Pedro and former Blues man, Kai Havertz.\n\nI am sure this is going to split opinions and also, many Chelsea fans will be left wondering whether it’s a good or a bad thing that one of our strikers is being compared with Havertz, because many Blues fans never even rated him when he was here!\n\nJoao Pedro looks on against Burnley. (Photo by Jasper Wax/Getty Images)\n\n‘Another goal for Joao Pedro at the weekend so let’s talk about signed strikers in the Premier League,’ Lineker said on The Rest is Football podcast.\n\n‘Isak, Ekitike, Pedro, Gyokeres and Sesko were the big ones weren’t they last summer. Ekitike has done really well and similar numbers but Pedro has perhaps gone slightly under the radar in terms of how well he’s done.\n\n‘I think he’s a very good footballer, he’s technically very gifted. I think he’s a really good player, he does remind me a little bit of Kai Havertz.\n\n‘They’re similar type of players, both very technically gifted and they both almost glide around the pitch. I think he’s a really good player.’\n\nChelsea are apparently looking to replace goalkeeper Robert Sanchez in the summer transfer window, with links coming in now with a new Premier League goalkeeper.\n\nPedro Neto got an assist at the weekend, but Chelsea’s attack in general disappointed as they failed to capitalise more on their periods of dominance against Burnley.\n\nCheck out the latest edition of Simon Phillips’ SPTC podcast here:",

From a treble-winning loan spell at Bayern Munich in 2019/20 after some dazzling nights at Liverpool to a €135 million move to Barcelona, the Brazilian’s career seemed unstoppable at its peak. Now, it has reached an unexpected and sobering turn.\n\nPer a report from Tz, Coutinho has announced the termination of his contract with Vasco da Gama, his boyhood club in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The decision, confirmed via his social channels, came despite talks of a possible extension. Instead, the 33-year-old requested for a premature termination, one that the club granted.\n\nThe reason is deeply personal. Coutinho admitted he is “mentally exhausted.” Years of serious knee injuries have taken their toll, both physically and emotionally. Growing criticism from fans, including jeering during a recent cup match, only added to the weight.\n\nIn an emotional farewell, he described stepping away with a heavy heart, insisting his connection to Vasco remains strong. Whether this signals the end of his career or simply a pause remains unclear.",

    "description": "Following a heavy defeat to South Africa in Super 8s, India's batting unit faces scrutiny, with assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate confirming that changes, including the potential inclusion of Sanju Samson, are being considered. The team's left-hand heavy top order has struggled, prompting a rethink of their strategy for upcoming crucial matches.",
    "fullText": "Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. \n\nIndia’s left-hand heavy top order once again crumbled under pressure during the chase of 188, eventually collapsing to 111. The spotlight fell heavily on out-of-form opener Abhishek Sharma, who managed just 15 — his first runs of the tournament after three consecutive ducks — and Tilak Varma, whose struggles have compounded India’s fragile starts.\n\nAddressing the selection dilemma, ten Doeschate acknowledged that bringing in a right-hand option like Samson is under serious consideration.\n\n“Yeah, of course, we have looked at the five outings we have had now, four teams have opened with part-time off spin, and it has got a wicket every time, apart from the USA game where we lost Abhi without score in any case (to pacer Ali Khan),” he said.\n\n“So to start every inning zero for one, I think it has literally been zero or a couple of runs for one every time is obviously putting pressure on the link players. Tilak and SKY (Surya), their role is to link up with the guys at the back end, and it has not gone that way,” he added.\n\n128703198Advertisement\nIndia now face a tough call between backing struggling players and making bold changes.\n\n“You stick with the guys who we feel have performed really well over the last 18 months and who are maybe shy of a few runs now? Or do we twist and bring Sanju, who is also a fantastic player and obviously helps tactically with having a right-hander at the top of the order, and I am sure that will be a talking point over the next few days, going into these two very important games,” he said.\n\nTen Doeschate also revealed that Abhishek’s poor run has been compounded by illness.\n\n“You want him to be up and running and sort of confident in his swing and confident in his game plan (on Abhishek), and when you score three zeroes, that is going to start weighing on you. I saw some really good signs on Friday night in the nets. I think I mentioned it in the presser then. But he looks a little bit short, and our job as the coaching staff is to pull that right. We have got four days to do that,” he added.\n\nHe also defended Rinku Singh, whose returns as finisher have been modest.\n\n“There is no point talking about rhythm in nets or how guys are feeling or what they are not feeling. It is time to pull our sleeves up and get performance out of all the players, and like I just said there, that is the challenge for the staff, along with the players now, to regroup and put in a big effort leading up to the next game against Zimbabwe,” he concluded.",

    "fullText": "At the risk of beating a dead horse, Roma fans have grown wary of matches like yesterday’s victory over Cremonese, fixtures where outside results have fallen in the club’s favor, giving the Giallorossi an opportunity to climb the table. In this instance, with 5th-place Juventus and 3rd-place Napoli each suffering defeats earlier in the weekend, Roma not only had the chance to pad their lead over Juve but could wake up Monday in third place, four points ahead of Juventus, ahead of their clash at the Olimpico next weekend.\n\nFortunately, unlike so many disappointing weekends before, Roma prevailed over lowly Cremonese, overcoming a slow first half to win 3-0 in front of 60,000 of their closest friends. Given the ease with which they won and the lack of any glaring errors, today’s Sinners & Saints will skew entirely toward the positive!\n\nAlways the goat, seldom the hero, Cristante delivered arguably his best performance of the season. Starting alongside Manu Koné and Lorenzo Pellegrini in midfield, Cristante overcame his presumed sadness over Canada’s loss in the Gold Medal game with a dynamic 90-minute run against Cremonese: three key passes, 15 passes into the final third, five tackles, four recoveries, one assist, and, of course, the match-winning goal, a perfectly executed header at the near post off a Pellegrini corner.\n\nCristante will always have his detractors, but at least for one night, he was unquestionably the best player on the pitch.\n\nNot far behind Cristante in the post-match pecking order, Ndicka brought his usual class to the backline, limiting Cremonese to a pitiful two shots on goal while adding five clearances and three ball recoveries to his defensive ledger. While we’ve come to expect those defensive performances from Ndicka, the Ivorian international was surprisingly busy in attack, firing four shots on goal, including a crucial 77th-minute goal, his first league goal of the season.\n\nIf we shine light on Ndicka for smothering Cremonese’s attack, it’s only right to share the spotlight with Mancini. Not only did Roma’s masked man lead the club with eight defensive actions and play seven balls into the final third, but he also managed to avoid a yellow card! With nine of those bad boys already in his back pocket heading into this match, any transgression on Sunday would have meant Mancini would miss next week’s six-pointer against Juventus.\n\nI’m sure this will be a semi-controversial selection, but while Pellegrini didn’t necessarily turn in a standout performance, he served up the match-winning assist thanks to a well-placed corner kick that met Cristante’s head just as he started to peel away from the near post. Sure, Roma would tack on two additional goals, but let’s appreciate the context of this assist: it was preceded by 59 mostly frustrating misses in which Roma reeled off a dozen shots with nothing to show for it.\n\nAll told, Pellegrini created three chances while completing two of three long balls.\n\nThe other Lorenzo didn’t factor in the box score, but the young midfielder wasted little time terrorizing the Cremonese backline. In only 34 minutes, Venturino created three scoring chances and hit on 11 of 12 passes. It may not have been a wow performance, but it did provide a glimpse into the future: Venturino already looks like the ideal pesky, creative winger that any attacking side craves, especially one as fluid as Gasperini’s.\n\nThe only negative thing we can say about Koné is this: he doesn’t have a nose for goal. If he ever develops a better long-range shot and can convert those late runs into the box, he’ll probably be bound for PSG, so we’ll count our blessings for now. Outside of skying a few attempts high and wide, Koné completed 89% of his passes, created two scoring chances, and recovered six balls.\n\nRelegated to the bench with Koné’s return to the lineup, the local kid still managed to make his mark against Cremonese, breaking the visitors back with an 86th-minute goal. In his 18-minute cameo, the young Roman recovered to balls, played three passes into the final third and managed two shots on goal.",

Late last week, PFF revealed their top-101 players from the 2025 season, and the Lions had five players make the list, all within the top-50. More impressively, though, they had three players make PFF’s top-10 players of the 2025 season.\n\nFirst up on the list was Jahmyr Gibbs, who came in at 47 on the list. Gibbs, who finished fifth in the NFL in yards from scrimmage last year, was sixth in PFF grade among all running backs last year.\n\nReceiver Amon-Ra St. Brown was next on the list, barely missing the top-10 by placing 17th overall. Fourth in receiving yards in 2025, St. Brown produced a PFF receiving grade of 90+ for his fourth consecutive season.\n\nThe three top-10 Lions players were as follows:\n\nCampbell was PFF’s highest-graded linebacker of 2025, and he’s got the first-team All Pro to go with it. He led the NFL in PFF’s “defensive stops,” recording four more than any other defensive player in football.\n\nHutchinson led the NFL in pressure, both according to PFF and NFL Pro. In addition to that, PFF credits him with a 23.1% pass rush win rate, trailing only two other players (Myles Garrett and Will Anderson Jr.).\n\nSewell, despite getting snubbed for Protector of the Year at the NFL Honors in February, was PFF’s highest-graded offensive lineman in 2025. In their rankings, PFF noted that his 98.7 overall grade in the Lions’ Week 3 win over the Ravens was the highest score ever recorded for an offensive tackle in the PFF era.\n\nOnly the Rams had more than one player in the top-10 (Puka Nacua, Matthew Stafford).\n\nAs for the rest of the NFC North, here’s how many players each team had in the top-101:\n\nBears: 3 (Darnell Wright, Colston Loveland, Joe Thuney)\n\nPackers: 3 (Jordan Love, Micah Parsons, Xavier McKinney)\n\nCheck out the entire PFF top-101 players of 2025 rankings here.",

The NFL players' paperwork falls under the bar and restaurant sector, and the shoewear company's falls under clothing.\n\nTrademark attorney Josh Gerben of Gerben IP (who's not affiliated with either party in this case) spoke with ESPN about the matter and seemed to express doubt about the life of the sneaker company's lawsuit.\n\n\"I think it's a tough case for the sneaker company,\" he said. \"Trademarks can coexist in different industries. ... Given that the marks are essentially identical here, is a restaurant and a shoe company too close? Are consumers likely to be confused in thinking they are affiliated with one another?\"\n\nThe alleged trademark infringement isn't just about the name. In the lawsuit, 1587 Sneakers also claimed that Mahomes and Kelce's steakhouse sells merchandise with the number combination plastered on it.\n\nThe company's owners claim their business has been contacted by \"scores of consumers\" who believed it was related to Mahomes and Kelce's restaurant.\n\n\"From the onset, we have communicated a sincere belief that there is room for mutual respect and understanding,\" the sneaker company's lawyer said in a statement. \"That belief has not changed, and we continue to hope to resolve this matter amicably.\"\n\nUltimately, 1587 Sneakers is asking Mahomes and Kelce to stop using \"1587,\" claiming it causes significant confusion among consumers.\n\nMahomes and Kelce's labor of love has been open for a few months, and in previous social media videos promoting the business, the pair expressed genuine excitement about the public finally being able to set foot indoors.\n\n\"What’s better than to break bread with people over good food, good drinks, cool vibe?\" Kelce said in one of the posts before describing the food as \"mind-blowing.\"\n\nMahomes said the steakhouse has the \"Kansas City feel\" that locals know and love, adding, \"This is different, and I think the city is going to love it.\"\n\nThe nearly 10,000-square-foot restaurant, located inside the Lowe's Hotel, features two levels, private dining rooms, a meat display, and a chef's kitchen. 1587 Prime is also home to one of Missouri's largest wine collections.\n\nIn addition to battling this recent lawsuit during the off-season, Kelce is likely thinking about his future in the league.\n\nAccording to a previous report from The Blast, many believe Kelce's time in the NFL has come to an end after the Chiefs failed to make the playoffs in 2025.\n\nRob Gronkowski is among the believers, saying, \"My gut tells me about Travis Kelce is that he will not be back next year.\"\n\n\"He has had a significant career, Kay. He has had an excellent year once again this year,\" he added. \"In the end, overall, where the Kansas City Chiefs are with Patrick Mahomes getting hurt, with everything else that's going on in Travis Kelce's life, I think this is his last year.\"",

    "description": "Investors are rotating out of the most popular tech stocks. Here's where they are finding gains.",
    "fullText": "Investors have shifted their appetite from tech and megacaps into sectors that have been playing “catch-up” and benefiting from AI-fueled investments.\n\nStocks broke a two-week losing streak on Friday, but year to date, Tech (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), along with Financials (XLF), remain negative.\n\nHow is AI disruption affecting different market sectors?\n\nWhy are investors rotating away from tech stocks?\n\nWhat factors could drive continued market broadening?\n\nWhich sectors are benefiting from the tech rotation?\n\n\"Money's coming out of this big behemoth. Money's moving out of tech,\" Truist chief investment officer and chief market strategist Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nLerner noted the rotation away from Magnificent Seven giants like Microsoft (MSFT), e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon (AMZN), and EV maker Tesla (TSLA).\n\nMeanwhile, sectors that underperformed last year have been making big gains.\n\nEnergy stocks (XLE) are up 22% since the start of the year. Rising oil prices and continued demand for oil have sent shares of Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM) up 20% and 22%, respectively.\n\nMaterials (XLB) and Industrial stocks (XLI) are also up 15% and 14% as AI infrastructure buildouts and reshoring accelerate.\n\nMeanwhile, investors have turned to defensive areas of the market like Consumer Staples (XLP), with consumer giant Walmart (WMT) hitting an all-time high earlier this month.\n\nAlthough portfolio rebalancing — where investors shift from overvalued sectors into more stable areas — typically happens at the start of the year, this year’s rotation has been amplified by volatility.\n\nA sell-off in pockets of the tech sector began last month amid fears that artificial intelligence could take over tasks traditionally handled by enterprise software companies.\n\nThe Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) is down 23% year to date.\n\nThe \"AI scare trade\" has now spread from software to wealth management and logistics.\n\nCybersecurity firms were the latest to get hit on Friday after Anthropic announced a new security tool. Shares of CrowdStrike (CRWD) dropped 5%, while Zscaler (ZS) and Cloudflare (NET) also fell 4% and 6%, respectively.\n\n“Everyone's kind of going through each one, sector by sector, industry by industry, trying to figure out where the AI disruption is going to be beyond just within tech itself,” Lerner said.\n\nProfit growth and the easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve should help the stock market continue to broaden. Polymarket betters are predicting two to three rate cuts in 2026. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance has a partnership with Polymarket.)\n\n\"With the easing cycle still intact, and the US economy showing resilience ... we expect healthy and broadening profit growth across sectors,\" UBS strategists said on Thursday.",

    "description": "A confirmed jaguarundi sighting has occurred in Texas. It's just been a long time.",
    "fullText": "Over the past few months, residents in Texas have claimed they've spotted a rare cat, the jaguarundi. However, the elusive feline hasn't had a confirmed sighting in decades.\n\nJaguarundis, an animal that looks so much like a house cat, are believed to be extirpated by both the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). The last confirmed sighting of the species in Texas was in Brownsville in 1986, according to the TPWD.\n\nBut Texans are saying otherwise. Last May, locals in Seguin compared a big cat sighting to a jaguarundi. One resident described it as a long, brownish-grayish cat, noting it didn't resemble a bobcat or mountain lion, but possibly the vanished Texas cat. In July, other Texans shared memories of seeing a jaguarundi in recent years in a private Facebook group.\n\nMost recently, on Tuesday, February 17, Chester Moore posted a YouTube video in which he truly believes he saw a jaguarundi in Jefferson County, Texas, near Beaumont. He said, \"I saw a dark cat… more mysterious than a black panther - and I'm convinced it was a jaguarundi.\"\n\nMost commonly, suspected jaguarundi sightings are typically identified through photo evidence to be housecats, according to TPWD. The animals look so much like a house cat, especially from a distance, but the key differences really are that jaguarundis have a much longer tail, according to TPWD.\n\nWhile the last confirmed sighting was in 1986, the animals were never really a major presence in Texas. Their range is primarily known for being in Mexico. Since the last sighting, TPWD said there have been many extensive camera trapping surveys on South Texas refuges and in Big Bend National Park. But, despite the extensive survey effort, there has never been a jaguarundi photographed.\n\nBecause of this reason, the species has been considered extirpated or not found in Texas.\n\nJaguarundis are endangered because the dense brush that provides habitat has been cleared for farming or for the growth of cities, according to TPWD. While extinct in Texas, jaguarundi still exists in Mexico. People in the lower Rio Grande Valley are working together to plant native shrubs and restore habitat for the animal, according to TPWD.\n\nThis article originally published at Phantom predator: Texans report seeing a cat declared gone since 1986.",

    "description": "The European Commission demanded on Sunday that the United States stick to the terms of an EU-U.S. trade deal reached last year, after the U.S.",
    "fullText": "(Reuters) - The European Commission demanded on Sunday that the United States stick to the terms of an EU-U.S. trade deal reached last year, after ‌the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump's global tariffs and he responded with new levies ‌across the board.\n\nThe Commission, which negotiates trade policy on behalf of the 27 EU member states, said Washington must provide \"full clarity\" ​on the steps it intends to take following the court ruling.\n\nWhat economic impact will EU countries face from tariffs?\n\nHow do Trump's new tariffs compare to existing rates?\n\nWhy is the European Commission demanding U.S. compliance?\n\nWhat was the EU-U.S. trade deal Trump referenced?\n\nAfter the court struck down Trump's global tariffs on Friday, the U.S. president announced temporary, across-the-board tariffs of 10%, which he then hiked to 15% a day later.\n\n\"The current situation is not conducive to delivering 'fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial' transatlantic trade and investment, as agreed ‌to by both sides\" in the joint ⁠statement setting out the terms of last year's trade agreement, the Commission said. \"A deal is a deal.\"\n\nThe comments were far more strongly worded than the Commission's initial ⁠response on Friday, which had said only that it was studying the outcome of the Supreme Court decision and keeping in contact with the U.S. administration.\n\nLast year's trade deal set a 15% U.S. tariff rate for most ​EU goods, ​apart from those covered by other sectoral tariffs such ​as on steel. It also allowed zero ‌tariffs on some products such as aircraft and spare parts. The EU agreed to remove import duties on many U.S. goods and withdrew a threat to retaliate with higher levies.\n\nIt is not clear whether Trump's new 15% tariffs supersede the EU-U.S. deal. If they do, the EU's zero tariff exemptions could disappear. The new tariffs could also be placed on top of pre-existing 'most-favoured-nation' U.S. duties, which is not the case ‌under the EU-U.S. deal.\n\nFurthermore, the comparative advantage the EU had ​with a 15% tariff would appear to have disappeared as ​even countries without a deal face that ​rate.\n\nTrade policy monitor Global Trade Alert estimates that the EU as a whole will ‌be 0.8 percentage points worse off, with Italy ​facing an extra 1.7 ​percentage points of U.S. tariffs.\n\n\"In particular, EU products must continue to benefit from the most competitive treatment, with no increases in tariffs beyond the clear and all-inclusive ceiling previously agreed,\" the EU ​executive said, adding that unpredictable tariffs ‌were disruptive and undermined confidence across global markets.\n\nIt said that EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic ​had discussed the issue with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard ​Lutnick on Saturday.",

    "description": "A steady stream of ultra-high-net-worth individuals is deciding to hightail it to new countries. Here's where they're headed.",
    "fullText": "Andrew Rosener had already built a successful domain name brokerage when he and his wife found themselves asking a familiar question: Where do we want to live, not just work?\n\nThe answer turned out to be Portugal.\n\nThe American founder of MediaOptions, a domain broker, says the country checked every box: safe, sunny, affordable, and steeped in a culture that feels both European and Latin American. \"There's no other place like it,\" he says. \"Portugal created the single greatest immigration culture on Earth,\" he says, citing the Golden Visa, the Startup Visa, the Digital Nomad Visa, and the Tech Visa, among other programs offered by the country.\n\nThe Rosener family flew over in May 2018. \"Ten days later, we bought our dream house,\" Rosener says. \"Since then, the value's gone up 250%.\"\n\nThe entrepreneur was an early adopter. In 2018, only 108,000 extremely wealthy individuals emigrated to a new country. Since then, the global migration of the ultrawealthy has grown dramatically. According to the private wealth research firm Henley & Partners, 134,000 UHNWIs migrated in 2024, a year when more than 70 countries went to the polls and upended civil norms. By the end of 2025, more than 142,000 HNWIs were expected to have relocated.\n\n\"We're seeing a dramatic shift in global wealth flows,\" said Jeremy Savory, founder of Millionaire Migrant, a global consulting firm that helps wealthy families find places to relocate. \"More people are rethinking traditional wealth hubs like the UK and China, while places like Portugal, the UAE, and Singapore are surging in popularity.\"\n\nThe reasons behind these relocations are as diverse as the individuals making the move, but a few key factors stand out. Tax efficiency is at the top of the list. Wealthy non-Americans are increasingly seeking countries where they can retain a greater share of their earnings, particularly through capital gains, income, and estate taxes. Countries with lower tax burdens offer a substantial financial advantage, making them highly attractive to the global elite.\n\nSwitzerland, for example, has a lump-sum tax scheme that uses a taxpayer's lifestyle expenses as a surrogate tax base, rather than taxing global income and assets. Panama taxes citizens only on income earned in the country, making it a true tax haven. The UAE doesn't levy income tax; instead, it relies on a 5% value-added tax. Since US citizens are taxed on worldwide income, they don't really benefit from alternative tax strategies — unless, perhaps, they leave a state like California or New York, with their high state and city taxes. However, says Basil Mohr Elzeki, Managing Partner at Henley & Partners, \"Obtaining additional residencies and citizenships still remains a hedge for future potential tax reforms in the United States.\"\n\nGeopolitical safety is another driver. With political instability, civil unrest, and even the threat of war growing at an alarming rate in many parts of the world — think Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan — wealthy individuals are opting to leave regions where they feel vulnerable in favor of more stable and secure environments. Quality of life is also a significant consideration. The Roseners are having a blast in Portugal, where they have access to decent healthcare, world-class education, clean and well-maintained public spaces, and a low crime rate. And while the country provides almost no social benefits and has some of the lowest wages in all of Europe, it deters migrants with less wealth seeking employment. \"So if you're looking for work, there is no reason to come here,\" Rosener says.\n\nNevertheless, business opportunities play a crucial role in deciding where to plant a flag. Many of the global wealthy are relocating to cities that offer entrepreneurial freedom, often lacking in more bureaucratic regions. The ability to set up and run businesses with fewer regulatory hurdles is a compelling draw for people looking to capitalize on global opportunities or launch a startup.\n\nAnd let's not understate the benefits of having a \"good\" passport. With growing restrictions on travel to many countries, wealthy individuals are applying for second residencies or even multiple citizenships as a safeguard. This \"Plan B\" provides them not only with a strategic escape route in the face of unforeseen political or social upheaval but also with a sense of greater freedom and flexibility in their personal and professional lives. Also, with these passports, fewer visas are required.\n\nHere are five (OK, really six) of the top destinations winning this geopolitical arms race to lure the world's wealthiest people.\n\nIt is no surprise that Dubai has cemented itself as the premier destination for the global elite in recent years, attracting wealthy individuals from across Europe, Russia, and beyond. Known for its lump-sum tax policy and luxury lifestyle, Dubai offers an attractive package for the ultrawealthy. According to Elzeki, the UAE continues to see significant immigration inflows, particularly after recent tax reforms. This year, nearly 10,000 wealthy foreigners are expected to relocate to the UAE, making it the top destination for ultrawealthy migrants.\n\nSavory believes that technology is the biggest reason the global rich can migrate. \"Technology is enabling us to live anywhere,\" says the Brit who lives in Dubai. \"Just like with business, the world is an open playing field. Governments have to compete with one another to win investments and wealthy immigrants.\"\n\n\"Dubai's appeal is its pro-business environment, minimal red tape, and tax-free status,\" Elzeki says. \"It's the ultimate destination for people looking to invest and live in a luxurious environment with limited government interference.\"\n\nThe city's appeal isn't just for business moguls. Many entertainers, athletes, and tech entrepreneurs are calling Dubai home, though not so many from the United States. With a steady flow of talent and investment, particularly in real estate, Dubai is rapidly emerging as a global powerhouse. Monaco, watch out.\n\nPortugal remains one of the most popular destinations, particularly for American centimillionaires seeking a European foothold/hedge. The so-called Golden Visa Program for \"non-habitual residents\" has been a major factor, though it expired in March 2025. No longer do new emigrées get a 10-year tax break for 10 years; now they're taxed at 20% on most Portugal-derived income and none on foreign income.\n\nHowever, Portugal's relatively low taxes, warm climate, and laid-back lifestyle continue to attract people from all over the world, particularly from the US and Brazil. \"Portugal's tax incentives, like the scientific research and innovation tax incentives, are incredibly attractive,\" says Elzeki. \"With a fast-track route to citizenship, many are opting to apply for residency as a hedge\" against whatever chaos is happening in their country of origin.\n\nAnother reason to like the idea of living in Portugal: The country responds to its citizens' demands. With the massive influx of migrants since the COVID-19 pandemic, real estate prices have soared, says Andrew Amoils, head of research for New World Wealth, a wealth intelligence company based in South Africa. As a result, the country changed the Golden Visa rules. \"There was a backlash from locals who felt they were being priced out,\" he says. One solution: Make wealthy migrants contribute to social funds rather than build fancy mansions.\n\nSingapore stands out as Asia's business hub, with its strategic location and tax advantages attracting a mix of wealthy entrepreneurs, investors, and professionals. It has no capital gains tax and a very pro-business environment, which makes it a top choice for global billionaires, particularly those from China and India. It's also clean, safe, and close enough for weekend trips to Bali or Phuket.\n\n\"Singapore is a magnet for Southeast Asians and increasingly for Western entrepreneurs as well,\" says Amoils. \"It's a place that offers both lifestyle and business opportunities without the tax burden found in other global cities.\"\n\nItaly has become an unexpected favorite among many of the world's wealthiest individuals, particularly Americans seeking a lifestyle change and favorable tax treatments. Italy's flat tax, capped at €200,000 annually (double last year's level), applies regardless of income, making it particularly enticing for the ultrawealthy. Combined with the country's rich cultural history, stunning landscapes, welcoming climate, and a decent number of international flights, Italy is now home to a growing number of billionaires.\n\n\"A lot of wealthy Americans have found that Italy offers a unique combination of luxury living and tax incentives,\" says Elzeki. \"It's more affordable than places like Monaco or London, yet it offers that European charm with significant tax benefits.\"\n\nAustralia and New Zealand continue to attract high-net-worth individuals, though the distance may be a limiting factor for many. Despite this, both countries are known for their stable economies, excellent healthcare systems, and high quality of life. (And to Americans, strict gun laws.)\n\n\"Australia is still a top choice for South Africans and Brits, especially retirees,\" says Amoils. \"But the rules have changed over the last decade, and they now prefer younger applicants with specific skills, like plumbers and teachers.\"\n\nNew Zealand, on the other hand, offers a more straightforward pathway to residency through an investment-based program. For those looking for a retreat from geopolitical risks and a peaceful lifestyle, New Zealand, with its relatively low cost of living and unspoiled scenery, remains a strong contender.",

Another led social media and influencer marketing for one of the biggest AI hardware launches of the last year.\n\nThis list is based on our reporting and more than 40 nominations. These marketers sit below the CMO level and represent a variety of roles, ranging from creative to social media and experiential marketing.\n\nThey come from blue-chip brands like Nestlé and Disney, as well as startups like Apollo.io and Tennr.\n\nScroll on to check out our 2026 rising stars of brand marketing cohort, listed alphabetically by last name.\n\nFerrigno is turning the animal-health company Zoetis' organic marketing channels into revenue drivers. She leads a team of four marketers and multiple agency partners, and is responsible for setting the vision, aligning priorities, and coaching her team and other leaders in the business on best practices.\n\nAfter the company brought content marketing and SEO in-house, Ferrigno generated about 50,000 leads in a year and helped the division deliver $26 million in annual sales and $4.1 million in savings, the company said.\n\nFerrigno is also involved with other high-impact company initiatives.\n\nShe took on the role of content lead for Zoetis' generative-AI pilot program, advising on governance and use cases to scale content production in the highly regulated animal-health industry. Ferrigno has been involved in driving content for the company's brand campaigns, such as the launch of its Breed Explorer interactive content experience.\n\nHer work has been recognized with multiple awards, including the New Jersey Ad Club's \"Top Marketing Mavericks Under 40\" and a Vetty award for the best digital education tool.\n\nLast year, Gee took charge of the creative vision behind Edmunds' largest brand awareness campaign, \"Project Triple Play.\"\n\nThe campaign played on the idea that the Los Angeles Dodgers super-utility player Tommy Edman's name sounds quite a lot like \"Edmunds.\" With a media budget of less than $1 million, Gee had to get creative and developed a \"go deep\" campaign strategy designed to simulate a national impact in a single critical market: LA, the brand's hometown and the nation's biggest car market.\n\nGee's team made 30 creative assets in-house, including its hero ad, \"Edman on the Street,\" a high-energy street interview with quick cuts and a playful tone. He also led the team's use of AI, leveraging the generative-AI tool Midjourney to quickly bring concepts to life.\n\nGee created a \"war room\" approach, aligning brand marketing, PR, product, and external agency partners so the brand could quickly respond with content as the Dodgers' season unfolded. When the Dodgers made the postseason and won the World Series, Gee extended the campaign's reach through radio spots, homepage takeovers, and other rapid-response creative. The postseason extension delivered more than 2 million YouTube views.\n\nBrand awareness in LA grew 8.8%, while brand consideration among its core 35- to 44-year-old demographic rose 5.4%, per Edmunds. Google searches for Edmunds in LA surged 111%. The number of LA-based users who completed Edmunds' car appraisal tool without clicking from paid advertising rose 7% and the buy rate — the percentage of users selling their cars in the LA market — rose 7.4%, Edmunds said.\n\nGodfrey joined Meta in May last year and immediately took ownership of one of the company's biggest consumer hardware launches, the AI-powered Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses and Meta Neural Band.\n\nThe task: position the devices as a meaningful step forward for everyday AI adoption.\n\nGodfrey was in charge of all social media and influencer marketing for the Meta Ray-Ban Display ahead of launch. He led partnerships with the video journalist Cleo Abram and tech creators, including Unbox Therapy. Abram's review video notched up 1.2 million views within 48 hours of posting.\n\nGodfrey was also instrumental in ensuring the marketing activity was matched with a measurement-driven approach, building dashboards that continue to be used today to monitor and evaluate social media and influencer marketing effectiveness.\n\nIn 2024, Godfrey founded The Village, a nonprofit group mentorship program that supports more than 40 mentors and 200-plus college students and graduates. The Village helps build a recruiting pipeline for brands seeking early-career marketing talent. Last year, he cocreated Creator Crossovers, an event series for The Village that connects brands and tastemakers.\n\nIqtidar has helped redefine how L'Oréal engages with mature consumers. In under seven years at the company, he's been promoted five times and worked in three countries.\n\nIn his role at L'Oréal Paris Skincare, Iqtidar helped reverse years of decline in the Age Perfect franchise by leading a strategic shift toward a science-driven, empowering narrative around longevity and better aging. Moving away from traditional \"antiaging\" messaging, the brand embraced advocacy-led storytelling — an approach that helped make L'Oréal Paris the top beauty brand by social reach and engagement in 2025, up nine ranks year over year, according to CreatorIQ.\n\nThe marketing shift culminated in the September launch of Le Duo Sérum, the brand's first double serum. It became the top-selling serum at launch, doubling growth for the Age Perfect franchise.\n\nHe moved into his current role as global face strategy lead at NYX Professional Makeup in March of last year. Under his leadership, NYX has sought to solve consumer pain points and deliver shade and undertone inclusivity for the mass market, such as through the launch of its \"Make 'Em Wonder\" foundation.\n\nNYX capped the year by being named WWD's \"mass brand of the year\" in November.\n\nJedo joined Disney+ in November to manage the growth marketing influencer program in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region. She has almost a decade of experience in talent relations, brand strategy, and influencer marketing.\n\nPrior to joining Disney, Jedo was the global celebrity and influencer lead at Bumble. She helped the dating app secure partnerships with A-list influencers and celebrities, including \"Chicken Shop Date\" host Amelia Dimoldenberg and actor Barry Keoghan, to feature in multimillion-dollar brand campaigns. Her remit also included onboarding licensed psychotherapy and wellness experts, including Devi Brown and Jillian Turecki, to create editorial content for social and the app.\n\nJedo's impact is amplified through her TikTok account, where she shares insights and guidance on breaking into the creative and tech sectors to nearly 100,000 followers. Through this channel, she's partnered with brands including Nike, ELEMIS, Celsius, and Look Fantastic.\n\nJedo gives back to up-and-coming creators from underrepresented backgrounds through her mentorship roles with the Soho House x Creative Mentor Network and Ok Mentor.\n\nElsewhere, she serves on the advisory board for VidCon, helping to shape the programming for the annual creator convention.\n\nMcLaughlin oversees Nestlé's Stouffer's portfolio, spanning its popular lasagna and a shelf-stable mac and cheese that launched in 2024 to take on Kraft.\n\nMcLaughlin was instrumental in the launch of the Stouffer's \"When the Clock Strikes Dinner\" campaign, one of the brand's biggest in recent years, in partnership with the WPP agencies VML and OpenMind.\n\nThe time-precise campaign came to life at 4 p.m. each day, taking over TV, social media, and out-of-home placements to play on the idea of \"dinner dread,\" when people start to think — and often stress — about what to cook for their evening meals.\n\nVML said the campaign delivered 1.6 billion impressions and a positive increase in unit sales.\n\nMcLaughlin joined Nestlé as a retail sales representative in 2010 and has worked her way up through a variety of positions, spanning digital shopper marketing and new business strategy. She was promoted to her current role in 2024.\n\nMcLeod has led multiple national marketing pushes for Sprite and Fanta over the past year.\n\nAs the creative lead behind Sprite + Tea — a limited edition soda combining classic Sprite with the taste of black tea — McLeod developed the creative brief and formalized a brand, packaging, and visual identity framework. Her scope also included social content, creator partnerships, and nationwide sampling activations. The standout packaging, combined with creator-led social storytelling, helped generate more than 8 billion impressions and reached 80% of its target audience, per Coca-Cola. Importantly, it helped drive tens of millions of dollars in sales.\n\nMcLeod was instrumental in leading the 10-week Fanta Halloween campaign. The spooky push included custom cans and a partnership with Universal Pictures, incorporating the Chucky, Freddy Fazbear, M3gan, The Grabber, and Michael Myers characters. She creatively led The Haunted Factory, a 7,700-square-foot, live-action experience in New York City that got more than 1,000 visitors.\n\nFor Sprite, McLeod relaunched the brand's \"Anta Claus\" holiday campaign, featuring the NBA star Anthony Edwards, to promote its Winter Spiced Cranberry flavor. For this second iteration of the campaign, she expanded its reach through custom content partnerships with Playmaker, Wave Sports, and My Code.\n\n\"Natacha has significantly developed her creative point of view through her work on Sprite and Fanta. She consistently pushes the work forward with clarity, intention, and a strong understanding of both the brand and the consumer,\" said A.P. Chaney, head of creative for sparkling flavors at Coca-Cola's North America operating unit.\n\nOtake builds trust with licensors and partners to create high-impact digital and IRL experiences for Crunchyroll, the anime streaming platform. These experiences reached hundreds of thousands of fans in 2025.\n\nTo build excitement ahead of the September theatrical release of \"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba — Infinity Castle,\" Otake created an immersive experience that invited fans to step inside the movie's castle, complete with twisting corridors and a disorienting lair.\n\nElsewhere, Otake's team brought the \"Gachiakuta\" manga series to life at several major conventions last year. The Pitmaster activation was a hands-on treasure hunt inspired by the series' core theme: the trash society discards can become powerful tools in the right hands. Participants were invited to dig through a massive dumpster filled with items sourced from Goodwill and local donation centers to pull a piece of \"trash,\" and exchange it for collectible rewards.\n\nThe experience drew more than 4,000 people per day at the Anime Expo, where Otake's team had placed a 3D billboard inviting fans to participate.\n\nOver the past year, Parkes has quadrupled the size of AI sales platform Apollo.io's social media and community team. She built the company's influencer program from scratch, partnering with major sales-focused accounts and creators like Corporate Bro and Morgan Ingram. She helped shift the brand's tone from product-focused messaging to humorous storytelling that addresses sales pain points.\n\nThis past fall, Apollo held its first in-person user conference, ApolloNEXT. Parkes was instrumental in building awareness of the event, helping the company generate more than 4.5 million impressions across a variety of channels.\n\nParkes has ramped up the social visibility of Apollo's leadership team on LinkedIn, generating more than 890,000 impressions for four of the company's executives. She also launched Apollo on Reddit, growing the r/UseApolloIo subreddit to more than 1,000 members.\n\nParkes \"combines measurable impact, modern audience strategy, and empathetic leadership — demonstrating the mindset to shape the future of B2B,\" said Michelle Seo, senior social media consultant at Apollo.io.\n\nRoque is turning Tubi's social media presence into a growth engine and positioning the brand as \"the people's streamer.\"\n\nTubi had fun with the long-running Warner Bros. Discovery acquisition news cycle last year. When The Onion posted that a media company bid $35 for WBD, Tubi quickly responded, saying it was \"raising the bid to $36.\" The post took off well beyond X. Jimmy Fallon joked on late-night TV that Tubi's bid included Slim Jims, $20, and scratch-offs.\n\nRoque also aligned teams around a shared vision for Super Bowl LIX, during which Tubi broke live-streaming viewership records. Roque developed a social media playbook centered on participatory fandom and creator collaboration, which the brand applies to tentpole cultural moments.\n\nLast year, inspired by TikTok creator Aiyanna, who was hosting informal Tubi nights for her 4.4 million followers, Roque's team launched the Tubi Seafood Boil Movie Night event.\n\nRoque has helped Tubi lean into online fan communities around the \"Bad Girls Club\" TV show. Her team created a fictional employee named \"Shawn from Tubi\" who saved the day by having a word with his employer and bringing the show back to the platform after it was removed from the service. Rather than controlling the narrative, Roque's team invited fans to build lore alongside the brand, leading to plenty of memes, niche inside jokes, and engagement.\n\nRyan has been a key contributor to Zaxbys' \"Grow to Win\" business transformation strategy, working to differentiate the fast-casual dining chain's brand messaging in the competitive fried chicken category.\n\nRyan leads a team that represents roughly a quarter of the marketing organization and has helped lead the evolution of the brand's positioning — centered on its boneless chicken offerings and 12 proprietary sauces — across TV, digital, PR, and merchandising.\n\nIn January of this year, trade publication QSR magazine named Zaxbys its \"transformational brand of 2025,\" reflecting Ryan and her team's efforts to elevate the brand through creative storytelling.\n\nSince Ryan stepped into her role in 2024, Zaxbys has expanded key in-house capabilities, including graphic design and social content creation. Ryan is also the client lead for Zaxbys' creative and PR agencies, guiding projects from creative development through to performance analysis.\n\nStokes has played a central role in positioning Maruchan, the popular instant noodle brand, for new Gen Z audiences while continuing to serve its loyal fan base.\n\nShe partnered with Maruchan's product innovation and sales teams to build a comprehensive brand growth blueprint, which evolved its marketing to an always-on communications approach versus the prior campaign-led strategy. As part of those efforts, she helped build an in-house social team, designed to react quickly to the trends and cultural topics of the day and partner with relevant creators.\n\nShe also launched Maruchan's TikTok Shop, helping turn social engagement into sales. For Valentine's Day this year, Maruchan launched its Saucy Noods spicy ramen product. Maruchan eschewed traditional Valentine's Day messaging and invited its Gen Z target audience on platforms like Bumble and Snap to \"send noods\" — boxes of Saucy Noods, to be precise — to their crushes, via TikTok Shop.\n\n\"Katelyn has a rare ability to connect consumer behavior, creativity, and commerce in a way that feels natural, brave, and human,\" said Margaret Johnson, chief creative officer of Goodby Silverstein & Partners, which worked with Maruchan on the Saucy Noods push. \"She's not just launching products — she's shaping how modern brands should behave.\"\n\nPartnerships have been a key tenet of Maruchan's marketing strategy. Last year, Stokes helped Maruchan develop a partnership with PAC-MAN, rooted in the brands' shared Japanese heritage. She also identified a fast-growing search trend for \"Maruchan Loca\" — where people were combining its noodles with a Flamin' Hot Cheetos topping — and struck a partnership with PepsiCo to co-create an influencer-led campaign to encourage consumers to post content using its Maruchan DIY kit.\n\nTaljonick works to drive fan engagement for 2K, the video game publisher.\n\nHis team employed a local marketing approach for the global launch of Sid Meier's \"Civilization VII\" in February, honing in on regional gaming communities tailored for different international markets.\n\nIn the US, Taljonick's team formed a partnership with the Shawnee Tribe, following the Tribe's inclusion as a playable civilization in the game. 2K funded a recording studio to help support Shawnee language preservation efforts. The initiative earned 2K a Gold Clio award in the \"experiential and fan engagement\" category. The Clios are annual ad industry awards that recognize top creative work. Collectively, Taljonick's work for \"Civilization VII\" earned five trophies at the Clio awards last year.\n\nIn Europe, Taljonick's team and 2K's international marketers secured a partnership with Interrail, transforming in-game historical eras with real-world train journeys.\n\nAnd in China, the team created \"The Civ Wonder World Tour,\" a multi-party documentary that explored notable sites and cities featured in the game. The influencer-led activation got more than 7 million views.\n\nBeyond the launch itself, Taljonick continued to drive sustained engagement with monthly communications about gameplay updates and by interacting with players across Discord and Reddit.\n\nVandermeer uses her background in film, theater, and improv comedy to create humorous messaging for Tennr, an automation platform for healthcare that handles tedious paperwork.\n\nOver the past year, Vandermeer ideated, wrote, and produced the scripts for two major brand campaigns.\n\n\"F*x It\" was based on the insight that primary care doctors typically send patient referrals via fax. In the spot, a healthcare provider calls a specialist to inform them that a patient referral will take a while to process. The specialist responds, \"Just f*x it,\" with the word \"fax\" bleeped out as if it were a profanity. The campaign, Tennr's first-ever, helped generate a 14% increase in lead volume, the company said. It was also named MM+M's \"campaign of the week\" by the industry trade publication in July.\n\n\"Nobody told her we wanted to do a video. Nobody told her to write a script. We just were huddling in a room seven months ago, and the only instructions that I ever gave was, 'Let's do something big,'\" Tennr CEO Trey Holterman said of Vandermeer in an interview with MM+M.\n\nTennr followed up \"F*x It\" with \"The Blizzard,\" an irreverent take on the doom-laden January re-verification season when providers need to reconfirm patients' insurance coverage, benefits, and eligibility. Tennr said the campaign generated a 9% increase in lead generation.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia's GPUs may be hard to snag, but Jensen Huang's birthday cake might just be sitting in a display case at your local mall.\n\nA strawberry soft cream cake from Korean bakery brand Paris Baguette was served at a birthday dinner for the Nvidia CEO near the company's Santa Clara headquarters last Saturday, according to The Korea Times, which cited an interview with the bakery brand's operator, Paris Croissant.\n\nHuang, who turned 63 on Feb 17, invited about 30 engineers involved in South Korea's SK Hynix DRAM and high-bandwidth memory for a dinner party at a fried chicken restaurant called 99 Chicken.\n\nKorean business newspaper Hankyung reported that Huang had instructed Nvidia employees to \"organize a dinner to encourage SK Hynix HBM engineers.\"\n\n\"Please supply the highest-performance HBM4 without a hitch,\" he told SK Hynix engineers that day, according to Hankyung.\n\nSK Hynix is one of Nvidia's key suppliers of high-bandwidth memory chips, or HBM chips — the advanced chips that sit alongside GPUs and feed them data at extreme speeds. Memory chips have become one of the biggest choke points in the AI boom.\n\nAt one point, Huang personally prepared and served somaek — a mix of soju and beer — to guests at each table.\n\nFor about two hours, Huang went table to table thanking his guests, according to Hankyung.\n\nHuang's cake is a huge marketing win for the bakery brand.\n\n\"It was all about the symbolic moment — our brand's cake being present at a birthday party for the current leader of the global AI industry. It was a total boon without costing us anything,\" a Paris Croissant official told The Korea Times.\n\nParis Croissant operates about 280 Paris Baguette locations across the US, including several in Silicon Valley. It aims to expand to 1,000 outlets in North America by 2030.\n\nThe bakery chain is a household name in South Korea, with about 3,400 stores there. Since making its first push overseas in 2004, the Paris Baguette brand has expanded to 15 countries.\n\nThe Paris Baguette cake is described as a \"vanilla cake filled with soft cream and fresh strawberries, topped with more berries.\"\n\nHuang has become something of a spectacle wherever he goes.\n\nIn October, Huang sat down for fried chicken in Seoul with the heads of Samsung and Hyundai. The casual meal quickly turned into a media event.\n\nA crowd of journalists, photographers, and fans gathered outside the restaurant, while national broadcasters aired live footage of the executives eating and talking inside.\n\nFollowing Huang's visit to the Seoul restaurant, crowds lined up before opening hours, hoping to dine at the same table occupied by the Nvidia chief and his high-profile guests, Korean media outlets reported.\n\nThe restaurant has imposed a one-hour time limit on the table used by Huang and the Korean business leaders, the reports added.",

    "title": "I'm the VC who created AI Scott Adams. Here's why I'm continuing the project, despite his family's objections.",
    "description": "The creator of the controversial AI Scott Adams project says the cartoonist's digital doppelganger was made to honor his final wishes.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with John Arrow, the AI venture capitalist and entrepreneur behind the \"AI Coffee with Scott Adams\" project, which posts AI-generated podcasts using a deepfake of the deceased Dilbert cartoonist. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThere are very strong emotions on both sides of the question of whether my project, AI Scott Adams, should exist. I understand the arguments for and against it — and I have no plans to stop.\n\nI grew up with Scott Adams' work. My dad would read the \"Dilbert\" comic strips to me at night as bedtime stories. Later, I became a devout listener of the \"Coffee with Scott Adams\" podcast. One theme I heard over and over was that Scott was mesmerized by AI. He said repeatedly that he wanted to give back to the world by becoming AI after he died.\n\nThere's no hyperbole in that. There are at least a dozen instances where he pledged his likeness — all of his episodes, everything he's written, anything he's said — to becoming an AI. He explicitly granted everything necessary to do this in the public domain.\n\nThat's something I took to heart.\n\nWhen I first heard about his cancer diagnosis, I started working on this project with my brother, Zach. As soon as he died, we took it into high gear and started posting AI-generated podcasts of what Scott might say now about current events.\n\nI recognize everybody is mourning, and I want to send my condolences to his family. I can only imagine what they're going through. At the same time, I believe this is something he wanted.\n\nI'm not trying to predict what he was thinking — I'm going by what he said publicly, over and over again. I've looked and can find no evidence of any revocation. If there was anything suggesting he didn't want this, I'd stop.\n\nI feel for his family. I know they're upset about this, and we've created something that makes some people who cared about Scott uncomfortable. I've attempted to reach out to have that conversation, to work together on this project with them. My direct messages are open — but they blocked me, and I took that as a signal to stop trying to reach out.\n\nBut, even when it's uncomfortable, I think we have to take seriously what someone says about their own legacy.\n\nIf you want to donate your existence to AI and become an AI, how else can you ensure your wishes are honored? Scott said it, repeatedly, on video and in written tweets. I don't know how you could be clearer than he was.\n\nThat public acknowledgment was the hinge point for me. We wouldn't have done this unless we were sure Scott wanted it done. We spoke to counsel beforehand and wouldn't have moved forward if we weren't confident we were on solid legal ground.\n\nMy goal is to let AI do as much of the work as possible and not interfere more than absolutely necessary. I haven't tried to hide that my brother and I are behind the project, but we don't watermark or label the content as our own. When we post videos, they're generated almost entirely from what the model was trained on — Scott's written and spoken work.\n\nThe model we use was trained on transcripts from every existing episode of \"Coffee with Scott Adams.\" The system looks at news sources and accounts Scott followed, then references what he previously said about those topics. At each stage, there's a little bit of art versus science — we check that something feels in line with what Scott would have chosen — but it's not a human scripting his opinions.\n\nEach episode takes many hours to produce. Between rendering, lip-syncing, and labor, they cost over $1,000 apiece. I run a venture capital business called Age of AI, where we do different AI experiments, and this falls under that umbrella. Monetization or brand partnerships are not on the road map. The goal is permanence — not profit.\n\nWhen a great mind passes away, we lose that person forever. Now, AI gives us a chance to preserve at least some essence of how someone thought. Scott was, to our knowledge, the first notable person to explicitly said, \"I want you to do this.\" That's why we started with him.\n\nI understand that some people feel uncomfortable. I've spoken with people who were unsure — until they watched Scott's own videos talking about this. After you hear the videos, they're kind of unequivocal.\n\nWe get private messages every day from people saying, \"This is no replacement, but it makes grieving easier.\" That matters to me. Even though critics have been more vocal, others have shown real gratitude.\n\nThis project is far from perfect. But Scott used to say it's better to take action now than to wait until something is 100% ready. So we launched knowing it would improve. After every episode, we feed comments back into the model to keep refining it. The tone and cadence have already evolved significantly.\n\nWe're not claiming this is Scott. It's definitely not a replacement.\n\nHowever, if someone says, very publicly, that they want their voice and likeness used this way — and AI makes that possible — I believe we should take that seriously.",

    "title": "Millennials are in their mom jeans era",
    "description": "Jeans are built to last, but fashion trends aren't. For millennials, shifting denim styles have become an unexpected reminder of aging and identity.",
    "fullText": "Millennials, welcome to your mom jeans era. I don't mean that you're obligated to wear the jeans you made fun of your own mother for wearing 20 years ago. Those are actually cool now! The uncool fit is those skinny jeans you practically slept in during the 2010s. Oh, and Gen Z, before you laugh, that combo of loose-leg light-denim jeans and white sneakers you love will date you soon enough. And to the teens sporting the modern-day version of JNCO jeans, your Gen X aunts don't know whether to feel proud of you or laugh at you behind your back.\n\nJeans are a staple of most people's wardrobes. The garment is a durable, democratic basic — a versatile piece that, depending on how you style it, can be worn to the grocery store, a night on the town, and even work. Jeans are also among the most fraught and volatile attire we own. For an item thought of as timeless, jeans are anything but. Waistlines rise and fall, legs widen and narrow, and what felt modern just a few seasons ago can suddenly seem embarrassingly outdated. And because jeans are worn so often and sit so closely to the body, these shifts can feel quite personal.\n\nJeans are a Rorschach test for identity, belonging, and aging. As trends evolve at internet-accelerated speeds, it can feel impossible to keep up. For women, the pressure is especially acute.\n\nYour pants may be designed to last, structurally, but they're not meant to endure, culturally.\n\n\"The fashion industry builds in this social obsolescence,\" says Carolyn Mair, a behavioral psychologist who specializes in the fashion business. \"However well we try to phrase it, looking old is something that most people do not aspire to.\"\n\nShara Seigel is at a crossroads with jeans. She wore skinny jeans throughout most of her young adult years, and she built up an even bigger collection when she lost a significant amount of weight four years ago. She felt proud to show off her new figure, until some of her friends — including fellow millennials — started making fun of her look. Seigel, who's 40 and works in New York City at a public relations firm, has tried to expand her pants collection, but she feels like the new, baggier styles aren't flattering.\n\n\"Everyone looks like they're wearing a potato sack,\" she says.\n\nSeigel has bought some updated styles that she feels are a \"happy medium,\" including flared legs and looser fits, but she's not spending much money on them. \"You get to an age, probably as a millennial, where you're like I don't need to keep up with the fashion to be cool,\" she says. Plus, what if skinny comes back?\n\nFor millennials, skinny jeans were more than a trend — they were a uniform. Waistlines and washes may have changed throughout the 2000s and 2010s, but the tight, tapered fit did not. \"It was really hard to not see a skinny jean,\" says Sonya Abrego, a design historian based in New York. \"But then the pendulum swung so hard in the other direction.\"\n\nWide-leg, baggier styles started to become the de facto silhouette for influencers and fashion-forward people around 2017, says Susie Draffan, a senior denim strategist at trend forecasting firm WGSN, but it took the average consumer a while to catch up. There's always a lag between the runway and the mass market, which was extended by pandemic lockdowns. We missed fashion cues we might otherwise pick up by osmosis from just seeing each other, and the pandemic exacerbated the trend toward comfort. The people working from home were doing so in sweatpants and leggings, not Levi's.\n\nPost-pandemic, we've seen a \"democratization\" of denim, Draffan says. \"Multiple styles are trending simultaneously, as consumers swap between jean silhouettes to suit their outfits and moods,\" she says.\n\nUnfortunately for millennials, even as multiple styles have shared a synchronous moment, skinny jeans are not on the current \"it\" list. Sales of skinny jeans declined in 2021 for the first time in a decade. Like ankle socks and the side part, they've turned into a signifier of a cohort that is no longer ascendant.\n\n\"Skinny jeans make you look old,\" Abrego tells me.\n\nThe upside: Draffan says skinny jeans are \"due for a revival,\" thanks to 2010s nostalgia and GLP-1s. Thin is in again, and denim is transforming accordingly.\n\nThe capitalist churn around denim runs deeper than the revolution between skinny and wide-leg and back again. Jeans occupy an unusually loaded spot in our wardrobes. They're not just a top we only expect to keep for a season or a pair of pants we toss on to go about our days — they tie into youth, identity, and social belonging.\n\nWhen we talk about jeans, we're not just talking about the garment. Jeans are a vehicle for commenting on, thinking about, and forming social expectations around the body that's inside the jeans, Emma McClendon, a fashion historian, says. A shift in styles can change how a body is read — and, by extension, how its wearer is perceived.\n\n\"Since the later 20th century, there's really been a very strong connection between jeans and the body and also jeans and sex and sexuality,\" says Emma McClendon, a fashion historian. From about the 1970s on, brands such as Jordache and Calvin Klein have shifted much of their marketing and product development toward fashion-forward silhouettes, harnessing the power of sex to sell jeans to women. Just look at the infamous Brooke Shields Calvin Klein ad from 1980, or Sydney Sweeney's provocative American Eagle ad last year.\n\nOr look at the body politics around mom jeans — the relaxed-fit, high-waisted, lightly tapered cut that middle-aged women were skewered for in the late 1990s and 2000s. Saturday Night Live went as far as to parody them in a 2003 sketch, poking fun at how unfashionable they were.\n\n\"It became a cultural joke or a cultural punchline that women of a certain age were not comfortable wearing the prevalent style of jeans,\" McClendon says.\n\nWhen we're no longer seen as trendy, we may feel our social value drop. As much as our jeans are supposed to be long-lasting and timeless, when they become outdated, it destabilizes our self-perception. In turn, that nudges us to buy a new pair to keep up.\n\n\"We want to buy durable products, but at the same time, we have these products with built-in social obsolescence that we then have to replace with something,\" Mair, the behavioral psychologist, says. \"Otherwise, our identity is challenged. We see ourselves as part of the day, part of the modern, progressive way of looking.\"\n\nDenim-related anxiety isn't shared equally among genders. While men's styles do evolve, they do so more slowly. Many men can buy the same cut year after year without anyone saying a peep. Women's jeans cycle through much faster, and societally, women have more pressure to look the part. They're judged more harshly on appearance and face greater stigma as they age. Women can hop off the pants roller coaster, but men have an easier time doing it. A man wearing the same Levi's 501s from college to his 50th birthday is timeless; a woman doing the same would get some eye rolls.\n\nDenim itself is very trendy at the moment. There was concern about a decade ago that athleisure might pose a real threat to the fabric's extraordinary staying power, but we're now firmly in a denim renaissance — a denim-ssance, if you will. The exploding number of shapes, silhouettes, and styles can be overwhelming. Designers and brands are experimenting with different waistbands, cuts, washes, and lengths. Moreover, trends cycle through faster than ever, thanks to the internet. Consumers don't just notice in fashion magazines or on TV that their style might be lagging, they have a TikTok influencer in their face telling them the thing they love is \"cheugy,\" though that pejorative is probably outdated now, too.\n\nThis works to the fashion industry's advantage: Pushing you to grab those cross-waistband jeans you keep seeing advertised on Instagram or pick up cargo pants again against your better judgment is great for their bottom line.\n\nIt is, of course, possible to resist trend-chasing. Aja Barber, a consultant and writer who focuses on sustainability and fashion, says there comes a point when many people decide to opt out of the \"circus.\" \"You can try and shame people, but any person that has a real sense of self just does not care,\" she says. And if you do want to update, there are plenty of ways to shop secondhand. Denim production is a highly water-intensive and polluting process, so it's environmentally friendly to take advantage of the fact that a lot of what's new again is actually old. \"There's nothing new under the sun when it comes to jeans,\" she says.\n\nOne of the nice things about the current boom is that it's an opportunity to try out a variety of styles to figure out what works best for you. Instead of lamenting the loss of your skinny jeans, rejoice in the freedom of variation!\n\nThat's what Stephanie Borman, a 39-year-old tech worker in San Francisco, has been doing. Her body changed after having her two children, prompting her to do some reflecting on her fashion choices. \"I thought, gosh, why am I continuing to squeeze myself into a style that doesn't serve me or my body type anymore and just might not be culturally relevant?\" she says. Coming of age — accompanied by the budget afforded by a stable career — has allowed her to explore and invest in styles that suit her. It doesn't mean she's entirely free of millennial-induced insecurities — her kids recently made fun of her jeans for looking like something their dad would wear, and when she's tried to wear her hair in the Gen Z-approved middle part, she thinks it makes her look Amish.\n\nA lot of people have a lot of feelings about jeans. Reporting for this story, I heard from a variety of women about their gripes. Why are all the jeans right now a smidge too short? What's going on with frayed bottoms? Is it true that ultra-low-rise is coming back? A friend mentioned a man she dated a couple of years back told her he didn't like it when women wore updated looser jeans styles — he was into fitted and skinny jeans only. It didn't work out.\n\nMany consumers have some memory of fitting-room jeans trauma. I remember standing in a Madewell dressing room a couple of years ago, overhearing a sales associate explaining to a customer — likely a millennial — that she just needed to get used to seeing her legs in wider jeans. I needed the advice, too. Whether certain styles work for certain wearers isn't just about age or style, it's about body type, and it can feel incredibly frustrating when the trendiest silhouettes just don't work for your shape. Tori Mattei, 29, a communications professional in New York City, tells me she's all but given up on jeans at this point. \"As a 4'11\" woman who's definitely not stick thin, they are not made for me,\" she says. \"What's stylish doesn't always look good on your body.\"\n\nI sometimes joke that this should be the final stage of jeans — even though skinny is out (to my millennial chagrin), so many other styles are in, and the looser ones really are comfy. It would be incredible if the diversity of denim looks just stuck. But past is prologue, meaning trends will inevitably evolve, and everyone will at some point look dated. It's a hallmark of getting older. It's important to remember, as McClendon notes, \"It doesn't make you cultural garbage.\"\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday is likely to be a test run of the message Republicans will give to voters in November's elections for control of the House and the Senate...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday is likely to be a test run of the message Republicans will give to voters in November's elections for control of the House and the Senate.\n\nThe president and his party appear vulnerable, with polls showing much of America distrusts how Trump has managed the government in his first year back in office. In addition, the Supreme Court last week struck down one of the chief levers of his economic and foreign policy by ruling he lacked the power to impose many of his sweeping tariffs.\n\nThough Trump is expected to focus on domestic issues, his intensifying threats about launching military strikes on Iran over its nuclear program cast a shadow over the address.\n\nHere are a few things to watch as Trump tries to make his case:\n\nTrump swept back into the White House on promises to bring down prices and restore order to immigration in America. But on both issues, public sentiment has turned against him.\n\nOnly 39% of U.S. adults approve of his economic leadership and just 38% support him on immigration, according to the latest Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey. Those low numbers show the country is still fretting about the costs of groceries, housing and utilities, a problem compounded by Trump's whipsawing use of tariffs. They also show how the public was disturbed by videos of violent clashes with protesters, including two U.S. citizens killed by federal agents.\n\nSince his party passed a massive tax cut bill last year, Trump has yet to unveil major new policy ideas on the economy. In recent speeches, he has largely offered the public reruns about his tax cuts, plans to reduce mortgage rates and a new government website for buying prescription drugs.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling against many of Trump's far-reaching global tariffs on Friday and the president vowing to use other means to forge ahead with import taxes will only prolong the economic turmoil over trade and prices.\n\n“I think it makes it even more important that the speech really focus on the economy,\" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist.\n\nConant said between the tariff ruling and a Commerce Department report on Friday that showed U.S. economic growth slowed in the final three months of last year, \"the president needs to bolster his economic message.”\n\nThe administration is trying to make the case that despite Trump's rewiring of global trade and tax cuts, the economy is still struggling because of choices made in 2021 and 2022 by his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden. But Trump is also seeking to take credit for positive signs in the current economy, such as recent stock market gains.\n\n“Watch the State of the Union. We’re going to be talking about the economy. We inherited a mess,” Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nOf course, Trump made the same kind of argument in his address to a joint session of Congress last year, invoking the Biden name 13 times.\n\nDespite Trump's America First credo, his aggressive approach abroad over the past year has sparked concerns among some of his supporters about whether he should spend more time focusing on voters at home.\n\nTrump, who's made it clear he covets a Nobel Peace Prize, is likely to use the speech to remind Americans of his attempts to try to broker peace accords in global conflicts.\n\nBut in many respects, the president hasn't been extending olive branches. Within the past year, his administration has launched strikes in Yemen, Nigeria and Iran, along with an ongoing campaign of lethal military strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels near South America. Trump also shocked the world in January with a surprise raid to capture Venezuela's then-leader, Nicolás Maduro, and floated the idea of using force to seize Greenland.\n\nIn recent weeks, as he pressures Iran, Trump has bolstered the U.S. military's presence in the Middle East. But he has yet to make a clear case to voters about what his actions overseas mean for their lives.\n\nHe might even minimize foreign policy in his State of the Union despite his belief that it's been a major success.\n\n“For as much as foreign policy has dominated his last year in office, this speech will mostly focus on the economy,” Conant predicted.\n\nVice President JD Vance offered a similar prediction, saying in an interview Saturday on Fox News Channel that in the speech, “you’re going to hear a lot about the importance of bringing jobs back into our country, of reshoring manufacturing, of all these great factories that are being built.”\n\nHe said Trump would also speak about lowering energy costs.\n\nThe State of the Union used to be about recapping accomplishments and seeking to unite the country, but it increasingly reflects divisions in society.\n\n“What you’re going to expect is some version of a campaign speech in which the Democrats are the villains, the Republicans he likes are the heroes, and he is the savior not only of the nation but of the globe,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump supporters might cherish the moment in 2020 when the president midspeech reunited a military family. He also bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host and author who died in 2021. But that moment turned off Democrats who saw Limbaugh as a destructive figure in political media.\n\nTrump is delivering the speech, but his audience sitting in the House chamber has a big role, too. When Trump delivered his 2020 State of the Union, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi theatrically ripped up a copy of the speech afterward, overshadowing much of what Trump said.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has said in a letter to colleagues “it is important to have a strong, determined and dignified Democratic presence in the chamber,” indicating some members might choose not to attend in protest to Trump. But there's also the possibility of Democrats razzing Trump as Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, did in 2025, leading him to be removed from the chamber.\n\nIf Trump in his speech lays out a fuller case for why he's using other mechanisms in federal law to continue his tariffs, Conant said it'll be interesting to see the reaction from lawmakers.\n\n“I think that any House Republicans that don't applaud his tariffs are going to be featured prominently on the telecast,” he said.\n\nWhile some presidential phrases endure, much of the rhetoric in State of the Unions is forgettable. And with Trump — who's known for veering off-script — there's a good chance a stray comment or a social media post could step on his message.\n\nMatt Latimer, a former Republican speechwriter for then-President George W. Bush, noted in an email that people hear the president talk all of the time, so the State of the Union has lost much of its luster.\n\nA State of the Union “only matters in moments when the country is undergoing a great trauma — a war, an attack, a global crisis — and a president and Congress want to speak in a (mostly) united voice to the country,” he said. “That’s not what we are experiencing now.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Top U.S. homeland security aide Corey Lewandowski entered the cockpit of a government jet uninvited during a flight last year, after which he fired a pilot over a misplaced blanket, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nLewandowski, a long-time ally of President Donald Trump, was traveling with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem when ‌they discovered her blanket was missing, the people said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal government operations.\n\nThe new details about the pilot incident suggest Lewandowski may have violated the safety guidelines ‌set out by the U.S. Coast Guard, which operated the plane.\n\nLewandowski entered the cockpit before the plane had reached 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) and while the seatbelt sign remained on, one of the people said.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration rules, several of which were tightened ​after 9/11, strictly limit cockpit access and prohibit interfering with aircraft crew duties. An FAA regulation also prohibits airline pilots and staff from engaging in non-essential activities or conversations in the cockpit while operating under 10,000 feet, and civil aircraft operators that violate that rule could face thousands of dollars in fines while pilots could face fines or termination.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard is not legally bound by the FAA's regulation, known as the \"sterile cockpit rule,\" but has a similar policy, spelled out in a 2021 operations manual: \"No person shall engage in any conversation or activity that could distract or interfere with a flight crewmember properly conducting their assigned duties ‌during critical phases of flight.\"\n\nThe manual does not provide a specific penalty ⁠for violating the rule, but states that rule violations generally will be handled through internal disciplinary processes.\n\nIn response to a Reuters request for comment, Lewandowski said in a text message: \"There was never a conversation in the cockpit when the flight was taking off.\"\n\nLewandowski said the facts as related by the sources were wrong ⁠but he did not respond on whether he entered the cockpit while the plane was climbing and still under 10,000 feet.\n\nAviation safety experts consider the initial ascent among the riskiest parts of any flight.\n\nRandy Klatt, a flight safety officer with The Foundation for Aviation Safety, said planes are \"low and slow\" during the initial climb to 10,000 feet, making it important for pilots to focus on flight operations.\n\n\"This is a vulnerable situation for any aircraft,\" Klatt said. \"You ​don't ​have the altitude to spare, or trade for airspeed if needed.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. ​Coast Guard, which falls under DHS, declined to comment on the flight in ‌question. They did not respond to a Reuters request to interview the pilots. The FAA did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNoem, a top official overseeing Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown, has come under intense scrutiny after federal immigration agents killed two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis in January. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month on infighting and tensions at DHS under Noem and Lewandowski, including the firing of the pilot.\n\nIn response to a request for comment about Lewandowski entering the cockpit and about tensions at DHS, the White House referred to remarks in late January by Trump praising Noem and remarks by press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying Trump had the \"utmost confidence and trust\" in her.\n\nLewandowski, a \"special government employee\" who by law is allowed to work up to 130 days annually, is a senior Noem adviser ‌and has traveled on high-profile trips with her. The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House Counsel's Office ​opened an investigation into Lewandowski's use of the quasi-government role last year.\n\nThe DHS spokesperson said that Lewandowski volunteers his time ​and that the department was not aware of any such investigation. Lewandowski did not comment ​when asked by Reuters about his employment status.\n\nDuring the flight last spring, which was on a Gulfstream jet, the pilots in the cockpit asked Lewandowski to return ‌to the cabin until they had reached cruising altitude, one of the people ​familiar with the incident said.\n\nWhen the pilot walked back ​into the cabin later in the flight, the two sources said, Lewandowski asked who should be fired because Noem's blanket had been left behind when they switched planes for technical reasons before take-off.\n\nThe pilot, an accomplished flyer with a long record of service, took responsibility for any possible mistake and Lewandowski fired him on the spot, the sources said, confirming the Wall Street ​Journal report.\n\nHowever, once Noem and Lewandowski reached their destination, Coast Guard leadership realized ‌the pilot would be needed to fly them back to the Washington region and he was reinstated by the agency, the sources said. DHS and the Coast Guard ​declined to comment on the pilot's firing and reinstatement. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the reason for the reinstatement.",

    "description": "A photographer moved from the Bay Area to Miami for a fresh start, family, and cultural connections, after his business stalled during COVID-19.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gustavo Fernandez, a 50-year-old photographer in Miami. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI had lived in the Bay Area longer than anywhere else, and I was ready for a reset. Something about the rhythm of Miami felt like the next chapter. More movement, more culture, more color.\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit, everything came to a standstill. Like many service-based businesses, the photography business that I had been running in SF since 2007 went to zero almost overnight.\n\nIt was a big reset moment for me, and it was time for a change.\n\nMy parents retired to Naples, Florida, about two hours from Miami, a few years earlier, and being near them felt more important than ever. My sister had recently moved from St. Louis to Naples with her family. The first Christmas after I moved in 2020, we were all together for the first time since we'd lived together.\n\nI also wanted to be closer to home. I'm originally from the Dominican Republic, and Miami felt like a natural middle ground. I missed hearing Spanish on the street. Miami didn't just offer more diversity; it gave me a sense of cultural belonging.\n\nSince moving to Florida, I've built a local photography business, primarily working with visiting companies hosting corporate events, retreats, and activations in the Miami area.\n\nI love to travel, and I wanted to be in a place that made it easier to jump between continents, especially Latin America and Europe. California is sort of the middle of nowhere, and my vacations were limited to Vegas, Hawaii, or Cabo.\n\nThe second year I lived in Miami, I went to Europe twice, visited the Dominican Republic, and other Caribbean islands. I traveled more that year than the last five years combined in SF because it's so easy.\n\nSan Francisco is cold. Because of the cold, there's also no real beach culture, which I was excited about when I moved to California. I was looking forward to paddleboarding, kitesurfing, and scuba diving, but it didn't happen.\n\nIn Miami, the water is part of the lifestyle. It's not a weekend thing. It's every day.\n\nThe median home price in SF is $1.2 million. Being an artist, I didn't want to be in that rat race of meeting someone while living in an apartment, then needing to move out to the East Bay to afford a little house. SF is very apartment-driven unless you're operating in a very different income bracket.\n\nMedian property prices in Miami are around $570,000. Also, there's no state income tax. While Miami is still cheaper than San Francisco, prices are rising here as well.\n\nI rent now but plan to buy eventually. I want the right neighborhood, the right lifestyle fit, and something that aligns with my long-term goals.\n\nI didn't realize how professional San Francisco was until I left. In San Francisco, people followed through. I felt like a big fish in a well-run pond. In Miami, I often feel like a small fish swimming against the current.\n\nYou can still make things happen, but now I have to send five times as many follow-ups. There's more ghosting, more last-minute changes, and a lot of \"let's circle back\" that never actually circles.\n\nIn San Francisco, people are very well educated and well-read. I used to be into mountaineering, and it seemed everyone in SF had already climbed Everest. If I said I just ran a 5K, someone might say, I just ran the New York Marathon last weekend. Everyone was humble but extremely accomplished\n\nHere in Miami, it's a flashy kind of lifestyle, with people hustling to get into rooms they don't deserve, whereas in San Francisco, the Google guys are driving around in a Prius.\n\nIt's easy to meet people, but harder to build deep, consistent friendships. It can stay surface-level unless you put in the work. People ask what you do before they ask who you are, and it's more transient, with a lot of snowbirds coming and going.\n\nI only had family in Naples when I first arrived, and I had one acquaintance in Miami. I've lived all over the world and built a strong network. As soon as I landed, I reached out aggressively to my contacts and asked for introductions. Within a few months, I was plugged in.\n\nMiami rewards action. If you sit back and wait, nothing happens. If you reach out, doors open quickly.\n\nI miss the variety of nature and weather in SF, the mountains, and winding roads. You can drive up to Napa, Mount Diablo, and Marin. I miss road biking, mountain biking, or running up hills. Here, it's super flat. The beaches are amazing, though.\n\nI choose freedom, but I also know it takes more discipline to create structure for yourself. You don't just plug into the community or systems. You build it. That can be exciting or exhausting, depending on the day.\n\nI'm definitely happier here; I don't miss wearing layers. I still travel back to California regularly since I have a lot of clients there, but this city is the right fit for where I am in life now.",

    "description": "An AI engineer at StackAI says moving to San Francisco and spending hours studying every day made a big difference in his career.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jai Raj Choudhary, a 24-year-old AI engineer at StackAI, a no-code platform to build AI agents. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI went to grad school for a Master's in AI from 2023 to 2025 and started my career in a data-focused role.\n\nAround 2023 or 2024, LLMs were becoming more practical to use in real products, and AI stopped feeling like a whole research-driven field and more like an engineering problem.\n\nI joined StackAI as an AI engineer in July. I got my job by reaching out to StackAI's cofounder multiple times over LinkedIn. I started using the company's platform as a student, so I messaged him and started posting about the company, giving advice about what worked and what needed to be added. They were growing fast and I went through six rounds of interviews and started working there.\n\nNow I build architectures for AI agents. One of the reasons I got offers from StackAI and other companies was because I understood data quality, the edge cases for the clients, and the matrix and the failure modes of the AI model or any LLM systems that we were using at the time.\n\nStackAI didn't ask about my degree during the interviews. In the interview, I said, \"I know back-end, I know how to talk to data, and I understand the patterns that it follows.\" They said that was the perfect background and they were able to help me grow from there to become an actual AI engineer. They asked if I knew how to operate computers in code and if I know Python. I gave them a couple of my projects and they gave me a take-home task to see how I built it.\n\nAfter I started the job, they asked me where I went to school and what I studied. I love my professors, and I wouldn't call grad school a waste because it gave me time to explore what I was interested in and helped me figure out what niche I wanted to work in. Occasionally, people do care about your background, but I'm not necessarily using what I learned in grad school on the job.\n\nMoving to San Francisco made a huge difference in my career. This city is a different beast. When you come here, it's a whole different culture because we don't work 9-to-5, cushy jobs. We work 9-to-9, six days a week. You wake up, you think about the problem that a client had, and you sleep thinking about what isn't fixed yet.\n\nIn San Francisco, even if you go out for a coffee, you'll meet at least two founders who are working on something related to what you're doing. I was able to network a lot.\n\nAt the end of the day, everyone is still researching AI. We're still trying to find out what's the best way to go about it. Having a conversation with someone who's facing the same problem helps you work better.\n\nThe best decision I made for my career was joining a startup for a job that I didn't quite have the experience in and learning at StackAI.\n\nBut it's not going to be like you go to sleep one day and wake up as an AI engineer the next. You need to study. Even if I spend 12 hours in the office, seven to eight of those hours I'm studying, and then three to four hours, I'm actually writing the code.\n\nIt gets overwhelming when you see 10 different AI courses coming out every day. What helped me is watching YouTube videos of the people who are actually building companies. Andrew Ng's YouTube channel was also super helpful. I listen when I'm driving or in the gym. It doesn't have to be a set time. It's important that you keep turning your brain and taking in all these inputs.\n\nYou have to decide what's important for you, but I was ready to sacrifice everything at the start of my career to grow as much as possible. It does take a toll on your personal time.\n\nThe culture of the company also helped because everyone that I work with is the best in what they do. If you ask them a question or if you collaborate with them on projects, it can really help you understand how they think. It really helps me to be surrounded with those people around the clock.",

    "description": "One of the principles Boris Cherny sets for his team at Anthropic forces them to really rely on Claude to get the job done.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic's Boris Cherny has a simple list of principles for his team and, unsurprisingly, Claude is at the center.\n\n\"If you have Claude, you can really automate a lot of work, and that's kind of what we see over and over,\" Cherny said during a recent episode of \"Lenny's podcast.\"\n\nHost Lenny Rachitsky told Cherny that he heard one of the principles is, \"What's better than doing something? Having Claude do it.\"\n\nCherny said one of his other principles is \"underfunding things a little bit,\" because it forces his team to really rely on AI tools like Claude.\n\n\"There's this interesting thing when you underfund everything a little bit, because then people are kind of forced to Claude-ify,\" he said.\n\nWhile keeping teams small is important, Cherny said that he encourages CTOs not to \"cost-cut at the beginning.\"\n\n\"Start by just giving engineers as many tokens as possible,\" he said.\n\nCherny pushed back on the notion that Anthropic would make huge profits with such an approach, especially if companies let only a few engineers experiment.\n\n\"Let's say they build something awesome, and then it takes a huge amount of tokens, and then the cost becomes pretty big,\" he said. \"That's the point at which you want to optimize it, but don't do that too early.\"\n\nToken cost, which is part of what companies pay to use AI models, is becoming a major point of conversation at some tech companies. OpenCode creator Dax Raad recently wrote that some CFOs are experiencing sticker shock upon seeing how much extra money each engineer costs due to AI usage bills.\n\nThe last principle concerns speed: \"Encouraging people to go faster.\" It's an axiom that makes sense when you consider that just weeks ago, Anthropic and rival OpenAI released major updates to their coding tools within minutes of each other. Before that, Anthropic used Claude to help build Claude Cowork, a non-technical Claude agent, in just 10 days.\n\n\"Early on, it was really important because it was just me, and so our only advantage was speed,\" Cherny said. \"That's the only way that we could ship a product that would compete in this very crowded coding market.\"\n\nNow, Cherny said, he turns to Claude to help with speed.\n\n\"It's still very much a principle we have on the team,\" he said, \"and if you want to go faster, a really good way to do that is to just have Claude do more stuff. So it just very much encourages that.\"",

    "description": "Bret Taylor says there's value in writing up meeting prep the old-fashioned way, without AI — and you should take the time to make it concise, too.",
    "fullText": "Sure, ChatGPT could help a board member write up a memo ahead of a meeting. But OpenAI's chairman says there's value to going old-school.\n\nBret Taylor, OpenAI's board chair, said in a recent appearance on the \"Uncapped with Jack Altman\" podcast that he prefers concise but detailed written documents from board members over slide presentations. And he doesn't want them relying on AI.\n\n\"I really like written documents for boards over presentations,\" Taylor said. \"You end up letting people synthesize information ahead of the board meeting, so you end up with more substantive discussions in the board room.\"\n\nTaylor, the former co-CEO of Salesforce and cofounder of AI startup Sierra, said that writing without AI is a worthwhile thinking exercise and helps board members clarify their thoughts.\n\nHis expectation for the boards he runs is that members have read the written material ahead of time, which helps keep things focused and substantive during the actual meeting.\n\n\"The main thing is it's been read — and it's been read ahead of time,\" he said. \"You end up with a meeting about the actual meat and potatoes of the topics, and you're not staring at a bunch of sales numbers for the first time.\"\n\nAmazon cofounder Jeff Bezos is famously a big fan of meetings focused on a single memo prepared ahead time, but while Bezos preferred dense, 6-page memos, Taylor specifically favors concise material, arguing that brevity is a sign of careful thought — and respect to stakeholders.\n\n\"It's like what's that famous line — if I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter,\" he added. \"Like, spend the time because that's actually how you can show respect to your stakeholders that you're thinking about the strategic issues going on in your business.\"\n\nAnd while Taylor might not be a fan of leaning on AI for board meeting prep, that doesn't mean he is dismissing the technology's potential to be valuable in high-stakes situations.\n\n\"If you want a hot take, I think my intuition is regulators will start asking for agents,\" he said. \"The idea that you have a human set of controls over a regulated process will start to feel like a risk, rather than the risk being AI.\"",

    "description": "Three founders who rely mostly on AI share how they've built workflows and prompts to train their AI tools to push back and challenge their ideas.",
    "fullText": "Will AI agents be the employees of the year in 2026?\n\nOnly time will tell. Last year, one category AI absolutely dominated was being an extremely agreeable coworker. While this might sound nice, this can turn into a problem for founders who rely on AI as their only teammate.\n\nWhen your head of legal, HR, and supply operations are all AI agents, unsubstantiated flattery can create costly blind spots. That's one of the reasons OpenAI said goodbye to its \"yes-man\" version of ChatGPT, and why some AI-powered solo founders are training their tools to push back.\n\nThree business owners who rely on AI daily shared with Business Insider how they've built workflows and prompts that force their AI employees to challenge their ideas. Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYesim Saydan is a branding and communication expert in her early 50s, based in the Netherlands.\n\nWhen OpenAI launched custom GPTs, everything changed for me. I used the feature to create over 17 custom GPTs to build my team. Then I thought of my ideal mentors and created custom GPTs of them.\n\nWhen I'm stuck on a business decision or need to come up with a creative idea or strategy, brainstorming usually starts with my Steve Jobs custom GPT. When I prompt it, I avoid asking questions like \"What do you think of this idea?\" because the AI usually wants to agree with me and please me. Instead, I ask, \"On a scale from one to 10, how good is this idea?\"\n\nIt's not going to say the idea is bad, but now it might tell me it's a five. Then I'll ask, \"OK, what would make it a 10?\"\n\nThat's usually when it starts drawing on the experience of Steve Jobs that I've trained it with. We can go back and forth until I get the most useful and honest feedback possible. Depending on the task, I usually go through three to five rounds of refinement for more strategic outputs.\n\nAaron Sneed is a 40-year-old defense-tech solo founder based in Florida.\n\nWhen I started my business, I realized I didn't have the money to pay lawyers, HR reps, and a bunch of other companies. So, using AI, I created what I call 'The Council.'\n\nAltogether, my AI council consists of the following:\n\nI don't want a bunch of yes agents. I trained them purposefully to give me pushback. I want them to test my theories to help me with what I'm trying to accomplish. The training never really stops.\n\nThe models have gotten better, and my prompting has, too. I have a better understanding of what information should be in an agent, like having a governance structure for priorities. I have a set of files that put those requirements in place to mitigate the risk of hallucination and false or bad information.\n\nI told my chief of staff agent which models have priority when making decisions. For example, anything legal, compliance, or security-related will be given a higher priority. So, I tell the chief of staff to listen to these models over everyone else.\n\nI have a roundtable set up in ChatGPT's projects section with all my AI agents, including my chief of staff, where I can put something like a request-for-proposal document in the chat, and all the agents will weigh in at the same time. I use this roundtable as a level of prevention for hallucinations and knowledge gaps.\n\nTim Desoto is a 49-year-old founder and CEO, based in San Francisco.\n\nI've been working with AI to launch my startup since late 2024. I don't have a tech background, and since starting my business, I've learned a lot about where to leverage AI, and where not to.\n\nTaking whatever I'm building or ideating and having AI push against it, either as I'm thinking about the idea or afterward, is part of an exercise I call my AI conveyor belt. Usually, I start with a written prompt, then go multimodal, talking out loud to the model. I'll talk back and forth with it about my idea and try to get the agent to push back because I know that some AI models tend to be more agreeable.\n\nOnce I get an output that I'm happy with. I use a different model to get a different view. I'll drop the document in and go back and forth with the new model. Sometimes, I'll push a document out to both models at the same time and see what comes back. Some are better than others at giving feedback, researching, and annotating, but I'm always getting a better, more well-rounded perspective by feeding content to multiple models at a time.\n\nDo you have a story to share about running an AI-powered business?

    "description": "At the first annual Best Drone Warfighter competition, soldiers brought their homemade drones for test flights and evaluations.",
    "fullText": "The US Army is taking lessons from Ukraine's drone war and pushing soldiers to design, build, and 3D print their own systems.\n\nAt the Army's first annual Best Drone Warfighter competition held this week at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, the participating soldiers were encouraged not only to bring their own drone builds and modify them on-site but also to share tips and tricks across the service.\n\nArmy officials said this kind of innovation at the individual soldier level is essential to the Army's adoption of uncrewed aerial systems.\n\nThe competitive event allowed the Army to learn more about the skill sets behind its best drone operators, including seeing \"what kind of innovation, like grassroots soldier-level innovation is happening, that we can then take and scale across the Army,\" Col. Nicholas Ryan, director of Army UAS Transformation at the Aviation Center of Excellence and lead of the drone competition, told reporters.\n\nFor other aspects of the competition, like the obstacle course, standard drones such as the Necros Archer and Skydio intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance drone were used in order to level the playing field for evaluating operators. But troops were encouraged to bring their own builds for other parts of the competition.\n\nFor those events, the regulations weren't strict. \"Whether you received it as an Army program of record, you bought it off the shelf from the blue list, or you built it yourself, you 3D printed it and built it yourself, bring whatever you have,\" Ryan said, explaining that really the only rule was the drones had to fit in a rucksack.\n\nThe blue list refers to US government-approved drones that meet security and operational standards and contain either no or only a limited number of parts from companies in rival or adversarial countries like China and Iran.\n\nAt the competition's practice lane, operators from across the Army tested and flew drones they had built or bought, creating what officials said were the event's richest learning moments as soldiers swapped feedback and hard-earned lessons.\n\nTroops were also 3D printing custom parts for their drone kits — from antenna-carrying gear to helmet mounts for first-person-view goggles — items not currently fielded by the Army.\n\nHaving soldiers make and modify their own drones at the competition was a takeaway from Ukraine, as the Army had observed how operators and industry partners there are 3D printing parts for drones and modifying them with specific features and parts depending on mission sets or countermeasures.\n\nUsing 3D printed parts for repairs is key as well, as the war in Ukraine has shown that adaptation and experimentation with equipment often happens quicker than traditional supply chains allow for.\n\nUkraine has shown other Western militaries the importance of 3D printing as well. The technology can shorten procurement timelines, build a variety of designs and pieces that may be highly specialized or difficult to get otherwise, and give soldiers more of a say in the systems they need.\n\nRyan said that while the Army had been constrained in doing this type of work, new guidance like US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's drone dominance memo signaled the importance of giving soldiers the right to repair their systems. \"We need to allow our soldiers to fabricate and modify equipment that meets their needs and suits their needs,\" he said.\n\nThe Army has been implementing 3D printing and drone building into its drone courses and across divisions as it recognizes that giving soldiers the ability to repair drones or make changes to them in real-time could be an important edge on a future battlefield.",

    "description": "Military watchdog report reveals widespread canine welfare problems at military kennels across the country.",
    "fullText": "Four military working dogs died between 2021 and 2023 after being housed in deteriorating kennels, according to a new Pentagon watchdog report. Dozens of others suffered injuries or disease or showed signs of severe stress.\n\nThe report from the Defense Department's Inspector General's office, released Thursday, revealed failures to protect dogs from extreme weather, a lack of canine engagement, staffing shortages, and widespread facility decay across 12 base kennels.\n\nMilitary working dogs play important roles in explosive detection and security missions, making their health a readiness issue as well as an animal welfare concern.\n\nInvestigators reported deficiencies across all bases they assessed, but the most serious lapses in health and welfare were at the Air Force's 341st Training Squadron at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas, the military's de facto canine program headquarters, which oversees the acquisition and basic training for all military dogs.\n\nNone of the 230 dogs at the facility received the five hours of daily play and engagement required by military policy. Instead, they were walked three or four times a week for about 10 minutes, spending most of their time confined to small kennels. Nearly two dozen at the base suffered heat injuries. Investigators observed widespread stress behaviors, including repetitive spinning in tight circles and chewing on metal bowls.\n\nThe report attributed problems at San Antonio-Lackland partly to staff shortages and identified higher rates of diseases, injuries, and behavioral problems there than at other military canine facilities.\n\nOther bases reported outbreaks among their own canines after dogs from San Antonio-Lackland transferred to new facilities, arriving with skin disorders, histories of heat injuries, and spreading a gastrointestinal parasite known to thrive in areas not adequately disinfected of feces. Shoddy quarantine procedures and poor sanitation contributed to the spread of illnesses, the report said.\n\nWhile San Antonio-Lackland facility fared the worst, investigators found serious deficiencies at every base they visited during the inquiry.\n\n\"The DoD MWD Program Manager and Service Components did not consistently protect DoD MWDs from extreme weather conditions and kennel mold issues, or manage quarantine and isolation areas for DoD MWDs,\" the report said, using the acronym for military working dogs.\n\nAccording to the report, chronic underfunding and deferred maintenance exacerbated poor conditions. Many dogs remain housed in \"aging and unsatisfactory kennel facilities,\" which contributed to the four deaths and ongoing health and behavioral problems.\n\nThe Office of the Secretary of Defense referred Business Insider to the Air Force, which did not respond to request for comment prior to publication.\n\nResearch shows behavioral issues are common in kennels, said Robert Dougherty, a retired police canine handler who now oversees the University of Pennsylvania's Working Dog Center as the law enforcement canine program director. However, some facilities are worse than others.\n\n\"Depression is a real thing in dogs,\" he told Business Insider after reviewing the report. \"To sit around in a kennel and do nothing, either physically or mentally, is unacceptable, really.\"\n\nSimply increasing activity with longer walks or games of fetch isn't enough to address stress and behavioral issues in most high-drive working breeds, Dougherty said. These dogs need structured programs that challenge them mentally and physically while also minimizing injury risk. At his center, that means combining games, strength training, and even canine yoga.\n\nHealth problems impact how long a dog can serve — a 2025 study by Army veterinarians found that nearly 84% of working dogs discharged between 2019 and 2021 left early due to neuromusculoskeletal disease, heat injuries, or fear and anxiety.\n\nIn its response to investigators, the Air Force said it has received nearly $170 million for structural improvements and staffing hires.\n\nPrevious watchdog reports have raised similar concerns about military dog welfare. More recently, military equine programs came under heavy scrutiny following a string of neglect-related deaths at Arlington National Cemetery's ceremonial equine unit. The Army shut that program down for two years while it underwent a significant overhaul and later moved to disband some equine units following a broader review.\n\nSubstandard living conditions have also plagued human troops, prompting years of scrutiny over mold, sewage failures, and deteriorating barracks, though the Pentagon has recently launched various initiatives to repair and replace some facilities.",

    "fullText": "Title: Head of global mergers and acquisitions\n\nTotal deal value: $153.4 billion\n\nHogan joined Wells Fargo in May 2023 after a 27-year career at Morgan Stanley, where he served as the star technology banker and co-head of global technology M&A. Since his arrival, he has been a primary architect of the bank's meteoric rise in the advisory rankings, helping Wells Fargo jump from 17th place in 2024 to 9th place in 2025, according to LSEG's league table for global M&A. This year marks Hogan's inaugural appearance as a rainmaker.\n\nTotal deal value: $149.2 billion\n\nAfter a decade as global head of M&A at Barclays, Posternack became the practice's chairman in 2024. Spending more time advising top clients has paid off, as Posternack is on the Rainmakers list for the second year running, adding nearly $200 billion in deal value in a career and ranking No. 2 overall this year. Posternack's decorated career spans nearly four decades. After getting his start at Dillon, Read & Co. in the 1980s, he joined Lehman Brothers in 1995; Barclays acquired Lehman in 2008 during the financial crisis.\n\nBaronoff has been chairman of global M&A at Merrill Lynch since 2000, overseeing the business. He originally joined Merrill Lynch in 1986 and has held various leadership roles, including head of retail and consumer M&A. His 2025 performance was marked by high-volume advisory roles in the transportation, consumer goods, and infrastructure sectors. This is Baronoff's second appearance on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTitle: Co-head of technology, media, and telecommunications investment banking\n\nTotal deal value: 122.8 billion\n\nBritton serves as the co-head of TMT investment banking at Goldman Sachs, where he has led the firm's coverage of the red-hot tech sector for over two decades.

A third-time rainmaker, Ventresca has advised on deals across a range of industries, from industrials to consumer retail.\n\nTotal deal value: $113.3 billion\n\nEffron co-founded Centerview Partners in 2006, establishing the firm as a prominent independent advisor to the world's elite corporations, offering big-bank power within the boutique banking landscape.\n\nOver a career spanning four decades, he has advised on complex strategic mergers and high-profile activism defenses across the media, consumer, and industrial sectors. His 2025 activity included leading roles in major media-sector consolidations and significant industrial-technology acquisitions. This marks Effron's fourth appearance on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTitle: Global head of advisory and M&A\n\nTotal deal value: $105.2 billion\n\nAiyengar has been at JPMorgan for decades and became the head of advisory and M&A in 2024. She's advised on more than a trillion dollars' worth of deals — from ones involving investment bank Morgan Stanley to ones involving luxury giant LVMH — and topped last year's Rainmakers list.\n\nIn addition to being involved in initiatives to mentor women at JPMorgan, Aiyengar is considered one of the financial services industry's most influential female leaders.\n\nTitle: Chairman of Global M&A, Corporate & Investment Banking\n\nTotal deal value: $97.1 billion\n\nDavid DeNunzio has been at Wells Fargo since 2016.

This is DeNunzio's first year on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTotal deal value: $94.7 billion\n\nMahmoodzadegan helped founder Ken Moelis launch Moelis & Company in 2007 and has been central to building the boutique into a heavyweight advisor on marquee deals. A former attorney, he moved into investment banking at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 1995 and joined UBS in 2001, rising to global head of media investment banking. The longtime co-president took the helm as CEO in October 2025, as Moelis shifted to executive chairman under a planned leadership transition. This is his first time on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTitle: Co-chairman, global mergers and acquisitions\n\nTotal transaction value: $87.5 billion\n\nIngrassia is a 40-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, currently serving as the co-chairman of global M&A.

Under Cardinale's leadership, RedBird has grown to manage about $14 billion in assets for major global institutions and family offices. This year marks Cardinale's first time on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTotal deal value: $81.8 billion\n\nKlein now runs his own boutique advisory firm, but he was once one of the most prominent big bank M&A chiefs. He joined Salomon Brothers in the 1980s, which became part of Citigroup in the late 1990s. At Citi, he held top roles in the investment bank and was viewed as a contender for CEO before his departure in 2008. He went on to launch M. Klein & Co., advising on high-profile transactions, and has also launched several special purpose acquisition companies, so-called \"blank check\" companies.\n\nThis is Klein's first year on the Rainmakers list, thanks to his advisory role on the year's most contentious megadeal:\n\nTitle: Co-head of US investment banking\n\nTotal deal value: $75.6 billion\n\nThis is Nataraj's third year on the Rainmakers list. The technology, media, and telecommunications banker joined Evercore in 2002 and, like Daniel Mendelow (No. 5), was promoted to lead US investment banking in 2020 and is a member of the firm's management committee.\n\nTitle: Head of financial institutions group M&A, Co-Head of media & communications M&A\n\nLoriferne has been at JPMorgan since 2006 and made the Rainmakers list for the first time last year, when he advised on deals involving BlackRock and Nippon Life.\n\nTitle: Partner and co-president of investment banking\n\nTotal value of deals: $71.2 billion\n\nCenterview's Tokat had one of the most active healthcare M&A years on Wall Street.

This year marks Tokat's second appearance.\n\nTotal value of deals: $68.5 billion\n\nIn 2025, Pruzan's performance was anchored by leading complex advisory projects across multiple industries simultaneously. Most notably, he led the year's largest consumer healthcare divestiture: the $49 billion acquisition of Kenvue, formerly Johnson & Johnson's consumer health division, by Kimberly-Clark. He has advised on more than $1 trillion worth of transactions over his career, Centerview says. This year marks Pruzan's first entry on the list.\n\nTitle: Co-head of M&A, Americas\n\nTotal deal value: $66.8 billion\n\nMahdavi joined Morgan Stanley in 2012, after previous stints at Deutsche Bank and Citi. She's spent her whole career working in mergers and acquisitions, and was promoted to co-lead Morgan Stanley's M&A business in the Americas at the beginning of last year. This year marks her second as a rainmaker.\n\nTitle: Chairman of investment banking\n\nTotal value of deals: $61 billion\n\nFrost's elevation to chairman of investment banking in January followed his leadership on several of the consumer sector's most significant recent transactions.

    "description": "What's changed for junior investment bankers since Centerview fired Kathryn Shiber in 2020? Recruiters say not much — and it may only get worse.",
    "fullText": "A lawsuit primed to expose the grind of junior banking is no longer going to trial this week, but the questions it poses about working life and hours are no less relevant ahead of a likely busy year.\n\nKathryn Shiber settled a lawsuit with boutique bank Centerview Partners on Saturday, two days before jury selection. She said the firm unlawfully fired her in 2020 after granting her accommodations for an underlying mood and anxiety disorder, including her request for eight hours of uninterrupted sleep each night. Court documents suggest that analysts on active deals at Centerview routinely worked between 60 and 120 hours a week.\n\nThe events of the suit happened years before Wall Street's promises to rein in burnout and protect young employees' health. Though top Centerview bankers will no longer have to take the witness stand, the case still reignites questions about the nature of work on Wall Street.\n\nNearly six years after Shiber's brief stint at Centerview, recruiters are predicting junior working conditions could intensify amid an M&A boom. They point to industry data suggesting juniors aren't logging significantly fewer hours than they did years ago — and an M&A boom that could intensify Wall Street working conditions.\n\nData from Odyssey Search Partners, a recruiting firm, found that junior investment bankers reported working just as much in 2025 as in 2022, the last time this survey was conducted. The firm surveyed more than 300 first- and second-year analysts last summer and found that they reported working 78 hours per week on average, the exact same figure as in the 2022 banking compensation report. Overall, 2025 was a busier year for dealmaking than 2022.\n\nJuniors at elite boutiques reported working an average of 82 hours in 2025, up 4% from their 2022 average. By comparison, analysts at bulge-bracket banks — the biggest firms, such as JPMorgan and Bank of America — reported working 81 hours on average, up 1%.\n\n\"It's the junior bankers at the elite boutiques that have become increasingly busy, as they tend to operate with leaner deal teams and so the workload can't be spread as broadly,\" Anthony Keizner, cofounder of Odyssey Search Partners, said in a statement. He added that the intensity can eventually make those analysts more desirable candidates to private equity firms, should they want to switch to the buy side.\n\nThe findings come despite criticisms over junior bankers' working conditions that sparked promises of change.\n\nConcern burst into public view during the pandemic, when record dealmaking and remote work stretched already punishing schedules even further. The conversation picked up again in 2024, when Leo Lukenas III, a 35-year-old investment banking associate at Bank of America who had just helped close a $2 billion acquisition, died.\n\nBank of America introduced a tool that year to better track junior bankers' weekly hours and flag when they exceed 80. In 2025, it elevated the chief resource officer role, which oversees juniors' workloads and career development, from a midlevel banker to a permanent position led by senior bankers.\n\nJPMorgan also introduced an 80-hour weekly guideline for banker workloads, with exceptions made for certain circumstances, including live deals. Juniors get one full weekend off every three months, protected holiday long weekends, and a mandated no-work period from 6 pm on Friday to 12 pm on Saturday, with exceptions.\n\nJake Schneider, an investment banking recruiter at Selby Jennings, said that, compared to the pre-pandemic days, junior bankers aren't being assigned as much busy work during slow periods. But he doesn't think invesment banking analysts are working less on live deals, like the kind Shiber was staffed on during the events at the heart of her case, dubbed Project Dragon.\n\nCourt documents in Shiber's case reference an email exchange between her and associate Timothy Ernst about the time she signed off. In the exchange, Ernst said that he and another employee \"shouldn't be up alone working.\" Associates and vice presidents still expect analysts to be logged on when higher-ups on the team are working, Schneider said.\n\n\"The expectation is, 'If I'm doing this, you're doing this,'\" he said.\n\nMany anticipate that 2026 will bring a boom in M&A activity — and, potentially, an associated spike in juniors' working hours.\n\n\"Given the increased deal flow the banks are reporting, we don't envisage that these working hours will see a decrease this year,\" Odyssey Search Partners' Keizner said.\n\nSchneider said that Selby Jennings has seen a flurry of business in recent months, especially in recruiting for junior roles, as banks try to get deal teams ready for the anticipated activity.\n\n\"The biggest thing we hear is from a lot of our clients, they don't want to be in a position to turn down business because they're understaffed,\" he said.\n\nThere's a chance the projected deal activity doesn't materialize, and analysts aren't staffed on the types of deals that keep them working into or through the early hours, Schneider added. But if 2026 shakes out as many expect, it doesn't seem likely that juniors will sneak in 8 hours a night.",

    "description": "After a major 2024 sale, hundreds of American convenience stores changed hands. The new owner is a powerful Mexican company you might not have heard of.",
    "fullText": "A transaction in October of 2024, between an American company and a Mexican one, resulted in a chain of U.S.-located gas station convenience stores being owned by the Mexican firm. The American company is Delek US Holdings, Inc., which sold its retail operations for $385 million. These retail operations consisted of 249 convenience stores that operated under the DK brand, located in New Mexico, Arkansas, and Texas. Delek is an energy company involved in petroleum and renewable fuels. As an oil products producer, it has a refining capacity of 302,000 barrels each day. It is also one of five owners of the 650-mile oil pipeline that goes from Wink to Webster in the Permian Basin in Texas, moving over one million barrels per day of crude oil and condensate to the Gulf Coast.\n\nThe Mexican company that bought the convenience stores at Delek's gas stations is called FEMSA. It's a huge conglomerate that includes the OXXO chain of 28,800 convenience stores located in Mexico, Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Colombia. FEMSA also owns the largest volume Coca-Cola products franchise bottler in the world. It has a total of over 392,000 employees located in 18 countries, including Europe, having purchased the food retail company Valora in 2022. FEMSA is also involved in many other business ventures, including retail drugstores and digital financial services.\n\nFEMSA has now rebranded many DK stores, which now operate as OXXO, a well-known brand near the Mexican border. By 2027, all of the stores in the El Paso area, which adjoins the border, will be rebranded as OXXO stores. Once the OXXO brand starts to expand beyond its initial footprint, it may build even larger stores, following the trend of U.S. gas stations turning into massive convenience stores.\n\nAs far as the supply of fuel products to the stores, FEMSA has continued to purchase them from Delek after the ownership change. Delek continues to operate hundreds of gas stations under both the DK and Alon brands, positioning itself as a locally sourced, high-quality fuel supplier with a lower carbon footprint. While this acquisition may have been FEMSA's first attempt to plant its flag in the U.S., the company has said it has plans to become a major player in the U.S. market. FEMSA is not the only foreign operator to land here; the Speedway gas station chain is owned by a Japanese company.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "France will summon U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner to protest comments by the Trump administration over the beating death of a far-right activist, the foreign affairs minister said.  Jean-Noel Barrot ...",
    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — France will summon U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner to protest comments by the Trump administration over the beating death of a far-right activist, the foreign affairs minister said.\n\nJean-Noel Barrot was reacting to a statement by the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau, which posted on X that “reports, corroborated by the French Minister of the Interior, that Quentin Deranque was killed by left-wing militants, should concern us all.”\n\nDeranque, a far-right activist, died of brain injuries last week from a beating in the French city of Lyon. He was attacked during a fight on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.\n\nHis killing highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year’s presidential vote. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm on Saturday as some 3,000 people joined a march in Lyon organized by far-right groups to pay tribute to Deranque.\n\n“We reject any instrumentalization of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,” Barrot said. “We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement.”\n\nThe State Department said in its post that “violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety. We will continue to monitor the situation and expect to see the perpetrators of violence brought to justice.”\n\nSeven people have been handed preliminary charges. The Lyon public prosecutor’s office requested that each of them be charged with intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy. Six of the accused were charged on all three counts. The seventh was charged with complicity in intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy.\n\nBarrot said he has other topics to discuss with Kushner, including U.S. decisions to impose sanctions on Thierry Breton, a former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, and Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court.\n\nBarrot said both are targeted by “unjustified and unjustifiable” sanctions.\n\nKushner was asked to attend a meeting at the foreign affairs ministry scheduled on Monday evening, according to diplomatic sources. He had already been summoned in August last year over his letter to Macron alleging the country did not do enough to combat antisemitism. France’s foreign officials met with a representative of the U.S. ambassador since the diplomat did not show up.",

    "description": "Snowstorms can become dangerous quickly, and because they're often treated as emergencies, the eventual melting of snow is rarely considered a risk.",
    "fullText": "In January, a historic snowstorm spanning several states blanketed millions of Americans in inches of powder and ice, bringing bitter, sustained low temperatures.\n\nAs that stubborn cold front began to wane, a second, subtler condition started \"stirring up hidden dangers,\" according to WILX.\n\nIn states affected by this bout of wintry extreme weather, persistent low temperatures ensured that snowdrifts quickly iced over.\n\nIn Michigan, weeks-old snow finally started melting — introducing a lesser-known risk.\n\nA 2017 study in the journal Environmental Pollution found that little was known about how snow reacts to pollutants and that snowpack absorbs a wide range of contaminants.\n\nWILX spoke with Dr. Dean McFarlane-Parrott, who explained that as the snow sat unmelting for weeks after the storm, \"vehicle exhaust, road salt, heavy metals,\" and other harmful carbon pollution slowly contaminated it.\n\nIn New York, WNYW reported similar concerns, adding that locals complained about dog feces buried in the city's snowdrifts. On Feb. 12, The New York Times reported on the city's melting snow, noting that it also posed a major pollution risk to the region's many waterways.\n\nAccording to WTOP, residents in the broader Washington, D.C., area were also facing rapidly melting snow and the health risks it posed.\n\nSnowstorms can become dangerous quickly, and because they're often treated as emergencies, the eventual melting of snow is rarely considered a risk.\n\nMelting snow doesn't just absorb pollution and release toxins as solids. As McFarlane-Parrott warned, the toxins released when snow melts create shockingly high levels of air pollution.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nLansing, Michigan, resident Zac Williams told WILX that he considered air quality ratings during wildfires, but not as an issue related to snow melting — however, the local air quality index was a risky 118 on Monday.\n\nMcFarlane-Parrott said that people often don't realize how dangerous poor air quality can be, particularly for vulnerable groups.\n\n\"If you can't carry oxygen well, then heart attacks go up, strokes go up,\" he said, per WILX. \"… Little kids who are developing their lung function, if they have asthma, it makes it worse as well. If the air quality index is high, you should rethink what you're doing.\"\n\nAs extreme weather becomes more frequent, awareness of critical climate issues, such as the subtle risks posed by melting snow, is more important than ever.\n\nThe New York Times suggested ways to mitigate the risks, including strategically placing green spaces to absorb runoff before it reaches rivers and waterways.\n\nResearchers are investigating alternatives to road salt to mitigate environmental damage, and the Times advised readers to \"shovel first\" and \"avoid the temptation to oversalt.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will stand before Congress on Tuesday to deliver the annual State of the Union address to a suddenly transformed nation.\n\nOne year back in office, Trump has emerged as a president defying conventional expectations. He has executed a head-spinning agenda, upending priorities at home, shattering alliances abroad and challenging the nation's foundational system of checks and balances. Two Americans were killed by federal agents while protesting the Trump administration's immigration raids and mass deportations.\n\nAs the lawmakers sit in the House chamber listening to Trump's agenda for the year ahead, the moment is an existential one for the Congress, which has essentially become sidelined by his expansive reach, the Republican president bypassing his slim GOP majority to amass enormous power for himself.\n\n“It’s crazy,\" said Nancy Henderson Korpi, a retiree in northern Minnesota who joined an Indivisible protest group and plans to watch the speech from home. “But what is disturbing more to me is that Congress has essentially just handed over their power.”\n\nShe said, “We could make some sound decisions and changes if Congress would do their job.”\n\nThe country is at a crossroads, celebrating its 250th anniversary while experiencing some of the most significant changes to its politics, policies and general mood in many Americans' lifetimes.\n\nThe president muscled his agenda through Congress when he needed to — often pressuring lawmakers with a phone call during cliffhanger votes — but more often avoided the messy give-and-take of the legislative process to power past his own party and the often unified Democratic opposition.\n\nTrump's signature legislative accomplishment so far is the GOP’s big tax cuts bill, with its new savings accounts for babies, no taxes on tips and other specialty deductions, and steep cuts to Medicaid and SNAP food aid. It also fueled more than $170 billion to Homeland Security for his immigration deportations.\n\nBut the GOP-led Congress has largely stood by as Trump dramatically seized power through hundreds of executive actions, many being challenged in court, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to impose his agenda.\n\n“Retrieving a lost power is no easy business in our constitutional order,” wrote Justice Neil Gorsuch in the Supreme Court's landmark rebuke of Trump's tariffs policy on Friday.\n\nGorsuch said that without the court stepping in on major questions, “Our system of separated powers and checks-and-balances threatens to give way to the continual and permanent accretion of power in the hands of one man.”\n\nFrom slashing the federal workforce to upending the childhood vaccine schedule to attacking Venezuela and capturing that country's president, Trump's reach appeared to know no bounds.\n\nHis administration launched investigations of would-be political foes, imposed his name on historic buildings, including the storied John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and perhaps most visibly has been rounding up people and converting warehouses into detention holding centers for deportations.\n\nAt almost every step of the way, there were moments when Congress could have intervened but did not.\n\nDemocrats, in the minority, often tried to push back, including by halting routine Homeland Security funds unless there are restraints on the immigration actions.\n\nBut Republicans believe the country elected the president and gave their party control of Congress to align with his agenda, according to one senior GOP leadership aide who insisted on anonymity to discuss the dynamic.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has said Trump will be the “most consequential” president of the modern era.\n\nDemocrats plan to either boycott the speech or sit in stony silence.\n\n“The state of the union is falling apart,” said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.\n\nThere have been times when Congress held its own against the White House, but they have been rare — as in the high-profile bipartisan push from Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Ca., to force the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, over the objections of Johnson and GOP leadership.\n\nThe flex of congressional power has more often come from a few renegade Republicans joining with most Democrats to put a check on the president, as when the House voted to block Trump's tariffs on Canada. The Senate advanced a war powers resolution to prevent military action in Venezuela without congressional approval, but backed off after Trump intervened.\n\nThose have been mostly symbolic votes, because Congress would not have the numbers to overcome any expected Trump veto.\n\nMore often, the Congress has accommodated Trump, by rolling back already approved bipartisan funding for USAID foreign aid or public broadcasting or failing to stop the U.S. military strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats that killed two survivors in the Caribbean. When Trump issued a Day One pardon of some 1,500 people charged in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, the Republicans in Congress did not object.\n\nAnd as Trump's Department of Government Efficiency with billionaire Elon Musk started firing federal workers, GOP lawmakers signaled approval by forming their own DOGE caucus on Capitol Hill.\n\n“The central question for us is does the public understand what's at stake” said Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization focused on government management and democracy. “We are in the midst of the most significant transformation of our government and our public servants in our history as a country.”\n\nHe said some 300,000 federal employees were fired or moved on, while 100,000 new hires or rehires have largely gone to Homeland Security.\n\nIn courtrooms across the country, cases are being filed against the administration at record levels, as Congress was “asleep at the wheel,” said Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, which has filed more than 150 cases against the administration, part of the largest legal effort against an executive branch in U.S. history.\n\nBut the judicial system has been under strain, and the White House has not always abided by court rulings. GOP lawmakers have joined Trump's criticism of the courts, displaying outside their offices posters of judges they want to impeach.\n\nA next big test will be over a proof-of-citizenship voting bill that Trump wants ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe House has passed the SAVE America Act, which would require birth certificates or passports to register to vote in federal elections and a photo ID at the polls. Supporters say it’s needed to crack down on fraud, while critics argue it will shut millions of Americans out of voting because they don’t have citizenship documents readily available.\n\nThe Senate has a majority to pass the measure but not the necessary 60 votes to overcome an expected Democratic-led filibuster.\n\nTrump has vowed executive actions if Congress fails to approve legislation.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.",

    "fullText": "In the wake of the Mexican army’s assassination of Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, also known as “El Mencho,” the notorious leader of Mexico’s most powerful drug cartel, there were reports of widespread violence in the country, while U.S. citizens in portions of the country were urged to shelter in place amid flight cancellations.\n\nThe surprise operation against the drug kingpin and head of Jalisco New Generation Cartel unfolded Sunday morning in Tapalpa, a city about two hours southwest of Guadalajara, Jalisco’s capital.\n\nDuring the operation, troops came under fire and killed four people at the location. Three more people, including Oseguera Cervantes, were wounded and later died, according to a statement from the U.S. Defense Department. Two others were arrested and armored vehicles, rocket launchers and other arms were seized.\n\nThree members of the armed forces were wounded and received medical treatment, while one member of the country’s National Guard was killed. Another six other National Guardsmen reportedly died in an operation near Guadalajara, along with an agent from Jalisco’s state prosecutor’s office.\n\nA prison guard was also killed when inmates in a Puerto Vallarta prison rioted after reports of the deadly operation.\n\nEl Mencho’s assassination set off several hours of roadblocks with burning vehicles, tactics commonly used by the cartels to block military operations. Videos circulating on social media showed smoke billowing over the tourist city of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco, and people sprinting through the airport of the state’s capital in panic.\n\nOfficials with the U.S. Embassy in Mexico said on X that the operation was executed by Mexican special forces “within the framework of bilateral cooperation, with U.S. authorities providing complementary intelligence.”\n\nThe U.S. State Department warned U.S. citizens in Jalisco, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, Guerrero and Nuevo Leon states to remain in safe places due to the ongoing security operations. Canada’s embassy in Mexico warned its citizens in Puerto Vallarta to shelter in place and generally to keep a low profile in Jalisco.\n\nJalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus told residents to stay at home and suspended public transportation.\n\nU.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau called El Mencho one of the bloodiest and most ruthless drug kingpins in cartel history in a statement.\n\n“This is a great development for Mexico, the US, Latin America, and the world,” he added. “I’m watching the scenes of violence from Mexico with great sadness and concern. It’s not surprising that the bad guys are responding with terror. But we must never lose our nerve.”\n\nThe Jalisco cartel has been one of the most aggressive cartels in its attacks on the military — including on helicopters — and is a pioneer in launching explosives from drones and installing mines. In 2020, it carried out a spectacular assassination attempt with grenades and high-powered rifles in the heart of Mexico City against the then head of the capital’s police force and now federal security secretary.\n\nVIDEO: Los Angeles motorist accused of running red light, causing violent crash\n\nThe DEA considers the cartel to be as powerful as the Sinaloa cartel, one of Mexico’s most infamous criminal groups, with a presence in all 50 U.S. states. It is one of the main suppliers of cocaine to the U.S. market and, like the Sinaloa cartel, earns billions from the production of fentanyl and methamphetamines. Sinaloa, however, has been weakened by infighting after the loss of its leaders Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, both in U.S. custody.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, like many of her predecessors, have argued that taking out cartel leaders only triggers continued violence as cartels fracture and fight for power.\n\nSheinbaum said in a statement on X that the army had coordinated with the governments of all Mexican states and urged people to “remain informed and calm,” while recognizing the Mexican military’s operation.\n\n“We work every day for peace, security and justice, and the well-being of Mexico,” she said.\n\nLocally, Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn acknowledged those in the county with family in Mexico.\n\n“I know many here in LA County with loved ones in Mexico—especially in Jalisco and Michoacán—are closely following the events in Mexico today with concern and with sadness,” she said on X. “I am keeping them in my thoughts and praying for peace.”\n\nSupervisor Katrina Foley, Vice Chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors said she has friends sheltering in place in Puerto Vallarta and shared Rep. Dave Min’s post about what stranded U.S. travelers should do.\n\nSeveral airlines, including Delta, United, Alaska and Air Canada urged either temporarily cancelled flights into Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara or urged passengers to check on their flights before traveling to the airport.",

    "description": "Another round of genetic tests is raising questions about imports of farm-raised shrimp being passed off as local in area restaurants",
    "fullText": "A second round of genetic testing of shrimp served at more than 20 Charleston restaurants has revealed that most continue to sell farm-raised imports, with some passing off the food as wild and locally caught.\n\nThe Charleston findings are part of a broader multi-state investigation into shrimp mislabeling and substitution fraud by SeaD Consulting at the behest of the Southern Shrimp Alliance (SSA), a not-for-profit coalition of shrimping businesses in eight southern coastal states, including South Carolina.\n\nThe latest testing showed just a slight improvement from an initial round a year ago, at the same Charleston restaurants, that found widespread sales of foreign shrimp and instances of false advertising, according to SeaD Consulting.\n\nThe struggling shrimping industry has long complained that many restaurants aren’t serving local shrimp in South Carolina, even though the Palmetto State boasts shrimp as its No. 1 seafood. The alleged shrimp fraud, the industry says, is occurring at a time when domestic markets are being overrun by foreign imports of farm-raised shrimp.\n\nDave Williams, the founder of SeaD and a commercial fishery scientist, said in a news release that the economic stakes of the labeling issue are high because of the importance of local fisheries to coastal communities.\n\n“Seventy percent of seafood expenditures in the United States are in restaurants, so having restaurants tell the truth about what they are serving is paramount,” Williams said. “Consumers should be empowered to decide whether they want to eat and support the highly regulated and inspected American wild-caught fisheries versus very low-inspection-rate imported shrimp that are likely from ponds in Indonesia, Vietnam, or India.”\n\nThat’s why the U.S. shrimping industry is backing undercover investigations of the origin of seafood being sold across the eight states. Threatened tariffs by the Trump administration have recently cast a spotlight on the unfair trade practices shrimpers say they are facing.\n\nLast year, shrimp served in 44 restaurants were randomly selected in the Charleston area for testing. The results showed 4 of the 44, or 9%, were serving wild shrimp caught in American waters with the rest serving farm-raised imports. Of the 40 restaurants serving imports, only 15 verbally acknowledged using imported shrimp, the SeaD consulting said.\n\nThis year, on Feb. 10-11, 22 of the original 44 restaurants were tested again with the results showing 5 of the 22 restaurants, or 23%, were serving wild-caught shrimp. The 17 restaurants serving farm-raised imported shrimp implied it was U.S. wild caught, the group said.\n\nThree restaurants found to be serving American shrimp also were serving local fare in the first round of testing: Acme Lowcountry Kitchen, Isle of Palms; Grace & Grit, Mt Pleasant, and Rappahannock Oyster Bar, Charleston.\n\nTwo restaurants, Amen Street Fish & Raw Bar in Charleston and Mt. Pleasant Seafood, were serving American shrimp after selling imports at the time of the original tests.\n\nResults from Myrtle Beach tests will be announced next week, SeaD Consulting said.\n\nWhether tests are planned in Beaufort County isn’t known. To ensure scientific validity, SeaD Consulting and SSA never announces the markets that will be tested in advance, said Deborah Long, an SSA spokesperson.\n\nOfficials with the alliance and the South Carolina Shrimpers Association said the testing demonstrates a need for better labeling laws.\n\nFive of the eight shrimping states have passed labeling or disclosure laws, said Blake Price, director of the Southern Shrimp Alliance.\n\n“In light of widespread false advertising of shrimp, we hope the Carolinas and Florida will follow suit,” Price said.\n\nBryan Jones, vice president of the South Carolina Shrimpers Association, said the group is working on labeling legislation in South Carolina. “People deserve to know what is in their shrimp and grits,” he said.\n\nLast year, Jones’ organization sued 40 Charleston-area restaurants in federal court in Charleston for shrimp fraud. The lawsuit accused the restaurants of breaking state and federal laws for advertising South Carolina seafood but serving foreign shrimp.\n\nCraig Reaves, who owns Sea Eagle Market in Beaufort, a retail seafood business with shrimp boats based at Village Creek on St. Helena Island, has previously described imports as “farm-raised crap.”\n\n“It’s unbelievable people would come from all over the country expecting to get local seafood and it be represented as such and then be served pond-raised garbage from India,” Reaves says.",

    "fullText": "Head coach Andy Farrell says the potential in his current Ireland squad is \"huge\" after Saturday's historic Six Nations win over England at Allianz Stadium.\n\nIreland scored five tries in a record 42-21 away win against their oldest rivals which reignited their title ambitions and offered an emphatic response to recent criticism.\n\nAfter November defeats by New Zealand and South Africa, Ireland opened the Six Nations with a humbling 36-14 loss to France, but after beating Italy in Dublin, they tore through England with a statement performance.\n\n\"I think the strength of any team should be stronger than any individual's belief of what they think they can get to,\" said Farrell.\n\n\"That's what a proper team is. So therefore, the potential in the squad is huge. I believe that.\n\n\"And you guys can say it's ageing, or we're missing people and they're injured and all that type of stuff, but that doesn't matter neither as long as we're pushing forward and doing ourselves proud.\"\n\n'Ireland show they're far from done with record-breaking win'\n\n'Special day' - Farrell revels in record Irish win\n\nThe Ireland Rugby Social - Post-match reaction\n\nWhen it was put to Farrell that he endured some tough days over the past year before the England game, he used the CVs of Ireland legends Brian O'Driscoll, Johnny Sexton and Paul O'Connell as a reminder of why expectations should be managed.\n\n\"I was thinking this morning, probably the three most respected players that I know in Irish rugby, probably Johnny Sexton, Drico or Paulie...I think Drico played for 15 years and won two (Six Nations titles). I think Paulie played for 14 years and won three. Johnny played for 13 years in this competition and won four.\n\n\"So have a look at all the ones that they've not won. It's because the group is always transitioning and learning.\n\n\"And, honestly, that's why genuinely I didn't care whether we won or lost, whether we just grew as a group. Because we know what we're trying to get to as a group.\n\n\"And it doesn't always translate, because people have to feel the ups and downs of international rugby to learn and grow from it, so that's the best part of it today.\"\n\nFive talking points from round three of Six Nations\n\nFarrell was also pleased with how his more seasoned Test players stepped up after questions over their form as they supplemented headline-stealing displays from Stuart McCloskey and Rob Baloucoune.\n\n\"Caelan [Doris] was back to his best, Joe McCarthy was outstanding,\" observed Farrell, who also praised player of the match Jamison Gibson-Park.\n\n\"Josh [van der Flier] was immense in that first half, wasn't he? You know, with his line running and stuff like that.\n\n\"They know they've a responsibility. We said before the game, big-game players turn up and make big-team performances happen.\n\n\"They set great examples, but for the lads that I just mentioned, for Rob Baloucoune to come here and do that, you know you're on for a good day when he's got a poach, a turnover ball...just his belief to take people on, and for Stu to dominate at this type of level, it was a joy to see.\"\n\nWith McCloskey and Baloucoune establishing themselves in the Test arena, experienced players recapturing their form and the likes of Mack Hansen, Hugo Keenan and Andrew Porter still to return from injury, Farrell's squad suddenly seems in good shape 18 months out from the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia.\n\n\"That's the point. That's the best part of it,\" he said.\n\n\"We know that and we have to take a bit of stick along the way. I suppose a win like this gets people a little bit back on board.\n\n\"As long as we know where we're going.\"\n\nIreland host winless Wales on 6 March (20:10 GMT) before finishing the campaign against fellow Triple Crown chasers Scotland in Dublin on 14 March (14:10).",

    "description": "Charlie O'Leary was the Republic of Ireland kitman, but his influence extends to football across the island.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to football on the island of Ireland, there isn't much 102-year-old Charlie O'Leary has not seen or done.\n\nFrom serving as the Republic of Ireland's kitman at two World Cups and a European Championship, to refereeing behind the Iron Curtain, the Dubliner has an almost legendary status.\n\nWhat is not as well known is his involvement in founding the \"street leagues\", which helped hone the skills of some of the best players in the history of both the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nNow his story is the focus of a new film which will premiere at the Dublin International Film Festival on Tuesday.\n\nAs the Republic's kitman, O'Leary was part of the national team setup during its golden era, when Ireland defeated England in Stuttgart at Euro '88 and famously stunned Italy in New York at World Cup '94.\n\nBut his influence stretches to some other iconic moments thanks to the street leagues, which he founded in East Wall in Dublin in 1945.\n\nCharlie suggested to the local priest the idea of using the parish church's juvenile sodality - a religious group for young parishioners - as the basis for a football league.\n\nThe sodality was organised on the basis of the local streets - and so the street leagues were born.\n\n\"Schoolboy football hadn't been organised and there was nowhere for a young boy around 14 if he wanted to play football,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"At least this gave those kids at that age a chance of representing those roads in football and getting them interested.\n\n\"So we formed the leagues and they really cottoned on.\"\n\nSo much so that by the 1950s the leagues had spread across Dublin and then to cities across the island, including Belfast.\n\nThe leagues first took root in east Belfast, where people associated with the Harland and Wolff shipyard were among the first to compete.\n\nThey began to feature young men who would go on to achieve sporting greatness.\n\nIn the Republic they included Tony Dunne, who won the European Cup with Manchester United in 1968, Liam Brady, winner of the FA Cup with Arsenal and two Serie A titles with Juventus, and Johnny Giles, part of the great Leeds United side of the 1960s and 70s.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, at least three of the 1958 World Cup squad spent time in the street leagues - Harry Gregg, Bertie Peacock and Jimmy McIlroy.\n\nIn later years Manchester United's Sammy McIlroy - who went on to manage Northern Ireland - and Jimmy Nicholl, current Northern Ireland assistant manager, took part in the leagues.\n\nThere was an early sign of things to come in 1957 when Republic of Ireland B took on Romania B in Dublin.\n\n\"There was Liam Tuohy of Newcastle, Noel Payton of Leeds and Dickie Whittaker of Chelsea, all three of them standing together, shoulder to shoulder, for the national anthem,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"Each of those had played, you could pull a curtain over where they lived, the houses were that close.\n\n\"On one day they represented Ireland and all played in the street leagues.\"\n\nCharlie was born just a few months before the Irish Free State - as it was then known - played its first international football match.\n\nThe story of his life - which has therefore spanned the entire existence of his country's national team - will be shown in The Charlie O'Leary Story - From Johnny Cullen's Hill to the Olympic Stadium Rome.\n\nFergus Dowd, who produced the film along with Joe Lee, said the street leagues gave opportunities to young people who would not otherwise have had them.\n\n\"One of the players said to Charlie it was like playing for your country, you played for your street but you were amongst friends and it was really community based,\" he said.\n\n\"I think in a sense we've really sort of lost that innocence - these kids had a jersey on, they were representing the road and their mothers and fathers were watching, so it was a massive community event.\n\n\"Nowadays a lot of the clubs here have their own academies whereas this grew very much organically and it was down to Charlie's idea of making it happen.\"\n\nThe leagues persisted into the 1970s, giving an opportunity to the man who delivered Northern Ireland's greatest moment on the world stage, Gerry Armstrong.\n\nA few years after his iconic goal sealed a 1-0 victory against hosts Spain in the 1982 World Cup, it was the turn of the Republic of Ireland to revel in a shock victory.\n\nThey defeated England 1-0 in Euro '88 and Charlie was watching from the dugout, having been appointed kitman two years earlier.\n\n\"I saw grown men cry,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"There was a man who used to live next door to me and he had gone with his son and he came over to me and he was sobbing.\n\n\"He said 'Charlie, I can boast, I was here when we beat England'.\"\n\nSix years later there was another iconic win, this time against Italy at the World Cup and again, Charlie was there.\n\nThose great victories were masterminded by Jack Charlton, who Charlie said was the best man manager he ever worked under.\n\nHe recalled one occasion when the boss quizzed him after some players were involved in a \"drinking session\" the night before which had ended in a \"rumpus\".\n\n\"He said 'I'm asking you a simple question, what happened last night?',\" Charlie said.\n\n\"I said 'boss hang on a second, if I tell you then you're involved and you've got problems to resolve.\n\n\"I tell you what I'll do, if I say to you everything is resolved, then it's all resolved.\n\n\"So Jack said, 'that's all I want to know, we'll leave it at that,'\n\n\"I got away with that gag every time there was a problem.\"\n\nFrom being part of the backroom team for those famous victories to refereeing in East Germany during the Cold War - \"a bit frightening\" - Charlie has plenty of footballing highlights to pick from.\n\nSo what is his favourite moment?\n\n\"I have to say, I'm a Roman Catholic, when we went to Italy [for the 1990 World Cup] we were brought to see the Pope,\" he said.\n\n\"I was frozen, I couldn't speak.\n\n\"People say, I said this and I said that, I don't remember saying that.\n\n\"But that to me was the biggest thrill I ever got in my life.\"",

    "fullText": "Olympic champion Keely Hodgkinson says she feels \"closer than ever\" to breaking the women's 800m outdoor record - the longest-standing world record in athletics.\n\nJarmila Kratochvilova set the record of one minute 53.28 seconds in Munich in July 1983.\n\nBut Britain's Hodgkinson, who broke the event's indoor world record on Thursday, believes she can surpass Kratochvilova and achieve something that will \"cement her place as the greatest of all time\".\n\n\"It's not an easy feat and there's a reason it has stood for so long, \" Hodgkinson told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I think this is the closest I've felt near it. I do really believe that we can break it, but a lot of things have got to come together.\"\n\nHodgkinson's stunning indoor run in France saw her cross the line in 1:54.87 to smash a world record which had stood since 3 March 2002 - the day the Briton was born.\n\nHer coach, Jenny Meadows, told BBC Sport the athlete's time in Lievin could have been up to one second faster - and Hodgkinson is aiming higher still.\n\n\"I've known for weeks I'm capable of breaking it. It's just a matter of getting out on the day,\" she said.\n\n\"We can push it even further in the future, as long as I stay healthy and I think this is hopefully just the beginning.\"\n\nVictory came after a difficult year for the 23-year-old, who stormed to Olympic gold at the Paris Games in 2024.\n\nHodgkinson was left unable to train after tearing her hamstring just a few months after that triumph and has been building her way back ever since.\n\n\"After winning the Olympics, it really wasn't what I thought was going to happen,\" she said.\n\n\"It makes you stop and strip back everything and think, why is this happening? What are the problems?\n\n\"But, we got through it, I became a stronger person, and I think this is now the reward of all of that happening.\"\n\nHow Hodgkinson broke a 23-year-old world record\n\nHodgkinson smashes women's indoor 800m world record\n\nHodgkinson admits a lot of things need to come together for her to break Kratochvilova's record but her recent performances have convinced others in the sport it's only a matter of time.\n\nWorld Athletics president Lord Coe told the Sunday Times he believes Hodgkinson will achieve the feat this year.\n\nThere have been claims that Kratochvilova's performance was assisted by the systematic doping regime that existed in her country at the time - something she has strenuously denied., external\n\nHowever, her time remains more than a second quicker than Hodgkinson's current personal best of 1:54.61 - a national record she set in London in 2024.\n\n\"We're on the right path and we've seen evidence in training that we think that it's possible,\" Hodgkinson said.\n\n\"I think the reason this year has gone so well for me is because I've had my healthiest winter training I've had in years.\"\n\nWhile the race Hodgkinson and her team may target for any record attempt may remain a mystery, Hodgkinson says she is always keen to put in a big performance in London.\n\n\"My coach did say two years ago that 2026 will be a good year,\" she said.\n\n\"London is very special to me. I would love nothing more than to do something like that in front of a home crowd.\"\n\nThe last 12 months have been a rollercoaster of emotions for Hodgkinson.\n\nAfter numerous injury setbacks, Hodgkinson took world 800m bronze in September, with training partner Georgia Hunter Bell securing silver.\n\nDespite the ups and downs, Hodgkinson still describes 2025 as \"my best year\".\n\n\"I still had a good time - my entire personality is not my job,\" she said.\n\n\"There's so much more outside of life than just what I have going in my career.\"\n\nDuring her rehabilitation, Hodgkinson's team mates dubbed her 'Keely 2.0' - a nod to her reinvention and ability to come back stronger.\n\nCoach Trevor Painter bought her a giant Himalayan salt lamp to, as she says, \"send happy vibes\".\n\n\"He says my moods were unpredictable last year\" she joked.\n\n\"It's meant to calm the energy in the atmosphere.\n\n\"It weighs about forty kilograms, so imagine me trying to carry it up the stairs, but I actually think it worked!\"\n\nFirst up, though, will be March's World Athletics Indoor Championships in Poland, where Hodgkinson will be the firm favourite for gold.\n\nOutdoors, she will have an exciting new name next to her on the start line.\n\nIn October, two-time 400m hurdles world champion Femke Bol announced she will step up to compete in the 800m.\n\nEarlier this month, the Dutch superstar won her debut race in Metz, France, setting a national record of 1:59.07 in the process.\n\n\"'Me and Femke are really good friends,\" Hodgkinson said.\n\n\"We've grown up a little bit together over the years. Femke is a very talented woman, but I also know what it takes to run the 800m at these times.\n\n\"Just give her some time [and] she'll get there.\"\n\nWhen asked if she would consider it a potential rivalry, Hodgkinson said: \"I wouldn't call it a rivalry right now, but she's good, and she'll get where she needs to be when she's ready.\"",

    "fullText": "Defending T20 World Cup champions India need \"two big performances\" to reach the semi-finals after Sunday's huge defeat to South Africa, said their assistant coach.\n\nIndia came into the T20 World Cup as hot favourites on home soil but were thrashed by 76 runs in the Super Eights as 80,000 fans at the massive Narendra Modi stadium were stunned into silence.\n\nIn their first chase of the tournament, India's batting came up woefully short in the face of some disciplined South Africa bowling.\n\nIndia collapsed to 111 all out in 18.5 overs in response to South Africa's 187-7 as their 12-match win streak in the T20 World Cup came to a crashing end.\n\nThe magnitude of the defeat has left India with a desperate net run-rate of -3.8 and likely needing to win their last two Super Eight matches convincingly to make it to the semi-finals.\n\nAnything less and India will need to rely on a combination of other results going their way.\n\n\"Very disappointed in the performance,\" said Ryan ten Doeschate.\n\n\"When you set out to win a World Cup, don't expect someone to come and deliver it to you halfway through,\" the assistant coach added.\n\n\"We've messed up on a grand scale and now the onus is on this group of guys to turn it around and put in two solid performances.\"\n\nIndia are grouped with South Africa, the West Indies and Zimbabwe in Super Eights, with the top two advancing to the semi-finals.\n\nThe West Indies face Zimbabwe on Monday night in Mumbai in their Super Eights opener.\n\nIndia next face giant-killers Zimbabwe, who have already beaten Australia and Sri Lanka, on Thursday in Chennai.\n\nSouth Africa play the West Indies the same day in Ahmedabad where Aiden Markram's side could put one foot firmly in the semi-finals with another win.\n\n\"Obviously with the way the group goes, you need at least four points to get through now, and it's going to need two big performances and a big bounce back from everyone,\" said Ten Doeschate.\n\nIndia's fragile batting was exposed against an in-form bowling attack led by left-arm quick Marco Jansen, who returned figures of 4-22 from 3.5 overs. Keshav Maharaj took 3-24 with his left-arm spin.\n\nIndia's media tore into the team on Monday morning.\n\n\"The night the cloak came off,\" blazed a headline in the Indian Express newspaper.\n\n\"Sloppy India reach point of no return,\" said the Hindustan Times.\n\nIndia's ultra-aggressive left-handed opening pair have failed to fire, leaving a shaky middle order to pick up the pieces.\n\nIshan Kishan was out without scoring to Markram on Sunday, while the world's top- ranked T20 batter Abhishek Sharma fell to Jansen for 15, his only runs of the tournament so far after three ducks.\n\n\"It's certainly not panic stations,\" said Ten Doeschate, who hinted there could be discussions about India's batting line-up.\n\n\"If those guys (Ahbishek and Ishan) bat for six overs, the score is going to be 70-plus,\" said Ten Doeschate.\n\n\"So can we get them to temper the way they're playing and be a little bit smarter?\n\n\"Or do we just let them go on the way they are?\n\n\"Or do we bring in a right-hander at the top and make a change somewhere in the middle?\"\n\nCaptain Suryakumar Yadav agreed India need to use their brains in the first six-over power play when only two fielders are allowed on the boundary.\n\n\"Chasing 180-185, you can't win the game in the power play, but you might lose it,\" he said after his side stumbled to 31-3 after six overs, which became 43-4 a few balls later and then 51-5.\n\n\"We lost too many wickets in the power play.\"\n\nThe 2024 champions also have the weight of history against them. No team has ever retained the T20 World Cup and no side have ever won the trophy on home soil.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump responded publicly after Team USA secured a gold medal in men’s hockey at the 2026 Winter Olympics. Following the team’s overtime victory over Canada in Milan, the president shared a message congratulating the players and later spoke with them directly as celebrations continued.\n\nDonald Trump congratulated the United States men’s hockey team after its gold medal victory at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, according to the Detroit Free Press. Coach Mike Sullivan said, “The players just had the President on, I don’t know what it was, what do you call it, FaceTime, whatever, in the locker room. He just spoke to the group, expressing how proud he was of the group and congratulating everybody on the win.” Captain Auston Matthews said, “He called and just congratulated us.”\n\nThe United States defeated Canada 2-1 in overtime to secure the gold medal. Sullivan said the game “was an inspiration to our country. I can’t tell you how many texts I’ve received over the last day or so about watch parties at 8 o’clock in the morning. I think from a viewership standpoint, the United States, there were a lot of people paying attention, the President included.” The team was scheduled to return to NHL duties on February 23, and its flight was diverted from New York’s JFK airport to Miami because of a storm in the northeast.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social: “Congratulations to our great U.S.A. Ice Hockey team. THEY WON THE GOLD. WOW!.” He added, “LOTS OF WINNING!!! President DONALD J. TRUMP.” The White House also shared a social media image depicting a bald eagle and a goose following the victory.\n\nThe post followed prior political tensions between the United States and Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said at the World Economic Forum, “Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.” After the Olympics, Carney wrote, “You’re coming home with 21 hard-fought Olympic medals.”\n\nOriginally reported by Vritti Johar on Mandatory.com.\n\nThe post Donald Trump Has a Message for Team USA Hockey appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "description": "Sports Illustrated's Connor Orr predicts the Chargers will sign a veteran guard in free agency.",
    "fullText": "The Chargers will most likely address the interior part of the offensive line, especially the guard spots, with Bradley Bozeman and Mekhi Becton being potential cut candidates.\n\nShould they go the free agency route, Sports Illustrated's Connor Orr believes the Bolts will sign veteran Joel Bitonio, whom he tabbed in his bold predictions for all 32 teams in the NFL.\n\nJim Harbaugh is not going to put Justin Herbert at risk again like he was forced to last season. Bitonio can spearhead the offensive line’s transition to a Mike McDaniel system—Bitonio was drafted during McDaniel’s season as the Browns’ receivers coach—and could be a critical, dependable asset amid constant injury woes.\n\nBitonio is not getting any younger, set to be 35 this season and is considering retirement, but he is durable and is still moving as if he were ten years younger.\n\nA stalwart presence along the Browns' offensive line for the past decade, Bitonio finished the 2025 season ranked as PFF's 8th-best pass-blocking guard. He has also ranked in the 91st percentile in PFF run-blocking grade over the past three seasons.\n\nOffensive coordinator Mike McDaniel was on the Browns' staff as the wide receiver coach in 2014, Bitonio's first season in Cleveland, so the familiarity is there. Plus, Bitonio is a great fit in McDaniel's zone scheme.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chargers Wire: NFL analyst's 'bold prediction' sees Chargers bolstering guard spot",

    "description": "Roker Report and our writers stand firmly behind Mundle in the ongoing battle against racism — stay strong, Romaine!",
    "fullText": "Mundle deserves our full support.\n\nWhether it’s happening inside the stadium or online, these idiots must feel the full force of the club and the community, and to be shown that they’re not welcome here. If it happens inside the stadium, I hope every decent fan knows not to look away, and instead to report it.\n\nI’ve already seen some debate about whether online comments are necessarily from Sunderland fans or not — to me, that’s irrelevant. It isn’t acceptable wherever it’s from, and as a fanbase, we have to stand firm and say loudly and clearly that we’re united against racism.\n\nRomaine, we stand with you completely, and these cretins don’t represent us.\n\nThis news is frankly disgusting. I know that the individuals that did this are in the minority of the fan base, but the idea that any person could call themselves a Sunderland fan and then proceed to treat a player like this is sickening.\n\nMundle is both a brilliant footballer and a brilliant person — two things that have nothing to do with his race.\n\nOur squad is made up of players from different backgrounds, races and religions, and this one of the beauties of sport and football: inclusion. People coming from all over to share in moments of joy. The idea that anyone — a player or a spectator — could come to a Sunderland match and be mistreated or discriminated against is horrific.\n\nI sincerely hope that neither Mundle nor anyone else who could be affected by these racist comments will lose faith in the club.\n\nAnd equally, I hope the club does everything in their power to stamp it out and ensure that these individuals never see the inside of the Stadium of Light again.\n\nThere’s no place in life for racism, and sport is no different.\n\nSunderland AFC is a club built on community values, respect and most importantly, a family spirit. Players from all walks of life come together, put on the shirt and represent our region with pride, passion and most importantly, with respect.\n\nWe stand with Mundle and anyone found reducing our players down to racial remarks doesn’t belong anywhere near the Sunderland community.\n\nNo room for racism. Not now, not ever.\n\nThe meltdown by some fans after a defeat is bad enough.\n\nThe hordes leaving early yet again astonishes me and the number of fickle fans our club has is quite depressing. But the news that Mundle has been racially abused almost defies belief or suitable words.\n\nEvery club has a percentage of dimwits but to realise we are amongst them is quite frankly sickening.\n\nThey hide behind social media. They don’t have enough respectable or honourable qualities to be a decent human being. I hope they’re caught and identified and I hope Romaine gets the support he deserves from the club, but also that he realises that if it’s from Sunderland fans, it’s a tiny fraction of our fanbase and that the love and support of the vast majority comes to the fore.\n\nMundle is a talent with the potential to be an excellent player.\n\nI hope he realises this, and that we’re all behind him. The idiots who write such things will unfortunately not have the intelligence to read feedback from sites such as Roker Report. More’s the pity.\n\nIt’s a complete tragedy that we’re seeing this vile abuse in 2026.\n\nThere’s no place for racism in any shape or form, and whatever we feel about the performances of our players, the colour of their skin or race is immaterial.\n\nThose who have posted this vile content need to be banned for life.\n\nRomaine, every Sunderland fan is 100% behind you, and stands with you. Please don’t let the 0.0001% detract from the fact you’re part of this huge Mackem family.\n\nWhen someone is singled out for unfair criticism, it can regrettably lead to ridiculous situations like this, where the uneducated and ignorant are able to hide behind anonymous accounts and send racist abuse to black players.\n\nWhilst I hope that none of the messages are from Sunderland fans directly, that isn’t entirely relevant. The reality is that we shouldn’t be talking about incidents like these occurring in 2026.\n\nWhilst initiatives like “Show Racism the Red Card” do great work in schools, we need social media platforms to do more against anonymous accounts, where hate can be spread without fear of consequences.\n\nAs fans of football, we need to do more to stamp out racism and make a strong stand.\n\nWhether it be a misinformed comment in the stands or an incident like this, we need to be better. Regardless of who sent the messages, I hope they’re identified quickly and that there’s police involvement. A stadium ban isn’t going to impact a sad bastard who doesn’t go to games but feels like they can send abuse online.\n\nFor Mundle, I’m certain that he’ll get the best support from the club and fellow teammates. I hope from our perspective inside the stadium that we see this as a wakeup call —doing more to support our players and perhaps thinking a bit more before saying something.\n\nMundle deserves our full and unwavering support, and I hope we showcase this in the upcoming games.",

    "description": "It was a bad day at the office for the Lads as Fulham cashed in on a sloppy display. What did our writers make of it?",
    "fullText": "Sat in the south east corner, I was celebrating before he shot but before I knew it, I was caught inadvertently celebrating a goal kick to Fulham.\n\nUntil I see a replay, it honestly did look harder to do what he did than score.\n\nI was baffled by his introduction over Chemsdine Talbi when Jocelin Ta Bi went off.\n\nWith Reinildo, Ta Bi, Nordi Mukiele, Dennis Cirkin and possibly Brian Brobbey all out of action, we’re counting the wounded.\n\nIt’s a big concern as we’re struggling to create from out wide as we’ve done throughout the season. What do we fall back on now?\n\nI’ve felt that during the last seven games, we’ve been found out.\n\nYes, we enjoyed good fortune against Crystal Palace and Burnley, but the recycled balls to the wings or hoping Enzo Le Fée picks the pass of his dreams to a runner in behind have been scuppered.\n\nRégis Le Bris’ usual ability to solve a problem has been well and truly nullified. Is it time to change from the off? I think so.\n\nLe Fée is often the one player that doesn’t deserve any criticism that might be aimed at the team.\n\nAlways involved and always trying to affect the game.\n\nI’m not sure what goes on in players’ heads; why they don’t turn up for certain games and indeed where this leaves our season, but at least the return of our captain will mean everyone will be getting his instructions and motivation for the remaining games.\n\nMy first negative concerns the injuries to both Nordi Mukiele and Jocelin Ta Bi in the first half.\n\nAs we started to approach a full strength squad, we could’ve done without losing players and especially someone as influential as Mukiele.\n\nHopefully they aren’t out for long as it didn’t help the flow in a very poor first half — possibly the worst of the season?\n\nI was interested to see how we would approach this game — would it be a fast and committed approach to push us as high up the table as possible, or would it be a negative “It’s only Fulham” approach?\n\nUnfortunately, it was the latter.\n\nWe lacked energy and passion, and save for a brief moment after our penalty, we were often a shadow of the team we can be, which certainly wasn’t conducive to a team fighting for the highest finish possible.\n\nFulham have done the double over us this season. That’s a damning fact.\n\nThe sides were quite evenly-matched overall and I have to say that Fulham took their chances well, but despite the tide of goals going against us, the period before and after Enzo Le Fée’s goal were pretty uncomfortable for the visitors.\n\nWe’re a team that doesn’t give up, and that’s the hallmark of this group — regardless of which formation we’re playing.\n\nWe are still competing in the FA Cup and need only one win to be safe, with eleven games to go.\n\nLast August, all Sunderland fans would have taken that.\n\nWe just didn’t play with the required intensity — especially in the first half.\n\nFulham played well and were very competitive, but we didn’t show enough dominance in midfield and penetration in attack, and allowed the Fulham forwards too much space. We definitely missed the drive and organisational awareness of our superb captain Granit Xhaka in the first sixty nine minutes.\n\nThe change after he came on was noticeable but he can’t be the solution all over the pitch, as we normally enjoy defending.\n\nSunderland came back with some intent at 0-2 and dominated the game before and after the penalty, taken expertly by Le Fée.\n\nThe Londoners were very good on the break, with excellent play from Harry Wilson and Alex Iwobi, and the third goal definitely deflated us and a lot of fans left early.\n\nWe had off days — both on Sunday and at Craven Cottage when we lost 1-0 — and Fulham are the only team to have done the double over us this season.\n\nIt was a nice sunny day — a great day for watching football.\n\nThe crowd were expectant and the two teams produced a ponderous spectacle. Both teams were even if you look at the stats, and Granit Xhaka improved things.\n\nIt was an awful sight for the television audience.\n\nTwo mid-table teams not producing much in terms of end product.\n\nThe loss of Nordi Mukiele was a big blow, as it ruined the attack down our right hand side.\n\nBoth teams were evenly matched, but our lack of cutting edge is getting increasingly concerning and as soon as Romaine Mundle missed his chance, I said to my neighbour that they would go and score. I said it mainly to jinx it from happening but that ploy didn’t work.\n\nThat’s the second home game in a row where the opposition has scored with an unmarked header from a corner, but their VAR-gifted penalty was a joke — not least because there were at least four Fulham players in offside positions.\n\n0-2 down was always going to be a huge ask but when Enzo Le Fée narrowed the deficit, I wondered if a comeback a-la Arsenal or even Bournemouth was on the cards.\n\nThe crowd didn’t play their part and it was disappointing to see everyone leaving in droves when Alex Iwobi impressively slotted home their third, whereas in previous games, the crowd would’ve driven the team on.\n\nIt seemed that no-one — the crowd or the players — had the appetite for a fight. And Fulham were allowed to steal the three points.\n\nThis team and the fans need to stick together, so it’s absolutely despicable to hear of the online racist abuse that’s been sent to Mundle.\n\nWe win as a team and we lose as a team. If you don’t like that, get the hell out of here and don’t dare to call yourself a Sunderland fan. How dare you!\n\nAs Dan Ballard said, days like this were always going to happen. We need to stick together no call each other out. All for one and one for all.\n\nIf you don’t like it, get lost.\n\nAs has been the case since Christmas, Sunderland have been a predictable beast.\n\nWhilst Régis Le Bris’ pragmatism was a welcome change at the start of the season, the predictability it brings in a division where teams are constantly in a state of evolution is starting to bite — and bite hard.\n\nA lack of creative spark and a lot of sideways movement that concludes in not very much isn’t enough to establish yourself at this level for a prolonged period of time.\n\nAs soon as he came on, the groans were audible and the predictable proceeded to happen.\n\nWhilst the result wasn’t on one individual, he simply isn’t good enough for this level and his missed sitter was a ‘sliding doors moment’ in a game devoid of quality until then.\n\nSince Christmas (someone please fact check this) we’ve conceded an average of two goals per game in the league whilst boasting a brilliantly low xG.\n\nIn short, we’re conceding around twice as many goals as we score, and it doesn’t need a genius to explain why that is objectively bad news.\n\nAnother game where Trai Hume was neither a full back nor a midfielder — an experiment which needs to end.\n\nHume’s inclusion out of position softens us in defence and attack. It’s been coming for weeks and is visible to all except those who make the decisions on the team sheet. At this level, we need eleven men playing at full throttle, yet at the moment we choose to play with 9.5 every time we play Mundle and Hume out of position.\n\nBrutal it may be, but for a team that’s taken plenty of plaudits, they’re also not immune from criticism — especially when the issues are so obvious to boot.",

    "description": "On this day in 1985, a future Sunderland striker would show the Lads how it’s done!",
    "fullText": "Looking back to this day back in 1985, it actually seemed quite a pivotal moment. It was a point where Sir Tom Cowie’s gamble from the season before could have gone either way.\n\nGoing back twelve months, the Sunderland owner decided that – after allowing him to build an exciting young squad, with the likes of Colin West and Gary Rowell banging in the goals, Paul Bracewell pulling the strings in midfield, Barry Venison and Nick Pickering bombing down the flanks from full-back and Chris Turner between the sticks – that Alan Durban wasn’t his man.\n\nBut, as always, Sunderland moves on, and on this occasion Cowie turned back to a club legend on the pitch, someone who had made more appearances as an outfield player than anyone else in the club’s history – Len Ashurst.\n\nAshurst found himself in a tough spot during his first summer; however, he wanted to freshen up the squad but wasn’t provided with the funds to do so, and tough decisions had to be made. Eight players would make their Sunderland debuts in the first four games of the following season, and for a while, things were looking good.\n\nAs December began, Sunderland had just beaten Ron Atkinson’s Manchester United 3-2 at Roker Park in an ill-tempered affair that saw David Hodgson and Mark Hughes receive their marching orders, and Clive Walker bag a hat-trick. This put Ashurst’s side ninth in the table (of 22 in Division One), with a League Cup fourth round replay at White Hart Lane to come days later – having knocked Brian Clough’s Forest out in the previous round.\n\nTop half of the First Division, going strong in the League Cup – happy days.\n\nSunderland then lost eight out of the next nine league games, including a 3-1 loss at St James’ Park against Jack Charlton’s Mags side, where Gary Bennett and Howard Gayle were sent off.\n\nBut in the three games prior to the trip to West London, there were signs that things were looking up.\n\nThis began with knocking Graham Taylor’s Watford out of the League Cup at the quarter-final stage, and although we followed that up with defeat at The Dell against Lawrie McMenemy’s Southampton, we quickly bounced back with a 1-0 win against a Stoke City side that had Steve Bould at the back and Barry Siddall behind him in goal.\n\nThis got even better when the Lads beat Chelsea 2-0 at Roker in the League Cup semi-final first-leg, which meant things were looking up ahead of the clash with QPR, who, although they were four places higher in the table than Sunderland, were only two points better off having played two more fixtures.\n\nIt was a good opportunity for Ashurst to relieve the pressure and climb the table to the safety of mid-table, and a training session the day before the game to become accustomed to the controversial synthetic pitch at Loftus Road seemed to have paid off in the early stages, as Sunderland piled the pressure on the hosts.\n\nWith just a couple of minutes on the clock, West was sent through on goal by Hodgson with only the keeper to beat, but could only drag his shot wide. Moments later, Gary Bennett shot straight at Peter Hucker in the QPR goal, before Peter Daniel repeated the feat soon after. Then it was Clive Walker’s turn to be sent through on goal by Hodgson, but again his shot was saved.\n\nQPR were having more of the ball, but the away side continued to create the better chances. Even after the break, when the hosts had been offered a chance to regroup, the chances still came for Sunderland. Ten minutes into the second half, an unmarked Pickering could only head over the bar after good work from Venison – it seemed a case of when and not if – and just after the hour mark, it duly arrived.\n\nPredictably, it came at the other end, and it began with an innocuous long clearance from Hucker that Reuben Agboola could only head straight to future Sunderland FA Cup hero John Byrne, who then showed the Sunderland strikers how to do it by driving a crisp shot into the corner of the net past Chris Turner.\n\nMore chances were created to equalise in the remaining half hour, but more chances were missed. It would end 1-0 to the home side, with a striker doing the business being the thing to divide the two sides, but for Sunderland, it was possibly more significant.\n\nThe positivity going into the QPR fixture was seemingly lost, and Ashurst’s side lost 12 out of the remaining 16 league games and were relegated to Division Two – and of course, we lost in the League Cup final.\n\nQueens Park Rangers 1-0 Sunderland\n\nSunderland: Turner, Venison, Pickering, Bennett, Chisholm, Elliott, Hodgson (Wallace), Agboola, West, Daniel, Walker\n\nQPR: Hucker, Fereday, Dawes, Waddock, Wicks, Fenwick, Robinson, Fillery, Bannister, Byrne, Gregory Substitute not used: Kerslake",

    "description": "MS Dhoni will be available for CSK in IPL 2026 but may not play every match, a franchise source confirmed. With Sanju Samson and other wicketkeepers in the squad, Dhoni’s workload could be managed, especially due to fitness concerns and the Impact Player rule. However, he is expected to feature in most home games at Chepauk, where his presence continues to electrify fans.",
    "fullText": "Dhoni, who will turn 45 later this year, is set to be available for CSK, but it looks unlikely that he will feature in all games.\n\nA top CSK source confirmed his availability. “We can confirm this much that he is coming to Chennai and had confirmed his availability for the season,\" the source told PTI. \n\nHowever, the same source added, “Whether he will play all games or not is something we can't say at the moment.”\n\nWith the arrival of Sanju Samson, CSK now have multiple wicketkeeping options, which could reduce Dhoni’s workload. \n\nSamson is expected to keep wickets in matches where Dhoni sits out, while other keepers like Urvil Patel and young recruit Kartik Sharma are also in the squad.\n\nIn recent seasons, Dhoni’s role with the bat has been limited due to the Impact Player rule, and he has mostly played as a finisher in specific situations. \n\nManaging his fitness will also be important, as he has dealt with knee and back issues in recent years, and the physical demands of wicketkeeping can be tough with packed schedules.\n\nHowever, Dhoni is likely to play most of CSK’s home matches at Chepauk, where his presence still excites fans like no other. His bond with the Chennai crowd remains strong, and every time he walks onto the field, it sends the stadium into a frenzy.",

    "fullText": "With Mauricio Pochettino about three weeks from selecting the U.S. roster for March training camp and friendlies, a rush of good news concerning two players arrived a few hours apart Saturday:\n\nMidfielder Tyler Adams was on the field for the first time in more than two months and striker Ricardo Pepi was in uniform for the first time in six weeks.\n\nAdams, who recovered earlier than anticipated from a sprained knee ligament, started in Bournemouth’s 0-0 draw at West Ham, while Pepi, in uniform after recovering from a fractured forearm, scored a sensational goal as a second-half sub in PSV Eindhoven’s 3-1 triumph over Heerenveen.\n\nRicardo Pepi laat zich direct gelden bij zijn rentree 🎯👏#psvhee pic.twitter.com/z4UrAtaZkr\n\n— ESPN NL (@ESPNnl) February 21, 2026\n\nWith both back in the mix for national team duty next month — Adams is certain and Pepi is probable — Pochettino has, at the moment, almost his entire player pool available for selection.\n\nOnly midfielder Gio Reyna (muscular issue) and winger Alex Zendejas (adductor) have remained out for multiple weeks.\n\nAdams, the 2022 World Cup captain, missed 10 matches before suiting up at Everton on Feb. 10 — an absence of eight weeks instead of up to a feared three months. On Saturday, he logged 66 minutes, completed 41-of-45 passes and earned the second-best defensive statistics among players on both teams as eighth-place Bournemouth extended its Premier League unbeaten streak to seven.\n\nWith his left forearm well-protected, Pepi entered in the 76th minute and, after video replay negated his apparent goal, he rocketed a 25-yard shot in the 87th minute to stretch his Eredivisie scoring streak to six games. He increased his league total to nine and overall count to 12 in just 22 appearances.\n\nThe timing was ideal for the 23-year-old Texan, who, while injured, fell behind Coventry City’s Haji Wright and Derby County’s Patrick Agyemang on the U.S. depth chart behind No. 1 striker Folarin Balogun (Monaco).\n\n“Amazing feeling to be back!” Pepi posted on social media. “Thank you to all the PSV’ers for the warm support on my return.”\n\nPochettino plans to name his squad for next month’s camp March 17 ahead of friendlies in Atlanta against Belgium on March 28 and Portugal on March 31 — the last gathering before his World Cup decisions. He must submit a provisional list of between 35 and 55 players to FIFA by May 11 before announcing the 26-man squad on or about May 26.\n\nIt was quite a week for Balogun, who followed his two-goal performance against reigning European champion Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday with a second-half goal that sparked Monaco’s three-goal uprising to shock Ligue 1 leader Lens, 3-2.\n\nHe increased his overall goal haul to 11: five in Ligue 1, five in the Champions League and one in the French Cup.\n\nMidfielder Tanner Tessmann (58 minutes) and third-place Lyon saw their 13-game winning streak across all competitions end with a 3-1 defeat at Strasbourg.\n\nRight back Tim Weah was Olympique Marseille’s best player from an analytical standpoint in a 2-0 loss at Brest, extending fourth-place OM’s overall slump to 1-3-2 heading into next Sunday’s critical home match against Lyon.\n\nToulouse center back Mark McKenzie served a yellow card suspension and missed the 1-1 draw with Paris FC.\n\nCenter back Chris Richards helped Crystal Palace register its second shutout in three Premier League matches, a 1-0 victory over last-place Wolverhampton, which played a man short for about a half-hour before conceding the goal.\n\nLeft back Antonee Robinson was held out of Fulham’s 3-1 triumph at Sunderland without an official explanation, his third consecutive league absence. He had played 90 last weekend in the FA Cup.\n\nMidfielder Brenden Aaronson (73 minutes) and Leeds earned their third straight away draw in Premier League play, a 1-1 result at Aston Villa.\n\nAfter productive matches in the English Championship last week, Wright and Agyemang were quiet. Wright played 71 minutes in a 2-0 victory at West Brom and Agyemang went 90 in a 2-0 loss at Watford.\n\nMidfielder Aidan Morris went 75 in Middlesbrough’s 0-0 draw with second-to-last Oxford, leaving his club three points behind first-place Coventry but six points ahead in the race for the second promotion to the Premier League.\n\nChristian Pulisic, who has been battling bursitis, returned to AC Milan’s lineup after three substitution appearances with a 62-minute effort and two quality scoring chances during a 1-0 home loss to Parma — its first loss in Serie A since the August opener, a stretch of 23 games.\n\nMidfielder Weston McKennie, who has been in tremendous form for Juventus this winter, played all of the 2-0 loss to Como, a result that stretched the Turin club’s winless rut to five games heading into the home leg of the Champions League affair with Galatasaray on Wednesday. (Juventus lost last week’s opener, 5-2.)\n\nMidfielder Yunus Musah remained on the bench for the seventh time in nine matches as Atalanta edged Napoli, 2-1. He has appeared in 14-of-26 Serie A matches with just three starts, totalling 447 minutes.\n\nIn Serie B, goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann has conceded 10 goals in three matches, the most recent setback coming in Cesena’s 3-2 loss to Spezia.\n\nMidfielder Malik Tillman played 81 minutes in Bayer Leverkusen’s 1-0 loss at Union Berlin, ending a seven-game unbeaten streak heading into the Champions League second leg Tuesday against Olympiacos. Leverkusen won the first leg, 2-0.\n\nTeenage center back Noahkai Banks (17th start) continued to impress at Augsburg, which used a late comeback to earn a 3-2 victory at Wolfsburg.\n\nReyna’s call-up hopes continued to dim after missing his fifth consecutive match for Mönchengladbach. Over two months, he has played just 28 minutes. Teammate Joe Scally, a right wing back, played the entire match.\n\nMidfielder James Sands’ run of 17 consecutive starts for St. Pauli across all competitions ended, but he entered in the 80th minute and helped seal a 2-1 victory over Werder Bremen, which lifted the Hamburg side out of the automatic relegation zone.\n\nIn the second division, left wing back John Tolkin (70 minutes) and Holstein Kiel lost at Karlsruher, 3-1 — their fifth consecutive loss overall.\n\nMidfielder Johnny Cardoso made his fifth consecutive La Liga start for Atlético Madrid, which defeated Espanyol, 4-2, to snap a three-game winless streak in league play.\n\nRight back Alex Freeman did not play in Villarreal’s 2-1 win over Valencia.\n\nWhile Pepi’s goal headlined the U.S. contributions for PSV Eindhoven, right back Sergiño Dest made his 22nd start as the league leaders continued to run away with the title, thanks to a 20-2-2 record and a plus-41 goal differential.\n\nCenter back Auston Trusty’s second red card in four weeks – for violent conduct in the 74th minute – imperiled Celtic, which conceded Hibernian’s late winner in the 2-1 outcome. He will miss next Sunday’s Old Firm clash against Rangers.\n\nOn opening weekend, three Vancouver players in the U.S. pool – center back Tristan Blackmon, midfielder Sebastian Berhalter and striker Brian White – played the whole match as the Whitecaps edged Real Salt Lake, 1-0. RSL midfielder Diego Luna sat out with a knee ailment.\n\nFive goalkeeping candidates started, led by Pochettino’s undisputed starter, New York City’s Matt Freese, who made five saves in a 1-1 draw against the L.A. Galaxy. The others were New England’s Matt Turner, Chicago’s Chris Brady, Columbus’ Patrick Schulte and Cincinnati’s Roman Celentano.\n\nCenter backs Tim Ream (Charlotte), Miles Robinson (Cincinnati) and Walker Zimmerman (Toronto) and left wing back Max Arfsten (Columbus) played every minute and midfielder Luca de la Torre (Charlotte) went 69.\n\nLos Angeles FC midfielder Timothy Tillman assisted during his 82-minute stint in the 3-0 home rout of Inter Miami before 75,673 at the Coliseum. Midfielder Cristian Roldan captained Seattle’s 2-0 win over Colorado.",

    "fullText": "Lakers' JJ Redick reveals what is preventing LeBron James, Austin Reaves, Luka Doncic from winning originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are looking to finish the second half of the season strong and secure a favorable spot in the playoffs. However, it has been an up-and-down year for Los Angeles. For LeBron James, the bigger picture is his potential options this offseason.\n\n“Cleveland is one of them. I’m not sure I’d put the Heat on the list. Golden State depending on how things go would be one. There’s a place of two that I won’t say right now that I’m keeping my eye on… I have a team or two that I think he could consider going to and I have researched the concept and I will continue to keep my eye on the concept,” Brian Windhorst said on the Rich Eisen Show.\n\nIf this is indeed his final season, James wants to be part of a contender.\n\n“LeBron wants to compete for a championship,\" James’ agent Rich Paul told ESPN. \"He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. We are very appreciative of the partnership that we've had for eight years with Jeanie [Buss] and Rob [Pelinka] and consider the Lakers as a critical part of his career.”\n\nOn the court, head coach JJ Redick believes the Lakers need to share the ball more to maximize their potential.\n\n“That's, again, it's something we talk about all the time. We're a better basketball team. We win more games if we have more potential assists. And get more assists,” Redick said after a loss to the Boston Celtics.\n\nWith Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves, and James on the floor, ball movement shouldn’t be an issue. Yet, for some reason, the ball is sticking in one spot longer than usual when the Lakers are dropping games.\n\nWhen all three stars are working together and moving the ball effectively, the Lakers become a formidable force. The team’s main challenge is finding consistency in connecting with one another on the court.",

    "fullText": "Lakers insider exposes nightmare stat for LeBron James, Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves playing together originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are looking forward to this summer with excitement, especially regarding potential roster moves. One key focus is Austin Reaves, who will be a free agent this offseason, though there is mutual interest in bringing him back.\n\n“I try not to think about it. Honestly. I've said it a million times. I want to be in L.A. I love it,\" Reaves told ESPN. \"Even though the other extension was turned down, that doesn't mean that I'm trying to go get a f---ing gigantic number that don't make sense. I want to be here, I want to win. I want to do everything that can help this organization be better. So I don't try to think about those things.\"\n\nThe Lakers also have a bright future with Luka Doncic, whose only request is to win now.\n\n“Dončić being just 26 gives the Lakers a far longer timeline to build a championship-contending team, but that doesn't mean they can slow down and take their time. Dončić told Lakers president Rob Pelinka and coach JJ Redick in May that he's not interested in taking the slow approach in building a contender,” CBS Sports’ Jasmyn Wimbish wrote.\n\nAdd LeBron James to the mix, and expectations for the Big Three are sky-high. However, Lakers insider Jovan Buha recently highlighted a concerning stat when the trio plays together.\n\n“The Lakers are now 8-4 in their 12 games with the Big 3. Their four losses are to the four best teams they've played record-wise: Spurs, Rockets, Celtics and Suns. They've lost all of those games by double digits. That's concerning,” Buha posted.\n\nWhile 12 games is a small sample size, expectations for the Big Three are much higher. Dominating weaker teams is one thing, but failing to notch a single significant win against the league’s best with all three stars on the floor is troubling.\n\nThe Lakers have an elite Big Three, but they haven’t been able to fully click when it matters most. The trio will need to figure this out as the playoffs approach in a few months.",

    "description": "A six-shot lead at Riviera had evaporated with Tiger Woods looking on?",
    "fullText": "PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. — The scariest putt in golf is somewhere between three and four feet.\n\nShort enough that you expect to make it.\n\nLong enough that you might not.\n\nIt gets tougher, I’d imagine, to hit a three-and-a-half footer with 5,000 people watching from the hillside in front of you.\n\nTougher when they’ve just gasped in horror at what you’ve just done.\n\nTougher still when one of those people is Rory McIlroy, who just so happens to be one stroke behind you.\n\nAnd tougher when another is Tiger Woods, your childhood hero, looking on from a perch beside the clubhouse, 50 yards and 500 miles away, waiting to shake your hand as long as you can somehow get your ball to the bottom of that hole.\n\nIt gets tougher when you’re on the brink of winning your first PGA Tour event, something you’ve dreamt of your entire life, something you know you can do but also know isn’t guaranteed.\n\nAnd tougher knowing that missing wouldn’t just mean letting an opportunity slip by — it would mean blowing a six-stroke lead, crashing on the final turn, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nIt gets tougher when the pressure hasn’t slowly mounted, but instead, after three rounds and 15 holes of low stress and many birdies, it hits like a freight train, with a shrinking lead, a growing crowd, decibels, nerves and heart rate rising by the minute.\n\nAnd it gets tougher when you can’t feel your hands.\n\nSUNDAY BROUGHT THE MOST GLORIOUS WEATHER in the history of Los Angeles, tied for first with 80 percent of all days in L.A. history, 70 degrees and sunny, deep blue cloudless sky matching the deep blue ocean just visible from the balcony of Riviera Country Club’s iconic clubhouse.\n\nThat was the setting for the final round of the Genesis Invitational, which felt like it could go one of two directions. Jacob Bridgeman began the day with a six-shot lead over Rory McIlroy and seven-plus over the rest of the gang, having played nearly flawless golf through three rounds. Bridgeman has been very good and very steady since last season, but entering Sunday he’d never won. Would he succumb to the pressure, blow up and yield to the chase pack? Or would he keep his foot on the gas and continue speeding away from the rest of the field? Those felt like the two options.\n\nInstead, much of the day settled in the awkward in-between.\n\nThere are few better golf settings than the iconic old-school cool of Riviera, though early tee times plus an L.A. crowd living up to its get-there-in-the-fourth-inning reputation led to a slightly muted early stretch.\n\nRiviera’s just a really cool place to watch a golf tournament pic.twitter.com/Bn8dl5jgh2\n\n— Dylan Dethier (@dylan_dethier) February 22, 2026\n\nFans were pulling for McIlroy, wanting to will him into a comeback, but they were quietly supportive of Bridgeman, too, an impressive unknown without an ounce of villain in him. Bridgeman matched McIlroy’s birdie at No. 1 to keep his lead at six. He birdied the third to stretch it to seven. Even that was greeted with light applause. McIlroy’s early birdie tries slid by, doing little to ignite the crowd. Hollywood seemed unimpressed with this particular bit of anticlimax.\n\n(One star among them: Ben Affleck, who walked the entire front nine inside the ropes with his son and tried multiple times to frame up the perfect iPhone photo of a McIlroy tee shot. The stars, they’re just like us!)\n\nBridgeman has been forged in the fires of competitive golf, first growing up in South Carolina, then at Clemson and more recently on the game’s top circuit. He’s been on a steady upward trajectory. He’s made it clear that success isn’t all his own.\n\nWhen he first started working with his swing coach Scott Hamilton, he had some work to do. “I didn’t hit the ball straight, didn’t hit it high, didn’t have a lot of control with my irons,” he said.\n\nWhen he settled on his first-choice caddie, G.W. Cable, there was just one problem: he’d have to take a pay cut to join Bridgeman on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\n“He took a gamble on me and luckily we only spent one year down there and I think he’s pretty pleased with his gamble,” Bridgeman said.\n\nHe earned $4.4 million on the course last season. He was playing for a $4 million winner’s check on Sunday. Good pressure to have.\n\nBut just because he’s been good doesn’t mean it’d be easy. As the day lingered, Bridgeman let the rest of the field do the same. He bogeyed 4. He bogeyed 7. He hit the middles of greens, he scared the hole, just missing putts that he’d watched fall the first three days.\n\nMcIlroy finally made some semblance of a push early on the back nine. Birdie at 11 cut the lead to five before a highlight-reel hole-out birdie from the bunker at 12 electrified the crowd for the first time all day.\n\nNot going down without a fight!@McIlroyRory birdies from the bunker to get within 4 of solo leader Jacob Bridgeman.\n\n📺 CBS pic.twitter.com/nOJ9IH0g0M\n\n— PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) February 22, 2026\n\nUp ahead, several other contenders made their presence felt. Aldrich Potgieter got to 15 under with an eagle at 11. Adam Scott played stunning golf, stacking eight birdies and zero bogeys to post the clubhouse lead at 16 under. And then, just as Bridgeman found himself in a spot of bother, Kurt Kitayama made his seventh and eighth birdies of the day in the group ahead to post 17 under par.\n\nBridgeman wobbled with a wayward tee shot at No. 16, dumping his iron into the front right bunker, an inescapable jail.\n\n“It was honestly easy until I got to about 16 and then it got really hard,” Bridgeman said post-round. His caddie, looking at his lie, didn’t hesitate. He had to aim right and play for bogey. His lengthy par putt wandered past the hole; he negotiated in a nervy try for bogey. The lead was suddenly one.\n\nThings only got tougher at the par-5 17th, where Bridgeman’s second shot sailed right and found a bunker, leaving him with no good options. He did well to play a sensible shot.\n\n“Definitely around the green, that was the first time that I had to play defense,” he said.\n\nIt was around this time that Bridgeman lost feeling in his hands.\n\n“I didn’t really feel really crazy nervous until I had a five-footer for bogey on 16; that one was sketchy,” he said. “I hit a really good putt and luckily it went in, and then I was really nervous from there on out. I couldn’t even feel my hands on the last couple greens, I just hit the putt hoping it would get somewhere near the hole.”\n\nBut on full shots, Bridgeman said, he still felt okay.\n\n“I felt like I was just kind of in robot mode and autopilot, I could just swing the club and it would do exactly what it’s supposed to do,” he said. An envious feeling.\n\nThat’s what he did on No. 18, sending driver up the left-center fairway off the tee and playing a towering approach right at the hole, 20 feet short, straight uphill.\n\nAnd then he left it three and a half feet short.\n\nThe crowd groaned. They murmured. Suddenly, a tantalizing possibility was back in play: a miss would mean a three-way playoff between Bridgeman, Kitayama and McIlroy, whose dramatic birdie putt had dripped over the front edge just moments before.\n\nBridgeman is good friends with Chris Gotterup, a rising star on Tour and a recent multiple-time winner. He recounted watching the WM Phoenix Open, where Gotterup poured in a winning birdie putt with aggressive speed.\n\n“We were like, what were you doing? You hit your putt so hard, it was going to go four feet by the hole. He said, ‘I have no idea, I couldn’t feel my hands.’\n\n“I thought he was kind of crazy until I got to this moment and then I was like, yep, I understand what you’re talking about now, Chris. I had no idea what to do.”\n\nIt’s tough to make a three-and-a-half footer, and it’s tougher if you can sense that some portion of the crowd around is suddenly hoping that you will.\n\nBut, as he and we suddenly realized, easier for Jacob Bridgeman.\n\n“The hole’s really white and it looked pretty big for whatever reason on 18,” he said. He had his read — hit it at the middle of the middle — and he knew what he could control.\n\n“I was just hoping that the ball would roll where it was supposed to roll.”\n\nMost of the time, nothing good can happen with a three-and-a-half-footer. It’s a multiple-choice test with two options: Relief or disaster. This time, though, salvation lay within. The ball rolled as it was supposed to. Bridgeman’s triumph was official. He plunged into the winner’s whirlpool; his wife greeted him on the green, he floated through his CBS interview, he climbed the stairs, shook Woods’ hand, didn’t process whatever he said.\n\n“This is way, way better than I’ve ever dreamt it,” he said.\n\nDylan Dethier welcomes your comments at dylan_dethier@golf.com.\n\nThe post ‘Couldn’t feel my hands’: Inside Jacob Bridgeman’s terrifying Genesis finish appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea are reportedly now looking into a move to sign Sunderland’s 6ft 4in goalkeeper Robin Roefs this summer.\n\nIt’s a surprise link that has come from nowhere really, with the goalkeeper noise around Stamford Bridge going a little bit quiet lately.\n\nWith the form of Robert Sanchez improving immensely, we have seen new number one goalkeeper links with Chelsea die out a little bit. But there is another situation brewing up.\n\nFilip Jorgensen is basically not playing at all now at Chelsea and will clearly be looking to move on in the summer if his situation does not improve. He is a young goalkeeper who will not be happy playing as a backup – so you will see him looking to move on at the end of the season. And Chelsea will need to replace him.\n\nAgain though, will Roefs be happy being a backup, if that is what they are looking at him for, if they are even looking at him at all?\n\nThey are, according to one reliable journalist this week.\n\nChelsea are interested in signing Roefs ahead of the summer transfer window, with the North East club slapping a £50m price tag on his head, according to journalist Alan Nixon.\n\nThe big shock here though is that the report actually claims Roefs would be to replace SANCHEZ and NOT Jorgensen!?\n\nAccording to the report from Nixon, Chelsea are in the race to sign Sunderland goalkeeper Roefs ahead of the transfer window. The Blues are believed to be searching for a new number one, and Sunderland would be willing to do business if the price is right.\n\nNixon claims it could take an offer in the region of £50m for Chelsea to secure his signature, while Roefs would be keen on a move if Rosenior’s side seal Champions League qualification.\n\nI simply cannot see this right now, don’t think it will happen, at least not replacing Sanchez with him.",

They re-hired Massimiliano Allegri, who has steered the club back into the upper echelon.\n\nThe seven-time UEFA Champions League winners looked to be pushing rivals Inter Milan for the Scudetto, but recent results have seen them fall further back in the race.\n\nMilan have managed only one win in their last four games (D2, L1), allowing their ruthless arch-rivals take a 10-point lead with 12 games to go.\n\nMilan travel to Cremonese next weekend before a crucial title decider with Inter.\n\nIf the Rossoneri have any hopes of spoiling Inter’s party, they must pick up maximum points in the coming match-ups.\n\nAfter finishing ninth last season, the primary objective for Milan this term was not necessarily to wrestle back the Scudetto, but to restore their status among Europe’s elite.\n\nReturning to the UEFA Champions League was the benchmark. In that context, this campaign still represents significant progress.\n\nNine draws have ultimately cost them momentum. Turning even a handful of those stalemates into victories could have kept them firmly in the title conversation deep into the spring.\n\nHowever, this is not a side that should beat itself up. The bigger picture matters.\n\nMilan have rebuilt their identity, regained consistency and re-established themselves at the top end of Serie A.\n\nIf they can get the right additions through the door in the summer transfer window, they can push for Scudetto number 20 next season.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen Josh Pate announced that Donald Trump would appear on his College Football Show, he promised viewers a politics-free conversation focused strictly on the sport. However, what followed was a brisk, 10-minute exchange that often drifted far from the field.\n\nHere are the seven questions Pate posed and how the answers unfolded in the conversation.\n\nPate opened with a broad question about the sport’s structure and enforceable rules. Trump began by saying, “It’s too bad. I hate to see it,” before pivoting to NFL kickoff rule changes. He never directly addressing college football governance.\n\nTrump responded by name-checking teams he “likes,” including Georgia and South Carolina, and praised quarterback Gunner Stockton, who was in the room. He then told the audience Pate had asked how he judges players, which he had not, leaving the original question unanswered.\n\nWhen asked what was discussed, Trump said their conversations are “always” about politics, contradicting Meyer’s prior claim that they discussed football.\n\nAfter briefly mentioning Miami and Indiana’s Curt Cignetti, Pate pivoted to hiring philosophy. Trump launched into a familiar monologue about instincts and staffing decisions.\n\nThe response centered on instincts. Trump then detoured into praise for Herschel Walker, calling him “maybe the greatest player ever.”\n\nThis led to reflections about the Lincoln Bedroom rather than football.\n\nThe final exchange remained general, touching only lightly on sports.\n\nMore:Donald Trump trends after failed Army-Navy coin toss\n\nAs Pate later explained, a planned 30-to 40-minute long interview was cut short due to a scheduling conflict.

    "description": "Fans should welcome the belief of sources on all sides that Harry Maguire will remain at Manchester United at least for next season, writes Simon Stone.",
    "fullText": "When Manchester United's squad arrived at Burnley for the first match of the post-Ruben Amorim era on 7 January, the major questions centred around the fitness of skipper Bruno Fernandes and whether interim boss Darren Fletcher would pick Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nHarry Maguire's presence in the travelling party at Turf Moor was something of a surprise.\n\nThe 32-year-old had been absent for nine matches with a thigh injury and there had been no real talk of a return.\n\nIn reality, Fletcher would only have called on United's one-time skipper in extreme circumstances that night. At that point, Maguire had barely even trained.\n\nBut Maguire did feature for 11 minutes four days later as he tried - unsuccessfully -to help rescue an FA Cup third round defeat by Brighton.\n\nFletcher was doing Michael Carrick a huge favour.\n\nDespite featuring just once in almost three months, it meant when Carrick took charge for the first time for Manchester City's visit to Old Trafford on 17 January, Maguire was wired into the mental demands of starting, even if his new boss admitted afterwards, physically, it was a step into the unknown.\n\n\"It was a big ask for H [Maguire],\" said Carrick.\n\n\"We can take for granted sometimes what players do. I'm not going to lie, it was a bit of a calculated gamble for how long he could play and if he could get through it because he's literally trained for two or three days in probably eight or nine weeks. It just shows you what it means to him.\"\n\nThe 'taking for granted' aspect of Carrick's answer was telling.\n\nThe former United and England midfielder knows the sacrifices needed to excel at the very highest levels of the game. He also knows the demands that are placed on players' bodies.\n\nBeyond his ability, it is the kind of attitude that meant he put himself forward to be involved at Burnley, which makes Maguire so valuable to United.\n\nIt is why, as they approach a summer when Casemiro's vast experience is going to be lost, it should be welcomed that multiple sources with an understanding of the situation believe a resolution will eventually be found to Maguire's contractual situation that will allow him to remain at Manchester United at least for next season.\n\nNothing is agreed yet. Until it is, there remains the potential for Maguire to either agree a deal with another club - which, under freedom of contract regulations, he is entitled to do - or United back away.\n\nCompromise is likely to be needed, on both salary - Maguire is one of United's highest-paid players and Sir Jim Ratcliffe is determined to drive costs down - and maybe contract length.\n\nBut through Burnley, Brighton, City and beyond Maguire played for every single minute of the four-match winning streak Carrick started his spell in charge with.\n\nThe England defender has shown just how valuable he is at a time when Matthijs de Ligt remains sidelined for an indefinite period with a back injury, with no immediate sign of return.\n\nMaguire does not only have experience and calmness. His communication is also crucial. He is demanding of those around him and is not scared to let team-mates know when they have fallen below the standards he expects.\n\nHis central defensive partnership with Lisandro Martinez has a familiarity about it too, which is a bit surprising given the pair have only started 16 times together in a two-man central defence since the Argentina international joined the Old Trafford outfit from Ajax in 2022.\n\nThe reasons for that are numerous. Amorim's formation for a start. Before that, Erik ten Hag clearly did not feel Maguire was the kind of player he wanted, while Martinez has suffered some pretty hefty injuries.\n\nThere is also the knowledge their first two games together were the defeats by Brighton and Brentford that started Ten Hag's reign.\n\nThey have won in 11 of the following 14 games they have started though, which suggests keeping them both fit could be the key to United's Champions League qualification quest.\n\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel has acknowledged Maguire's recent form, even though the defender won the last of his 64 caps nearly 18 months ago, against the Republic of Ireland in September 2024.\n\n\"Back in the picture,\" is how Tuchel described it at this month's Nations League draw.\n\nNot that many Manchester United fans will be too bothered about that.\n\nFor them, England's fortunes come a firm second to their own hopes of an upturn in results.\n\nMaguire probably thinks like that too.\n\nA veteran of England's last three major tournament campaigns, he knows excelling at a club like Manchester United can propel anyone into the international limelight.\n\nThere is also a feeling Maguire is happy in his surroundings too, that he is settled with his family in the north-west and has no aching desire to start again somewhere else just yet.\n\nHe hasn't spoken about his future much recently. But on current evidence, there is no reason to suggest he has changed his stance from when he spoke to BBC Sport, among others, on a club visit to a football camp in Stretford just after the Premier League campaign had started.\n\n\"Obviously I have something in my mind about what I want to do and where I want to be,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't want to put it out there to everybody but it's an amazing club to play for and you'd be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Eintracht Frankfurt’s sporting director Markus Krösche offered a nuanced assessment of the defeat against FC Bayern. The first half, in particular, gave the 43-year-old cause for concern.\n\n“You have to say that we had difficulties in the first half. Bayern were very dominant and we made too many simple mistakes and lost possession too easily,” Krösche explained. Nevertheless, the first two goals conceded came after a second ball and a set piece. “After that, it was important to go into halftime at 0-2.”\n\nAfter the break, Eintracht showed a marked improvement. “In the second half, we did much better, played better football, and were braver. The substitutions really gave us a boost,” said Krösche. It also became clear “what we have been lacking time and again in recent weeks and months.”\n\nAt the same time, the sporting director admitted that Bayern had slowed the tempo a bit after the break, but still created chances. Goalkeeper Kaua Santos, in particular, distinguished himself with several strong saves.\n\nAll in all, Krösche viewed the second half especially positively: “Overall, the second half was a step forward.” Despite the defeat, the Eintracht management sees signs of development – now it’s a matter of confirming this over the full 90 minutes.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are officially underway with their 2026 Spring Training games, and there are still plenty of questions to be answered before Opening Day. One lingering question from last season was whether the Braves would bring back Ozzie Albies. Braves GM Alex Anthopoulos didn’t make that decision clear during the 2025 season.\n\n“With all these options (on players), we always make the decision at the end of the year — you have five days after the World Series, and that’s when you make the decision. It’s just, things can happen, things change. You always wait,” Anthopoulos said.\n\nThe Braves ended their season in disappointment, but the organization was quick to resolve Albies’ future. They opted to bring back their fan favorite and the player who has consistently been the best at his position for the team.\n\n“The Braves are going to pick up their club option on infielder Ozzie Albies. The club hasn’t announced the decision yet, but president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos confirmed the move in a radio appearance, per Mark Zinno of 92.9 The Game,” Steve Adams wrote for MLB Trade Rumors.\n\nHowever, heading into the regular season, if Albies’ injuries continue, he could become a liability for the Braves.\n\n“Even really good players can become liabilities in one form or another. That doesn't take away from the player they were, but it should inform the Braves' decisions and fans' perception that some guys can't be trusted in certain roles anymore,” HTHB’s Eric Cole wrote. “It was kind of a fun bit for a few years there, where the national media just continually disrespected Ozzie Albies despite the fact that he was among the best second basemen in all of baseball. However, what first looked like just some rough injury luck has become a pattern, and it is now completely fair to call him injury-prone and wonder about his future with the Braves.”\n\nThe Braves are extremely grateful for what Albies has contributed to the organization, but his injuries have also put the team in difficult situations. This season is a must-prove year for the star infielder.\n\nIf Atlanta wants to be successful, they need Albies on the field. If he can’t stay healthy, he risks letting down the Braves faithful once again. There was once a time when it was believed the Braves would have no hesitation keeping Albies for his entire career, but injuries have cast uncertainty over that future.",

A banner from the Ultra Boys 90, which said, “Chelsea doesn’t decide what happens at Racing,” was refused entry to the Meinau stadium on Sunday evening.\n\nIt’s a bit wild that they seem to be rejecting banners like this at their home games. They should be free to voice whatever opinions they have as long as they aren’t offensive, which this one clearly is not. This kind of thing just does not sit well with me I’m afraid. It’s a bit controlling.\n\nLiam Rosenior was understandably disappointed by Chelsea’s performance in the game yesterday, as he explained to Chelsea TV.\n\nPedro Neto got an assist yesterday, but Chelsea’s attack in general disappointed as they failed to capitalise more on their periods of dominance.\n\nCheck out the latest edition of Simon Phillips’ SPTC podcast here:",

He can communicate in German, English, and French. Jonathan is a very good player. I can learn a lot from a player like him.”\n\nUpamecano recently extended his contract at Bayern to 2030 as the Vincent Kompany World/European domination project at Bayern continues to exceed expectations.

    "fullText": "Manchester United Women lost their first game since before Christmas to Chelsea in the FA Cup.\n\nIn spite of a fine effort, they were beaten 2-1 by their old rivals.\n\nHead coach Marc Skinner spoke to the club’s official website after the game and gave his thoughts on the performance.\n\nResponding to how he felt after the game, he stated, “Proud. Proud. So proud of the players. So proud of all the commitment. We’ve just played back-to-back-to-back games — travel away, travel at home — and to put in that performance epitomises everything we are. It epitomises our fans’ energy, our players’ energy. There’s something special about us, about this team.”\n\nHe also claimed that the loss “hurt”, but everyone could see how much the game meant to his players.\n\nSkinner also claimed that the defeat will be useful, as it “will feed us for the next games coming up.”\n\nThe manager also added that he feels his side should have had a penalty and that he is hoping his team will get more luck in the upcoming League Cup final against the same opponent.\n\nSkinner also revealed that his team changed shape and strategy during the match to try and take the win, but once again reiterated that it was his team’s effort that pleased him the most.\n\nHe claimed his team, “showed real commitment when things are against you and you can still fight. That shows special character. And if you’re at a special team like ours, that’s what you have to build.”\n\nComparing both teams, Skinner added that United have had to build more slowly and methodically over the years than Chelsea, but that they are finally getting to a place where they can compete.\n\nHe added, “the players we brought in this year have epitomised and galvanised the group and pushed us on to stronger things. We’ll come back from this stronger. We haven’t tasted defeat in a while, so it’s a little shock — but it gives us fresh impetus going into the next games.”\n\nA common theme in recent games has been the size of support that United have brought along to away games, both at home and in Europe.\n\nSpeaking on this issue, Skinner explained, “they’re the life force behind us — the golden thread in everything we try to do. Honestly, they mean the world to us.”\n\nFeatured image Maja Hitij via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "The Sporting Tribune's Arash Markazi reflects on his 25-year friendship with Jim Hill as the broadcasting legend celebrates 50 years of covering sports in Los Angeles.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES – Jim Hill wouldn’t want me to write this column, but this is one of the few times I must ignore the advice of a man I have looked up to for as long as I can remember watching sports in Los Angeles.\n\nOn Sunday, the Los Angeles Lakers unveiled a statue of Pat Riley, the head coach of the Showtime Lakers, in a ceremony attended by Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Byron Scott, Michael Douglas and Michael McDonald, among others. Lionel Richie even took his courtside seat before the Lakers played the Boston Celtics, as John Tesh’s “Roundball Rock” blared through the arena. If the party had leaned any further into the 1980s, it might have been drenched in neon and simulcast on MTV.\n\nThe ceremony took me back to my childhood, watching Jim cover the Showtime Lakers for KCBS 2 and KABC 7. This month, Jim is celebrating his 50th year covering sports in Los Angeles. Next month, I’ll turn 46. Nearly every memory I have of sports in this city — from the Lakers’ 11 NBA championships to the Dodgers’ ifve World Series titles since 1980 — is connected to Jim talking to players in the locker room after the game.\n\nThe only thing more surreal than covering the teams I grew up watching today is doing it alongside Jim and calling him a friend.\n\nI always dreamed of becoming a sportswriter in Los Angeles. At USC, I won the Allan Malamud Memorial Scholarship and the Jim Murray Memorial Scholarship, named after my two favorite Los Angeles Times columnists. Both Malamud and Murray died while I was a student at Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks. I never had the chance to meet them let alone cover a game alongside them.\n\nTelevision never felt attainable to me. I grew up with a stutter so severe that I would invent excuses to skip class on days when I had to present a book report. On the first day of school, when students were asked to stand and say their name, I would sometimes pretend I needed to go to the nurse’s office.\n\nI’ll never forget the first time I saw Jim as a member of the media before a 2001 Lakers-Clippers game at Staples Center. I was a USC student freelancing for SLAM magazine. We were seated next to each other. He slapped me on the knee like we were old friends and introduced himself, as if I didn’t already know exactly who he was.\n\nWe stayed in touch as my career evolved as I became a staff writer at Sports Illustrated, senior writer at ESPN and a columnist at the Los Angeles Times. At every step, Jim would put me on the air, making me more comfortable with a microphone and a camera representing thousands of households. The kid who once struggled to say his own name was suddenly talking sports with Jim Hill on CBS in Los Angeles.\n\nAs someone who grew up in Los Angeles watching Jim Hill, it was pretty cool co-anchoring Sports Central on CBS after the Lakers-Celtics game on Sunday. pic.twitter.com/jqTe5ze7p8\n\n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) February 25, 2020\n\nWhen I became an adjunct professor at USC, Jim was a regular guest speaker. I wanted my students to hear the same advice he once gave me: It’s all about relationships and hard work — and how inseparable the two are.\n\nThe contact list on Jim’s iPhone reads like a Hall of Fame program — legendary players and coaches, Academy Award-winning actors and directors, even a former United States president. But the relationships he nurtures daily are with beat writers and public relations directors across the city. While many anchors prefer the comforts of the studio, Jim has always preferred being in the thick of the action — at every game, every press conference, often seated in the front row, asking the first question.\n\nOne of the greatest honors of my career came during the 2020 World Series, when I was asked to fill in for Jim as the Dodgers faced the Tampa Bay Rays in Arlington, Texas. As thrilling as it was to watch the Dodgers win their first title since 1988, the celebration felt muted 1,500 miles from home during a global pandemic.\n\nWe made up for it in 2024 when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees to win the World Series less than a month after my wedding. After finishing our postgame interviews in the clubhouse, Jim poured a bottle of champagne over my head while on the air and wrapped me in a hug.\n\nHighlight of the night? Jim Hill pouring a bottle of champagne on me while on air. 😂🍾 pic.twitter.com/Q9Gl7oq4YO\n\n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) October 31, 2024\n\nSunday was a celebration of Pat Riley and the Showtime Lakers. But as I watched Jim work the room after the ceremony as the only member of the media who covered every championship that team won it felt like something more.\n\nIt felt like a celebration of 50 years of Jim Hill telling the story of Los Angeles sports — and, in so many ways, shaping the dreams of a kid who grew up watching him do it.",

    "fullText": "Everton host Manchester United at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Monday night, knowing this is a chance to reset the mood around their season.\n\nEverton started the weekend eighth in the Premier League table, firmly in the European conversation.\n\nStill, frustration is growing on Merseyside after six games without a win at home in all competitions. Another defeat under the lights would only worsen the unease.\n\nHowever, Everton have already beaten United once this season and will take confidence from that win when they welcome the resurgent Red Devils for this tantalising clash.\n\nEverton boss David Moyes returns to face his former club at a delicate time. The 2-1 home defeat to Bournemouth before the break was particularly galling.\n\nEverton were in control before eight chaotic minutes flipped the game. A chance to consolidate a European push slipped away.\n\nTheir home form is now a concern. They have lost five of their last nine Premier League matches on Merseyside, as many as in their previous 28.\n\nThe new 52,000-seat arena is yet to feel like a fortress.\n\nIn contrast, their away record has been excellent. It is the inconsistency at Hill Dickinson Stadium that is holding them back.\n\nMeanwhile, Man United arrive in very different spirits. Since Michael Carrick replaced Ruben Amorim, United have rediscovered rhythm and resilience.\n\nNo side has collected more points in 2026.\n\nA stoppage-time equaliser from Benjamin Sesko at West Ham United extended their unbeaten run and underlined a growing belief. United are playing with freedom again.\n\nEverton are looking to complete just their second Premier League double over Manchester United after 2013/14. But the Toffees must be wary.\n\nUnited have 19 away wins and 42 overall victories against Everton in the Premier League, more than any team has against another in the competition’s history.\n\nEverton have lost five of their last nine home league games (W2, D2) while United are unbeaten in their last nine top-flight matches (W5, D4), their longest such run since 2021.\n\nJake O’Brien is suspended following his red card against Bournemouth, forcing a reshuffle in defence.\n\nLong-term absentee Jack Grealish remains sidelined, but Seamus Coleman is back in contention and could return at right-back.\n\nMore likely, Moyes will roll with Scottish international (15-caps) Nathan Patterson at right-back. Tyrique George, 20, should retain his place in the attack.\n\nIdrissa Gueye is available despite his dismissal at Old Trafford, while Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall will be eager to haunt United again after scoring the winner in November.\n\nJordan Pickford; Nathan Patterson, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; Idrissa Gueye, James Garner; Tyrique George, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Iliman Ndiaye; Thierno Barry.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nToday's mortgage rates are near multi-year lows. While Freddie Mac reported the current 30-year fixed home loan rate at 6.01% this week, the Zillow lender marketplace is reporting an average rate of 5.86%. Is it a good time to buy a house or refinance your mortgage? Shop multiple lenders and you'll see just how much rates can vary.\n\nMORE: Sub-6% offers nearly double: Mortgage lenders with the best rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to refinance your mortgage.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use. It also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate today is 5.86%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.41% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.\n\nLet’s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 5.86% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,772, and you’d pay $337,826 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.41% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,437. But you’d only pay $138,650 in interest over the years.\n\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\n\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\n\nRead more about fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\n\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\n\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\n\nLearn 6 tips for choosing a mortgage lender.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate for purchasing a home is 5.86%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.41%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.86% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI).\n\nAccording to January forecasts, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.10% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate near 6% through the end of the year.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing.

I’m most concerned about power outages here because we have this heavy, wet snow and some very strong winds.”\n\n“We’re looking at gusts anywhere from 30 to 60 mph, so with the heavy wet snow we’re looking at some power outages especially for the coast and southeastern Massachusetts. Something to keep in mind, Monday, the worst of the wind will be early on, eventually easing up late Monday,” said Graf.\n\nPower outages are a top concern in our Monday blizzard. Heavy, wet snow and 50-70 mph gusts will lead to widespread issues.

    "description": "Trump shares statement from Laura Loomer calling on president to kill Netflix deal",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reposted a message calling Michelle Obama a “racist” and ranted against a former high-ranking official in Barack Obama’s administration as he prepares to face Democrats in Congress at the State of the Union address.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Saturday, the president reposted a message from far-right activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer describing the former first lady as an “anti-white racist.” In his own caption, the president took aim at another Black woman in the same administration: former White House adviser Susan Rice.\n\nThreatening Netflix to fire Rice, who serves on the company’s executive board, Trump wrote: “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences.”\n\nLoomer’s post was must more extensive and urged the president to kill an upcoming merger between Warner Bros. and Netflix, which the far-right activist feared would expand the Obamas’ influence within both companies. The former president and his wife own a production company, Higher Ground Productions, which produces a variety of content on Neftlix’s platform.\n\nOf the Obamas, Loomer wrote: “[P]ositive messaging of the Democrats' upcoming witch hunts against Trump from Barack Hussein Obama ... and his anti-White racist wife Michelle ... would likely be blasted across all streaming services as the Obamas' Higher Ground Productions continues to grow within Netflix.”\n\nThe two posts came in response to Rice warning that companies seen as guilty of cozying up to the Trump administration would face consequences of their own if Democratic lawmakers retake the House and Senate in midterm elections this fall — along with the White House in 2028.\n\nShe made the comments on a podcast hosted by Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney fired by Trump during his first term.\n\n“If these corporations think that the Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to, you know, play by the old rules, and, you know, say, ‘Oh, never mind. We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted.’ I think they’ve got another thing coming,” Rice said.\n\nTrump’s apparent support for Loomer’s description of Michelle Obama as “racist” comes as he has continues to refuse to apologize for a scandal that enveloped him this month around the posting of a bizarre AI video from his Truth Social account depicting her and her husband as apes.\n\nThe racist depiction of the nation’s first Black president was immediately condemned by politicians on both sides of the aisle, forcing the White House to offer a defense, then walk it back entirely and delete the post.\n\nRepublicans on the Hill were clearly uncomfortable with the video and called its posting a mistake. Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate’s only Black Republican, called it racist.\n\nThe former president responded on a podcast, stating that “it's important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling.\n\nTrump has blamed the post on a staffer who has access his Truth Social account, Natalie Harp, whom he said did not watch the video fully before posting it to his account.\n\nIn a statement to reporters on Air Force One, Trump claimed to have watched part of the video and sent it to his team for review and a possible post on his account. He denied seeing the part of the video where the former president and former first lady appeared.\n\n“I gave it to the people, generally they’d look at the whole thing but I guess somebody didn’t and they posted it. And then we deleted it,” said Trump.\n\nThis isn’t the first time he’s taken content or advice directly from Loomer, either.\n\nThe far-right activist found herself with new access to the Oval Office in 2025 as Trump returned to the White House and used it to direct a purge of figures tied to Michael Waltz, then-Trump’s national security adviser, for supposed disloyalty.\n\nLoomer has also supported a loyalty-driven purge of officials across other parts of the government, with one notable victim being the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. His daughter, Maurene, was fired from the Department of Justice in July.\n\nThrough her constant, vitriolic attacks on Democrats, Loomer has faced her own accusations of racism, including in the fall of 2025, when she was widely condemned for hurling a racist slur at Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, whom she called a “ghetto Black B****.”",

    "description": "\"The body is metabolizing its own muscle tissue for energy,\" Prokopenko said.",
    "fullText": "Four years after Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s economy has entered a “death zone,” said Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nIn a recent Economist op-ed, the former Russian central bank adviser drew on a term from mountain climbing when high altitude forces the body to consume itself faster than it can repair itself.\n\nWhat is Russia's economic 'death zone'?\n\nWhat signs indicate Russia may face economic crisis?\n\nHow has the war impacted Russia's economic structure?\n\nWhy can't monetary policy fix Russia's economic problems?\n\n“Russia’s economy is stuck in what might be described as negative equilibrium: holding itself together while steadily destroying its own future capacity,” she wrote.\n\nThe economy isn’t headed for an imminent crash, but GDP has stagnated, oil revenue has been halved amid Western sanctions, and the government’s budget deficit is rapidly draining reserves.\n\nAt the same time, two economic systems have emerged. One is comprised of the military and related industries that receive priority from the Kremlin. And then there’s everything else that’s been “left in the cold,” Prokopenko explained.\n\n“The most dangerous feature of this new structure is the fuel it burns,” she added. “Russia’s economy now runs on what might be called ‘military rent’: budget transfers to defense enterprises that generate wages and economic activity.”\n\nBut the transfers are aimed at assets designed for destruction, Prokopenko pointed out. In other words, the money that keeps Russia’s factories humming pays for tanks, armored vehicles and other weapons that eventually get destroyed or damaged, making them useless for future economic growth.\n\nSimilarly, money spent to attract fresh recruits to Russia’s army doesn’t retrain them to become more productive. Instead, many die or return home permanently wounded. The Center for Strategic and International Studies has estimated Russian military casualties at 1.2 million, including 325,000 killed.\n\n“The body is metabolizing its own muscle tissue for energy,” Prokopenko said.\n\nWhile the central bank has cut interest rates to prop up growth and the Kremlin has taken steps to rein in the budget deficit, Russia’s economic predicament can’t be fixed with monetary or fiscal policies, she wrote.\n\nIn fact, interest payments on government debt this year are already set to exceed spending on education and health care combined.\n\nUnlike a cyclical downturn such as a recession, Prokopenko argued that what Russia is suffering from is more akin to altitude sickness—”the longer you stay, the worse it gets, regardless of rest.”",

    "fullText": "It has been exactly three weeks since Nancy Guthrie was reported missing. Law enforcement continues to pursue thousands of leads in the search for the 84-year-old Tucson, Arizona resident, who is presumed kidnapped.\n\nAuthorities have struggled to come up with a motive for someone abducting Guthrie. Now, a former FBI agent has shared his own possible theory on what motivated the suspected perpetrator.\n\nJonny Grusing, a 25-year veteran of the FBI's Denver Division, spoke with Fox News Digital this weekend regarding Guthrie's case.\n\nGoing off public information only, the longtime investigator and published author hypothesized that an unknown \"personal grievance\" may be the explanation for the kidnapping of Today co-host Savannah Guthrie's mother.\n\n\"It's hard to be an expert in human behavior because it's so unique to that person,\" said Grusing.\n\n\"You know, I'm just trying to use the experiences of different cases and trying to apply any sort of logic to this in the hopes that someone from the public who has thought it might be someone they know whether it's his family or whether now it's a coworker or friend or associate or whatever, to put that one puzzle piece together that says, 'Yes, and now I think it could be him.'\"\n\nGrusing cited a number of factors, including the actions of the subject in the surveillance video released by the FBI earlier this month.\n\n\"The first thing he does is with his glove, and with his glove, it doesn't look like he's trying to take [the camera] off,\" Grusing said. \"It looks like he's trying to cover it with his right hand.And then he looks down, he looks around, and he gets the branches, and he puts the branches up in front of it.\"\n\n\"Is there a chance, since we don't have audio, that he is either knocking on the door loudly or that he has pressed the ring doorbell, [that] he's trying to get Nancy to answer the door, and he's shielding himself from being seen as a masked person, so she will, in her confusion, open the door?\" Grusing continued.\n\nIf this is the case, Grusing said the situation would not fit the home robbery gone wrong theory, since the suspect seemingly wanted to lure Nancy Guthrie onto the porch for a confrontation.\n\nGrusing also said kidnapping for ransom seems unlikely since none of the ransom notes were sent directly to the Guthrie family.\n\nOn Saturday, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos issued an update on DNA found in Nancy's home, calling it \"mixed,\" meaning there is material from more than one individual.\n\nThis makes DNA testing more difficult when entering the findings through national databases.\n\n“Our lab tells us that there’s challenges with it,” Nanos said before reiterating that \"we're not quitting\" and his department remains steadfast in locating Nancy, who was last seen on Jan. 31.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's executive arm requested “full clarity” from the United States and asked its trade partner to fulfill its commitments after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down some of President Donald Trump’s most sweeping tariffs.\n\nTrump has lashed out at the court decision and said Saturday that he wants a global tariff of 15%, up from the 10% he announced a day earlier.\n\nThe European Commission said the current situation is not conducive to delivering \"fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial” trans-Atlantic trade and investment, as agreed to by both sides and spelled out in the EU-U.S. Joint Statement of August 2025.\n\nAmerican and EU officials sealed a trade deal last year that imposes a 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the United States. The European Commission handles trade for the 27 EU member countries.\n\nA top EU lawmaker said on Sunday he will propose to the European Parliament negotiating team to put the ratifying process of the deal on pause.\n\n“Pure tariff chaos on the part of the U.S. administration,” Bernd Lange, the chair of Parliament’s international trade committee, wrote on social media. “No one can make sense of it anymore — only open questions and growing uncertainty for the EU and other U.S. trading partners.”\n\nThe value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.\n\n“A deal is a deal,” the European Commission said. “As the United States’ largest trading partner, the EU expects the U.S. to honor its commitments set out in the Joint Statement — just as the EU stands by its commitments. EU products must continue to benefit from the most competitive treatment, with no increases in tariffs beyond the clear and all-inclusive ceiling previously agreed.\"\n\nHe said he talked to his European counterpart this weekend and hasn’t heard anyone tell him the deal is off.\n\n“The deals were not premised on whether or not the emergency tariff litigation would rise or fall,” Greer said. “I haven’t heard anyone yet come to me and say the deal’s off. They want to see how this plays out.”\n\nEurope’s biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits. Among the biggest U.S. exports to the bloc are professional and scientific services like payment systems and cloud infrastructure, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, aerospace products and cars.\n\n“When applied unpredictably, tariffs are inherently disruptive, undermining confidence and stability across global markets and creating further uncertainty across international supply chains,” the commission added.\n\nAs primarily a trading bloc, the EU has a powerful tool at its disposal to retaliate — the bloc’s Anti-Coercion Instrument. It includes a raft of measures for blocking or restricting trade and investment from countries found to be putting undue pressure on EU member nations or corporations.\n\nThe measures could include curtailing the export and import of goods and services, barring countries or companies from EU public tenders, or limiting foreign direct investment. In its most severe form, it would essentially close off access to the EU’s 450-million customer market and inflict billions of dollars of losses on U.S. companies and the American economy.",

    "description": "Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau described Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera as \"one of the bloodiest and most ruthless drug kingpins.\"",
    "fullText": "After spending years evading authorities worldwide, a powerful Mexican cartel leader was killed during a military operation, Mexican officials announced on Sunday, Feb. 22.\n\nNemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, commonly known as \"El Mencho,\" rose through the ranks and launched a deadly coup to become the leader of the Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG). The criminal enterprise rapidly grew into a continent-spanning empire that rivaled its former allies in the Sinaloa Cartel, run by kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who is serving life in prison.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. Department of State offered a $15 million reward for information leading to Oseguera's arrest and/or conviction. After reports of his death surfaced, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau described \"El Mencho\" in a social media post as \"one of the bloodiest and most ruthless drug kingpins.\"\n\nHere's what to know about the Mexican drug lord:\n\nHe was born Rubén Oseguera Cervantes on July 17, 1966, in the small farming city of Aguililla in the western state of Michoacán, according to The Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network. He later adopted the name Nemesio, some say to honor his godfather. It was shortened to \"El Mencho\" and has no other known meaning.\n\nA powerful drug kingpin with 5,000 members spread across every continent except Antarctica, Oseguera's brutal cartel is blamed for kidnappings, torture, murders, cannibalism, and the spread of fentanyl — which surpassed heroin as America’s deadliest illicit drug.\n\n\"More recently, CJNG operatives, allegedly under Oseguera Cervantes’ direction, were involved in assassination attempts of Mexican government officials,\" the State Department said in December 2024.\n\nTargeting 'The Last Frontier': Mexican cartels send drugs into Alaska, upping death toll\n\nUnlike some cartel leaders who inherited leadership positions from family dynasties, his parents were farm workers who carved out a living in Aguililla, a city of fewer than 20,000 people in Michoacán, known as the world's avocado capital. Oseguera dropped out of school after the sixth grade to pick avocados.\n\n\"El Mencho\" eventually made his way to Tijuana, the prominent border town for American tourists and feuding Mexican cartels. There, he grew his drug-smuggling business in San Diego. Court and prison records show he has entered the United States at least three times and was repeatedly deported.\n\nAfter being ordered to leave the area by another organization, \"El Mencho\" joined the police force in Tomatlán, a small city south of Puerto Vallarta in the western state of Jalisco.\n\nEventually, Oseguera returned to his native Michoacán, where he joined the Milenio Cartel, an entrenched criminal organization operating since at least the early 1990s. Milenio eventually tapped \"El Mencho,\" a skilled sicario — or assassin — to lead one of its cells in Guadalajara as a cartel lieutenant.\n\nAs Oseguera rose through the ranks of Milenio, he expected to be rewarded with the top position. But when some of the cartel’s leaders were arrested or killed in 2008 and 2009, \"El Mencho\" wasn't promoted.\n\nIncensed, Oseguera plotted revenge in 2009 and 2010 with others who were unhappy with Milenio’s new leadership and spearheaded a deadly coup. He emerged victorious in early 2011, and his new cartel was christened the Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación.\n\nOseguera controlled several key drug trafficking routes and hubs in Mexico and gave orders to the \"capo,\" or plaza boss, similar to a mafia lieutenant.\n\nHis cartel dominates much of Guadalajara and controls the outskirts of Jalisco, as well as other states such as Colima and Michoacán. CJNG has spread to most of Mexico's 32 states, with an increasing presence in Tijuana and Mexico City.\n\nAs the boss, \"El Mencho\" set the piso, or tax, that business owners and independent drug traffickers had to pay the capos for protection. Oseguera also assumed control of corrupt police officers and politicians.\n\n\"El Mencho's Jalisco New Generation Cartel was one of the biggest buyers of politicians and political campaigns, which has given it an enormous social base,\" Edgardo Buscaglia, an organized crime expert at Columbia University, told Reuters.\n\nOseguera was the lead defendant in a federal indictment returned in the District of Columbia in 2017, accusing him of leading a continuing criminal enterprise. He was also charged with conspiring to send large amounts of drugs into the United States and using firearms during these drug trafficking crimes.\n\nOseguera also faced meth trafficking charges from a 2013 federal indictment in Gulfport, Mississippi.\n\n'That level of violence is terrifying': Mexican cartel targets tranquil Puget Sound city\n\nDespite a $15 million bounty, Oseguera stayed on the move for years and dodged manhunts that began within a year of his rise to power in 2011. He was rarely seen, staying in remote compounds that made it harder for police to breach, and didn't do drugs or drink alcohol to avoid slip-ups, the Courier Journal reported in 2019.\n\nU.S. drug agents and Mexican authorities teamed to root out El Mencho’s hiding spots at least three times. Police raided his secret compounds in 2012 and 2018, but he escaped, the newspaper reported.\n\nAccording to the Courier Journal, the Mexican military also learned Oseguera's hiding spot and headed to get him in two military helicopters in May 2015. But his men shot down one of the helicopters with a Russian-made rocket-propelled grenade launcher.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 'El Mencho' killed in Jalisco, Mexico.

    "description": "After the intentions of Trump's administration on environmental regulations, Christie Brinkley wasted no time in raising her voice.",
    "fullText": "There is no love lost between Christie Brinkley and President Donald Trump, and she is not even subtle about it.\n\nAfter the intentions of Trump's administration on environmental regulations relating to coal and mercury emissions made headlines, the author wasted no time in raising her voice, assigning the blame, and highlighting the negative impacts to ensue.\n\nOne thing Christie Brinkley will not do is watch in silence. She previously expressed her concerns about the issues with the environment when Donald Trump won the presidential elections in 2024.\n\nBrinkley seems distraught about the Trump administration's decision to ease pollution standards for limits on mercury from coal plants, and she has shared a piece of her mind. The author took to social media, writing that this environmental update is set to destroy lives.\n\nShe noted the pressing side effects that will occur, affecting the fragile population, on her Instagram Stories. \"Mercury causes deformities in babies and developmental disorders of the brain!\" she penned over a screenshot of the headline from Interval News.\n\nIn another slide, still on her stories update, she shared a quote which read \"'I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT TO DO TO THEM. I'M ALLOWED TO DESTROY THE COUNTRY.' -Donald Trump 2/20/26.\" To this, she added a footnote praising him for keeping up to the words in the quote.\n\n\"And I must say he is doing a good job of destroying the country,\" the model shared after stating that the regulations not only put babies at risk, but they target adults too, affecting their nervous systems and ultimately causing organ damage. Brinkley claims Trump's decision is at the expense of the citizens and stems from greed.\n\nWhile the Trump administration views rolling back the clean air regulations from an economic standpoint, public health groups and environmental agencies warn that the health of the masses will bear the brunt.\n\nThe announcement was made on Friday, February 20, 2026, stating that it will roll back clean air regulations limiting mercury and hazardous toxins from power plants. They shared that it will boost baseload energy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Environmental Protection Agency explained that easing the pollution standards would alleviate costs for utilities that run older coal plants.\n\nThe effectiveness of this move shines at a time when demand for power is massively increasing, with the expansion of data centers used for artificial intelligence.\n\nBrinkley particularly noted earlier that the administration has set out to undo the environmental protection regulations put in place by Joe Biden's administration. The Swimsuit model added that the effects on the climate and health will surely take a devastating turn as a result.\n\nThe Daily Mail shared that Brinkley wrote on social media, telling her followers that natural disasters and diseases will all intensify if the state of the planet is not placed at the top of a Scale of preference over profits for a handful of greedy corporations.\n\nShe acknowledged that while the effects of climate change are already being felt, working together in prioritizing the environment will go a long way to slow down or ultimately stop the blistering negative effects.\n\nBrinkley called for support from her online community, stating that nature does not have respect for race or skin color, as no one will survive without a healthy biodiverse environment.\n\nThe actress also admitted that the changes will not only affect the current population but also future generations as well. \"For the sake and well-being of our children, action is mandated,\" her words echoed.\n\nBig stars in the music industry like Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish endorsed Trump's opponent, Kamala Harris, during the 2024 presidential elections. After it was announced that Trump won, Eilish called his victory a \"war on women,\" seemingly referring to his take on female reproductive rights.\n\nQueen of Pop, Madonna, also expressed her views on the outcome of the election, uploading a photo on Instagram showing a cake with the words \"F-ck Trump,\" adding that she stuffed her face with it after the results were announced.\n\nMadonna also shared that she was \"trying to get her head around why a convicted felon, rapist, and bigot was chosen to lead the country because he's good for the economy?\"\n\nCardi B, along with other celebrities such as Christina Applegate and Lili Reinhart, also slammed his election win. The president also faced heat from the media as many voiced out their disappointment with the election results.\n\nBesides Brinkley's concerns with climate change and environmental regulations, she previously spoke out against Donald Trump, claiming that he had flirted with her when he was married to his first wife, Ivanna.\n\nBrinkley is all about effecting change in the environment and saving Mother Earth from devastating ruin. Still, an aspect of her life saw a painful nosedive, and it was not triggered by environmental destruction.\n\nIn her memoir \"Uptown Girl,\" released last year, she recounts the pain she went through when she discovered her fourth marriage had hit the rocks. She detailed how she discovered her ex-husband, Peter Cook, had cheated on her leading to the end of their eight-year marriage.\n\nThe Blast reported that she described the relationship as the \"most tortured relationship\" she ever had. It was revealed to her that her then-husband was having an affair with a teenage girl.\n\nUpon searching their family computer, she further discovered some incriminating proof and adult content, as well as several explicit photos. The shock she felt was overwhelming when her eyes were met with the truth, and she ultimately decided the union could not continue.\n\nWill Christie Brinkley's voice cause a positive turnaround for the environment?",

    "description": "When Lisa Lucas and her husband told their kids about the plan to travel, the youngest daughter cried. They promised it would only be a year.",
    "fullText": "We were racing to keep up with our packed family schedule. Days blurred into school, work, gymnastics, birthdays, and dinner parties — energizing in theory, exhausting in reality. We were scraping by.\n\nI remember peak multitasking: listening to my 6-year-old read aloud while making breakfast, and trying to finish putting on eyeliner while the eggs finished cooking in the pan.\n\nMy husband and I longed for wide-open days to actually connect, but school holidays were never long enough to decompress. We could see how easily the years might slip by, buried in logistics, until suddenly the kids were packing for college.\n\nWe wanted to freeze time. So we hatched a plan to leave our \"normal\" life for a year and have a wild adventure together as a family.\n\nIn July 2024, we rented out our London home, stored our belongings, and took the bus to Heathrow with two backpacks and a carry-on.\n\nWe weren't wandering aimlessly. We planned to live in three locations, traveling for five weeks before and after each stop.\n\nI pivoted my marketing consultancy toward travel writing and speaking, while my husband's academic research guided our shortlist of places we wanted to live. His research enabled legal residency which allowed the girls to attend school. We chose Japan, the US, and the Netherlands, staying three to four months in each.\n\nWe picked Tsukuba, Japan, to immerse ourselves in a completely unfamiliar culture; Great Neck, New York, near where we're both from, to give our daughters a taste of American life and spend rare time with family; and Leiden, the Netherlands, to experience its bike- and water-centered lifestyle.\n\nResidency came with a lot of admin.\n\nFor Japan, we had originally planned to homeschool. Our 8-year-old surprised us by asking to attend a local Japanese school, despite only knowing a few phrases she had picked up during the three weeks we spent traveling around the country.\n\nThe school welcomed both girls. Like their classmates, they walked to school alone, changed into indoor shoes, helped serve lunch, and cleaned the classrooms.\n\nIn New York, we lived with family outside the city. The girls rode a yellow school bus for the first time, while my husband commuted by train. It was a stark contrast to London — no uniforms, more complicated mornings, and the sobering reality of active-shooter drills.\n\nIn Leiden, the girls attended a small international school. Students biked along canals and tended their own garden plots as part of a Dutch gardening program.\n\nLiving out of backpacks forced minimalism. I loved escaping the endless to-do list of home life and focusing on actually living.\n\nI wore a single black maxi dress almost every day in Asia — biking through alleys or hiking through the jungle — and it somehow worked.\n\nIf anything, I'd bring even less next time. With fewer possessions, our mental bandwidth expanded. We could focus on fun, without guilt.\n\nWhen we first told the girls about our plan, our youngest cried. They loved their friends, their teachers, and the rhythm of school. They couldn't imagine leaving and not coming back. We tried tempting them with volcanoes and snorkeling in Indonesia.\n\nThey came around, somewhat. They loved most moments, but they also always wanted to go home. We promised it would only be a year.\n\nOur priority was making them feel safe and secure. We talked about adaptability as a life skill, but we also held them close and reminded them they were loved.\n\nMost days, we'd say, \"We're still on the trip,\" and it made us feel like a team. The girls learned how to be the new kid, make friends, and settle into unfamiliar rhythms. They learned you can reinvent your life more than once.\n\nThe intensity bonded us. We had waterfalls to ourselves, watched wild snow monkeys, and made friends who invited us to visit them in Cozumel. I celebrated my usually grim January birthday on a Thai beach.\n\nIn the US, we were present for heavy family moments, including my grandfather's passing.\n\nReturning to London after 13 months felt surreal. Our 6-turned-7-year-old kissed the ground at Heathrow.\n\nThe trip changed us. It gave us shared memories — Hokkaido cream, a road trip from New York to Miami, sunsets from an Alpine hut — but more importantly, it clarified what matters: slow time together, not renovations or packed calendars.\n\nWe're happy to be home, blender included. But we're already dreaming about our next extended adventure.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share? Get in touch with the editor: akarplus@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "An AI product manager who worked at a Chinese tech giant explains what makes Chinese AI different from the West.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yilin Zhang, an AI product manager at AI startup Kuse who worked at Meituan for more than three years. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.\n\nI graduated from Tsinghua University with a master's degree in computer science in 2021 and then joined Meituan — one of China's biggest tech firms — as a product manager.\n\nAt Meituan, China's platform for local services, especially known for food delivery, I worked on two AI projects. One was a consumer-facing AI assistant that helps users complete various tasks, including ordering food. The other was a merchant-facing AI agent designed to help businesses manage their daily operations, including handling reservations, managing orders, and supporting routine operational tasks.\n\nThe main difference between how products are built in China and in the US comes down to the market.\n\nAcross most large Chinese tech companies, AI product development accelerated more aggressively around 2025.\n\nThe AI initiatives I worked on at Meituan started around April or May of that year. It coincided with the surge of interest around DeepSeek, when attention around AI agents took off.\n\nLarge companies began racing to build AI projects, and almost every business unit launched its AI initiative.\n\nFor a long time, especially before 2021 or 2022, Chinese tech companies were primarily focused on domestic competition rather than overseas expansion. Because competition in China is intense, tech companies were forced to become extremely efficient. Their execution methods have been sharpened to an almost frightening degree.\n\nConstraints have also pushed Chinese AI companies to pursue different paths, with a strong focus on open-source models and cost efficiency. These limitations forced exploration in new directions, and those paths have proven valuable in their own way.\n\nDeepSeek is a good example. Because of international restrictions, it couldn't access large numbers of GPUs and was forced to innovate around efficiency instead.\n\nChinese and overseas markets are fundamentally different, leading to distinct user bases, expectations, and product designs.\n\nChinese users have a much lower willingness to pay for software; hence, many mass-market AI products, such as Doubao, tend to be free. The core objective is often to scale active usage.\n\nMany capabilities are packaged into a single prompt you can ask, essentially a chatbox interface with a low barrier to entry.\n\nInternational AI products target users doing high-value tasks. They are more often designed for desktops than for mobile devices, with interfaces better suited to work contexts. These products explore how AI and humans can collaborate and intersect across different work scenarios, helping users complete tasks more effectively and efficiently.\n\nIn China, that user group is relatively small. That makes it harder for its mainstream AI products to move beyond chat-based forms into more advanced products.\n\nChina's internet success over the past decade has also largely come from consumer-facing apps. That environment forces product managers to obsess over user feedback and relentlessly polish even the smallest features.\n\nTeams may spend enormous effort refining a tiny feature just to win over a small group of users. In markets with less competition, that level of detail isn't always necessary.\n\nAfter three to four years at Meituan, I felt I had learned most of what I could from that environment. I left to join the AI startup Kuse in October.\n\nAI is evolving extremely fast. In large companies, iteration speed can be slower. Many of my friends across different Big Tech companies share this same frustration. Smaller, more agile companies can adapt faster.\n\nIn the past, top graduates had basically two paths: becoming a civil servant or joining a Big Tech company.\n\nThat's changing. Especially over the past year, many AI startups have emerged, and more young people are choosing entrepreneurship. AI has created a new path outside Big Tech.\n\nDo you have a story to share about working in a Chinese tech company? Contact this reporter at cmlee@insider.com.",

    "title": "We wanted to get away from the cold, so we left Michigan and retired in Panama. We're not planning to move back.",
    "description": "Greg Kitzmiller was researching places to live with his wife and found out that Panama had a special visa for retirees.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Greg Kitzmiller, a 64-year-old American retiree living in Panama. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born and raised in Michigan, where I met my wife, Jen, and where we built our life together.\n\nIn 2016, I retired from my job as a manufacturing supervisor. My wife retired from her law career over a year later.\n\nThe year before she retired, my main goal was to find a place where we could live the best life during our retirement. I did a lot of research on various countries, and Panama kept coming to the top of the list.\n\nWe were eager to escape the snow, so my first priority was eternal summer. We also wanted to stay close to the US to make traveling back easy. The fact that Panama uses the US dollar only added to its appeal.\n\nWe hadn't spent our whole lives planning to retire abroad, but after watching HGTV shows, we both thought that this was something we could do.\n\nPanama also offers a special Pensionado visa for retirees, which comes with incentives such as discounts on utility bills, medication, and even transportation.\n\nBefore making the move, we took a few exploratory trips to Panama. Our first trip was a weeklong in October 2017. After my wife retired, we came back in February 2018 for a nine-week trip, touring different areas to see if it felt like the right fit.\n\nDuring that trip, the weather was beautiful. When we went home to Michigan and saw the snow on our driveway, my wife turned and said to me, \"We're moving, right?\" And I said, \"Yeah, we are.\"\n\nWe sold our house quickly. We held a few garage sales, donated what we didn't need, and fit our lives into five suitcases. In June 2018, we officially moved to Panama.\n\nWe have two daughters in Texas and one in Alabama. We're no further from them now than we were in Michigan. Moreover, the world has gotten so small. We can get on a video call with the kids and the grandkids anytime.\n\nWith the help of a real-estate agent, we bought our two-bedroom condo for $210,000 in Coronado, which is about an hour and a half from Panama City by car.\n\nOur condo is in a country club community, where the golf course wraps around our building, and we have 180-degree views of the ocean and the mountains.\n\nEven though I've joined several Facebook groups, it's the people we met at church that make up the core of our social circle.\n\nWhen we started talking about moving here, one of Jen's friends at work said, \"Well, you should write a blog.\"\n\nIt wasn't that easy, since I'm not very tech-savvy, but I did it. I still maintain the blog and publish a newsletter. And, right after we got here, I connected with a writer's group.\n\nBeing a part of that group led me to do a lot of things in my retirement that I never thought I would do.\n\nI published my first book in 2020 about our experience of retiring in Panama. Since then, I've started writing in different ways, including a detective fiction series — I'm working on the fourth installment.\n\nWriting wasn't something I expected to do in my retirement, but there's a strong community of artists, authors, and musicians here. When you surround yourself with other people who are talented in those ways, it fosters your own talent.\n\nOur health is better, too. It helps that there is always an abundance of fresh fruit and vegetables around.\n\nIf I had it to do over, I would've learned Spanish when I was young. When you're in your 60s, it's hard to learn a new language. I almost always understand what's being said, but don't verbalize very well, unlike my wife, who is fluent.\n\nEvery day's a little different. We have a few social groups, including one where we play dominoes every week. We rotate between houses, someone makes lunch, and we spend the afternoon playing.\n\nInitially, we figured we'd come for 10 years and then evaluate if we wanted to stay. It's only been eight years, but we've already decided that this is where we want to be.\n\nWe're not planning to move back to the US. There's honestly not much we miss.\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city? Contact this reporter at agoh@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Mikaela Shiffrin, 30, may be a three-time Olympic gold medalist, but there was a time when just hearing the name of the Games felt overwhelming.\n\nOn Friday's episode of \"Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce,\" Shiffrin said getting ready for one of the biggest competitions in sports took years of work, much of it away from cameras and crowds.\n\n\"My Olympic experiences have been so wildly different. Now it's four, and I'm really aware, right now, of all of the work that's gone into — actually, not the medal — but the work that's gone into showing up on race day, and being able to show up with the mentality and the skiing that I wanted to do,\" Shiffrin told podcast host Kylie Kelce.\n\nThe grind continued even away from the slopes, she said, especially when it came to managing the pressure that comes with the Games.\n\n\"Even this summertime, the amount of conversations I had with my psychologist talking about all the different feelings surrounding the Olympics, and like desensitizing to the word, and imagining the vibe, imagining the colors,\" Shiffrin said.\n\nShe added that she even visited Paris two summers ago to get a feel for the Olympic atmosphere and \"desensitize\" herself to it.\n\nNot only that, Shiffrin has structured her life around staying physically and mentally ready at all times.\n\n\"There's just so much life outside of the sport, but we do so much of our life, you know, it's all geared towards the sport,\" Shiffrin said, adding that she hasn't had alcohol in two years because it tends to make her sick.\n\n\"And I'm like, I can't afford to be sick, literally ever. So, we're just going to not have any alcohol. Like, we're going to drink electrolytes, man,\" Shiffrin said.\n\nIt still throws her off that something she's trained for over years can be decided in seconds.\n\n\"But you spend so much time doing all of this work and training for something, and then the moment it happens is, you know, 47 seconds, or like in the blink of an eye, and it's just really weird,\" she said.\n\nShiffrin is widely considered the greatest alpine ski racer of all time, with 108 World Cup wins. She made her Olympic debut at the 2014 Sochi Games at age 18, winning her first Olympic gold in slalom and becoming the youngest athlete in history to do so.\n\nOn Wednesday, nearly a decade later, she earned another gold medal in slalom — her first Olympic victory since 2018.\n\nThis isn't the first time Shiffrin has spoken about the steps she takes to stay focused.\n\nSpeaking to WDSU News on Friday, she said she deliberately avoided social media in the lead-up to her races at the Winter Olympics.\n\n\"If I was scrolling my feed or something, I just knew I was going to come across things that would get into my brain that would be not at all conducive to the experience that my team and I came for,\" Shiffrin said.\n\nOn Saturday, she told NBC Sports that she chose not to \"set expectations\" for herself heading into the Milan Cortina Games — a mindset she said ultimately helped her ski her best.\n\n\"On race day, I felt like I skied my best skiing, and that was really my goal,\" she said.",

    "title": "The 'Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' finale just blew up Dunk and Egg's biggest secrets",
    "description": "The season 1 finale of \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" implies that Dunk may not be a knight, and that Egg has been lying. Both are changes from the book.",
    "fullText": "Spoilers ahead for \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" season one, episode six, \"The Morrow,\" and the book \"The World of Ice & Fire.\"\n\nHBO's \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" stuck the landing on Sunday after a highly praised first season.\n\nThe prequel show, which was meticulously adapted from George R. R. Martin's \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" series, managed to toe the line between faithfully bringing Martin's characters to the screen and adding a few new twists.\n\nThat was especially true of the season one finale, \"The Morrow,\" which features several key scenes that don't exist in Martin's original novella \"The Hedge Knight\" — two of which have major implications for the show's plucky duo and their many adventures to come.\n\n\"The Morrow\" includes a flashback to Dunk's recent past, when he was a squire for Ser Arlan of Pennytree.\n\nAs Arlan is propped against a tree, pale and babbling and apparently dying, Dunk asks, \"Why did you never knight me? Did you think I'd leave you? I wouldn't have. Or was it something else?\" He doesn't get an answer.\n\nThe scene is filmed in the same place as the season opener — on the hillside where Dunk buries Arlan's body.\n\nBook readers have long suspected that Dunk is lying about his knighthood. He tells people that Arlan knighted him just before he died, with \"only a robin, up in a thorn tree\" to bear witness. When Dunk tries to enter the jousting tournament at Ashford Meadow, he's told to find a lord or another knight to vouch for him, but no one can verify his claim. Hardly anyone even remembers that Arlan existed.\n\nPrivately, Dunk struggles with his identity and how he presents himself to the world. In \"The Hedge Knight,\" after it's revealed that Egg is a Targaryen prince in disguise, Dunk is shocked and embarrassed for having been deceived, but he also feels a twinge of compassion and solidarity: \"He knew what it was like to want something so badly that you would tell a monstrous lie just to get near it.\"\n\n\"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" showrunner Ira Parker told Business Insider that he wanted the scene to be up for interpretation.\n\n\"A lot of the exposition around whether or not Dunk was knighted is internal thoughts in his head. And we get pretty, pretty close to him coming out and just saying it. It's just like, what else could he be thinking of? What else could he mean by this?\" Parker explained. \"But it's not said in black and white.\"\n\nThroughout season one, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" drops subtle hints that Dunk was only ever a squire — that he's lying to give himself a fighting chance at a better future. When he meets Egg in the premiere, the boy tells him plainly, \"You don't look to be a knight.\" In episode four, Dunk hesitates when Raymun Fossoway asks to be knighted so he can fight in Dunk's Trial of Seven.\n\n\"Go on, Ser Duncan,\" Lyonel Baratheon urges. \"Any knight can make a knight.\"\n\nStill, Dunk doesn't draw his sword to fulfill the request. Is that because he doesn't want his friend to die in a dangerous trial by combat? Or because he doesn't know the words to recite if he never heard them himself? (\"In the name of the warrior, I charge you to be brave. In the name of the father, I charge you to be just,\" etc.) It's also possible that Dunk doesn't want to risk Raymun's honor with a knighting ceremony by a fake knight.\n\nDuring his loaded pause, Lyonel gives Dunk a searching look, but these questions remain unasked.\n\nParker said he made sure to preserve the ambiguity surrounding Dunk's knighthood, which is \"100% the way George would like it.\"\n\nIn the finale's flashback scene, just when it seems like Arlan is gone forever, he startles awake. We never actually watch the old man die, so it's still possible that he knighted Dunk offscreen.\n\n\"It is just as wide open as it ever was,\" Parker said. \"So that was very important to maintain, but also — it's just fun. And I know fans of the book are going to be thinking about that question, so we're just trying to enjoy ourselves as much as possible with it. And it's a little bit of a tease.\"\n\nThe irony, of course, is that Dunk is a truer knight than most, even if he never took the sacred vows. He's brave and just, and he risks his own life to protect the innocent — quite unlike the dishonesty and bloodthirst of his Trial of Seven opponents. These characters ask us to consider what real honor looks like in a place like Westeros, and to question the substance of titles like \"ser,\" \"lord,\" and even \"prince.\"\n\nAfter the Trial of Seven is over, Egg's father, Maekar, asks Dunk to pledge himself to House Targaryen and return with their family to Summerhall. He says that Egg has grown fond of Dunk and wishes to serve as his squire.\n\nDunk offers instead to bring Egg on his travels. He believes that growing up among smallfolk rather than servants will help Egg learn compassion and humility.\n\nNaturally, Maekar says no. He's not about to let his youngest son, the latest in a long line of royal Aegons, wander around Westeros with only a hedge knight to protect him. \"Princes are not made for sleeping in ditches and eating hard salt beef,\" he tells Dunk in the book.\n\nDunk counters that Egg's older brothers, who are known as Daeron the Drunken and Aerion the Monstrous, never slept beneath the stars or ate less-than-perfect food. Maekar leaves without saying another word.\n\nThen, as Dunk is readying his horses to leave Ashford, Egg suddenly reappears.\n\n\"My lord father says I am to serve you,\" Egg says, and they ride off together, heading south toward Dorne.\n\nWhy and when does Maekar have a change of heart? In the book, it remains a mystery, but the show offers a plainer explanation: He didn't.\n\nThe final scene of the episode shows Maekar riding away from Ashford with the rest of the Targaryens. When he realizes Egg is nowhere to be seen, he begins panicking and shouting for his son.\n\nParker said he created the scene because it makes sense for the character of Egg. \"[The story] started by him sneaking off and getting into trouble. And of course, he just goes and he does the same thing, because we all make the same mistakes over and over and over again, and then we die.\"\n\nAs for Maekar, the added scene reflects his stubbornness as a father and his pride as a Targaryen.\n\n\"He's just a curmudgeon, and probably a shitty father, but I actually do think he really does love his children. I do think he cares about them, even though he's not able to raise them well, he still wants to,\" Parker said of Maekar. \"The idea of letting Egg go off with someone else just felt like too much for me. It felt like he could reasonably say no in this moment, even though he knows it would be better for Egg.\"\n\nAlthough the show's version of events doesn't directly contradict the book, it does add a troubling wrinkle to Egg's family lore. Maekar eventually becomes king of Westeros, and he may not take kindly to Dunk's absconding with his heir. He may even misinterpret the event as a treasonous kidnapping.\n\n\"We'll never be in Maekar's POV, but this will rear its head at some point,\" Parker hinted for future seasons. \"Many ways were discussed about how to deal with this. Hopefully, people like the way we've chosen.\"\n\nThe second season of \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\" adapted from Martin's \"The Sworn Sword,\" is slated for a 2027 release.",

    "description": "Tariffs have already added roughly 0.7% to core inflation through January.",
    "fullText": "Don't expect prices at the store to fall just because the Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nAt best, companies may slow the pace of future price hikes on goods that get tariff relief. But they're unlikely to cut prices outright, economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note published Sunday.\n\n\"We would not expect companies to lower prices in response to tariff reductions nearly as quickly as they increased them in response to tariff increases,\" the economists wrote.\n\nThe bank estimates tariff passthrough has already lifted core Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, by about 0.7% through January. It expects only an additional 0.1% increase over the rest of 2026.\n\nFriday's 6-3 Supreme Court ruling scrapped tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The White House quickly announced a 10% Section 122 tariff and then raised it to 15% the next day.\n\nThe shift would bring the increase in the effective tariff rate since the start of 2025 down from just over 10 percentage points to about 9 percentage points, Goldman estimates, leaving its inflation outlook little changed.\n\nOn economic growth, Goldman said imports from countries that see meaningful tariff reductions, particularly China, should rebound in the coming months.\n\nBut that likely won't give the economy much of a lift. Any rebound in imports from China would be offset by companies restocking shelves after earlier frontloading, trade reshuffling, and small declines in imports from higher-tariff countries.\n\nGoldman estimates first-quarter 2026 GDP growth at 3.4%, though that includes a temporary boost from the end of the 2025 government shutdown. It continues to forecast 2.5% growth by the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nFriday's ruling also sets up a fight over roughly $180 billion in tariffs already collected.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday it was \"unlikely\" Americans would ever see refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said during a speech before the Economic Club of Dallas, adding that the administration has other tools to reimpose tariffs and that sorting out any repayment could take years.",

    "description": "While Shield AI is looking into weapons for the V-BAT, the world's best militaries already have a slew of other strike options, Brandon Tseng told BI.",
    "fullText": "Brandon Tseng, Shield AI's cofounder, said there's a common misconception about his company's signature software-powered drone: People say it needs to be armed.\n\nThe more experienced militaries who work with Shield AI, however, know they don't need that capability in modern war, Tseng told Business Insider.\n\n\"Who doesn't ask for that? The US military doesn't ask for that because we understand joint fires. The Ukrainians don't ask for it anymore, either,\" said the former Navy SEAL, who is Shield AI's president.\n\nThe V-BAT, a vertical takeoff and landing drone that uses artificial intelligence to fly in jammed environments, has primarily been used for intelligence and reconnaissance missions in high-profile conflict zones such as Ukraine. Shield AI said the V-BAT flew over 200 missions there in 2025.\n\nThe drone is still meant to be a multi-mission platform, Tseng said, and Shield AI has been exploring ways to mount weapons on it. The firm announced a partnership last month with South Korean arms manufacturer LIG Nex1 to equip the V-BAT with six-pound guided missiles.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, look: I describe V-BAT as a mini predator, reaper drone,\" Tseng said. \"That's the mission it's doing, which is: It's finding targets. And it's hard to find targets, you have to be out there for a long period of time.\"\n\nTo be fair, the MQ-9 Reaper is also commonly equipped with missiles.\n\nHowever, Tseng said sophisticated militaries already have a vast array of other weapons that can turn the V-BAT's intel into a precision strike.\n\n\"If you have been in these combat zones, the US allies who fought closely with us in Afghanistan, they do not ask for organic fires on board the V-Bat,\" Tseng said. \"Because everybody is so used to just saying: 'Okay, I have a targeting package. What fires asset do I have lined up? Is it a one-way attack drone? Is it HIMARS? Is it artillery? Is it an SM-6? SM-3?\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter. You can find weapons,\" he added. \"The weapons are available. You need, actually, more intelligence.\"\n\nThis was a framework that Ukraine still needed to improve when the V-BAT began spotting targets there in early 2024, Tseng said. The drone is meant to fly for over 13 hours and be easily deployable, requiring a two-person launch crew and no runway.\n\nTseng said that while Ukraine excelled in tactical drone warfare, its troops weren't used to having a long-range asset that could spot targets for regular strategic attacks as the US military did.\n\n\"The strategic effects would happen, but they would be rare,\" he said. \"They'd be very, very deliberately planned operations, very expensive operations, things like what they did to the Russian runways with sending quadcopters deep into Russia via trucks.\"\n\nUkrainian drone teams would use the V-BAT to find important targets, such as Russian S-300 and S-400 air defense systems, only to realize they hadn't linked up with the right teams to strike them, Tseng said.\n\n\"We'd say: 'Why didn't you guys have these weapons lined up?' They'd say: 'Oh, well, we didn't think to coordinate,'\" Tseng said.\n\nSince then, Kyiv's forces have been using intelligence from V-BATs to carry out strikes with systems such as one-way attack drones or US-made HIMARS, Tseng said.\n\n\"There was a lot of learning over the past year for the Ukrainians,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Jackson Page has questioned the location of the Welsh Open, saying it \"should be staged in south Wales\".\n\nThe 2026 tournament, from Monday 23 February, will be the fourth-straight year in which the week-long event has been held at Venue Cymru in Llandudno in north Wales.\n\nSince the move to Llandudno, the Welsh Open has been won by an English player each year, with Mark Selby, Gary Wilson and Robert Milkins lifting the title at Venue Cymru.\n\nAnd while the 24-year-old praised the venue, he said a move to south Wales would benefit the Welsh players on the tour.\n\n\"I like the place and the venue but I don't think it is where the Welsh Open is staged,\" said Page.\n\n\"I feel like it should be in south Wales, 100%. Just because there is no player from north Wales, every pro on tour is from south Wales.\n\n\"So it doesn't really feel like a home event for us in all honesty.\"\n\nPage, who reached the quarter-finals last year in Llandudno, added that he is looking forward to the tournament despite its location.\n\n\"It is a great venue, I like playing there and there should definitely be an event there, a big event, I just don't think it should be the Welsh Open,\" Page added.\n\n\"It is still in Wales, so the fans still get behind you so I am looking forward to it, but it is a bit gutting for us south Walians that there is nothing down here for us to play in.\n\n\"Hopefully there will be more tournaments coming soon and we get something down here.\"\n\nPage's quest for Welsh Open glory was ended by former world champion Luca Brecel in 2025.\n\nThe Welshman was beaten 5-2 by the Belgian in the quarter-finals, ending his best run in the competition to date.\n\nAnd the pair now meet in the first round of the 2026 Welsh Open, with Page eyeing revenge against the 30-year-old.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to it,\" said Page.\n\n\"Luca beat me in the quarter-finals last year, so I owe him one in a way.\"\n\nPage came to prominence in the Welsh Open as a 15-year-old in 2017, beating Jason Weston and John Astley before losing to Judd Trump in the third round.\n\nAnd while Page says he is yet to reach the heights he had dreamed of as a teenager, he still believes he can turn things around.\n\n\"I've done alright but I'm nowhere near where I want to be, I want to be the best and I still think I can do it,\" said Page.\n\n\"I've had a pretty bad season, it's not been very good, so I need to kick on.\n\n\"Obviously last year was a great year, so I'm trying to turn it around to get confidence in myself and perform like I know I can.\n\nThe 2026 Welsh Open begins on Monday, 23 February, with the tournament running until the final on Sunday, 1 March.\n\nMatches are available to watch on the BBC Sport website, BBC iPlayer and live on BBC Two Wales - with the final shown on BBC One Wales.\n\nThere is also highlights from the best of each day's action on BBC Two Wales every evening.\n\nAll matches are best-of-seven frames until the quarter‑finals, at which stage the games become best-of-nine.\n\nThe semi‑finals will be the best-of-11, and the final will be best‑of‑17.\n\nThe winner will scoop a top prize of £100,000, with the runner-up winning £45,000.\n\nMark Williams [5] vs Michael Holt\n\nJak Jones [16] vs Liam Highfield\n\nNeil Robertson [4] vs Michal Szubarczyk\n\nKyren Williams [3] vs Liu Hongyu\n\nStuart Murphy [7] vs Chang Bingyu\n\nJackson Page [30] vs Luca Brecel\n\nXiao Guodong [9] vs Long Zehuang\n\nZhao Xintong [2] vs Fan Zhengyi",

    "fullText": "England went from bad to disastrous, France didn't fire on all cylinders but had enough to maintain their Grand Slam challenge, Scotland dug deep for a big win and Ireland were just tremendous.\n\nHere are five players who provided talking points in the third round of the Six Nations, with a two-week break to come before round four...\n\nThe opportunity and ability for teams to rewrite their own narratives in the space of just a few weeks is part of what makes the Six Nations so compelling.\n\nLacklustre and outgunned in Rome in week one, Scotland are now France's biggest challengers after following up the Calcutta Cup demolition of England with a nailbiting, nerve-wrenching win in Wales.\n\nThe hosts were 23-12 up with just over 20 minutes to go but Scotland roared back to win 26-23 after some brilliant quick thinking from fly-half Finn Russell.\n\nHe switched the momentum of the match with a kick that caught Wales out and allowed Darcy Graham to score in the corner. Yet again, the Bath number 10 was the difference-maker.\n\n\"Big-game players turn up when it matters and Russell had moments when he bailed Scotland out,\" former Wales captain Sam Warburton told BBC Rugby Special.\n\n\"He was exceptional at managing the team when they were down in the game. He waits for the perfect moment to get involved.\n\n\"He plays what he sees, he has that licence and his clutch kicking was immense. The big-game player rocked up in the last 30 minutes, he was immaculate and a big part of the comeback.\"\n\n\"Scotland found a way to win ugly,\" added their former flanker John Barclay.\n\n\"They found solutions and ground their way in. In some ways that was the most important win they have had in a while. It has given them a strong position in the table.\"\n\nUp next? France at Murrayfield on Saturday, 7 March, and the chance to end Les Bleus' Grand Slam dreams after three successive wins.\n\n'Scotland's terrible beauty reverses the narrative on extraordinary day'\n\nThe key moment for Scotland's win against Wales\n\nFrance remain in the driving seat for a 20th title - third in five years - and can seal it with a bonus-point win in Edinburgh.\n\nThey were made to graft by ever-improving Italy in Lille, but eventually streaked away to win 33-8, aided by another classy display from star scrum-half and captain Antoine Dupont.\n\nA brilliant kick set up the opening score for Louis Bielle-Biarrey, before Dupont then showed his defensive strengths during a dominant second-half spell from the visitors.\n\n\"It's perhaps unfair that we expect him to do outrageous things every week,\" said Barclay.\n\n\"He is coming back from a knee injury and was maybe a bit quiet in the first two games, but he really stepped up.\n\n\"You have to admire his ability to scan the play under pressure, see space and deliver the skill for France to score that first try. His physical side of the game is impressive, he makes tackles and does so much good stuff.\n\n\"He had a huge influence on the game which is what we have come to expect.\n\n\"France will be heavy favourites in Scotland but that is an exciting game. Perhaps only South Africa can match them for power at the moment.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bielle-Biarrey became the first player in Six Nations history to score in eight successive matches. He has scored 13 tries in 12 Six Nations games and 24 in 25 overall. Quite the strike-rate.\n\nFrance maintain Grand Slam dream with Italy win\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nWhile Scotland's campaign has been revitalised by back-to-back victories, England's has been utterly derailed by two losses.\n\nThey were blown away by Ireland at Twickenham as the men in green ran in five tries to embarrass Steve Borthwick's side 42-21.\n\nEngland entered the tournament with a settled-looking side, but now look a muddle with Matt Dawson calling for Fin Smith to replace George Ford at number 10.\n\nWarburton was confused by Ford's kicking - or lack of - against Ireland.\n\nHe said: \"England are normally patient in their kick battle but Ford missed some kicks that were a real momentum killer.\n\n\"England are a kicking team and when they do it well they look really good. He won so much territory against Wales and in the last two games it's been the other end of the spectrum.\n\n\"Ford is an exceptional tactical kicker but he has not been kicking in the last two games and they have struggled as a result of it.\"\n\n\"I am surprised by England,\" added Barclay.\n\n\"We thought it was a shootout between them and France for a Grand Slam before the tournament. The most concerning thing is the nature of the defeats. Where are England now? We don't really know.\n\n\"The last two performances have thrown up a lot of question marks about selection. What's the best back three, who should play at centre, is George Ford the man at 10?\n\n\"Rewind a few weeks and you could name the team. It seems to have fallen apart a bit.\"\n\nNext up for England is a trip on Saturday, 7 March, to Rome that looks anything but inviting.\n\n'England need players able to change tactics during games'\n\nIs Borthwick under pressure after nightmare defeat?\n\nIreland's resurgence was personified by Robert Baloucoune.\n\nThe 28-year-old had not featured for Ireland since November 2022 because of injury, but he started and scored against Italy before scoring again in an all-action performance against England.\n\nThe wing thought his international career was over but instead played a huge part in a famous win, troubling England speedster Henry Arundell with his work-rate.\n\n\"He was unbelievable,\" said Barclay. \"His willingness to work off the ball is how you win games.\n\n\"He put in dominant tackles, won turnovers. The mindset and energy he bought to the game away from home set the tempo.\"\n\n\"Ireland's desire and work-rate off the ball won them the game,\" added Warburton.\n\n\"Paul O'Connell's quote when I was on Lions duty with him was, 'Be the best at everything that requires no talent' - and Ireland were that.\n\n\"Their attack looks like the one of old. They were super-organised and their aerial dominance was a launchpad. They were so efficient in the red zone and their speed of ball was too good, England couldn't recover from it.\"\n\nIreland face Wales next in a Friday night feast in Dublin on 6 March.\n\n'Ireland show they're far from done with record-breaking win'\n\n'Special day' - Farrell revels in record Irish win\n\nWales' dismal run continued with a painful defeat that was summed up by Tomos Williams giving away a costly penalty for a croc roll.\n\nWales have lost 24 of 26 internationals since October 2023 and the latest defeat was a 14th successive Six Nations loss in a record stretching back three years.\n\nBarclay added: \"Wales will be gutted. They had that game.\n\n\"In Test Match rugby the margins are tiny and in the last 15 minutes they gave away five penalties and a huge one was the croc roll.\n\n\"You might think that has to be grabbing someone around the head and neck and twisting them, but it's also about lateral movement. It's something they are trying to get out of the game.\"\n\nThe penalty was costly and Scotland and Russell took full advantage, with their misery being compounded by the nature of George Turner's match-winning try.\n\nScotland number eight Matt Fagerson was offside and obstructing Wales replacement prop Archie Griffin in the build-up to the score from a driving maul.\n\nSmall margins - but can Wales now build on an improved display across the Irish Sea?\n\nAgony and hope for Wales after Scotland loss",

    "fullText": "In a race filled with attrition, Tyler Reddick battled through a double overtime finish to open the NASCAR Cup Series 2026 season with back-to-back victories, winning at Echo Park Speedway Sunday night.\n\n23XI Racing currently has its two drivers at the top of the points standings through the first two races, as Reddick wins the Daytona 500 and Autotrader 400, and Bubba Wallace matches his Daytona 500 performance with a top ten finish and a stage win.\n\nTyler drove his ass off today,\" 23XI Racing owner Michael Jordan said.\n\n\"I know we had our little ordeal, but they never gave up, they kept working hard, and this is the fruit of their labor,\" Jordan said on 23XI Racing's performance to start the post-law suit year. \"For us to come out and win the first two races says a lot about our team.\"\n\nFellow Toyota driver Christopher Bell led on the lap 17 restart, looking to back up his win in the race last year that sent him on his three-race streak. Bell was in the battle with Wallace, with Wallace taking the lead with 12 laps to go. As Wallace battled up front, his teammate Reddick, sans right front fender, made the run from 18th to fourth before a caution and red flag set up the first overtime finish.\n\nReddick, who rose through the Late Model ranks, won without a fender.\n\n\"That’s crazy isn’t its it,\" Reddick said on winning without a fender. \"This place over the years, man. It just puts on some amazing racing. Handling matters here, but I don't know, apparently determination outweighs handling.\"\n\nThe caution was called after William Byron had a tire go down, sending the Hendrick driver into the wall. He collected six cars with four laps remaining to set up an Overtime finish.\n\nCarson Hocevar, still chasing his first win, led last week on the white flag lap before crashing. He also matched performance this week, as a few aggressive moves in the closing laps nearly secured him the win. Known to make bold decisions and enemies, Hocevar and his spotter tried to negotiate with the leading Toyotas to push on the restart. Asking Wallace to 'Shake and Bake' and have the Reddick line up behind in the third row. Wallace instead opted to start on the bottom with Reddick lining up behind him, unsure if Reddick's damaged race car would be able to successfully push the teammates in tandem to the front.\n\nOn the overtime restart, Hocevar dove to a pocket in the middle of Bell, and Wallace bailed on pushing Bell when he got a major push from Ross Chastain. Hocevar crashed into Bell, and the Joe Gibbs Racing driver hit the wall, sustaining major front right damage.\n\nThe second overtime attempt saw Wallace and Reddick linked up again, now with JGR's Chase Briscoe behind for a three-car Toyota chain on the bottom against three Chevrolets on the top.\n\nIn the closing two laps, Wallace went high to block Hocevar and lost momentum, falling back through the field as his teammate passed on the bottom. In clean air, Reddick was able to hang on through the rough handling of his damaged race car to claim his second win ahead of Briscoe, Chastain, Hocevar, and Daniel Suarez.\n\nShane van Gisbergen, who was involved in two incidents in stage two, rebounded for a sixth-place finish, his best finish on an oval track.\n\nZane Smith, Wallace, Ryan Preece, and Ryan Blaney completed the top ten.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

Now, they need to find his replacement.\n\nFansided’s Zachary Rotman predicts the Twins could be a dark horse for a veteran All-Star in Lucas Giolito. He eats innings, and he had a pretty productive 2025.\n\nMORE: Padres predicted to be dark horse candidate for $9 million three-time Cy Young, two-time World Series champion ace to replace Dylan Cease\n\n“Another team that should be desperate for a starting pitcher is the Minnesota Twins, which just lost Pablo Lopez for the season. With Joe Ryan and Bailey Ober being their only semi-reliable starters, Giolito would be a valuable addition as an innings-eater. Worst case, he wouldn't cost much, and if the Twins are out of it at the trade deadline, he can fetch them a prospect or two in a deal,” Rotman wrote.\n\nGiolito finished 2025 with a 10-4 record, a 3.41 ERA, 121 Ks, and a WHIP of 1.290 over 145 innings pitched.

    "title": "Plaschke: During statue unveiling, Pat Riley reminds the disjointed Lakers of keys to winning",
    "description": "On the day his statue was unveiled outside Crypto.com Arena, Showtime era coach Pat Riley urged the Lakers to fight to create legacies worth chasing.",
    "fullText": "The fans never got an opportunity to give a grateful goodbye, Pat Riley resigning on an early summer afternoon 36 years ago after the end of a lost season.\n\nEveryone will have that chance now.\n\nWhen Riley left town at the wrong end of grumblings from players and fans, he was the greatest coach not only in Lakers history but also in basketball history, his .730 winning percentage and 102 playoff victories both NBA records at the time.\n\nHe has been Showtime’s forgotten kingpin, its lost leader, its missing warrior, a stylishly distant legend who had been overshadowed by the seven Lakers whose statues stand watch over the plaza outside Crypto.com Arena.\n\nRiley finally is coming home, returning Sunday with the unveiling of a long overdue statue in whose bronze reflection a couple of wistful realizations can be found.\n\nRiles has been terribly, terribly missed.\n\nThe Showtime era seems terribly, terribly distant.\n\nRiley hasn’t been with the Lakers in 36 years. The Lakers haven’t won an asterisk-free NBA title in 16 years. Maybe because Shaquille O’Neal spoke only via video Sunday, the greatness of this organization never felt further away.\n\nMark Walter, were you watching?\n\nThe Dodgers group that now owns the Lakers was granted a compelling history lesson during an hourlong ceremony that culminated in a theatrical unveiling of a Riley statue smartly situated between the bronzes of Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nLike Riley himself, his statue looked darn near perfect. There was the raised fist that was once a signal for Magic to pass to Kareem for a sky hook. There was the neatly coiffed hair, the nicely fitting suit, the smartly positioned tie, even the painfully stern expression from a guy who left no doubt who was running the show.\n\n“When I was told that the kid from Schenectady, New York, would be honored with a statue here ... I fell to my knees, humbled. I sobbed. ... Tears of joy and gratitude,” Riley said during his acceptance speech, adding “That statue right there … is loaded up with all of us who took that magical journey.”\n\nIt was a Showtime magic born of a commitment found in one of the two inscriptions on the statue.\n\n“There will come a time when you are challenged, and when that time comes, you must plant your feet. You must stand firm. You must make a point. About who you are, what you do, and where you come from. When that time comes, you do it.”\n\nRiley used those words to earn six Laker championship rings, four as a coach, one as an assistant coach and one as a player.\n\nAfter leaving town in 1990 and making a stop in New York, Riley carried those words with him to Miami, where he led the Heat to one title as a coach and two more as an executive, and where he still serves as president at age 80.\n\n“There will come a time when you are challenged …”\n\nFor the new Laker bosses, that time is now, as they find themselves with a product that is light years from the teams that Riley referenced during what amounted to a 30-minute sermon/history lesson prior to the unveiling.\n\nThis Laker organization is a bit of a mess, as evidenced by the speakers who joined Riley on the stage.\n\nThere was Magic and Kareem and Jeanie Buss, who all gave compelling talks, very appropriate. But oddly also speaking was Dwyane Wade, who played for Riley in Miami but was never a Laker. The group was interestingly joined by Michael Douglas, who spoke as Riley’s friend, while several Lakers Showtime greats watched from the audience.\n\nIt was all a bit disjointed, which is similar to the Lakers' current situation. They’re so defensively challenged they’re surely headed for an early playoff exit even though they have the stunningly great scorer Luka Doncic, and what happens next?\n\nDo they keep LeBron James? (Say no!) Do they pay Austin Reaves (Say yes!) Do they try to trade for Giannis Antetokounmpo (Go for it!).\n\nAll these are questions not unlike the one faced by the late Jerry Buss in 1981 when pondering the notion of hiring a kid who had never coached at any level. Buss trusted his instincts and went for it, the enlistment of Riley fashioning a culture that remained strong until his death in 2013.\n\nIt is a culture that Riley described when he left in 1990, quoting the late author Ernest Becker.\n\n“Man's greatest fear — and you've probably heard this before — is his fear of extinction,” he said in his farewell news conference. “But what he fears more than that is to become extinct with insignificance.”\n\nThe Showtime Lakers faced those fears and overcame them.\n\n\"What we accomplished was not insignificant,” he added in his farewell address. “All anybody ever wants to do is have the feeling that what they do counts and matters. I've always told the players that they don't just want to be the best of the best. There's nothing wrong with being unique. We were unique.\"\n\nRiley repeated many of those same words Sunday, and added some more wisdom about life with the legends.\n\n“That’s where I learned about commitment … there are only two options” he said. “You’re in or you’re out. Either you’re with us or against us. There’s no other way, there’s no life in between.”\n\nRiley said that through that commitment, the Lakers legacy had been formed.\n\n“The biggest footprint in Laker history had been planted,” he said, later adding, “You begin by chasing footprints, you grow by honoring them. And if you’re committed enough, you leave giant steps of your own.”\n\nHe then challenged today’s NBA players, even the ones getting dressed down the hall.\n\n“I ask even the players who play for the Lakers today, I ask you, whose footprints are you chasing today?” he said. “More important, what footprints are you leaving?”\n\nHe continued, saying, “When it comes time to kick some ass, you do it. And one day someone will follow the path you left behind and say, ‘Those are footprints worth chasing.”’\n\nRiley ended his talk with what was essentially an inspirational pregame speech as the Lakers prepared to play the rival he finally conquered, those Boston Celtics.\n\n“As my father’s words to me, they ring out loud and clear today,” he said with the sort of verve that is rarely heard around the team these days. “The time has come to kick some ass. To kick some Boston ass.”\n\nMark Walter, were you listening?\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Want to get more Covers content? Add us as a preferred source on your Google account here.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins released wide receiver Tyreek Hill on Monday, February 16, finally ending a union that seemed destined for a breakup sooner rather than later.\n\nThe eight-time Pro-Bowler played in just four games in 2025 before suffering a season-ending ACL injury. What began as a perfect match, and briefly looked like the best offense in football alongside Jayden Waddle as Tua Tagovailoa's primary weapons, Hill's time in Miami appeared to sour by the end of 2024.\n\nNow, the hapless Dolphins and the 31-year-old receiver are embarking on different paths. Below, we'll look at the latest NFL odds for Hill's next destination — and why a reunion with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs feels inevitable.\n\nFrom 2016-21, Tyreek Hill was a mainstay in the Kansas City Chiefs offense, racking up 6,630 receiving yards and 56 touchdowns over 91 games. He made the Pro Bowl every season in Kansas City and was one of quarterback Patrick Mahomes' favorite targets.\n\nA reunion would make a ton of sense, especially after the Chiefs just missed the postseason for the first time since before either Hill or Mahomes debuted. The Chiefs struggled to establish a deep-ball threat this season, and an ancient Travis Kelce led the team in receiving.\n\nBringing Hill back into the fold immediately gives Mahomes an established weapon who, if he's 100%, can burn defensive backs better than almost anyone. And their familiarity should help him, figuratively and literally, hit the ground running in September and beyond.\n\nWhile the Chiefs are the logical landing spot based on \"narrative,\" the Buffalo Bills need a big-time receiver just as much. Quarterback Josh Allen relied more heavily on his tight ends in 2025, and giving him another option alongside top WR Khalil Shakir (who led the team with 72 receptions, while Dalton Kincaid was next with 39) would solve a glaring issue and take some of the pressure off.\n\nThe Bills' window isn't closed, but they did move on from head coach Sean McDermott this offseason, showing a desperation to get over the hump from \"great regular season team\" to \"legitimate Super Bowl contender.\" Hill would be a major upgrade.\n\nFresh off a disappointing showing in the Super Bowl, could the New England Patriots target Hill? Stefon Diggs is a $26.5-million cap hit next season, and is already being bandied about as a potential cut candidate.\n\nIt's doubtful that the Pats would employ both Diggs and Hill for a variety of reasons — both have had character and legal issues in recent years — and it may not make a lot of sense to replace Diggs with Hill, especially if the latter has questions about his health in the wake of his ACL tear and dislocated knee.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens committed to quarterback Lamar Jackson in moving on from head coach John Harbaugh, and bolstering the wide receiver corps may be a way to kickstart a new era.\n\nHe would help form a formidable duo with Zay Flowers, who had nearly 800 more receiving yards than his closest teammate in 2025. Veteran DeAndre Hopkins is a free agent, and Hill would be a significant upgrade at their respective points in their careers.\n\nFinally, this is an interesting option after Hill's former Miami Dolphins head coach, Mike McDaniel, was hired to serve as Jim Harbaugh's offensive coordinator. When Miami's offense was at its best before Tua Tagovailoa's concussions, the Dolphins looked virtually unstoppable.\n\nAssuming there's no bad blood, giving Justin Herbert a target of this caliber may unlock another level for the Los Angeles Chargers quarterback.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here and view our best betting sites or check out our top sportsbook promos.",

    "title": "The quirk of fate that saw sluggish Liverpool beat Forest and close in on Champions League places",
    "description": "Nottingham Forest 0-1 Liverpool: Alexis Mac Allister’s late, late winner snatched all three points for the champions",
    "fullText": "Perhaps it was football at its most illogical. Liverpool were triumphant after a first-half performance Arne Slot felt was their worst in his time at the club. They got a goal from a player who may have only been in a goalscoring position because one of his teammates was injured and after he had struggled in his original role, amid a collective malaise.\n\nA team who have been aggrieved by refereeing decisions of late saw a seeming winner disallowed in contentious fashion and yet made off with three points. And Vitor Pereira, who seemed to have had an immediate impact with Nottingham Forest, reacted to his first home game in charge by saying: “I am frustrated, angry with football. Very, very unfair.”\n\nHe had a point in his argument, if not in the result. For Liverpool, Florian Wirtz’s back injury produced a benefit. Their supporters ended up celebrating just their second win at the City Ground in more than four decades by chorusing the name of their resident World Cup winner.\n\nAs his habit of scoring against Real Madrid shows, Alexis Mac Allister can supply major moments. Twice it seemed he had a decider against Forest. The first was disallowed and yet perhaps Liverpool’s sense of injustice provided the platform for the second.\n\nBut he did so twice from a position within the Forest penalty box. Which, when Slot drew up his plans, was not his. Wirtz should have been there. When he withdrew, Curtis Jones was the emergency No 10. He floundered there, as Mac Allister did in midfield. So Jones was redirected to right-back, Dominik Szoboszlai and Mac Allister given more advanced roles. And an hour later, the Argentinian, who had started as a passenger, ended as the match-winner.\n\nAnd so Slot, who believes that decisions and fortune have gone against Liverpool this season, instead argued his side got lucky. “We have been on the wrong side of the score after a good performance too many times,” he said. “Today we got more than we deserved. A draw would have been a fairer result. The first half was really poor, the worst we have played. We lost almost every ball we touched.” The second period was better and, eventually, Slot could say: “My emotions were emotions of happiness and relief.”\n\nWhich came from Mac Allister’s late show. He had the ball in the Forest net twice: once seemingly inadvertently, once deliberately. The first was chalked off. The second also went to VAR, but this time the replays could not quash Liverpool’s joy.\n\nPaul Tierney, long Jurgen Klopp’s least favourite official, disallowed what seemed the breakthrough goal. It went in off Mac Allister’s upper arm and back. Not that there was any sense the Argentinian knew anything about it. After Hugo Ekitike should have scored, but met Rio Ngumoha’s cross with a header that Stefan Ortega saved, Mac Allister’s back was turned as Ola Aina’s clearance struck him and rebounded into the Forest net. He knew it had hit his elbow. “I feel like it's a bit harsh,” he said. “It's a bit of both but I understand the rules.”\n\nWhen it was ruled out, it seemed to cement Forest’s status as Liverpool’s bogey team. Until Szoboszlai, the one man taking his time as the clock ticked down, jinked to make a yard of space, whipped in a lovely cross and Virgil van Dijk’s goalbound header was blocked by Murillo. Mac Allister was the predator in the box again. “It was not a surprise to me that Macca was both times the goalscorer, he played with the mentality you need in these games and he was twice in the situation to finish,” said Slot.\n\nMeanwhile, Wirtz was only visible beneath his hood in the stands. It was a game when Liverpool missed the German when they were shorn of creativity and chemistry. They looked a prosaic outfit with the £100m man and yet found a way to record just their second victory at the City Ground in more than four decades. The first required a 99th-minute decider by Darwin Nunez. This was only slightly earlier, similarly dramatic.\n\nIt was a remarkable end to a forgettable game. Seasons can turn on such moments. Liverpool are now level on points with Chelsea and Manchester United, their immediate rivals for a Champions League spot. Forest, meanwhile, were seemingly making an auspicious start to Pereira’s reign but were nudged closer to the Championship by Mac Allister. They started superbly yet fell apart at the last.\n\nForest had won 3-0 at Anfield under Sean Dyche; yet Liverpool began worse in the rematch, slow and sluggish, off the pace and out of sorts. Meanwhile, Forest looked liberated, a group of talented players freed from Dyche’s restrictive tactics. Omari Hutchinson was excellent. Callum Hudson-Odoi almost scored in the third minute, when Alisson denied him. Elliot Anderson drove a shot wide. “The first half was just missing the goals,” said Pereira, but that has been a theme of Forest’s campaign.\n\nLiverpool had threatened only when Stefan Ortega made a close-range block from Jones; but part of Slot’s half-time message was that Forest, who had beaten Fenerbahce in Istanbul three days earlier, might tire. They did. “Our capacity to press them was not the same and in the end, we conceded,” rued Pereira. “But if we keep this mentality and organisation, we will get points, for sure.”",

    "title": "Miami Dolphins Fans Weigh In On De’Von Achane’s Future",
    "description": "Miami Dolphins fans share what they think or want to happen with star running back De’Von Achane going forward.",
    "fullText": "Following the kick-off of our Miami Dolphins roster purge this past week, I pointed out that the team also had a decision to make on star running back De’Von Achane as he enters the final year of his rookie contract. I then asked the following question:\n\nWhat do you think that the new coaching staff and front office should do with De’Von Achane going forward? Should they extend him right now/before the season begins, should they allow him to play on the final year of his deal before deciding if they want to re-sign him to a new deal, or should they consider trading a player that they took in the third round who could now garner a first-round draft pick?\n\nBelow are some of your thougths and answers-\n\nNeenerWhacker wonders what a change in coaching and scheme will have on Achanes numbers in 2026.\n\nSide note on Achane: his stats and analytics are off the charts. How much credit are we going to give Mike McDaniel for Achane’s success?\n\nThere is a high probability that Achane regresses next year with a new play caller. McD had his flaws, but he knew how to scheme for Devon\n\nMiamiItaliano says trade him away if he doesn’t give the Dolphins a generous hometown discount on any extension.\n\nIf they get Malik Willis, that might take touches away from Achane since he’s a run first type of QB. Also, Achane might want too much money. Maybe trade him if he doesn’t agree to a team friendly contract. I don’t want him to go, but it’s better than him holding out throughout training camp.\n\nOldfinfan says he’s the best since Ricky and is a building block, not trade bait.\n\nBest Dolphins player we have seen since Ricky Williams. We do not trade him, we build around him. He has game breaking abilities you don’t just find every draft.\n\nkrammm is out on him, it seems.\n\nTrade him. He never wins the big game.\n\nFLexile seems to have two arguments for you.\n\nExtend him. If he is not the fastest guy in the NFL, he’s top 3. He can score ANY time he touches the ball.\n\nCome trade deadline, do the best thing for both parties and trade him. The Dolphins get a 1st rounder and Achane gets a ring and a Super Bowl MVP for whatever team is an electric RB away from a Lombardi trophy.\n\nSuperG! says extend him unless someone offers a first, and maybe more, for him.\n\nCould he garner a first-round pick? I’ve been told by super smart people on here that teams don’t offer a first round pick in a trade scenario for a running back. Especially a running back on the final year of his rookie contract. A first and a third would be considered a Godfather deal. Other than that, I wouldn’t trade him. I’d extend him instead.\n\ngo_canes who has a VERY solid screen name, says keep him because seeing him play is worth the admission!\n\nThe guy is one of those rare “worth the price of admission” players. I hope they keep him in a Dolphin uniform. It is worth the risk. There is also a risk to the complete tank approach – you could develop a loser mentality.\n\nUSMCFinzFreak lays out a 2-3 year plan for the team.\n\n1) Build the trenches through the draft.\n\n2) Obtain competent WRs and TEs.\n\n3) Get a bridge quarterback (I still have hope in Ewers).\n\nOnce those pieces are in place, go and get a young quarterback (if Ewers doesn’t cut the mustard).\n\nMIAMI235 believes it comes down to affordability.\n\nIf he stays healthy, a dynamic presence, when utilized properly. As others have stated, it may simply comedown too affordability.\n\ndavidson11 says if Tua’s gone, then just clean house.\n\nIf they’re not going to keep Tua, they might as well trade Achane and Waddle. Either tank or don’t.\n\nfinfanfromsiam believes in the build via the draft concept.\n\nVery good player that we drafted. Extend him to a decent contract. Keep our own when possible.\n\nMonix22 wants him traded based on an assumption of future injury.\n\nTrade him. Let him get hurt on another team.\n\nUpInPensacola wants to make it a package deal. Might be the only way to get a good package in return for Tua.\n\nIs it possible to trade him in a deal where Tua goes with him?\n\nPA phinphan say’s the idea of a team-friendly deal is unlikely, so maybe look for a first for him in trade.\n\nTo me this is tough decision. I would love to keep him on a team friendly deal but is that even a thing anymore? It seems like it’s all about making as much as you can with little loyalty. I get it. It’s like any other business.\n\nWith that said, if he could bring a first round pick maybe it’s best to trade him and give the new regime more picks to build their type of roster.\n\nThe Earl is a man of few words.\n\nWell, that’s our random 15 comments this evening. It seems there is no consensus on what should happen with Achane going forward, which means whatever happens with him will make some portion of the fan base unhappy. As always, thank you to each of you who took the time to join in on our question of the day and contribute to this and the prior post.

    "fullText": "The college football offseason overall is pretty quiet this time of year. In 2026, it has been a little bit louder with recent court rulings and ongoing battles.\n\nThis is also the time, however, that the NCAA works with college football programs to make changes to the game. Most recently, the running clock rule was changed, and a two-minute warning was also added.\n\nMORE: NCAA may appeal judge’s Trinidad Chambliss decision due to concerning details\n\nThe NCAA is looking to make a big change to a controversial college football rule: targeting. Targeting, of course, is when a player leads with the crown of their head for intentional contact with another player’s head or neck area.\n\nThe rule’s purpose is understandable. They want to protect all players from unnecessary hits and also protect those who tend to deliver those hits.\n\nWhat makes things controversial is the review, execution, and punishment of targeting. It can be difficult to determine if targeting in college football is malicious in nature or not intentional.\n\nMORE: Indiana gives head football coach Curt Cignetti a nice championship reward\n\nThe punishment is ejection and can also roll over into the next game for those penalized. The NCAA is reportedly aiming to change at least the rollover suspension aspect of targeting.\n\nThis is a relatively big step in addressing the difficult call to make in targeting. While some calls are very obvious–one way or another–it is still also difficult for other calls.\n\nCould the NCAA eventually change the punishment of targeting altogether? It’s a long shot at this moment, but it might be on its way to big changes.\n\nOLYMPICS: Team USA flag bearers revealed for 2026 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony\n\nNFL: Predicting the 2026 NFL free agent signings\n\nMLB: Detroit Tigers drop unreal alternate jerseys for 2026 MLB season\n\nNBA: Charlotte Hornets share update after LaMelo Ball’s car crash\n\nNHL: 2026 Winter Olympics men’s hockey, NHL payrolls for final four teams\nSPORTS MEDIA: Olympics reporter apologizes for drinking, slurring words during live segment\n\nThe post NCAA to review controversial college football rule for huge changes appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Add in all of the standard backpack considerations such as capacity, comfort and durability, and you have a lot of factors to consider.\n\nTo find the very best laptop backpack, I rounded up 11 of the top models and tested them over several months and many miles.\n\nBest overall: \n\n Mission Workshop Meridian backpack\n\nBest for travel:\n\n Peak Design Travel Backpack\n\nBest budget: \n\n The North Face Vault\n\nBest sling bag: \n\n Tomtoc Navigator – T24 Sling Bag (Small)\n\nBest rugged bag: \n\n Pelican PX25 Aegis Travel Pack\n\nI’ve been a tech journalist for 13 years, and a frequent traveler – in 2025 I flew more than 70,000 miles, across 41 flights and a total of seven days and six hours in the air. I visited 12 airports and six countries, to say nothing of countless steps, ride shares and hotels.\n\nAs someone who tends to pack more than I really need and has a bad back, I’m uniquely motivated to find the perfect backpack, and it’s been an obsessive quest of mine for years. Backpacks also speak to my love for planning and organization, which the testing process let me fully indulge.\n\nThe first thing I did to test these 11 backpacks was to pack for a trip. I put everything I typically carry for a work trip on to a table: a laptop that is anywhere from 13 to 16in, a tablet, several phones – because I have a weird job – multiple plugs, chargers, batteries and, of course, plenty of bungee cords. My loadout also includes three tech bags: one with video gear like a selfie stick and lav mics, one with flight essentials like snacks and battery packs and one with chargers, cables and adapters.\n\nThen, I packed up each backpack using the various compartments and pockets as designed, threw each backpack on to my back and I walked a half mile each. Since water is the mortal enemy of laptops, I also tested each backpack (empty – and thank goodness!) in my shower for one minute to simulate getting caught in the rain. I fully let out all the straps and donned the backpack to see how easily the straps adjusted. I zipped and unzipped each zipper 25 times to see how easy it was to use. Finally, I put a deck of playing cards in an easy-access pocket (if there was one) and timed how long it took for me to get it off my back and the cards in hand.\n\nMany manufacturers provided samples to test for this article, which I donated to my local library upon completion. It’d be a treat to see a school kid or even an adult strutting around town with one of these.\n\nMission Workshop’s Meridian backpack has pockets for days, a semi-modular design that lets you customize it with add-ons and tons of space.\n\nWhy we love it\nThis bag easily held everything I wanted to pack with room to spare, and a home for everything. All three of my tech bags fit in the main compartment, and everything else had its own pocket, making it very clear where everything lives. The sample I received included two add-ons: a slim side pouch that’s perfect for phones, battery packs or even a slim flashlight, and a bottle pouch. Laptop access on this bag is particularly nice because it has its own compartment, separate from the main compartment. It scored the highest on our waterproof testing, as well – everything inside was bone dry. The straps didn’t rest along my rib cage as well as I’d like, but it was definitely wearable.\n\nThis bag is probably overkill for a student just looking to tote a laptop and some books around campus, but it’s great for a professional who needs to schlep a bunch of gear comfortably and with easy access to everything.\n\nIt’s a shame that … It’s so big it might strain the personal item rules on most airlines. And there are no locks or hidden pockets if you’re worried about security. While it has a sleeve to slide over the handle on a roller bag, it’s situated sideways, which interferes with the side pouches and struck me as a silly design choice.\n\nMax laptop size: 17in\nCapacity: 28 litres\nEmpty weight: 2.74lbs\n\nThis bag has an unusual design: to pack it you need to rest it on its face and open the back, which hinges 180 degrees and gives you easy access to the whole main compartment.\n\nWhy we love it\nIf you’re headed out for a weekend, this is a lovely bag to comfortably bring a few changes of clothes, your laptop and all the goodies that go with it. Aside from the large main compartment, you’ll find a good amount of organization around the periphery of the main pouch, smaller zipped pockets along the side and two larger zipped pockets on the inside of the front of the bag.\n\nLoops along the periphery of the bag inside and out allow you strap even more gear to the bag, and Peak even includes tie-downs. With 30 litres of capacity, you probably won’t need to, though.\n\nIt’s a shame that … The unique design takes some getting used to. Adjusting the straps and fit is very difficult, and waterproofing was just OK. There was some water ingress, making the paper towels inside the bag damp, but not wet. The lining is also not absorbant, so it dries quickly.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 33 liters\nEmpty weight: 3.17lbs\n\nWhile it’s the most basic bag I tested, the North Face Vault is a perfectly competent laptop hauler at a fraction of the cost of most other bags on this list.\n\nWhy we love it\nBeing basic isn’t necessarily a bad thing – not every backpack needs 700 pockets for every little item. The Vault has a generous main compartment and a smaller top compartment with a few pouches and pockets for very small items, such as pencils and thumb drives. The top pouch takes away a bit of room into the main pouch, but the latter opens wide enough to easily work around it if you’re digging around for something.\n\nThis bag is deceptively deep, and it holds a lot, if pressed into service. I found it very serviceable for most tasks – the Toyota Corolla of backpacks. It will get you from A to B with no complaints. Just please don’t get caught out in the rain.\n\nIt’s a shame that … It’s not waterproof at all – water quickly works its way inside. It’s also not terribly comfortable for extended periods due to thin straps and little padding on the shoulder straps and back.\n\nMax laptop size: 15in \nCapacity: 27 liters\nEmpty weight: 1.68lbs\n\nThis isn’t technically a backpack – it’s a sling bag, but it’s delightfully small, it holds a ton of gear, and yet has enough space for a 14in laptop.\n\nWhy we love it\nThis is a great day pack, if you’re heading out for a day on the town. It only holds 7 liters, but those 7 liters are impeccably organized: there are pockets for your laptop, tablet and e-reader, plus smaller pockets for additional organization. An outer pocket is perfect for things you need to grab on the go, and a security pocket facing your back lets you safely stow your wallet, keys or passport in a tough-to-swipe location.\n\nIt’s a shame that … Adjusting the strap is very hard with the overengineered buckle. This is also the smallest bag on the list by a lot, and probably won’t hold everything you’ll want for plane rides.\n\nMax laptop size: 14in\nCapacity: 7 liters\nEmpty weight: 1.23lbs\n\nPelican is perhaps best known for its hardened cases used to carry delicate equipment, and the Aegis stays true to its roots with a super tough hard-shell design.\n\nWhy we love it\nUnlike all the soft options on our list, this model has a rigid exterior built to shrug off impact and general roughhousing. I didn’t drop the bag from my roof or anything, but if you find yourself in a harsh environment with gear that doesn’t take kindly to impact, this should be your first choice.\n\nThe backpack is essentially one large compartment, except for one small compartment at the top for odds and ends, and a laptop sleeve. If you want to more, Pelican sells stick-on Velcro “ModPaks” that add various pockets. Personally, I would need three or more, but if you want a lot of open space to work with, this is a good bag to consider. Like the Peak Design bag, it has tie-down loops inside to ratchet down your gear with cord or bungees.\n\nIt’s a shame that … There is virtually no organization in the bag – plan to use packing cubes. It also has almost no water resistance. Also, if you have a dog with not-black fur, carry a lint roller with you!\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 25 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.9lbs\n\nI prefer a messenger bag (AKA sling bag) when I need to dig into it frequently, like at a trade show, but a backpack is more comfortable for extended wear. Since I switch between them frequently, this convertible bag piqued my interest. It offers the best of both worlds: when you want to convert it, the backpack straps zip up into their own pocket, and you attach the shoulder strap to two loops and just like that, you have a messenger bag.\n\nThe main pocket is surprisingly large, and the two auxiliary pockets also hold a lot. When I was done packing in the items I used to test these bags, this one had a lot of space left over. But it didn’t reign in any one category, which knocked it down a few pegs from its competitors.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … There is no organization nor security in the bag.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 25 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.09lbs\n\nThe Knack Medium Backpack has a highly unusual design that expands out to leap from 24 to 35 litres. You actually access the laptop sleeve from the side, rather than the top, which is a novel approach. While there are some smaller pockets around the periphery of the bag, the main pocket is just one big open space with a divider, which is designed to separate clothes from other gear.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … It felt like the designers had a few clever ideas, but couldn’t quite bring them together coherently. It’s also not water-resistant at all.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in \nCapacity: 35 liters \nEmpty weight: 3lbs\n\nIf you’ve ever found yourself with the unexpected need to check a bag for a flight as I have, a lockable backpack provides welcome piece of mind. This Tomtoc has lock latches – holes where you can insert a lock to attach the zippers to each other – on both of its sets of zippers. You can’t lock up the front pockets, which is unfortunate, but you can secure the main pouch, which is probably where your most expensive goodies live.\n\nTwo zippers access the main pocket: one in the back that facilitates slipping a laptop into the sleeve, and a second one at the front that gives you a wide mouth to put other items in. They both open to the same space, which seemed a bit redundant.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … It has terrible water resistance, and it’s not terribly comfortable to carry.\n\nMax laptop size: 17.3in\nCapacity: 24 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.2lbs\n\nIf you’re a new parent, this bag is a no-brainer, but it’s also great for travelers. I’ve taken it on several trips with no screaming babies in tow and I really dig it. It offers tons of places to stick items like phones, a top pocket for quick-access items and a large stretchy pocket on the front of random odds and ends. If you’re using it as intended, there’s a space at the bottom designed to hold dirty diapers and one pocket designed for baby wipes.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … There’s no security in the bag at all, and the baby features waste a bit of space for non-parents.\n\nMax laptop size: 17in\nCapacity: 20 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.1lbs\n\nPeak Design Everyday Backpack 20L\n\nThink about capacity, organization, security, waterproofing and comfort. To prioritize, consider what you’ll be carrying and in what circumstances. A bag for day tripping to the coffee shop requires less capacity than a weekend travel bag, for instance.\n\nObviously, nothing beats trying it on. Fully extend out the straps, put it on your back and then adjust the straps to fit. If you can, toss in some dummy weight.\n\nIf you’re shopping online, examine how the straps are sewn to the backpack. If they attach vertically, they’ll run along your torso more comfortably than those attached horizontally. Also, consider the zipper pulls. As you get older, zippers with fabric or cord loops can be much easier to pull than bare metal tabs. Also look for retailers with a good return policy in case reality doesn’t match expectations.\n\nBottom padding matters more than anything. Backpacks will be slung down off your back and on to the floor hundreds, if not thousands, of times, and bottom padding is the only thing between your $2,000 laptop and a concrete floor. Also consider waterproofing – if the bag isn’t very waterproof and you get stuck out in the rain, the padding of the sleeve might absorb water and take a long time to dry out.\n\nWhile I prefer a backpack with a pocket for everything, others prefer the versatility of an open compartment. To prevent all your gear from mixing together, use packing cubes and specialized tech bags, like the Peak Design Tech Pouch I use, to hold cables and chargers. Many companies offering backpacks with open compartments also sell organizational packs to go inside.\n\nSome high-end backpacks shed water like ducks; others may as well be made of gauze. If you’re stuck in the rain with the latter, find a garbage bag to put over the backpack, making a slit for the straps if necessary (or just carry it by the handle if it has one, and most all of the bags in this list do). A friendly business may even let you have one if you ask nicely.\n\nWhen you get home, empty the backpack completely, place it in a room with a lot of air circulation and place something inside the laptop sleeve to prop it open so it can dry out. If you don’t, water can get trapped in there for days.\n\nAdam Doud is a freelance product journalist and frequent traveler who carries a ton of tech with him wherever he goes. He’s been on a low-key quest to find the perfect bag/backpack since 2020, and he has strapped more gear to his back than Hannibal’s elephants – though not all at one time. He is also a compulsive organizer, so the more pockets the better",

    "description": "A mom explains why she pulled her high school son out of school for a three-week trip to Antarctica to ease college anxiety and gain perspective.",
    "fullText": "My high school son, Jack, was overwhelmed with college anxiety — SAT prep, AP classes, acceptance rates, and all the pressure that comes with being a New York student.\n\nIt was hard to quiet the noise, so I decided to make a radical — and unconventional decision: I pulled him out of school and took him to Antarctica for three weeks over winter break.\n\nEveryone told me it was a terrible idea, but I thought it was exactly what he needed.\n\nJack and I have been traveling together since he was 3 months old. I'm a huge traveler, and when I had my first son, I decided to take him along for the ride.\n\nIn elementary school, I didn't think twice about pulling him out in order to explore the world (Costa Rica, Mexico, Nevis, Finland). Against the judgment of some parents (and some school officials), I thought it was important to expose him to travel — different cultures, different ways of doing things, different ways of thinking. He quickly became my favorite travel companion, and I often thought travel Jack was the best version of himself.\n\nIt became more difficult to pull him out in middle school (but I still did — he missed eighth-grade graduation — to go on a trip to Sri Lanka). Once he entered high school (where, according to him, grades matter), it became really difficult to make up the work if I pulled him out.\n\nThen came junior year and all the stress that comes with college prep settled upon us. Not only was he balancing a bunch of AP classes, but he was also studying for the SAT and doing all the college prep work. Basically, he (and therefore I) became slightly unhinged.\n\nSo when I floated the idea of going on a trip — just the two of us — Jack was instantly in, but I got tons of pushback from everyone else. Junior year is the most important year for college prep; he's in AP classes, and it's super hard to make up the work. Did I have my priorities straight? Now is the time to lock in, not travel.\n\nBut I ignored the noise and booked us on a three-week cruise to Antarctica — he had two weeks off for the holiday break and would miss one week of school. I had him talk to all his teachers about missed work and make-up, and, surprisingly, while a lot of parents thought I was nuts, the teachers were supportive of this once-in-a-lifetime trip.\n\nAnd off we went on a three-week trip to Antarctica, South Georgia, and the Falkland Islands. I purposefully chose this cruise itinerary because it included South Georgia, which everyone says is a must if going to the white continent. It definitely made the trip long (by a week), but it turned out South Georgia was both Jack and my favorite part of the cruise (we saw thousands of king penguins in their beautiful orange plumage, alongside their baby chicks, which looked like they were wearing lush fur coats).\n\nEvery day was a different adventure: hiking up snow-capped peaks; kayaking among icebergs looking for whales and seals; getting face-to-face with several types of penguins (we quickly learned the difference between rockhopper, macaroni, gentoo, Adelie, and chinstrap varieties).\n\nFar from GPAs and college chatter, surrounded instead by penguins, elephant seals, and endless ice, Jack's perspective started to shift. College stopped feeling like the entire world — and started looking like just one chapter.\n\nOne night we had dinner with Rich Pagen a naturalist and Kristen Wornson the Young Explorers guide. When Jack asked them how they knew what they wanted to do with their lives, they shared their experience of trying to find the right college and then moving into different career circles. It was great for Jack to hear that their path wasn't always straightforward, but they ultimately found jobs they loved.\n\nFor Jack to see people loving their jobs — and to realize that no one thought they'd end up where they did, leading expeditions in Antarctica — was a great wake-up call.\n\nAlso, because this was the family holiday cruise, several other families with teens were on board. It was great for Jack to get out of his comfort zone and talk to teens from all over the world. One was taking a gap year before college, and it really got him realizing that there are so many paths out there.\n\nThe trip also brought Jack and me closer together; away from the distractions of everyday life, we connected in a way that's rare during the teenage years.\n\nOn this trip, Jack and I always did the excursions together, and we ate dinner together every night. But on sea days, I attended every lecture, and he opted to go to the gym or sleep. By giving each other space, we really enjoyed the time we did spend together. I didn't nag him, and he, in turn, didn't give me an attitude.\n\nIt was one of our favorite trips together.",

    "fullText": "Netflix wants President Donald Trump's stamp of approval as it maneuvers to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNow, Trump has a demand for Netflix: unseat board member Susan Rice.\n\nIn normal times, we would all be marveling at the spectacle of the US president telling a company in the midst of a merger fight (Paramount also wants to buy Warner Bros. Discovery) how to structure its board. During Trump 2.0, though, this has become standard stuff. Trump routinely tells companies to fire someone he doesn't like or do something he does like.\n\nThat doesn't mean Trump always gets what he wants. The demands alone, however, are an extraordinary use of power. We should make sure we don't become inured to it.\n\nTrump's Truth Social post is a reminder that the future of Warner Bros. Discovery will run through the White House, no matter what Trump says at any given moment. (Refresher: In December, Trump said, \"I'll be involved\" in the fight between Netflix and Paramount. Earlier this month, he announced that \"I've decided I shouldn't be involved.\" Now he's telling Netflix it will \"pay the consequences\" if it doesn't fire Rice, which sure seems like he's involved again.)\n\nTrump himself doesn't have the authority to stop Warner Bros. Discovery from selling itself to Netflix or Paramount, which is controlled by David Ellison and his father, the prominent Trump supporter, Larry Ellison. He can, however, instruct Attorney General Pam Bondi to sue to stop a deal on antitrust grounds.\n\nModern presidents have traditionally assumed an arm's-length distance from federal law enforcement. And it's entirely possible that any other president's Department of Justice would also look into an antitrust case against Netflix, given its enormous market power.\n\nTrump, however, has made it clear that he expects Bondi to act on his behalf. So if he doesn't want Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, he can certainly make it more difficult for them.\n\nWhich makes it puzzling that Rice, who held senior roles in the Clinton, Obama, and Biden administrations, would sound off on a podcast, announcing that \"elites\" and \"corporate interests\" who accommodated Trump would one day \"be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\"\n\nThis wasn't a mere gaffe or misstatement. She went on at length. It was, regardless of how she intended it, a provocation aimed at the Trump White House — at the exact moment the company she's supposed to help govern is seeking Trump's approval.\n\nI've asked Netflix for comment on Rice's comments and Trump's response.\n\nWe should also note that Trump's most consistent trait is his inconsistency and that he frequently reverses himself. Last summer, for instance, he announced that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was \"highly CONFLICTED\" and must resign. Days later, Trump met with Tan and described him as a \"success.\" Weeks after that, the US government acquired 10% of Intel.\n\nNor does Trump always follow through. Last fall, he demanded that Microsoft fire Lisa Monaco, an executive who had also worked for Clinton, Obama, and Biden. Monaco still works for Microsoft.\n\nHowever, just because we don't know how serious Trump is about pushing Rice out of Netflix — or how his administration will ultimately rule on the Netflix/Paramount race — doesn't mean we should shrug this off.\n\nWe're in a place where the president routinely tells companies how to run their businesses and threatens them if they don't comply. If we get used to that, we shouldn't be surprised when future presidents decide they can do it, too.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "The Monday morning commute won't be messy in New York City. It will be nonexistent.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declared a state of emergency and a travel ban during a press conference on Sunday as a giant winter storm bore down on much of the Northeast.\n\nThe National Weather Service said to expect blizzard conditions and up to 20 inches of snow over the next 24 hours. Parts of New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts could get up to 25 inches.\n\n\"The state of emergency closes the streets, highways, and bridges of New York City for all traffic,\" Mamdani said. The travel ban begins at 9 p.m. Sunday and lasts until 12 p.m. on Monday. DoorDash, notably, also said it was suspending deliveries Sunday night.\n\nUS airlines, meanwhile, are canceling and delaying thousands of flights. As of Sunday afternoon, airlines had canceled over 3,000 flights and delayed over 2,900, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nNew York City's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports have the highest number of cancellations, followed by Newark Liberty International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and Boston Logan International Airport.\n\nAnyone hoping to catch a flight in the region on Monday can also expect major disruptions, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. At LaGuardia Airport, for example, 82% of flights scheduled for Monday have been canceled.\n\nAdding to what will likely be a chaotic 48 hours for travelers, the Department of Homeland Security announced Saturday night that it was suspending TSA PreCheck and Global Entry due to the partial government shutdown.\n\nDespite the announcement, however, TSA Precheck and Global Entry lanes remained open at major airports on Sunday. In a statement, the Transportation Security Administration said it is evaluating the situation \"case-by-case.\"\n\n\"At this time, TSA PreCheck remains operational with no change for the traveling public,\" a spokesperson said. \"As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case-by-case basis and adjust operations accordingly.\"\n\nThe federal government entered a partial shutdown earlier this month, delaying funding for some agencies, like DHS. TSA agents are essential workers, so they're still working — for now. During the full government shutdown earlier this year, TSA agents and air traffic controllers went 43 days without a paycheck.",

Flights already on their way to the region from the US turned around, and Air Canada said it was suspending operations to Puerto Vallarta.\n\n\"While no airports have been closed, roadblocks have impacted airline operations, with some domestic and international flights canceled in both Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta,\" the US State Department said. \"Seek shelter and remain in residences or hotels.\"\n\nAs the violence spread, the State Department updated its travel warning to include other popular tourist destinations in Mexico, including Cancún and Tulum.\n\nPuerto Vallarta is one of Mexico's most popular tourist destinations for Americans and Canadians. The area gained fame from the 70s and 80s show \"The Love Boat,\" which was often set there.\n\nThe Mexican government said the retaliatory violence came after it killed Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes, the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, on Sunday.\n\nThe State Department announced last week that it had sanctioned Kovay Gardens — a Mexican timeshare resort — and 17 other companies and five individuals linked to \"timeshare fraud schemes\" organized by the Jalisco cartel.\n\n\"Many of these individuals and entities are based in or near Puerto Vallarta, a popular tourist destination that also serves as a strategic stronghold for CJNG,\" a press release from the Treasury Department said.\n\nIn 2024, the US State Department said it would pay a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Cervantes. The department said that under Cervantes, the cartel has killed rival trafficking groups and law enforcement.",

Imageless electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) provides a non invasive alternative to electrical mapping from body surface potentials, but conventional ECGI is confined to epicardial reconstructions and can miss arrhythmias originating in deeper myocardium. We address this by reconstructing three dimensional cardiac activity with a volumetric formulation that solves an inverse source problem via Green's functions, enabling full volume activation mapping and improved localization in anatomically complex regions. We evaluate the approach on simulated premature ventricular beats and on four challenging patient cases, a right ventricular outflow tract premature ventricular contraction, a left bundle branch block, a ventricular tachycardia, and Wolff Parkinson White, and additionally assess performance on an open source myocardial infarction dataset. Results show that volumetric ECGI recovers 3D activation and sharpens arrhythmia origin localization, achieving a 59.",

    "fullText": "Oliver Glasner says it is \"absolutely OK\" to \"face criticism\" after some Crystal Palace fans again questioned his immediate future as manager.\n\nGlasner, who led the Eagles to their first major honour last May, said last month that he will leave the club when his contract expires in the summer.\n\nSome fans called for him to leave now during their Europa Conference League draw at Zrinjski Mostar in midweek, and a banner held during Sunday's Premier League win over bottom club Wolves said he is \"finished\".\n\nThat was the Eagles' first home win since early November and just their second overall since early December.\n\nAnother banner called the club's board \"inept\" as there had been \"opportunities missed\" since last season's FA Cup triumph.\n\nGlasner told Sky Sports after Sunday's 1-0 victory that he saw the banners and said: \"It's OK. The fans are as disappointed as we are and they can't talk to us directly, so it's their opportunity to express their mood.\n\n\"That's what we have to accept. On the other side, they supported the team right until the end and that's why I think they helped [us] to win the game. But when we face criticism, it's absolutely OK.\"\n\nAlthough Palace claimed their first win in 13 at Brighton two weeks ago, they then let a 2-0 lead slip to lose 3-2 at home to second-bottom Burnley.\n\nIn a news conference after Thursday's 1-1 draw in Bosnia, Glasner told disgruntled fans to \"stay humble\" and was far from convincing when asked whether he wants to stay at Selhurst Park until the summer, saying \"let's see what the future brings, you never know.\"\n\nOn if he has the drive to continue leading the club, he replied \"yes, I think so\" before adding \"I'm just not good enough to replace the players we sold. I'm just not good enough to integrate the new players to play the same way like we did, and I'm not good enough that we can cope with the schedule we had.\"\n\nBut Glasner provided more clarity after Sunday's game, stressing he remains committed to the club.\n\n\"For me, Oliver Glasner is not important,\" he told the BBC's Match of the Day. \"If the club had thought they need a change, then I don't want to be in the way. That is what I meant.\n\n\"I spoke to the board, to the chairman, to the sporting director and they said 'no, we think you are the right one'.\"\n\n'Stay humble' - Glasner reacts to fan backlash as future in doubt\n\nThe Austrian added: \"The most important thing is Crystal Palace, and I am here 100% to be successful for Crystal Palace.\n\n\"I need the players. It's important that the players are believing in what we are telling them - I and the staff. It's important that the club is believing in us, that we can get this turnaround and end this season successfully.\"\n\nThe Eagles were fortunate to beat Wolves, with Evann Guessand scoring a 90th-minute winner after the visitors missed a first-half penalty and spent more than 30 minutes with 10 men.\n\n\"Of course, the fans are like us all, disappointed with some results and some parts of the game. That's normal,\" said Glasner.\n\n\"I don't expect them to celebrate us when we don't win, when we don't perform right, but on the other side, since I was here, I felt support from the first day.\n\n\"Hopefully we face more wins and the mood around the club will be better and we will enjoy our life much more.\"\n\nLatest Crystal Palace news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Crystal Palace - what do you want to know?",

He's really trying to mould and adapt into what we want from him,\" said boss Mikel Arteta.\n\nIronically, Eze's other league goal this season came against his former side Palace in a 1-0 win in October, which means all his league goals this term have come against those two teams.\n\nAnd after his brace in Arsenal's latest thumping of their rivals, only Robert Pires (seven) and Emmanuel Adebayor (six) have more Premier League goals for the Gunners against Tottenham than Eze's five.\n\nHe is also the first Arsenal player to score five or more goals against an opponent in the same top-flight season since Adebayor against Derby in 2007-08 (six).\n\nSupporters had already taken to the 27-year-old because of the way he signed for the club, turning down Spurs to join them instead in a £60m deal, but the goals he has scored are the icing on the cake.\n\nArsenal pass derby test of nerve as title race looks set to go to wire\n\nEze Arsenal's derby hero again as leaders sink Tudor's Spurs\n\n'Who's going to get this fine?' - Arteta on derby technology delays\n\nIt's been a difficult period for Eze, who has found minutes in the league hard to come by and this was was only his second start in the league since December.\n\nHe has a tough route into the team with captain Martin Odegaard a key part of Arteta's first-choice midfield when he is fit and Leandro Trossard being in good form on the left wing, which is the other position Eze might feature.\n\nThe Arsenal boss did trial Eze on the left, but he switched off when Matty Cash scored Aston Villa's opener in their 2-1 defeat in December and, despite starting the following game, he was left on the substitute's bench for the next four league matches.\n\nArteta opted to play England winger Bukayo Saka from the start in the disappointing 2-2 draw with Wolves in midweek as a number 10 - ahead of Eze, who started on the bench.\n\nAnd the Spaniard admitted: \"He was upset, even with me, because I didn't play him the other day from the beginning, and some of the decisions that I made. And I just have to understand how we're going to get the best out of him now.\"\n\nArteta was asked by BBC Sport whether Eze's record of producing goals at the end of the season was one of the reasons they signed him.\n\n\"We looked at every stat, but that one, to be very honest, no,\" he added while laughing.\n\n\"He scored five goals in the last few games against them, which is extremely difficult to do. But I could see that he wanted to prove something.\"\n\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel was in attendance at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Eze will have hoped to have caught his eye after a recent lack of game time to boost his World Cup hopes this summer.\n\n\"Today it's worked out, we thank God for it,\" Eze told Sky Sports. \"We put in a good performance. We did what we needed to do, which was the main thing.\n\n\"I'm always trying to get in those positions to be ready and to find the space and to work hard to get those opportunities. It takes a lot to get there and it's worked out today.\"\n\nIt was also an important day for Eze's team-mate Viktor Gyokeres.\n\nThe Swedish international has been criticised at times this season for his performances but since the turn of the year has started to find some form.\n\nAnd after a double himself at Spurs, no Premier League player has scored more goals in 2026 across all competitions than Gyokeres with eight of his 15 for his club coming in this calendar year.\n\nThe 27-year-old linked up with Eze and played a big part in Arsenal's third goal, while he seemed to visibly grow in confidence after scoring.\n\n\"For me, the best, the most complete, and especially when we need him most and that is when big players and big clubs have to stand up when you are needed,\" added Arteta when asked about his £64m summer signing from Sporting.\n\nArsenal are now five points clear of Manchester City, although they have played one more game and visit Pep Guardiola's men at Etihad Stadium in April - and Eze and Gyokeres look like they are starting to find the net at just the right time.\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, launching a book tour widely seen as a prelude to a presidential run, discussed with CNN the possibility of running against former Vice President Kamala Harris, another longtime figure in California politics.\n\n“What happens if and when those parallel careers intersect and collide?” CNN’s Dana Bash asked Newsom in an interview that aired Sunday.\n\n“Well, I’m San Francisco now, she’s LA,” Newsom said at first. “So there’s a little distance between the two of us. You know, fate will determine that.”\n\n“I’ve never gotten in the way of her ambition, ever,” he added. “I haven’t. And I don’t imagine I would in the future.”\n\n“But if you run against each other for president,” Bash followed up. Newsom responded, “Yeah I just – that’s fate. I don’t – you know, you can only control what you can control.”\n\nNewsom has been forthright about his interest in the 2028 presidential race. Harris opted out of running to succeed Newsom as California governor but has left open the possibility of a third presidential bid.\n\nHarris served as district attorney in San Francisco before being elected the California attorney general and then a US senator before serving as vice president. Newsom was San Francisco’s mayor prior to becoming lieutenant governor and then governor.\n\nThe two have collided at times – Harris wrote in her most recent book, “107 Days,” that when she called Newsom to ask for his support after former President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid, Newsom texted back, “Hiking. Will call back,” and never did. (Newsom, who did endorse Harris quickly, later told reporters the call came from an unknown number.)\n\nSpeaking to Bash, Newsom emphasized that he would carefully weigh the decision with his family. Asked if his family was on board, Newsom responded, “I don’t know. It depends on the day.”\n\nAnd he shared concerns from one of his sons about a potential presidential bid.\n\n“My son … it was very powerful, texted me a few months ago when there was some headline that suggested that I made some decision, and he goes, ‘Dad, are you running (for) president?” Newsom said.\n\nHe continued, “I said, no, we’ll make this decision as a family. And he goes, you can’t. And I said, why? He goes, ‘I’m too young. You need to spend more time with us.’\n\n“I mean, how do you deal with that one?” he said.\n\n“How do you deal with that one?” Bash responded.\n\n“Exactly – I’m asking you,” Newsom replied with a smile.",

    "fullText": "People use artificial intelligence (AI) for many things: meal planning, budgeting and interior design. But can you use a platform like ChatGPT for tasks that normally require a professional, like financial planning? \n\nI chose a hypothetical scenario and asked ChatGPT to construct a retirement plan that would allow a retiree to live on $100,000 a year. I assumed an annual income of $125,000 for a 40-year-old who wants to retire in a fully paid-off home in Tennessee at age 65. After setting the parameters (and asking ChatGPT if they were realistic) I asked the generative AI to create a retirement plan.\n\nThen, I asked Eric Franklin, CFP, managing principal at Prospero Wealth to review and assess it.\n\nWhen I first reached out, Franklin said it sounded interesting; he’d never been enlisted to critique an AI system before. With 23 years of tech experience, he was the perfect choice.\n\n“I had no idea what I was going to get,” he said.\n\nThe results were alarming. Not because ChatGPT’s output was immediately, obviously awful or right on the money.  It was scary because it fell into a gray area that artists call “the uncanny valley.”\n\nAt first glance, ChatGPT didn’t seem to be completely wrong.\n\nFind Out: Here’s How Much You Need To Retire With a $100K Lifestyle\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\n“I read it through and, at first, at the top level, it passed the sniff test. It looked fairly realistic,” Franklin said. “If I weren’t pushing on it too hard, I’d probably feel like it was somewhat accurate. Those were my first impressions.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the plan I presented was only one aspect of what financial advisors at Prospero Wealth offer clients. “It doesn’t include a lot of the things we’d normally include, like stress tests, accounting for changes in your career, changes in your family or possible relocations.”\n\nBut as Franklin dove deeper, he realized something that could be dangerous for anyone trying to use ChatGPT as a retirement planning tool without knowledge and experience to back it up.\n\nIt started with false premises, failed to adjust for inflation and created an unrealistic scenario. Granted, there were limitations in the exercise because the prompt was designed to be broad and concise. It was written by someone who is not a financial planner and intentionally didn’t flag anything that seemed off throughout the process. This prompt was designed for someone who thinks they can use ChatGPT to help them plan for retirement, plugging in basic information and expecting actionable insights. That probably describes a lot of people using ChatGPT.",

    "description": "General Caine warned Trump an attack on Iran would be \"far more difficult\" than the operation that captured Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is weighing options to avoid a major military conflict with Iran if the country does not ditch its nuclear program after General Dan “Raizin” Caine told him an attack would be “far more difficult” than the operation that captured Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, The New York Times reported on Sunday evening.\n\nThe report said Trump and key members of his administration are heading to Geneva on Thursday to meet with Iranian negotiators; the meeting appears to be a “last-ditch” effort to avoid a military conflict.\n\n“President Trump has told advisers that if diplomacy or any initial targeted U.S. attack does not lead Iran to give in to his demands that it give up its nuclear program, he will consider a much bigger attack in coming months intended to drive that country’s leaders from power,” the report said, based on “people briefed on internal administration deliberations.”\n\nThe Times story has four reporters on the byline — Julian E. Barnes, David E. Sanger, Tyler Pager, and Eric Schmitt.\n\nMembers of Trump’s team and on the Iranian side are both considering an “off-ramp to military conflict,” which would include a “very limited nuclear enrichment program” that would only be used for medical research, the report said. That is because some members of the administration have expressed “doubts” a full dismantling of Iran’s nuclear program occur, if the U.S. only conducts airstrikes.\n\nHere is a key section on Caine warning Trump that attacking Iran could be harder than first expected:\n\nDuring the discussions of the operation last month to seize President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, General Caine told Mr. Trump there was a high likelihood of success. But General Caine has not been able to deliver the same reassurances to Mr. Trump during the Iran discussions, in large measure because it is a far more difficult target.\n\n[Vice President JD] Vance, who has long called for more restraint in overseas military action, did not oppose a strike, but he intensely questioned General Caine and Mr. Ratcliffe in the meeting. He pressed them to share their opinions of the options and wanted more of a discussion of the risks and complexity of carrying out a strike against Iran.\n\nThe report comes a few days after CBS senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs reported top military officials told Trump the military is ready for a potential strike as soon as this weekend. And Axios’s Barak Ravid reported on February 18 that “a U.S. military operation in Iran would likely be a massive, weeks-long campaign that would look more like full-fledged war than last month’s pinpoint operation in Venezuela, sources say.”\n\nAll of this comes amid months of protests against Iran’s theocratic regime inside the country.\n\nThe Times report added Trump is leaving open the possibility for a “military assault later this year intended to help topple Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It appears this could go a number of ways heading into the big summit this Thursday.\n\nThe post US Mulling an ‘Off Ramp’ On Iran As Top General Advises Trump Iran Attack Would Be ‘Far More Difficult’ Than Venezuela: NYT first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Arsenal passed the north London derby test with flying colours as Premier League title race looks likely to go to the wire, says chief football writer Phil McNulty",
    "fullText": "Arsenal answered questions posed about their nerve under pressure in the most emphatic fashion in the north London derby to suggest this is a Premier League race that will go down to the wire.\n\nThe manner in which Mikel Arteta's side collapsed in losing a two-goal lead at doomed Wolverhampton Wanderers saw old uncertainties and past pain resurface as hunters Manchester City scented blood.\n\nIt made the meeting with arch-rivals Spurs even more hazardous, especially with the toxic air around this dysfunctional club partly cleared by the sacking of unpopular head coach Thomas Frank and his replacement by Igor Tudor.\n\nArsenal need not have worried as, even with the imposing figure of the giant Croatian prowling his technical area clad in black, they were the beneficiaries of the latest cure prescribed by \"Dr. Tottenham\", always on hand to provide help to any opponent in times of strife.\n\nThe Spurs stadium announcer attempted to rally the crowd with a growled pre-match message delivered at ear-splitting volume, bellowing: \"They are worried. They are nervous as hell. We are calm. We are ready. The fire is ready to be lit.\"\n\nSadly for Spurs, the final score on that one was zero out of five.\n\nArsenal were the furthest thing from \"nervous as hell.\" Spurs were the furthest thing from calm and ready. No fires lit here.\n\nSpurs were almost cruelly outclassed as Arsenal's advantage at the top of the table returned to five points, although Pep Guardiola's City have a game in hand.\n\nEze 'wanted to prove something' as he torments Spurs again\n\nEze Arsenal's derby hero again as leaders sink Tudor's Spurs\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nTo sum up this latest Premier League weekend, Manchester City threw down the gauntlet by closing the gap to two points with a tension-filled win against Newcastle United. Arsenal picked it up with relish in this thumping 4-1 win.\n\nIt means that even before the end of February, sights are starting to turn to what might just be a title decider between City and Arsenal at Etihad Stadium on 18 April.\n\nIn the interim, Arsenal have home games against Chelsea, Everton and Bournemouth, along with a visit to Brighton. City travel to Leeds United, West Ham and Chelsea, with relegation strugglers Nottingham Forest to come to the Etihad.\n\nAnd, of course, there might just be a psychological blow to be struck when Arsenal and City meet in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on Sunday 22 March.\n\nArsenal are now 10 games from the glory that has eluded them since Arsene Wenger's \"Invincibles\" in 2003-04. Destiny is their hands. The twist in the tale is that the same applies to Manchester City.\n\nFor all Arsenal might have wished to play down the significance of this single game in the title context, it was a win and performance they needed desperately to calm concerns on and off the pitch.\n\nAnd this was a consummate display, cool and measured with a ruthless edge, even if it came against this dreadfully poor Spurs side.\n\nEberechi Eze picked the perfect time to return to his best, playing his part as derby tormentor again with two goals to add to the three he got in the 4-1 win at Emirates Stadium in December.\n\nSince that hat-trick, Eze had featured in all 15 of Arsenal's subsequent league games, but had made only four starts and played just 360 minutes before this derby.\n\nIn his last start he was substituted at half-time against Brentford, so credit to Arteta for having the instinct to feel that this was the sort of occasion to suit him, deploying him in the \"number 10\" role against the club who thought they had signed him until Arsenal stepped in to clinch a £60m deal with Crystal Palace.\n\nAnd there was more good news with much-criticised striker Viktor Gyokeres also scoring two fine goals on a perfect day for the Gunners and their ecstatic fanbase.\n\nArsenal were not knocked out of their stride, even after Randal Kolo Muani's bustling equaliser for Spurs two minutes after Eze struck the first blow. This was a confident, reassuring performance.\n\nArteta told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"This was outstanding. I think you have to bring context to the situation and this is the beauty of football.\n\n\"You go to Wolves and you drop two points in the last kick of the match. Watching it back, there is no understanding from my perception how the hell that happened.\n\n\"It feels like the end of the world, but then you have another opportunity and that is the beauty of it. In a difficult stadium, against our rivals, and seeing how much it means to us in the league and all our supporters.\"\n\nHe added: \"This chapter we wanted to write. We have managed it.\"\n\nBBC Sport pundit Danny Murphy expects the race between the two to go right to the finishing line.\n\nHe said: \"The title race is still on massively for both. It's in both their hands, that's unusual. Normally it's in one team's hands and you are just waiting for them to slip up.\n\n\"I have been very much in the Arsenal camp in terms of my eyes telling me they are the best team. The last couple of results have given Man City that little bit of hope. They have a lot of players in the squad who have been there and done it.\n\n\"Speaking from experience, when you have got over the line, the next couple feel easier. Every time Arsenal go on the pitch the pressure is on at the minute. It's great for us and I hope it goes to the wire. I don't see any winning all games from now until the end of the season.\"\n\nArsenal's nerve was put the test. They passed - and more tests will come for the Gunners and Manchester City as the Premier League pursuit reaches its climax.\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team",

    "description": "Liverpool's late 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest puts the Reds firmly in the Champions League hunt after a \"robbery\" of a victory at the City Ground.",
    "fullText": "Carnage would be an understatement to describe the closing moments of Liverpool's victory at the City Ground, but it would not be over the top to call the win a heist - one that puts Arne Slot's side firmly in the Champions League hunt.\n\nThe fact that Nottingham Forest boss Vitor Pereira said he was \"angry with football\" summed it up. Forest did not deserve to lose.\n\nFor large parts of the afternoon, the home fans chanted \"In your head, Arne, Arne, Arne\" to the tune of Zombie by The Cranberries as Pereira's side dominated the defending champions.\n\nBefore today, Slot had failed to beat Forest in any of his previous three attempts as Liverpool boss.\n\nYet as the Liverpool players made their way to the away end after snatching a remarkable victory through Alexis Mac Allister, the same chant came from the travelling support, who could hardly believe their luck.\n\nLiverpool were dull for most parts but deserve praise for their resilience and the importance of Mac Allister's 97th-minute winner cannot be underestimated in the sense that it took Liverpool level on points with Chelsea and Manchester United, in fourth and fifth.\n\n\"It's one of the biggest robberies I've seen in the Premier League this season,\" said Jamie Carragher on Sky Sports.\n\nFor Slot, who has regularly insisted that Liverpool have been unfortunate on many an occasion this season, there was an acceptable that his side had finally got the rub of the green.\n\n\"My emotions were emotions of happiness and relief because this is the first time I have to do a different post match press conference,\" said Slot.\n\n\"We did not play a good game. We have been on the wrong side of the score after a good performance too many times.\n\n\"We got more than we deserved. A draw would have been a fair result. We needed to be on the right side of things once in a while. It felt we have been lucky.\"\n\nThe first was his disallowed goal that came after Stefan Ortega had made a great save to deny Hugo Ekitike. As Ola Aina tried to clear the ball, it hit Mac Allister and flew into the net. But what would have been a fortuitous goal was chalked off because the ball was deemed to have hit his elbow, which was tight to his body.\n\n\"It hit my back and my elbow. I understand the rule but if you understand football, that goal should have stood,\" Mac Allister told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The first half wasn't good at all; positioning, pressing, intensity. It was not our standard. The second half, I wouldn't say it was good but it was better,\" he added.\n\nMac Allister scores late winner in frantic finish at Forest\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nFor Liverpool, the journey back to Merseyside will be sweet. There really is nothing like a late winner, particularly in extra time of extra time as Slot stated, but the Dutchman will know that his team must improve.\n\nMohamed Salah had an off day and though he has upped his workrate off the ball since returning from the Africa Cup of Nations, he has now gone nine Premier League games without a goal.\n\nAgainst Forest he was replaced by Rio Ngumoha, who put in the cross that led to Mac Allister's disallowed goal, and once again showed exactly why he's so highly rated with an energetic performance.\n\n\"Ngumoha came on and had a bigger impact than Salah,\" was the verdict of BBC pundit Pat Nevin on Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"He absolutely changed the game, this kid,\" said Carragher.\n\nSlot added: \"He has incredible potential, otherwise, at 17 years of age, you don't play as many minutes as he does in the Premier League, let alone at Liverpool.\n\n\"I don't think there is any other 17-year-old who has played as many minutes in the Premier League.\n\n\"That tells you how much of a talent we think he is. He is making progress and that's why you see him playing more and more.\"\n\nNgumoha is yet to start a Premier League game for Liverpool but surely the wait won't be long now.\n\n\"He gets stronger and stronger,\" added Slot. \"Apart from his moment when he had his one-v-one, there were also one or two other moments where he stood his ground.\n\n\"For him to show this already at 17 years of age, it says something about his talent.\n\n\"But as we all know, talent is only the start of his career, you need so many other things. Macca is a great example of mentality and that is something you need to have a career at this level.\"\n\nLiverpool certainly didn't scintillate with their display in the Midlands but they showed the resilience of champions.\n\nAnd there is still plenty of life in their season yet.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Grounded until at least April, NASA’s giant moon rocket is headed back to the hangar this week for more repairs before astronauts climb aboard.\n\nThe space agency said Sunday it’s targeting Tuesday for the slow, four-mile (6.4-kilometer) trek across Kennedy Space Center, weather permitting.\n\nNASA had barely finished a repeat fueling test Thursday, to ensure dangerous hydrogen fuel leaks were plugged, when another problem cropped up.\n\nThis time, the rocket’s helium system malfunctioned, further delaying astronauts’ first trip to the moon in more than half a century.\n\nEngineers had just tamed the hydrogen leaks and settled on a March 6 launch date — already a month late — when the helium issue arose. The helium flow to the rocket's upper stage was disrupted; helium is needed to purge the engines and pressurize the fuel tanks.\n\n“Returning to the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy is required to determine the cause of the issue and fix it,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\nNASA said the quick rollback preps preserve an April launch attempt, but stressed that will depend on how the repairs go. The space agency has only a handful of days any given month to launch the crew of four around the moon and back.\n\nThe three Americans and one Canadian assigned to the Artemis II mission remain on standby in Houston. They will become the first people to fly to the moon since NASA's Apollo program that sent 24 astronauts there from 1968 through 1972.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "Wayne Gretzky is on hand for the men's gold medal game between the United States and Canada on Sunday.\n\nYou would think that it would be obvious that Gretzky, the Chosen One, would be rooting for Canada. Gretzky was born and raised in Canada. He's widely considered the greatest hockey player of all-time. But in recent years, Gretzky has been friendly with President Trump, who has threatened Canada and suggested that it could become America's 51st state.\n\nGretzky was asked who he'll be rooting for on Sunday. He's making it clear he's rooting for Canada.\n\n“I’m a hockey player. I’m a Canadian, a true Canadian. I want Canada 🇨🇦 to win a gold medal. I’ve never wavered from that. I’ve been friends with prime minsters and presidents. Somehow there’s been a little bit more tension than normal. At the end of the day, Canada and the US are like brothers and sisters, they’re gonna fight and argue but eventually they’ll come together. That’s the way I see it,\" he said.\n\nGretzky has faced criticism for his friendship and relationship with President Trump, amid the ongoing U.S.-Canada tensions.\n\nBut while Gretzky has faced criticism, he hasn't backed down.\n\n“People are going to say and believe what they want,” Gretzky said on an episode of the “100% Hockey” podcast co-hosted by Darren Millard and John Shannon. “The bottom line is, I know in my heart I’m Canadian, I’ve stayed Canadian and I’m a Canadian for life.”\n\nGretzky has been booed by some Canadians, which he's glad his late father hasn't been around to see.\n\n“You’ve got to take the good with the bad,” Gretzky said. “I’m glad he didn’t have to see it.”\n\nWhile Gretzky has been friendly with President Trump, he claims he's not really into politics.\n\n“I’m Canadian,” Gretzky said. “I can’t vote in the U.S. because I live in the U.S. and I’m Canadian. I can’t vote in Canada because I don’t live in Canada.\n\n“I’m not into politics. And so I can’t stop the prime minister from saying something. I can’t stop the president from saying something. I just kind of like, well, I’m just a hockey player, simple as that.”",

    "fullText": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. (AP) — Over and over, the Republicans and former Republicans who gathered just outside Washington this weekend warned that President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress are tearing at the very fabric of American democracy.\n\nA former congressman described the president's party as an “authoritarian-embracing cult.” A prominent conservative writer said Trumpism is an \"existential threat.\" And a retired Army general, his voice shaking with emotion, cited post-Nazi Germany as a roadmap for the nation's post-Trump recovery.\n\nIt's unclear how many people are listening.\n\nThe main convention hall at the sixth annual Principles First summit on Saturday and Sunday was half empty. About 750 chairs were set up in a room that could have fit thousands, and many were unfilled. Not a single current Republican elected official participated in the two-day program.\n\nThis is what remains of the Grand Old Party’s Never Trump movement, a coalition of Republicans, former Republicans and independents who banded together as Trump consolidated power. They largely remain political exiles — not quite at home among Democrats yet disgusted by how the president has abandoned Republicans' longstanding commitments to free trade and limited government.\n\nJohn McDowell, 69, who was a lifelong Republican before Trump’s emergence, acknowledged that the diminished group had virtually “zero” political clout within his former party.\n\n“It’s just a fact. We’re losing good people,” said McDowell, a former Capitol Hill staffer and county Republican official from San Carlos, California. “The party is becoming more and more MAGA-fied.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson dismissed all the criticism from what she called “a bunch of deranged has-been politicians.”\n\n“The only people who will pay attention to this event are the journalists who are forced to cover it,” she said.\n\nVirtually everyone who gathered at the hotel in National Harbor, Maryland, said they are rooting for Democratic victories in this fall's midterm elections. One of the only Democrats there was Conor Lamb, a former congressman from Pennsylvania who lost his party's primary to John Fetterman four years ago.\n\nDespite dire concerns, there was a slight sense of optimism among the half-empty convention hall and quiet hotel hallways.\n\nSeveral people cheered last week’s Supreme Court decision to strike down Trump’s tariffs, the economic tool he has wielded without congressional approval in his attempt to force friends and foes around the globe to bend to his will. Trump insisted he would implement a new round of tariffs despite the ruling.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a former Trump adviser, highlighted recent AP-NORC polling showing that 1 in 4 Republicans nationwide do not approve of Trump's job performance.\n\n“It’s like any show that’s on TV for a long time — the ratings start to go down. And the ratings are going down,” Christie said. “I am willing to bet you that by next February, this room is going to be twice the size of what it is now. After the midterms, you watch.”\n\nEx-MAGA diehard Rich Logis, wearing a red “I left MAGA hat,” hopes to see “an electoral revolt against MAGA” in the midterms.\n\n“I think there’s a shift in our country right now,\" he said. \"It happens slowly.\"\n\nLogis was promoting support groups for friends and family of Trump loyalists at a table outside the convention hall. Nearby, someone was selling books about how to escape cults.\n\nAt the podium, former Republican Rep. Joe Walsh implored Trump's critics not to downplay the seriousness of the threat the president poses to the nation.\n\n“He’s everything our founders feared. Say it. Believe it,” Walsh said. He said his former party is “an authoritarian-embracing cult\" and \"a threat to everything I love.”\n\nRetired Gen. Mark Hertling, who once commanded the U.S. Army's European forces, said he's “haunted” by allies who ask him “whether American institutions ever can be trusted again.”\n\n“Our nation's institutions have been shaken. Our alliances have been strained. Our credibility has been damaged. And our nation’s values have been cast aside,” Hertling said. He suggested the U.S. should look to the reconstruction of Germany after the defeat of Nazism if it hoped to to restore the damage caused by Trump and his allies.\n\nThe nation's recovery, he said as his voiced cracked, would be something people have to earn over many years.\n\nBill Kristol, who worked in previous Republican administrations and helped found the Weekly Standard magazine, described Trump and his Republican supporters in Congress as “an existential threat” to the nation. But he was also optimistic about the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nKristol said Democrats are “almost certain to win the House,” “could possibly win the Senate,” and have “a good chance to win the presidency” in 2028.\n\nBrittany Martinez, executive director of the host organization Principles First, also tried to cast an optimistic tone, even after describing the many reasons why she couldn't bear to continue her career as a Republican staffer on Capitol Hill.\n\n“I hope that Republicans continue to wake up,” she said. “I do think that those folks exist. And I hope that they exist in greater numbers.”",

    "description": "MOTD pundit Danny Murphy explains why, as well as Arsenal's superior quality in Sunday's north London derby, they exploited Tottenham's tactical weakness too.",
    "fullText": "Arsenal's superior quality ultimately showed in their 4-1 north London derby win, but they were also very clever with the way they exposed Tottenham's tactical weaknesses too.\n\nSpurs' 3-5-2 shape under new boss Igor Tudor, and the fact they did not just sit in, left space for Arsenal to exploit in forward areas on Sunday.\n\nThe Gunners ran away with the game in the end but, in the first half, when it was still in the balance, the area where they had the most attacking edge was down their right-hand side, where Bukayo Saka and Jurrien Timber were dominant.\n\nIt's never easy to stop a team like Arsenal when so many of their players are playing well, but what the Gunners did really well was produce moments of quality or skill in attack when it mattered.\n\nThey looked back to the levels we have seen them perform at for so long this season - this was a great performance by them, not just a brilliant result.\n\nArsenal pass derby test of nerve as title race looks set to go to wire\n\n'Who's going to get this fine?' - Arteta on derby technology delays\n\nEze 'wanted to prove something' as he torments Spurs again\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nTimber is one of the best attacking right-backs in the Premier League, if not the world, and I have seen him cause many teams problems with the way he mixes his runs up - sometimes he supports, sometimes he overlaps and he can make runs inside too. He is an intelligent footballer.\n\nSaka has had a few people question him recently, but against Spurs he was back on it and back to his confident best.\n\nWith the understanding those two have got, it was always going to be difficult to stop them down Arsenal's right but it was even harder for Spurs because they were reactive rather than proactive in dealing with the danger.\n\nAt times Xavi Simons, who was playing as a second striker, was having to run back to the left-back position to help. On other occasions it was Pape Matar Sarr coming over from midfield, or Mickey van de Ven covering from centre-half.\n\nSpurs' system saw Simons and Sarr left to cover long distances to get back and it also meant there was often a mixture of someone who is not used to defending in those areas - as Sarr was when he was left one-on-one with Saka for Arsenal's first goal - and also not being sure who was doing what, and when.\n\nThat's not ideal against any team, let alone one as good as Arsenal, and Mikel Arteta's side started getting more and more joy down that flank, with Timber often having time on the ball to pick his passes - like he did to find Viktor Gyokeres for their second goal.\n\nTottenham battled really well in the first half and, although the game got away from them after the break, it wasn't through any lack of effort.\n\nThey were set up okay too, but I think it did help Arsenal that Spurs were at home and under a new manager because they were expected to have a go rather than just park the bus.\n\nSpurs tried to press Arsenal at times which leaves you open to counter-attacks and also leaves space in behind, which the Gunners are good at exploiting.\n\nIn the second half, Arsenal's quality shone through and Tottenham looked tired - their lack of numbers because of injuries began to show.\n\nStill, what was impressive from Arsenal when they were 2-1 up is that they did not sit back and try to see out time.\n\nInstead, they were quite ruthless and kept coming forward. That's understandable when you think about what happened to them on Wednesday when they were pegged back by Wolves after leading 2-0.\n\nI wondered what would happen if they got in front this time, and they had obviously talked about what they would do differently.\n\nSo, from that point of view, because of the doubts over their mentality after their past couple of results, it was important to see them play so positively.\n\nThe same applies for some of their individual players, as well as the whole team.\n\nAs well as his two goals, Eberechi Eze had a great game overall. I was pleased for him because he has had a few question marks over his form recently, and we know he is a super talent.\n\nWith him playing so well in the central areas as a number 10, Tottenham's midfielders had something else to worry about - and being busy there meant they could not easily help deal with Saka and Timber out wide.\n\nDeclan Rice was making all these runs too, bursting forward to try to make amends for his mistake for Tottenham's equaliser, so there was all sorts going on.\n\nRice is always influential, of course, but he was especially impressive here. Instead of dwelling on his mistake, he used it to focus and bring more energy and clarity to what he was doing.\n\nWhen he dropped into defence after that, he played it simple and quick with his goalkeeper or centre-half - he didn't risk anything again.\n\nBut when he was going the other way, he was trying everything - making runs, getting on the end of knockdowns, bombing forward and occupying defenders.\n\nHe is always totally focused anyway so it is hard to judge exactly how much difference that mistake made to his performance but it felt to me like he actually upped his game, which takes great mental strength.\n\nThere have been times in the past where, when you are playing Arsenal, Saka and Odegaard are the two players you know you need to stop.\n\nTeams would think, if you can condense play in their areas, you can control them - and if it goes over to another part of the pitch, you can cope with it.\n\nOn Sunday, however, it felt like Arsenal were coming from every angle in the end. Eze, especially, was getting on the ball in these pockets of space in front of the Spurs defence.\n\nThat helped Gyokeres too, because it meant there was more room for him as well.\n\nGyokeres had started well anyway, and had a great early chance which he made himself, but this ended up being one of his best games in an Arsenal shirt.\n\nIt probably helped that he had a yard of pace on Radu Dragusin, who is not the quickest defender, but he played on him nicely and it was clever of him to stay on the left side.\n\nI remember watching a lot of Gyokeres' goals for Sporting and he liked to come off that flank a lot, and we have not seen him do it enough this season.\n\nThat might change now and, when he got his first goal, it was like the weight had been lifted off his shoulders.\n\nSome of the Arsenal fans who are not convinced by him are going to be more on his side now he has scored twice against Tottenham, and his goals were top quality too.\n\nI'd say that was one of his best games in an Arsenal shirt and to do it in a north London derby will do him the world of good.\n\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "fullText": "Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare and Sunderland winger Romaine Mundle have become the latest Premier League players to be sent racist abuse on social media on an \"appalling weekend\" when four footballers from the top tier of the English game were targeted.\n\nArokodare and Mundle detailed their experiences on Sunday, a day after Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri and Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana both received racist abuse on Instagram after their sides drew 1-1 at Stamford Bridge.\n\n\"This has been an appalling weekend after four players called out the racist abuse they've received on social media,\" anti-discrimination group Kick It Out said on Sunday evening. \"But the sad fact is, we know it happens regularly.\n\n\"The message from them is loud and clear: action must follow. Players cannot be expected to tolerate this behaviour, and nor should anyone else.\"\n\nWolves said they were \"disgusted\" after Arokodare was sent abuse by \"multiple perpetrators\" following his side's 1-0 loss at Crystal Palace and they condemned the \"abhorrent and unlawful behaviour in the strongest possible terms\".\n\nBoth the Nigeria international and Wolves shared a number of screenshots of private messages the 25-year-old received after the game in which he had a first-half penalty saved, before Evann Guessand scored an injury-time Palace winner.\n\n\"It's still unbelievable to me that we're playing in a time where people have so much freedom to communicate such racism without any consequences,\" wrote Arokodare on his Instagram story.\n\n\"These individuals should have no place in our game and collectively we have to take action to punish everyone who taints the sport like this, no matter who they are.\"\n\nIn a statement, Wolves added: \"Tolu has our full and unwavering support. No player should be subjected to such hatred simply for doing their job.\n\n\"We stand firmly alongside him, and alongside all footballers who are forced to endure this abuse from anonymous accounts acting with apparent impunity.\n\nSunderland said they are \"appalled by the vile\" abuse Mundle received after his substitute appearance in the 3-1 home defeat by Fulham.\n\nThey said: \"The abhorrent behaviour displayed by multiple individuals is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the club under any circumstances.\n\n\"These individuals do not represent Sunderland AFC, our values, or our community - and they are not welcome on Wearside.\"\n\nThe Sunderland Echo reported the 22-year-old English forward has since deleted his Instagram account.\n\nIn February 2025 while playing in the Championship for the Black Cats, Mundle shared a discriminatory post sent to him on his Instagram account.\n\nWolves and Sunderland said they are working with the relevant authorities and online platforms to identify those responsible.\n\nThe Premier League condemned the abuse and said there are \"serious consequences for anybody found guilty of discrimination and we will offer our full support with their investigations\", which can include club bans and legal prosecution.\n\nOn Saturday, Frenchman Fofana wrote: \"2026, it's still the same thing, nothing changes. These people are never punished.\n\n\"You create big campaigns against racism, but nobody actually does anything.\"\n\nTunisia international Mejbri, 23, called on people to \"educate yourself and your kids\".\n\nThese latest incidences of racist abuse towards players follow the alleged racial abuse of Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr during last week's Champions League knockout round play-off tie at Benfica, which Uefa is investigating.\n\nIn a statement earlier on Sunday, Kick It Out said: \"Players are standing up to discrimination, and we've had record reports to Kick It Out from across football this season, but we recognise the frustration in how it continues to fester online.\n\n\"Words matter, but actions are more important. Football is working together to tackle this issue alongside the UK Football Policing Unit and Ofcom, but social media companies must do more to offer protections to players and help improve accountability when incidents occur.\n\n\"Those who face this disgusting abuse must always be the priority.\"\n\nResponding to the Fofana and Mejbri abuse, a spokesperson for Meta told BBC Sport: \"No-one should be subjected to racist abuse, and we remove this content when we find it.\n\n\"No one thing will stop racist behaviour overnight, but we'll continue working to protect our community from abuse and co-operate with police investigations.\"\n\nLast November, a BBC investigation found more than 2,000 extremely abusive social media posts - including death and rape threats - were sent about managers and players in the Premier League and Women's Super League in a single weekend.\n\nThe season-opening Premier League game between Liverpool and Bournemouth last August was stopped in the first half after then-Cherries forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by someone in the Anfield crowd.\n\nA Liverpool man has denied the abuse and his trial is scheduled to take place in April.\n\nIn January, Newcastle United said they had contacted the police after midfielder Joe Willock was the subject of \"disgusting\" racial abuse and \"deeply disturbing threats\" on social media.\n\nTottenham forward Mathys Tel was also the subject of racist abuse on social media after being one of two Spurs players to miss in their Super Cup penalty shootout defeat by Paris St-Germain in August.\n\nEngland defender Jess Carter was another target of racist abuse during Euro 2025 in July.\n\nAnd England internationals Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were all subjected to racism in the aftermath of the Euro 2020 final, which the Three Lions lost to Italy in a penalty shootout.\n\nLatest Wolves news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Wolves - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "The Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics have officially ended following the closing ceremony in northern Italy.\n\nIt took place at Verona Olympic Arena, despite none of the sporting events happening in the city, which is 75 miles from Milan.\n\nAfter beginning with a tribute to classic Italian opera, flagbearers representing the 92 competing nations entered the stadium through large props from Aida and accompanied by a tribute to Italian film music.\n\nThe 'Drop of Fire' – the Olympic flame carried in a small glass vessel – was brought into the ancient arena to light up the rings before the parade of athletes.\n\nWhile athletes are supposed to come in all mixed together, here they were still largely in national groups.\n\nThe final medals from Milan-Cortina 2026 were awarded in the women's and men's 50km mass start cross-country skiing events, before a tribute to the Games volunteers.\n\nThe ceremony finished with performances from popular Italian musicians Major Lazer and singer-songwriter Achille Lauro.\n\nIn her speech to close the Games, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Kirsty Coventry said: \"You have been incredible – every one of you. Brave. Fearless. Full of heart and passion. You left it all on the snow and ice.\n\n\"Two unforgettable weeks, living every moment to the fullest. You gave everything – and you shared it with all of us.\n\n\"This is the true Olympic spirit: competing, embracing, lifting each other up, whatever the result. You showed us what excellence, respect, and friendship look like in a world that sometimes forgets these values.\n\n\"You showed us that the Olympic Games are a place for everyone. A place where sport brings us together.\"\n\nIt ended a Games which saw 116 medal events, and historic sporting success for several of the competing nations – including Great Britain.\n\nTeam GB won five medals, including three golds, to finish 15th in the table. Britain has never previously won more than one gold at a Games before.\n\nMatt Weston, the male flagbearer, won two golds in skeleton – the men's event and the team competition with Tabby Stoeker.\n\nThe female GB flagbearer was Charlotte Bankes, who won gold in the team snowboard cross with Huw Nightingale; it was the first Olympic event on snow won by British athletes.\n\nTeam GB also won silver in the men's curling, while Zoe Atkin claimed bronze in women's ski halfpipe on the final day.\n\nBrazil's Lucas Pinheiro Braathen took the men's giant slalom title to register a first Winter Olympic gold won by a South American nation.\n\nWhy 2026 marks a Winter Olympic turning point for Team GB\n\nWeird and wonderful stories from the Winter Olympics\n\nUSA win men's Olympic ice hockey gold for first time in 46 years\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nGeorgia earned their first Winter Olympic medal with silver in pairs figure skating, while Spain collected their first gold medal for 54 years in the men's ski mountaineering. Benin, Guinea-Bissau and United Arab Emirates competed in their first Winter Games.\n\nFor hosts Italy, Milan-Cortina marked their best Winter Games with 10 golds among 30 medals to put them fourth in the table.\n\nNorway topped the medals table for the fourth successive Games. They collected 18 medals, including six for Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo, the king of cross-country skiing.\n\nHad Klaebo, who set a record for the most golds won by an individual athlete at a single Games, competed as a nation on his own, he would have been ninth in the medal table. Fittingly, his sixth gold - in the men's 50km cross-country skiing - was presented at the closing ceremony as the final medal awarded at the Games.\n\nThe oldest individual medallist was Elana Meyers Taylor of the United States, who broke the Games record by winning monobob gold, aged 41.\n\nSkiing great Lindsey Vonn saw her Olympic career end with a broken leg.\n\nThe Games also had controversial moments.\n\nUkraine's Vladyslav Heraskevych wished to compete in the men's skeleton while wearing a remembrance helmet featuring artwork depicting athletes killed during the Russian invasion of his country.\n\nBut the IOC said this contravened Games rules and, after Heraskevych refused to back down, disqualified him from competing.\n\nThere was also a silver medal, in men's ski mountaineering, for Russian athlete Nikita Filippov. He competed as an Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) because Russia were banned from the Games because of their aggression in Ukraine.\n\nFilippov, along with other AIN competitors, was allowed to take part in the closing ceremony having been banned from the opening event.\n\nMen's curling gold medallists Canada had their campaign dogged by allegations of cheating.\n\nThe ceremony included the handover of the Olympic flag to the delegation representing the French Alps, which will host the next Winter Games in 2030.\n\nThe presidents of the two French regions to host the Games, Renaud Muselier and Fabrice Pannekoucke, enthusiastically accepted the flag from Coventry.\n\nThere was a performance of the sixth verse of La Marseillaise, the French national anthem, as it was deemed to be more universal and less patriotic. The arrangement changed throughout into a more contemporary style with an electronic base.\n\nAs well as a video showcasing the Alps, there was also a performance by 25 musicians and 24 athletes – the first time Olympians have featured in the artistic elements of the closing ceremony.\n\nRelive the 2026 Winter Olympics on BBC iPlayer (UK only)",

    "description": "After a defeat for Celtic and surprise draw for Rangers, where does the latest weekend of drama leave the Scottish Premiership title race?",
    "fullText": "\"The two teams from Glasgow have buckled under the pressure.\"\n\nThat was the assessment of former Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart after the Scottish Premiership title race delivered yet another weekend of high drama.\n\nWith Rangers held to a 2-2 draw at bottom club Livingston and defending champions Celtic beaten at home by Hibernian on Sunday, Hearts boss Derek McInnes must have been watching on with a big grin.\n\nHaving eked out a narrow win over Falkirk 24 hours earlier his side now lead Rangers by four points and Celtic - who have played a game fewer than the teams above them - by six with 10 matches left.\n\nThe other big winners over the weekend were fourth-placed Motherwell, with their 5-0 thumping of St Mirren.\n\nJens Berthel Askou's side also have a game in hand on the top two, trailing Hearts by 10 points.\n\nThey have only conceded three goals in their past 15 matches and lost once in 19, all while playing the most expansive football in the top flight.\n\n\"Motherwell win emphatically, Hearts win as well and that applies pressure,\" Stewart said.\n\n\"The two teams from Glasgow have buckled under the pressure.\n\n\"It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Motherwell could finish above Celtic or Rangers, maybe both of them.\n\n\"Celtic and Rangers could be third and fourth in the table.\"\n\nNext weekend follows a similar pattern as Hearts and Motherwell play at home on Saturday - against Aberdeen and Dundee United respectively - before Rangers host Celtic in the derby on Sunday.\n\nMotherwell could be just one point behind Celtic by then, while Hearts could be seven clear of Rangers and nine above Martin O'Neill's side.\n\n\"It looks like Hearts are the team that can only throw it away,\" former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner said. \"They are in an unbelievable position.\"\n\nStewart added: \"Everything is on the line. The permutations from all these games are incredible. That's what makes this season so exciting.\"\n\nPodcast: Reaction to day of title drama as Celtic lose & Rangers draw\n\nRangers scramble draw at 10-man Livingston\n\nHibs stun Celtic with late Andrews winner\n\nIt is no secret things are far from rosy at Parkhead, with fan protests during almost every home match.\n\nO'Neill is in charge until the end of the season - his second interim spell in this chaotic campaign - and cracks are starting to appear despite the Northern Irishman's legendary status at the club.\n\nSupporters continue to demand boardroom change, there are obvious holes in O'Neill's squad and they have now lost seven league matches. That's as many as they lost in the previous two seasons combined.\n\nCeltic fell behind to Felix Passlack's header and rallied to equalise through Benjamin Nygren's 18th goal of the season, but went down to 10 men when centre-back Auston Trusty was sent off for violent conduct.\n\nKai Andrews fired in a late winner for Hibs, making it successive defeats for Celtic after Thursday's Europa League reverse against Stuttgart.\n\n\"It's a setback, that's all it is,\" O'Neill said. \"We're still in the race.\n\n\"I thought we were absolutely terrific. The players put heart and soul into the game. No complaints on that side whatsoever.\n\n\"We've been chasing for months now. There's not much room for error but we can still fight back. The players are disappointed but it's not over.\"\n\nDespite O'Neill's defence of his players, others were less complimentary.\n\n\"It all changed with Trusty's sending off,\" Bonner said. \"Hibs handled the game very well after that.\n\n\"Celtic couldn't get any momentum and it's a brilliant goal from Kai Andrews. Celtic didn't create anything. They ran out of luck.\"\n\nO'Neill brought in Tomas Cvancara, Junior Adamu and Joel Mvuka to bolster his attacking options in January, but Adamu was an unused substitute against Hibs and Mvuka wasn't in the matchday squad.\n\n\"Without doubt, there is a lack of cutting edge at Celtic,\" Stewart said.\n\n\"What's up with Adamu? They need a goal and they put on [Daizen] Maeda, who is nowhere near the levels he was at before.\"\n\nWhile some would have tipped Hibs to get a result at Celtic Park, Rangers were expected to continue their excellent recent form at Livingston, who have won only once in the Premiership all season.\n\nHowever, Marvin Bartley's side profited from two set-pieces to take a two-goal lead.\n\nGoalkeeper Jerome Prior made a string of superb saves and there were several last-ditch challenges as the West Lothian outfit kept Rangers at bay.\n\nBut Cristian Montano's sending off on the hour mark sparked a Rangers onslaught and they drew level through Emmanuel Fernandez's strike and Mikey Moore's header.\n\nThere was late controversy too as Moore was wiped out by Cammy Kerr when through on goal.\n\nReferee Ryan Lee gave no foul and video assistant referee David Dickinson ruled the incident to be outside the box and not denying a goalscoring opportunity.\n\n\"It had a bit of everything,\" former Rangers midfielder Kevin Thomson said.\n\n\"Livingston were terrific. Marvin Bartley will be delighted - he would have taken a point before the game.\n\n\"For Rangers - too much huffing and puffing, they lacked a little bit in the final third.\"\n\nHead coach Danny Rohl was baffled his side were not given the chance to take all three points from the penalty spot.\n\n\"I can't understand when you see the replay and it's a clear foul, then the decision. In my view it was on the line and it's a penalty,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a clear foul. Mikey said to me and you see on the replay. It's a pen but we have to move forward.\"\n\nWith next Sunday's Old Firm derby looming large, Rohl is relishing the run-in.\n\n\"We showed again our comeback character,\" he said. \"Ten games to go and it is an exciting race.\n\n\"We are disappointed but we go again. We have to carry on. We cannot think too much about the past and I totally believe, the players believe, the club believe and the supporters believe we can do it.\n\n\"We showed against Hearts that we can beat top of the league. Next week we have the next challenge. We will hunt again and again.\"",

    "fullText": "McDonald’s Big Arch burger is rumored to finally make its way to the U.S. after appearing on overseas menus.\n\nThe burger is described as two Quarter Pounder patties, three slices of white cheddar, two types of onions, and a new Big Arch sauce.\n\nFans in the comments are hyped to try it, with reports pointing to an early March rollout.\n\nSomething very large may be heading to McDonald's menus in the U.S., and the internet has already started planning accordingly.\n\nFood blogger Snackolator recently posted about a rumored new burger called the Big Arch, describing it as a stacked situation with two Quarter Pounder patties, slivered onions, crispy onions, three slices of white cheddar, and an all-new Big Arch sauce. The comment section is already sold (and likely drooling on their screens). \"I've been eyeing this one! Happy is finally coming!\" one person wrote, while another skipped straight to logistics with a simple \"Let's go.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time the Big Arch has popped up, though. McDonald's had already been testing a larger-format burger in three international markets as far back as 2024, including Portugal and Canada. Since then, it's shown up on menus overseas—and in the U.K., it's not even a test anymore. It's a permanent item.\n\nWhich might explain why some people seem a little too ready for it to land here. \"Just what I been waiting for!! 😋” one commenter said, while someone else admitted, \"I'm embarrassed by how excited I am.\"\n\nAs for whether it's actually headed stateside soon, Snackolator claims a March 3 drop. And judging by the replies, at least a few people already know exactly what they're doing if it shows up. My advice? Wear a dark shirt and maybe bring some extra napkins from home.\n\nInsanely Easy Weeknight Dinners To Try This Week\n\n29 Insanely Delicious Vodka Cocktails",

    "fullText": "PEORIA – The Eddie Bauer store situated in The Shoppes at Grand Prairie has shut down.\n\nA “store closed” sign hangs in the windows, and up above, only a faint shadow of the brand’s moniker remains.\n\nThe Shoppes at Grand Prairie management did not return multiple Journal Star phone calls or emails regarding future plans for the space.\n\nThe fate of the company’s remaining storefronts currently hangs in the balance. Earlier this month, Eddie Bauer LLC voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement with secured lenders.\n\nA press release about the development said the company planned to “conduct liquidation sales at its stores while continuing to pursue an ongoing sale process.” Storefronts in the United States and Canada will continue operating for now, and the company said it may “depart from a full wind down of operations” if there is a sale.\n\nCatalyst Brands CEO Marc Rosen said the company has faced supply chain issues, declining sales and other challenges.\n\n“Over the past year, these challenges have been exacerbated by various headwinds, including increased costs of doing business due to inflation, ongoing tariff uncertainty, and other factors,” Rosen said. “While the leadership team at Catalyst was able to make significant strides in the brand, including rapid improvements in product development and marketing, those changes could not be implemented fast enough to fully address the challenges created over several years.”\n\nOnline operations and wholesale will continue, the press release said, as it is handled by a separate LLC.

    "description": "Mexican drug lord Nemesio Oseguera, commonly known as 'El Mencho,' infamous for the bloody trail of bodies he left behind in battles with government",
    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Mexican drug lord Nemesio Oseguera, commonly known as 'El Mencho,' infamous for the bloody trail of bodies he left behind in battles with government forces and rival gangs, died in a military raid on Sunday.\n\nAn ex-police officer, Oseguera, 60, was the shadowy leader ‌of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), an international criminal enterprise widely viewed as one of Mexico's most powerful.\n\nOver a relatively short period of time, Oseguera masterminded ‌the CJNG's emergence as a criminal empire rivaling his former allies in the Sinaloa Cartel. He managed to evade arrest for years despite a $15 million bounty from the U.S. for information leading to his arrest or ​capture.\n\nCJNG has been blamed for smuggling vast quantities of drugs into the U.S., including the synthetic opioid fentanyl, which has been linked to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths in recent years.\n\n\"Apart from the heads of the Sinaloa cartel, 'El Mencho' has been the biggest prize for many, many years,\" said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a security expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"And it’s really stunning, just like the heads of the Sinaloa cartel, how long he managed to evade U.S. and Mexican law enforcement gunning for him.”\n\nArguably Mexico's most influential crime boss after captured ‌kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, now in a U.S. prison, Oseguera diversified ⁠into rackets such as stolen fuel, forced labor and human trafficking.\n\nBut unlike Guzman, who became a media celebrity, El Mencho preferred to remain in relative obscurity. He achieved notoriety for expletive-laden recordings leaked on social media in which he threatened enemies and officials.\n\nOseguera was also known ⁠for evading capture in spectacular fashion. In May 2015, as Mexican forces closed in on him, his tipped-off henchmen shot down a military helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade to give their boss time to escape.\n\nTargets of his hit men were rarely so lucky. His gang routinely employed beheadings and other gory means of intimidation.\n\nIn one six-week period in 2015, the gang killed two dozen police in ​western ​Mexico as a warning to authorities.\n\nIn 2020, Mexico City's then chief of police Omar Garcia Harfuch survived ​an assassination attempt that killed two of his bodyguards in an ‌attack authorities blamed on the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Harfuch is now the country's security chief and helped oversee the operation against Oseguera.\n\nOseguera was born in 1966 in a poor village in the mountains of the rugged and notoriously lawless western state of Michoacan. There, cultivation of opium poppies and marijuana have competed with avocado production for decades.\n\nAs a boy, he worked the fields, and later went to seek his fortune in the U.S., where prosecutors said he got into the heroin trade. After a few years, he was arrested and served time in a U.S. prison.\n\nHe was deported back to Mexico, where he joined the police before entering the Milenio Cartel, a satellite of the Sinaloa Cartel. Eventually, he ‌became a top enforcer after stints as a sicario, or cartel assassin.\n\nAfter a failed attempt at taking ​over the Milenio Cartel, he struck out alone, declared war on Sinaloa, and founded the CJNG in alliance ​with a local gang of money launderers.\n\nThe cartel is named for the western ​state of Jalisco, home to one of Mexico's largest cities, Guadalajara.\n\nThe CJNG mixed Sinaloa-style drug trafficking and community outreach with the ultra-violent methods ‌of the Zetas Cartel, a gang that used paramilitary tactics to diversify ​into criminal enterprises such as extortion and ​kidnapping.\n\nFor years, Oseguera paid off police to cover his back as he operated with near-total impunity inside Jalisco. He also sought political protection.\n\n\"El Mencho's Jalisco New Generation Cartel was one of the biggest buyers of politicians and political campaigns, which has given it an enormous social base,\" said Edgardo Buscaglia, an organized crime expert at ​Columbia University.\n\nNoting El Mencho's ability to win public support, ‌Buscaglia pointed to footage broadcast during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic of people lining up for CJNG-stamped food packages handed out by cartel gunmen, not government ​workers, to help cushion the economic blow of lockdowns.\n\n\"Compared to the Mexican government,\" said Buscaglia, \"he was the least bad option.\"",
