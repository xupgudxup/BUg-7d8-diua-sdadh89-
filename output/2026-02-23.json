    "fullText": "Defending T20 World Cup champions India need \"two big performances\" to reach the semi-finals after Sunday's huge defeat to South Africa, said their assistant coach.\n\nIndia came into the T20 World Cup as hot favourites on home soil but were thrashed by 76 runs in the Super Eights as 80,000 fans at the massive Narendra Modi stadium were stunned into silence.\n\nIn their first chase of the tournament, India's batting came up woefully short in the face of some disciplined South Africa bowling.\n\nIndia collapsed to 111 all out in 18.5 overs in response to South Africa's 187-7 as their 12-match win streak in the T20 World Cup came to a crashing end.\n\nThe magnitude of the defeat has left India with a desperate net run-rate of -3.8 and likely needing to win their last two Super Eight matches convincingly to make it to the semi-finals.\n\nAnything less and India will need to rely on a combination of other results going their way.\n\n\"Very disappointed in the performance,\" said Ryan ten Doeschate.\n\n\"When you set out to win a World Cup, don't expect someone to come and deliver it to you halfway through,\" the assistant coach added.\n\n\"We've messed up on a grand scale and now the onus is on this group of guys to turn it around and put in two solid performances.\"\n\nIndia are grouped with South Africa, the West Indies and Zimbabwe in Super Eights, with the top two advancing to the semi-finals.\n\nThe West Indies face Zimbabwe on Monday night in Mumbai in their Super Eights opener.\n\nIndia next face giant-killers Zimbabwe, who have already beaten Australia and Sri Lanka, on Thursday in Chennai.\n\nSouth Africa play the West Indies the same day in Ahmedabad where Aiden Markram's side could put one foot firmly in the semi-finals with another win.\n\n\"Obviously with the way the group goes, you need at least four points to get through now, and it's going to need two big performances and a big bounce back from everyone,\" said Ten Doeschate.\n\nIndia's fragile batting was exposed against an in-form bowling attack led by left-arm quick Marco Jansen, who returned figures of 4-22 from 3.5 overs. Keshav Maharaj took 3-24 with his left-arm spin.\n\nIndia's media tore into the team on Monday morning.\n\n\"The night the cloak came off,\" blazed a headline in the Indian Express newspaper.\n\n\"Sloppy India reach point of no return,\" said the Hindustan Times.\n\nIndia's ultra-aggressive left-handed opening pair have failed to fire, leaving a shaky middle order to pick up the pieces.\n\nIshan Kishan was out without scoring to Markram on Sunday, while the world's top- ranked T20 batter Abhishek Sharma fell to Jansen for 15, his only runs of the tournament so far after three ducks.\n\n\"It's certainly not panic stations,\" said Ten Doeschate, who hinted there could be discussions about India's batting line-up.\n\n\"If those guys (Ahbishek and Ishan) bat for six overs, the score is going to be 70-plus,\" said Ten Doeschate.\n\n\"So can we get them to temper the way they're playing and be a little bit smarter?\n\n\"Or do we just let them go on the way they are?\n\n\"Or do we bring in a right-hander at the top and make a change somewhere in the middle?\"\n\nCaptain Suryakumar Yadav agreed India need to use their brains in the first six-over power play when only two fielders are allowed on the boundary.\n\n\"Chasing 180-185, you can't win the game in the power play, but you might lose it,\" he said after his side stumbled to 31-3 after six overs, which became 43-4 a few balls later and then 51-5.\n\n\"We lost too many wickets in the power play.\"\n\nThe 2024 champions also have the weight of history against them. No team has ever retained the T20 World Cup and no side have ever won the trophy on home soil.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump responded publicly after Team USA secured a gold medal in men’s hockey at the 2026 Winter Olympics. Following the team’s overtime victory over Canada in Milan, the president shared a message congratulating the players and later spoke with them directly as celebrations continued.\n\nDonald Trump congratulated the United States men’s hockey team after its gold medal victory at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, according to the Detroit Free Press. Coach Mike Sullivan said, “The players just had the President on, I don’t know what it was, what do you call it, FaceTime, whatever, in the locker room. He just spoke to the group, expressing how proud he was of the group and congratulating everybody on the win.” Captain Auston Matthews said, “He called and just congratulated us.”\n\nThe United States defeated Canada 2-1 in overtime to secure the gold medal. Sullivan said the game “was an inspiration to our country. I can’t tell you how many texts I’ve received over the last day or so about watch parties at 8 o’clock in the morning. I think from a viewership standpoint, the United States, there were a lot of people paying attention, the President included.” The team was scheduled to return to NHL duties on February 23, and its flight was diverted from New York’s JFK airport to Miami because of a storm in the northeast.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social: “Congratulations to our great U.S.A. Ice Hockey team. THEY WON THE GOLD. WOW!.” He added, “LOTS OF WINNING!!! President DONALD J. TRUMP.” The White House also shared a social media image depicting a bald eagle and a goose following the victory.\n\nThe post followed prior political tensions between the United States and Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said at the World Economic Forum, “Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.” After the Olympics, Carney wrote, “You’re coming home with 21 hard-fought Olympic medals.”\n\nOriginally reported by Vritti Johar on Mandatory.com.\n\nThe post Donald Trump Has a Message for Team USA Hockey appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "fullText": "The Chargers will most likely address the interior part of the offensive line, especially the guard spots, with Bradley Bozeman and Mekhi Becton being potential cut candidates.\n\nShould they go the free agency route, Sports Illustrated's Connor Orr believes the Bolts will sign veteran Joel Bitonio, whom he tabbed in his bold predictions for all 32 teams in the NFL.\n\nJim Harbaugh is not going to put Justin Herbert at risk again like he was forced to last season. Bitonio can spearhead the offensive line’s transition to a Mike McDaniel system—Bitonio was drafted during McDaniel’s season as the Browns’ receivers coach—and could be a critical, dependable asset amid constant injury woes.\n\nBitonio is not getting any younger, set to be 35 this season and is considering retirement, but he is durable and is still moving as if he were ten years younger.\n\nA stalwart presence along the Browns' offensive line for the past decade, Bitonio finished the 2025 season ranked as PFF's 8th-best pass-blocking guard. He has also ranked in the 91st percentile in PFF run-blocking grade over the past three seasons.\n\nOffensive coordinator Mike McDaniel was on the Browns' staff as the wide receiver coach in 2014, Bitonio's first season in Cleveland, so the familiarity is there. Plus, Bitonio is a great fit in McDaniel's zone scheme.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chargers Wire: NFL analyst's 'bold prediction' sees Chargers bolstering guard spot",

    "description": "Roker Report and our writers stand firmly behind Mundle in the ongoing battle against racism — stay strong, Romaine!",
    "fullText": "Mundle deserves our full support.\n\nWhether it’s happening inside the stadium or online, these idiots must feel the full force of the club and the community, and to be shown that they’re not welcome here. If it happens inside the stadium, I hope every decent fan knows not to look away, and instead to report it.\n\nI’ve already seen some debate about whether online comments are necessarily from Sunderland fans or not — to me, that’s irrelevant. It isn’t acceptable wherever it’s from, and as a fanbase, we have to stand firm and say loudly and clearly that we’re united against racism.\n\nRomaine, we stand with you completely, and these cretins don’t represent us.\n\nThis news is frankly disgusting. I know that the individuals that did this are in the minority of the fan base, but the idea that any person could call themselves a Sunderland fan and then proceed to treat a player like this is sickening.\n\nMundle is both a brilliant footballer and a brilliant person — two things that have nothing to do with his race.\n\nOur squad is made up of players from different backgrounds, races and religions, and this one of the beauties of sport and football: inclusion. People coming from all over to share in moments of joy. The idea that anyone — a player or a spectator — could come to a Sunderland match and be mistreated or discriminated against is horrific.\n\nI sincerely hope that neither Mundle nor anyone else who could be affected by these racist comments will lose faith in the club.\n\nAnd equally, I hope the club does everything in their power to stamp it out and ensure that these individuals never see the inside of the Stadium of Light again.\n\nThere’s no place in life for racism, and sport is no different.\n\nSunderland AFC is a club built on community values, respect and most importantly, a family spirit. Players from all walks of life come together, put on the shirt and represent our region with pride, passion and most importantly, with respect.\n\nWe stand with Mundle and anyone found reducing our players down to racial remarks doesn’t belong anywhere near the Sunderland community.\n\nNo room for racism. Not now, not ever.\n\nThe meltdown by some fans after a defeat is bad enough.\n\nThe hordes leaving early yet again astonishes me and the number of fickle fans our club has is quite depressing. But the news that Mundle has been racially abused almost defies belief or suitable words.\n\nEvery club has a percentage of dimwits but to realise we are amongst them is quite frankly sickening.\n\nThey hide behind social media. They don’t have enough respectable or honourable qualities to be a decent human being. I hope they’re caught and identified and I hope Romaine gets the support he deserves from the club, but also that he realises that if it’s from Sunderland fans, it’s a tiny fraction of our fanbase and that the love and support of the vast majority comes to the fore.\n\nMundle is a talent with the potential to be an excellent player.\n\nI hope he realises this, and that we’re all behind him. The idiots who write such things will unfortunately not have the intelligence to read feedback from sites such as Roker Report. More’s the pity.\n\nIt’s a complete tragedy that we’re seeing this vile abuse in 2026.\n\nThere’s no place for racism in any shape or form, and whatever we feel about the performances of our players, the colour of their skin or race is immaterial.\n\nThose who have posted this vile content need to be banned for life.\n\nRomaine, every Sunderland fan is 100% behind you, and stands with you. Please don’t let the 0.0001% detract from the fact you’re part of this huge Mackem family.\n\nWhen someone is singled out for unfair criticism, it can regrettably lead to ridiculous situations like this, where the uneducated and ignorant are able to hide behind anonymous accounts and send racist abuse to black players.\n\nWhilst I hope that none of the messages are from Sunderland fans directly, that isn’t entirely relevant. The reality is that we shouldn’t be talking about incidents like these occurring in 2026.\n\nWhilst initiatives like “Show Racism the Red Card” do great work in schools, we need social media platforms to do more against anonymous accounts, where hate can be spread without fear of consequences.\n\nAs fans of football, we need to do more to stamp out racism and make a strong stand.\n\nWhether it be a misinformed comment in the stands or an incident like this, we need to be better. Regardless of who sent the messages, I hope they’re identified quickly and that there’s police involvement. A stadium ban isn’t going to impact a sad bastard who doesn’t go to games but feels like they can send abuse online.\n\nFor Mundle, I’m certain that he’ll get the best support from the club and fellow teammates. I hope from our perspective inside the stadium that we see this as a wakeup call —doing more to support our players and perhaps thinking a bit more before saying something.\n\nMundle deserves our full and unwavering support, and I hope we showcase this in the upcoming games.",

    "description": "It was a bad day at the office for the Lads as Fulham cashed in on a sloppy display. What did our writers make of it?",
    "fullText": "Sat in the south east corner, I was celebrating before he shot but before I knew it, I was caught inadvertently celebrating a goal kick to Fulham.\n\nUntil I see a replay, it honestly did look harder to do what he did than score.\n\nI was baffled by his introduction over Chemsdine Talbi when Jocelin Ta Bi went off.\n\nWith Reinildo, Ta Bi, Nordi Mukiele, Dennis Cirkin and possibly Brian Brobbey all out of action, we’re counting the wounded.\n\nIt’s a big concern as we’re struggling to create from out wide as we’ve done throughout the season. What do we fall back on now?\n\nI’ve felt that during the last seven games, we’ve been found out.\n\nYes, we enjoyed good fortune against Crystal Palace and Burnley, but the recycled balls to the wings or hoping Enzo Le Fée picks the pass of his dreams to a runner in behind have been scuppered.\n\nRégis Le Bris’ usual ability to solve a problem has been well and truly nullified. Is it time to change from the off? I think so.\n\nLe Fée is often the one player that doesn’t deserve any criticism that might be aimed at the team.\n\nAlways involved and always trying to affect the game.\n\nI’m not sure what goes on in players’ heads; why they don’t turn up for certain games and indeed where this leaves our season, but at least the return of our captain will mean everyone will be getting his instructions and motivation for the remaining games.\n\nMy first negative concerns the injuries to both Nordi Mukiele and Jocelin Ta Bi in the first half.\n\nAs we started to approach a full strength squad, we could’ve done without losing players and especially someone as influential as Mukiele.\n\nHopefully they aren’t out for long as it didn’t help the flow in a very poor first half — possibly the worst of the season?\n\nI was interested to see how we would approach this game — would it be a fast and committed approach to push us as high up the table as possible, or would it be a negative “It’s only Fulham” approach?\n\nUnfortunately, it was the latter.\n\nWe lacked energy and passion, and save for a brief moment after our penalty, we were often a shadow of the team we can be, which certainly wasn’t conducive to a team fighting for the highest finish possible.\n\nFulham have done the double over us this season. That’s a damning fact.\n\nThe sides were quite evenly-matched overall and I have to say that Fulham took their chances well, but despite the tide of goals going against us, the period before and after Enzo Le Fée’s goal were pretty uncomfortable for the visitors.\n\nWe’re a team that doesn’t give up, and that’s the hallmark of this group — regardless of which formation we’re playing.\n\nWe are still competing in the FA Cup and need only one win to be safe, with eleven games to go.\n\nLast August, all Sunderland fans would have taken that.\n\nWe just didn’t play with the required intensity — especially in the first half.\n\nFulham played well and were very competitive, but we didn’t show enough dominance in midfield and penetration in attack, and allowed the Fulham forwards too much space. We definitely missed the drive and organisational awareness of our superb captain Granit Xhaka in the first sixty nine minutes.\n\nThe change after he came on was noticeable but he can’t be the solution all over the pitch, as we normally enjoy defending.\n\nSunderland came back with some intent at 0-2 and dominated the game before and after the penalty, taken expertly by Le Fée.\n\nThe Londoners were very good on the break, with excellent play from Harry Wilson and Alex Iwobi, and the third goal definitely deflated us and a lot of fans left early.\n\nWe had off days — both on Sunday and at Craven Cottage when we lost 1-0 — and Fulham are the only team to have done the double over us this season.\n\nIt was a nice sunny day — a great day for watching football.\n\nThe crowd were expectant and the two teams produced a ponderous spectacle. Both teams were even if you look at the stats, and Granit Xhaka improved things.\n\nIt was an awful sight for the television audience.\n\nTwo mid-table teams not producing much in terms of end product.\n\nThe loss of Nordi Mukiele was a big blow, as it ruined the attack down our right hand side.\n\nBoth teams were evenly matched, but our lack of cutting edge is getting increasingly concerning and as soon as Romaine Mundle missed his chance, I said to my neighbour that they would go and score. I said it mainly to jinx it from happening but that ploy didn’t work.\n\nThat’s the second home game in a row where the opposition has scored with an unmarked header from a corner, but their VAR-gifted penalty was a joke — not least because there were at least four Fulham players in offside positions.\n\n0-2 down was always going to be a huge ask but when Enzo Le Fée narrowed the deficit, I wondered if a comeback a-la Arsenal or even Bournemouth was on the cards.\n\nThe crowd didn’t play their part and it was disappointing to see everyone leaving in droves when Alex Iwobi impressively slotted home their third, whereas in previous games, the crowd would’ve driven the team on.\n\nIt seemed that no-one — the crowd or the players — had the appetite for a fight. And Fulham were allowed to steal the three points.\n\nThis team and the fans need to stick together, so it’s absolutely despicable to hear of the online racist abuse that’s been sent to Mundle.\n\nWe win as a team and we lose as a team. If you don’t like that, get the hell out of here and don’t dare to call yourself a Sunderland fan. How dare you!\n\nAs Dan Ballard said, days like this were always going to happen. We need to stick together no call each other out. All for one and one for all.\n\nIf you don’t like it, get lost.\n\nAs has been the case since Christmas, Sunderland have been a predictable beast.\n\nWhilst Régis Le Bris’ pragmatism was a welcome change at the start of the season, the predictability it brings in a division where teams are constantly in a state of evolution is starting to bite — and bite hard.\n\nA lack of creative spark and a lot of sideways movement that concludes in not very much isn’t enough to establish yourself at this level for a prolonged period of time.\n\nAs soon as he came on, the groans were audible and the predictable proceeded to happen.\n\nWhilst the result wasn’t on one individual, he simply isn’t good enough for this level and his missed sitter was a ‘sliding doors moment’ in a game devoid of quality until then.\n\nSince Christmas (someone please fact check this) we’ve conceded an average of two goals per game in the league whilst boasting a brilliantly low xG.\n\nIn short, we’re conceding around twice as many goals as we score, and it doesn’t need a genius to explain why that is objectively bad news.\n\nAnother game where Trai Hume was neither a full back nor a midfielder — an experiment which needs to end.\n\nHume’s inclusion out of position softens us in defence and attack. It’s been coming for weeks and is visible to all except those who make the decisions on the team sheet. At this level, we need eleven men playing at full throttle, yet at the moment we choose to play with 9.5 every time we play Mundle and Hume out of position.\n\nBrutal it may be, but for a team that’s taken plenty of plaudits, they’re also not immune from criticism — especially when the issues are so obvious to boot.",

Under the guidance of head coach Daren Sammy, the Caribbean side have spoken about creating their own slice of history, but consistency will be crucial as the competition intensifies.\n\nThe West Indies enter the match on the back of four consecutive wins, putting behind a disappointing run in bilateral series before the tournament. Shai Hope and Shimron Hetmyer have led the batting charge, while Jason Holder and Roston Chase have provided balance with their all-round skills. Romario Shepherd has also impressed with both bat and ball, particularly on Indian surfaces where he has IPL experience.\n\nZimbabwe, on the other hand, have been one of the biggest revelations of the tournament. The Sikandar Raza-led side have pulled off memorable victories over former world champions Australia and Sri Lanka, earning respect and recognition on the global stage. Young batter Brian Bennett has been their standout performer with the bat, while Blessing Muzarabani and Brad Evans have been among the leading wicket-takers in the competition.\n\nWith short boundaries and a batting-friendly pitch expected at the Wankhede Stadium, West Indies are likely to target a big-hitting approach, but Zimbabwe’s confidence and resilience suggest they are capable of pushing their opponents to the limit.\n\nWest Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match: Live streaming details\n\nWhen will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match be played?\n\nThe West Indies vs Zimbabwe Super 8 match will be played on Monday, February 23, 2026.\n\nWhere will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match be played?\n\nThe match will take place at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, India.\n\nWhat time will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match start?\n\nThe match is scheduled to begin at 7:00 PM IST, with the toss at 6:30 PM IST.\n\nWhich TV channels will broadcast the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match?\n\nThe game will be broadcast live on the Star Sports Network in India.\n\nHow to watch live streaming of the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match?\n\nFans can watch the live stream on the Jio Hotstar app and website.\n\nWhere can we follow the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match online?\n\nLive ball-by-ball updates and coverage will be available on TimesofIndia.com.",

    "title": "On This Day (23rd Feb 1985): Striker Shows Sunderland Fans Of Times To Come",
    "description": "On this day in 1985, a future Sunderland striker would show the Lads how it’s done!",
    "fullText": "Looking back to this day back in 1985, it actually seemed quite a pivotal moment. It was a point where Sir Tom Cowie’s gamble from the season before could have gone either way.\n\nGoing back twelve months, the Sunderland owner decided that – after allowing him to build an exciting young squad, with the likes of Colin West and Gary Rowell banging in the goals, Paul Bracewell pulling the strings in midfield, Barry Venison and Nick Pickering bombing down the flanks from full-back and Chris Turner between the sticks – that Alan Durban wasn’t his man.\n\nBut, as always, Sunderland moves on, and on this occasion Cowie turned back to a club legend on the pitch, someone who had made more appearances as an outfield player than anyone else in the club’s history – Len Ashurst.\n\nAshurst found himself in a tough spot during his first summer; however, he wanted to freshen up the squad but wasn’t provided with the funds to do so, and tough decisions had to be made. Eight players would make their Sunderland debuts in the first four games of the following season, and for a while, things were looking good.\n\nAs December began, Sunderland had just beaten Ron Atkinson’s Manchester United 3-2 at Roker Park in an ill-tempered affair that saw David Hodgson and Mark Hughes receive their marching orders, and Clive Walker bag a hat-trick. This put Ashurst’s side ninth in the table (of 22 in Division One), with a League Cup fourth round replay at White Hart Lane to come days later – having knocked Brian Clough’s Forest out in the previous round.\n\nTop half of the First Division, going strong in the League Cup – happy days.\n\nSunderland then lost eight out of the next nine league games, including a 3-1 loss at St James’ Park against Jack Charlton’s Mags side, where Gary Bennett and Howard Gayle were sent off.\n\nBut in the three games prior to the trip to West London, there were signs that things were looking up.\n\nThis began with knocking Graham Taylor’s Watford out of the League Cup at the quarter-final stage, and although we followed that up with defeat at The Dell against Lawrie McMenemy’s Southampton, we quickly bounced back with a 1-0 win against a Stoke City side that had Steve Bould at the back and Barry Siddall behind him in goal.\n\nThis got even better when the Lads beat Chelsea 2-0 at Roker in the League Cup semi-final first-leg, which meant things were looking up ahead of the clash with QPR, who, although they were four places higher in the table than Sunderland, were only two points better off having played two more fixtures.\n\nIt was a good opportunity for Ashurst to relieve the pressure and climb the table to the safety of mid-table, and a training session the day before the game to become accustomed to the controversial synthetic pitch at Loftus Road seemed to have paid off in the early stages, as Sunderland piled the pressure on the hosts.\n\nWith just a couple of minutes on the clock, West was sent through on goal by Hodgson with only the keeper to beat, but could only drag his shot wide. Moments later, Gary Bennett shot straight at Peter Hucker in the QPR goal, before Peter Daniel repeated the feat soon after. Then it was Clive Walker’s turn to be sent through on goal by Hodgson, but again his shot was saved.\n\nQPR were having more of the ball, but the away side continued to create the better chances. Even after the break, when the hosts had been offered a chance to regroup, the chances still came for Sunderland. Ten minutes into the second half, an unmarked Pickering could only head over the bar after good work from Venison – it seemed a case of when and not if – and just after the hour mark, it duly arrived.\n\nPredictably, it came at the other end, and it began with an innocuous long clearance from Hucker that Reuben Agboola could only head straight to future Sunderland FA Cup hero John Byrne, who then showed the Sunderland strikers how to do it by driving a crisp shot into the corner of the net past Chris Turner.\n\nMore chances were created to equalise in the remaining half hour, but more chances were missed. It would end 1-0 to the home side, with a striker doing the business being the thing to divide the two sides, but for Sunderland, it was possibly more significant.\n\nThe positivity going into the QPR fixture was seemingly lost, and Ashurst’s side lost 12 out of the remaining 16 league games and were relegated to Division Two – and of course, we lost in the League Cup final.\n\nQueens Park Rangers 1-0 Sunderland\n\nSunderland: Turner, Venison, Pickering, Bennett, Chisholm, Elliott, Hodgson (Wallace), Agboola, West, Daniel, Walker\n\nQPR: Hucker, Fereday, Dawes, Waddock, Wicks, Fenwick, Robinson, Fillery, Bannister, Byrne, Gregory Substitute not used: Kerslake",

    "description": "MS Dhoni will be available for CSK in IPL 2026 but may not play every match, a franchise source confirmed. With Sanju Samson and other wicketkeepers in the squad, Dhoni’s workload could be managed, especially due to fitness concerns and the Impact Player rule.

    "fullText": "Dhoni, who will turn 45 later this year, is set to be available for CSK, but it looks unlikely that he will feature in all games.\n\nA top CSK source confirmed his availability. “We can confirm this much that he is coming to Chennai and had confirmed his availability for the season,\" the source told PTI. \n\nHowever, the same source added, “Whether he will play all games or not is something we can't say at the moment.”\n\nWith the arrival of Sanju Samson, CSK now have multiple wicketkeeping options, which could reduce Dhoni’s workload. \n\nSamson is expected to keep wickets in matches where Dhoni sits out, while other keepers like Urvil Patel and young recruit Kartik Sharma are also in the squad.\n\nIn recent seasons, Dhoni’s role with the bat has been limited due to the Impact Player rule, and he has mostly played as a finisher in specific situations. \n\nManaging his fitness will also be important, as he has dealt with knee and back issues in recent years, and the physical demands of wicketkeeping can be tough with packed schedules.\n\nHowever, Dhoni is likely to play most of CSK’s home matches at Chepauk, where his presence still excites fans like no other. His bond with the Chennai crowd remains strong, and every time he walks onto the field, it sends the stadium into a frenzy.",

    "fullText": "With Mauricio Pochettino about three weeks from selecting the U.S. roster for March training camp and friendlies, a rush of good news concerning two players arrived a few hours apart Saturday:\n\nMidfielder Tyler Adams was on the field for the first time in more than two months and striker Ricardo Pepi was in uniform for the first time in six weeks.\n\nAdams, who recovered earlier than anticipated from a sprained knee ligament, started in Bournemouth’s 0-0 draw at West Ham, while Pepi, in uniform after recovering from a fractured forearm, scored a sensational goal as a second-half sub in PSV Eindhoven’s 3-1 triumph over Heerenveen.\n\nRicardo Pepi laat zich direct gelden bij zijn rentree 🎯👏#psvhee pic.twitter.com/z4UrAtaZkr\n\n— ESPN NL (@ESPNnl) February 21, 2026\n\nWith both back in the mix for national team duty next month — Adams is certain and Pepi is probable — Pochettino has, at the moment, almost his entire player pool available for selection.\n\nOnly midfielder Gio Reyna (muscular issue) and winger Alex Zendejas (adductor) have remained out for multiple weeks.\n\nAdams, the 2022 World Cup captain, missed 10 matches before suiting up at Everton on Feb. 10 — an absence of eight weeks instead of up to a feared three months. On Saturday, he logged 66 minutes, completed 41-of-45 passes and earned the second-best defensive statistics among players on both teams as eighth-place Bournemouth extended its Premier League unbeaten streak to seven.\n\nWith his left forearm well-protected, Pepi entered in the 76th minute and, after video replay negated his apparent goal, he rocketed a 25-yard shot in the 87th minute to stretch his Eredivisie scoring streak to six games. He increased his league total to nine and overall count to 12 in just 22 appearances.\n\nThe timing was ideal for the 23-year-old Texan, who, while injured, fell behind Coventry City’s Haji Wright and Derby County’s Patrick Agyemang on the U.S. depth chart behind No. 1 striker Folarin Balogun (Monaco).\n\n“Amazing feeling to be back!” Pepi posted on social media. “Thank you to all the PSV’ers for the warm support on my return.”\n\nPochettino plans to name his squad for next month’s camp March 17 ahead of friendlies in Atlanta against Belgium on March 28 and Portugal on March 31 — the last gathering before his World Cup decisions. He must submit a provisional list of between 35 and 55 players to FIFA by May 11 before announcing the 26-man squad on or about May 26.\n\nIt was quite a week for Balogun, who followed his two-goal performance against reigning European champion Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday with a second-half goal that sparked Monaco’s three-goal uprising to shock Ligue 1 leader Lens, 3-2.\n\nHe increased his overall goal haul to 11: five in Ligue 1, five in the Champions League and one in the French Cup.\n\nMidfielder Tanner Tessmann (58 minutes) and third-place Lyon saw their 13-game winning streak across all competitions end with a 3-1 defeat at Strasbourg.\n\nRight back Tim Weah was Olympique Marseille’s best player from an analytical standpoint in a 2-0 loss at Brest, extending fourth-place OM’s overall slump to 1-3-2 heading into next Sunday’s critical home match against Lyon.\n\nToulouse center back Mark McKenzie served a yellow card suspension and missed the 1-1 draw with Paris FC.\n\nCenter back Chris Richards helped Crystal Palace register its second shutout in three Premier League matches, a 1-0 victory over last-place Wolverhampton, which played a man short for about a half-hour before conceding the goal.\n\nLeft back Antonee Robinson was held out of Fulham’s 3-1 triumph at Sunderland without an official explanation, his third consecutive league absence. He had played 90 last weekend in the FA Cup.\n\nMidfielder Brenden Aaronson (73 minutes) and Leeds earned their third straight away draw in Premier League play, a 1-1 result at Aston Villa.\n\nAfter productive matches in the English Championship last week, Wright and Agyemang were quiet. Wright played 71 minutes in a 2-0 victory at West Brom and Agyemang went 90 in a 2-0 loss at Watford.\n\nMidfielder Aidan Morris went 75 in Middlesbrough’s 0-0 draw with second-to-last Oxford, leaving his club three points behind first-place Coventry but six points ahead in the race for the second promotion to the Premier League.\n\nChristian Pulisic, who has been battling bursitis, returned to AC Milan’s lineup after three substitution appearances with a 62-minute effort and two quality scoring chances during a 1-0 home loss to Parma — its first loss in Serie A since the August opener, a stretch of 23 games.\n\nMidfielder Weston McKennie, who has been in tremendous form for Juventus this winter, played all of the 2-0 loss to Como, a result that stretched the Turin club’s winless rut to five games heading into the home leg of the Champions League affair with Galatasaray on Wednesday. (Juventus lost last week’s opener, 5-2.)\n\nMidfielder Yunus Musah remained on the bench for the seventh time in nine matches as Atalanta edged Napoli, 2-1. He has appeared in 14-of-26 Serie A matches with just three starts, totalling 447 minutes.\n\nIn Serie B, goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann has conceded 10 goals in three matches, the most recent setback coming in Cesena’s 3-2 loss to Spezia.\n\nMidfielder Malik Tillman played 81 minutes in Bayer Leverkusen’s 1-0 loss at Union Berlin, ending a seven-game unbeaten streak heading into the Champions League second leg Tuesday against Olympiacos. Leverkusen won the first leg, 2-0.\n\nTeenage center back Noahkai Banks (17th start) continued to impress at Augsburg, which used a late comeback to earn a 3-2 victory at Wolfsburg.\n\nReyna’s call-up hopes continued to dim after missing his fifth consecutive match for Mönchengladbach. Over two months, he has played just 28 minutes. Teammate Joe Scally, a right wing back, played the entire match.\n\nMidfielder James Sands’ run of 17 consecutive starts for St. Pauli across all competitions ended, but he entered in the 80th minute and helped seal a 2-1 victory over Werder Bremen, which lifted the Hamburg side out of the automatic relegation zone.\n\nIn the second division, left wing back John Tolkin (70 minutes) and Holstein Kiel lost at Karlsruher, 3-1 — their fifth consecutive loss overall.\n\nMidfielder Johnny Cardoso made his fifth consecutive La Liga start for Atlético Madrid, which defeated Espanyol, 4-2, to snap a three-game winless streak in league play.\n\nRight back Alex Freeman did not play in Villarreal’s 2-1 win over Valencia.\n\nWhile Pepi’s goal headlined the U.S. contributions for PSV Eindhoven, right back Sergiño Dest made his 22nd start as the league leaders continued to run away with the title, thanks to a 20-2-2 record and a plus-41 goal differential.\n\nCenter back Auston Trusty’s second red card in four weeks – for violent conduct in the 74th minute – imperiled Celtic, which conceded Hibernian’s late winner in the 2-1 outcome. He will miss next Sunday’s Old Firm clash against Rangers.\n\nOn opening weekend, three Vancouver players in the U.S. pool – center back Tristan Blackmon, midfielder Sebastian Berhalter and striker Brian White – played the whole match as the Whitecaps edged Real Salt Lake, 1-0. RSL midfielder Diego Luna sat out with a knee ailment.\n\nFive goalkeeping candidates started, led by Pochettino’s undisputed starter, New York City’s Matt Freese, who made five saves in a 1-1 draw against the L.A. Galaxy. The others were New England’s Matt Turner, Chicago’s Chris Brady, Columbus’ Patrick Schulte and Cincinnati’s Roman Celentano.\n\nCenter backs Tim Ream (Charlotte), Miles Robinson (Cincinnati) and Walker Zimmerman (Toronto) and left wing back Max Arfsten (Columbus) played every minute and midfielder Luca de la Torre (Charlotte) went 69.\n\nLos Angeles FC midfielder Timothy Tillman assisted during his 82-minute stint in the 3-0 home rout of Inter Miami before 75,673 at the Coliseum. Midfielder Cristian Roldan captained Seattle’s 2-0 win over Colorado.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are looking to finish the second half of the season strong and secure a favorable spot in the playoffs. However, it has been an up-and-down year for Los Angeles. For LeBron James, the bigger picture is his potential options this offseason.\n\n“Cleveland is one of them. I’m not sure I’d put the Heat on the list. Golden State depending on how things go would be one. There’s a place of two that I won’t say right now that I’m keeping my eye on… I have a team or two that I think he could consider going to and I have researched the concept and I will continue to keep my eye on the concept,” Brian Windhorst said on the Rich Eisen Show.\n\nIf this is indeed his final season, James wants to be part of a contender.\n\n“LeBron wants to compete for a championship,\" James’ agent Rich Paul told ESPN. \"He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. We are very appreciative of the partnership that we've had for eight years with Jeanie [Buss] and Rob [Pelinka] and consider the Lakers as a critical part of his career.”\n\nOn the court, head coach JJ Redick believes the Lakers need to share the ball more to maximize their potential.\n\n“That's, again, it's something we talk about all the time. We're a better basketball team. We win more games if we have more potential assists. And get more assists,” Redick said after a loss to the Boston Celtics.\n\nWith Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves, and James on the floor, ball movement shouldn’t be an issue. Yet, for some reason, the ball is sticking in one spot longer than usual when the Lakers are dropping games.\n\nWhen all three stars are working together and moving the ball effectively, the Lakers become a formidable force. The team’s main challenge is finding consistency in connecting with one another on the court.",

    "fullText": "Lakers insider exposes nightmare stat for LeBron James, Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves playing together originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are looking forward to this summer with excitement, especially regarding potential roster moves. One key focus is Austin Reaves, who will be a free agent this offseason, though there is mutual interest in bringing him back.\n\n“I try not to think about it. Honestly. I've said it a million times. I want to be in L.A. I love it,\" Reaves told ESPN. \"Even though the other extension was turned down, that doesn't mean that I'm trying to go get a f---ing gigantic number that don't make sense. I want to be here, I want to win. I want to do everything that can help this organization be better. So I don't try to think about those things.\"\n\nThe Lakers also have a bright future with Luka Doncic, whose only request is to win now.\n\n“Dončić being just 26 gives the Lakers a far longer timeline to build a championship-contending team, but that doesn't mean they can slow down and take their time. Dončić told Lakers president Rob Pelinka and coach JJ Redick in May that he's not interested in taking the slow approach in building a contender,” CBS Sports’ Jasmyn Wimbish wrote.\n\nAdd LeBron James to the mix, and expectations for the Big Three are sky-high. However, Lakers insider Jovan Buha recently highlighted a concerning stat when the trio plays together.\n\n“The Lakers are now 8-4 in their 12 games with the Big 3. Their four losses are to the four best teams they've played record-wise: Spurs, Rockets, Celtics and Suns. They've lost all of those games by double digits. That's concerning,” Buha posted.\n\nWhile 12 games is a small sample size, expectations for the Big Three are much higher. Dominating weaker teams is one thing, but failing to notch a single significant win against the league’s best with all three stars on the floor is troubling.\n\nThe Lakers have an elite Big Three, but they haven’t been able to fully click when it matters most. The trio will need to figure this out as the playoffs approach in a few months.",

    "description": "A six-shot lead at Riviera had evaporated with Tiger Woods looking on?",
    "fullText": "PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. — The scariest putt in golf is somewhere between three and four feet.\n\nShort enough that you expect to make it.\n\nLong enough that you might not.\n\nIt gets tougher, I’d imagine, to hit a three-and-a-half footer with 5,000 people watching from the hillside in front of you.\n\nTougher when they’ve just gasped in horror at what you’ve just done.\n\nTougher still when one of those people is Rory McIlroy, who just so happens to be one stroke behind you.\n\nAnd tougher when another is Tiger Woods, your childhood hero, looking on from a perch beside the clubhouse, 50 yards and 500 miles away, waiting to shake your hand as long as you can somehow get your ball to the bottom of that hole.\n\nIt gets tougher when you’re on the brink of winning your first PGA Tour event, something you’ve dreamt of your entire life, something you know you can do but also know isn’t guaranteed.\n\nAnd tougher knowing that missing wouldn’t just mean letting an opportunity slip by — it would mean blowing a six-stroke lead, crashing on the final turn, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nIt gets tougher when the pressure hasn’t slowly mounted, but instead, after three rounds and 15 holes of low stress and many birdies, it hits like a freight train, with a shrinking lead, a growing crowd, decibels, nerves and heart rate rising by the minute.\n\nAnd it gets tougher when you can’t feel your hands.\n\nSUNDAY BROUGHT THE MOST GLORIOUS WEATHER in the history of Los Angeles, tied for first with 80 percent of all days in L.A. history, 70 degrees and sunny, deep blue cloudless sky matching the deep blue ocean just visible from the balcony of Riviera Country Club’s iconic clubhouse.\n\nThat was the setting for the final round of the Genesis Invitational, which felt like it could go one of two directions. Jacob Bridgeman began the day with a six-shot lead over Rory McIlroy and seven-plus over the rest of the gang, having played nearly flawless golf through three rounds. Bridgeman has been very good and very steady since last season, but entering Sunday he’d never won. Would he succumb to the pressure, blow up and yield to the chase pack? Or would he keep his foot on the gas and continue speeding away from the rest of the field? Those felt like the two options.\n\nInstead, much of the day settled in the awkward in-between.\n\nThere are few better golf settings than the iconic old-school cool of Riviera, though early tee times plus an L.A. crowd living up to its get-there-in-the-fourth-inning reputation led to a slightly muted early stretch.\n\nRiviera’s just a really cool place to watch a golf tournament pic.twitter.com/Bn8dl5jgh2\n\n— Dylan Dethier (@dylan_dethier) February 22, 2026\n\nFans were pulling for McIlroy, wanting to will him into a comeback, but they were quietly supportive of Bridgeman, too, an impressive unknown without an ounce of villain in him. Bridgeman matched McIlroy’s birdie at No. 1 to keep his lead at six. He birdied the third to stretch it to seven. Even that was greeted with light applause. McIlroy’s early birdie tries slid by, doing little to ignite the crowd. Hollywood seemed unimpressed with this particular bit of anticlimax.\n\n(One star among them: Ben Affleck, who walked the entire front nine inside the ropes with his son and tried multiple times to frame up the perfect iPhone photo of a McIlroy tee shot. The stars, they’re just like us!)\n\nBridgeman has been forged in the fires of competitive golf, first growing up in South Carolina, then at Clemson and more recently on the game’s top circuit. He’s been on a steady upward trajectory. He’s made it clear that success isn’t all his own.\n\nWhen he first started working with his swing coach Scott Hamilton, he had some work to do. “I didn’t hit the ball straight, didn’t hit it high, didn’t have a lot of control with my irons,” he said.\n\nWhen he settled on his first-choice caddie, G.W. Cable, there was just one problem: he’d have to take a pay cut to join Bridgeman on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\n“He took a gamble on me and luckily we only spent one year down there and I think he’s pretty pleased with his gamble,” Bridgeman said.\n\nHe earned $4.4 million on the course last season. He was playing for a $4 million winner’s check on Sunday. Good pressure to have.\n\nBut just because he’s been good doesn’t mean it’d be easy. As the day lingered, Bridgeman let the rest of the field do the same. He bogeyed 4. He bogeyed 7. He hit the middles of greens, he scared the hole, just missing putts that he’d watched fall the first three days.\n\nMcIlroy finally made some semblance of a push early on the back nine. Birdie at 11 cut the lead to five before a highlight-reel hole-out birdie from the bunker at 12 electrified the crowd for the first time all day.\n\nNot going down without a fight!@McIlroyRory birdies from the bunker to get within 4 of solo leader Jacob Bridgeman.\n\n📺 CBS pic.twitter.com/nOJ9IH0g0M\n\n— PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) February 22, 2026\n\nUp ahead, several other contenders made their presence felt. Aldrich Potgieter got to 15 under with an eagle at 11. Adam Scott played stunning golf, stacking eight birdies and zero bogeys to post the clubhouse lead at 16 under. And then, just as Bridgeman found himself in a spot of bother, Kurt Kitayama made his seventh and eighth birdies of the day in the group ahead to post 17 under par.\n\nBridgeman wobbled with a wayward tee shot at No. 16, dumping his iron into the front right bunker, an inescapable jail.\n\n“It was honestly easy until I got to about 16 and then it got really hard,” Bridgeman said post-round. His caddie, looking at his lie, didn’t hesitate. He had to aim right and play for bogey. His lengthy par putt wandered past the hole; he negotiated in a nervy try for bogey. The lead was suddenly one.\n\nThings only got tougher at the par-5 17th, where Bridgeman’s second shot sailed right and found a bunker, leaving him with no good options. He did well to play a sensible shot.\n\n“Definitely around the green, that was the first time that I had to play defense,” he said.\n\nIt was around this time that Bridgeman lost feeling in his hands.\n\n“I didn’t really feel really crazy nervous until I had a five-footer for bogey on 16; that one was sketchy,” he said. “I hit a really good putt and luckily it went in, and then I was really nervous from there on out. I couldn’t even feel my hands on the last couple greens, I just hit the putt hoping it would get somewhere near the hole.”\n\nBut on full shots, Bridgeman said, he still felt okay.\n\n“I felt like I was just kind of in robot mode and autopilot, I could just swing the club and it would do exactly what it’s supposed to do,” he said. An envious feeling.\n\nThat’s what he did on No. 18, sending driver up the left-center fairway off the tee and playing a towering approach right at the hole, 20 feet short, straight uphill.\n\nAnd then he left it three and a half feet short.\n\nThe crowd groaned. They murmured. Suddenly, a tantalizing possibility was back in play: a miss would mean a three-way playoff between Bridgeman, Kitayama and McIlroy, whose dramatic birdie putt had dripped over the front edge just moments before.\n\nBridgeman is good friends with Chris Gotterup, a rising star on Tour and a recent multiple-time winner. He recounted watching the WM Phoenix Open, where Gotterup poured in a winning birdie putt with aggressive speed.\n\n“We were like, what were you doing? You hit your putt so hard, it was going to go four feet by the hole. He said, ‘I have no idea, I couldn’t feel my hands.’\n\n“I thought he was kind of crazy until I got to this moment and then I was like, yep, I understand what you’re talking about now, Chris. I had no idea what to do.”\n\nIt’s tough to make a three-and-a-half footer, and it’s tougher if you can sense that some portion of the crowd around is suddenly hoping that you will.\n\nBut, as he and we suddenly realized, easier for Jacob Bridgeman.\n\n“The hole’s really white and it looked pretty big for whatever reason on 18,” he said. He had his read — hit it at the middle of the middle — and he knew what he could control.\n\n“I was just hoping that the ball would roll where it was supposed to roll.”\n\nMost of the time, nothing good can happen with a three-and-a-half-footer. It’s a multiple-choice test with two options: Relief or disaster. This time, though, salvation lay within. The ball rolled as it was supposed to. Bridgeman’s triumph was official. He plunged into the winner’s whirlpool; his wife greeted him on the green, he floated through his CBS interview, he climbed the stairs, shook Woods’ hand, didn’t process whatever he said.\n\n“This is way, way better than I’ve ever dreamt it,” he said.\n\nDylan Dethier welcomes your comments at dylan_dethier@golf.com.\n\nThe post ‘Couldn’t feel my hands’: Inside Jacob Bridgeman’s terrifying Genesis finish appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea are reportedly now looking into a move to sign Sunderland’s 6ft 4in goalkeeper Robin Roefs this summer.\n\nIt’s a surprise link that has come from nowhere really, with the goalkeeper noise around Stamford Bridge going a little bit quiet lately.\n\nWith the form of Robert Sanchez improving immensely, we have seen new number one goalkeeper links with Chelsea die out a little bit. But there is another situation brewing up.\n\nFilip Jorgensen is basically not playing at all now at Chelsea and will clearly be looking to move on in the summer if his situation does not improve. He is a young goalkeeper who will not be happy playing as a backup – so you will see him looking to move on at the end of the season. And Chelsea will need to replace him.\n\nAgain though, will Roefs be happy being a backup, if that is what they are looking at him for, if they are even looking at him at all?\n\nThey are, according to one reliable journalist this week.\n\nChelsea are interested in signing Roefs ahead of the summer transfer window, with the North East club slapping a £50m price tag on his head, according to journalist Alan Nixon.\n\nThe big shock here though is that the report actually claims Roefs would be to replace SANCHEZ and NOT Jorgensen!?\n\nAccording to the report from Nixon, Chelsea are in the race to sign Sunderland goalkeeper Roefs ahead of the transfer window. The Blues are believed to be searching for a new number one, and Sunderland would be willing to do business if the price is right.\n\nNixon claims it could take an offer in the region of £50m for Chelsea to secure his signature, while Roefs would be keen on a move if Rosenior’s side seal Champions League qualification.\n\nI simply cannot see this right now, don’t think it will happen, at least not replacing Sanchez with him.",

In that context, this campaign still represents significant progress.\n\nNine draws have ultimately cost them momentum. Turning even a handful of those stalemates into victories could have kept them firmly in the title conversation deep into the spring.\n\nHowever, this is not a side that should beat itself up.

However, what followed was a brisk, 10-minute exchange that often drifted far from the field.\n\nHere are the seven questions Pate posed and how the answers unfolded in the conversation.\n\nPate opened with a broad question about the sport’s structure and enforceable rules. Trump began by saying, “It’s too bad. I hate to see it,” before pivoting to NFL kickoff rule changes. He never directly addressing college football governance.\n\nTrump responded by name-checking teams he “likes,” including Georgia and South Carolina, and praised quarterback Gunner Stockton, who was in the room. He then told the audience Pate had asked how he judges players, which he had not, leaving the original question unanswered.\n\nWhen asked what was discussed, Trump said their conversations are “always” about politics, contradicting Meyer’s prior claim that they discussed football.\n\nAfter briefly mentioning Miami and Indiana’s Curt Cignetti, Pate pivoted to hiring philosophy. Trump launched into a familiar monologue about instincts and staffing decisions.\n\nThe response centered on instincts. Trump then detoured into praise for Herschel Walker, calling him “maybe the greatest player ever.”\n\nThis led to reflections about the Lincoln Bedroom rather than football.\n\nThe final exchange remained general, touching only lightly on sports.\n\nMore:Donald Trump trends after failed Army-Navy coin toss\n\nAs Pate later explained, a planned 30-to 40-minute long interview was cut short due to a scheduling conflict.

    "description": "Fans should welcome the belief of sources on all sides that Harry Maguire will remain at Manchester United at least for next season, writes Simon Stone.",
    "fullText": "When Manchester United's squad arrived at Burnley for the first match of the post-Ruben Amorim era on 7 January, the major questions centred around the fitness of skipper Bruno Fernandes and whether interim boss Darren Fletcher would pick Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nHarry Maguire's presence in the travelling party at Turf Moor was something of a surprise.\n\nThe 32-year-old had been absent for nine matches with a thigh injury and there had been no real talk of a return.\n\nIn reality, Fletcher would only have called on United's one-time skipper in extreme circumstances that night. At that point, Maguire had barely even trained.\n\nBut Maguire did feature for 11 minutes four days later as he tried - unsuccessfully -to help rescue an FA Cup third round defeat by Brighton.\n\nFletcher was doing Michael Carrick a huge favour.\n\nDespite featuring just once in almost three months, it meant when Carrick took charge for the first time for Manchester City's visit to Old Trafford on 17 January, Maguire was wired into the mental demands of starting, even if his new boss admitted afterwards, physically, it was a step into the unknown.\n\n\"It was a big ask for H [Maguire],\" said Carrick.\n\n\"We can take for granted sometimes what players do. I'm not going to lie, it was a bit of a calculated gamble for how long he could play and if he could get through it because he's literally trained for two or three days in probably eight or nine weeks. It just shows you what it means to him.\"\n\nThe 'taking for granted' aspect of Carrick's answer was telling.\n\nThe former United and England midfielder knows the sacrifices needed to excel at the very highest levels of the game. He also knows the demands that are placed on players' bodies.\n\nBeyond his ability, it is the kind of attitude that meant he put himself forward to be involved at Burnley, which makes Maguire so valuable to United.\n\nIt is why, as they approach a summer when Casemiro's vast experience is going to be lost, it should be welcomed that multiple sources with an understanding of the situation believe a resolution will eventually be found to Maguire's contractual situation that will allow him to remain at Manchester United at least for next season.\n\nNothing is agreed yet. Until it is, there remains the potential for Maguire to either agree a deal with another club - which, under freedom of contract regulations, he is entitled to do - or United back away.\n\nCompromise is likely to be needed, on both salary - Maguire is one of United's highest-paid players and Sir Jim Ratcliffe is determined to drive costs down - and maybe contract length.\n\nBut through Burnley, Brighton, City and beyond Maguire played for every single minute of the four-match winning streak Carrick started his spell in charge with.\n\nThe England defender has shown just how valuable he is at a time when Matthijs de Ligt remains sidelined for an indefinite period with a back injury, with no immediate sign of return.\n\nMaguire does not only have experience and calmness. His communication is also crucial. He is demanding of those around him and is not scared to let team-mates know when they have fallen below the standards he expects.\n\nHis central defensive partnership with Lisandro Martinez has a familiarity about it too, which is a bit surprising given the pair have only started 16 times together in a two-man central defence since the Argentina international joined the Old Trafford outfit from Ajax in 2022.\n\nThe reasons for that are numerous. Amorim's formation for a start. Before that, Erik ten Hag clearly did not feel Maguire was the kind of player he wanted, while Martinez has suffered some pretty hefty injuries.\n\nThere is also the knowledge their first two games together were the defeats by Brighton and Brentford that started Ten Hag's reign.\n\nThey have won in 11 of the following 14 games they have started though, which suggests keeping them both fit could be the key to United's Champions League qualification quest.\n\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel has acknowledged Maguire's recent form, even though the defender won the last of his 64 caps nearly 18 months ago, against the Republic of Ireland in September 2024.\n\n\"Back in the picture,\" is how Tuchel described it at this month's Nations League draw.\n\nNot that many Manchester United fans will be too bothered about that.\n\nFor them, England's fortunes come a firm second to their own hopes of an upturn in results.\n\nMaguire probably thinks like that too.\n\nA veteran of England's last three major tournament campaigns, he knows excelling at a club like Manchester United can propel anyone into the international limelight.\n\nThere is also a feeling Maguire is happy in his surroundings too, that he is settled with his family in the north-west and has no aching desire to start again somewhere else just yet.\n\nHe hasn't spoken about his future much recently. But on current evidence, there is no reason to suggest he has changed his stance from when he spoke to BBC Sport, among others, on a club visit to a football camp in Stretford just after the Premier League campaign had started.\n\n\"Obviously I have something in my mind about what I want to do and where I want to be,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't want to put it out there to everybody but it's an amazing club to play for and you'd be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Eintracht Frankfurt’s sporting director Markus Krösche offered a nuanced assessment of the defeat against FC Bayern. The first half, in particular, gave the 43-year-old cause for concern.\n\n“You have to say that we had difficulties in the first half. Bayern were very dominant and we made too many simple mistakes and lost possession too easily,” Krösche explained. Nevertheless, the first two goals conceded came after a second ball and a set piece. “After that, it was important to go into halftime at 0-2.”\n\nAfter the break, Eintracht showed a marked improvement. “In the second half, we did much better, played better football, and were braver. The substitutions really gave us a boost,” said Krösche. It also became clear “what we have been lacking time and again in recent weeks and months.”\n\nAt the same time, the sporting director admitted that Bayern had slowed the tempo a bit after the break, but still created chances. Goalkeeper Kaua Santos, in particular, distinguished himself with several strong saves.\n\nAll in all, Krösche viewed the second half especially positively: “Overall, the second half was a step forward.” Despite the defeat, the Eintracht management sees signs of development – now it’s a matter of confirming this over the full 90 minutes.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Braves' $7M injury prone fan favorite, World Series champion deemed unreliable, questioning future originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are officially underway with their 2026 Spring Training games, and there are still plenty of questions to be answered before Opening Day. One lingering question from last season was whether the Braves would bring back Ozzie Albies. Braves GM Alex Anthopoulos didn’t make that decision clear during the 2025 season.\n\n“With all these options (on players), we always make the decision at the end of the year — you have five days after the World Series, and that’s when you make the decision. It’s just, things can happen, things change. You always wait,” Anthopoulos said.\n\nThe Braves ended their season in disappointment, but the organization was quick to resolve Albies’ future. They opted to bring back their fan favorite and the player who has consistently been the best at his position for the team.\n\n“The Braves are going to pick up their club option on infielder Ozzie Albies. The club hasn’t announced the decision yet, but president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos confirmed the move in a radio appearance, per Mark Zinno of 92.9 The Game,” Steve Adams wrote for MLB Trade Rumors.\n\nHowever, heading into the regular season, if Albies’ injuries continue, he could become a liability for the Braves.\n\n“Even really good players can become liabilities in one form or another. That doesn't take away from the player they were, but it should inform the Braves' decisions and fans' perception that some guys can't be trusted in certain roles anymore,” HTHB’s Eric Cole wrote. “It was kind of a fun bit for a few years there, where the national media just continually disrespected Ozzie Albies despite the fact that he was among the best second basemen in all of baseball. However, what first looked like just some rough injury luck has become a pattern, and it is now completely fair to call him injury-prone and wonder about his future with the Braves.”\n\nThe Braves are extremely grateful for what Albies has contributed to the organization, but his injuries have also put the team in difficult situations. This season is a must-prove year for the star infielder.\n\nIf Atlanta wants to be successful, they need Albies on the field. If he can’t stay healthy, he risks letting down the Braves faithful once again. There was once a time when it was believed the Braves would have no hesitation keeping Albies for his entire career, but injuries have cast uncertainty over that future.",

A banner from the Ultra Boys 90, which said, “Chelsea doesn’t decide what happens at Racing,” was refused entry to the Meinau stadium on Sunday evening.\n\nIt’s a bit wild that they seem to be rejecting banners like this at their home games. They should be free to voice whatever opinions they have as long as they aren’t offensive, which this one clearly is not. This kind of thing just does not sit well with me I’m afraid. It’s a bit controlling.\n\nLiam Rosenior was understandably disappointed by Chelsea’s performance in the game yesterday, as he explained to Chelsea TV.\n\nPedro Neto got an assist yesterday, but Chelsea’s attack in general disappointed as they failed to capitalise more on their periods of dominance.\n\nCheck out the latest edition of Simon Phillips’ SPTC podcast here:",

    "fullText": "Manchester United Women lost their first game since before Christmas to Chelsea in the FA Cup.\n\nIn spite of a fine effort, they were beaten 2-1 by their old rivals.\n\nHead coach Marc Skinner spoke to the club’s official website after the game and gave his thoughts on the performance.\n\nResponding to how he felt after the game, he stated, “Proud. Proud. So proud of the players. So proud of all the commitment. We’ve just played back-to-back-to-back games — travel away, travel at home — and to put in that performance epitomises everything we are. It epitomises our fans’ energy, our players’ energy. There’s something special about us, about this team.”\n\nHe also claimed that the loss “hurt”, but everyone could see how much the game meant to his players.\n\nSkinner also claimed that the defeat will be useful, as it “will feed us for the next games coming up.”\n\nThe manager also added that he feels his side should have had a penalty and that he is hoping his team will get more luck in the upcoming League Cup final against the same opponent.\n\nSkinner also revealed that his team changed shape and strategy during the match to try and take the win, but once again reiterated that it was his team’s effort that pleased him the most.\n\nHe claimed his team, “showed real commitment when things are against you and you can still fight. That shows special character. And if you’re at a special team like ours, that’s what you have to build.”\n\nComparing both teams, Skinner added that United have had to build more slowly and methodically over the years than Chelsea, but that they are finally getting to a place where they can compete.\n\nHe added, “the players we brought in this year have epitomised and galvanised the group and pushed us on to stronger things. We’ll come back from this stronger. We haven’t tasted defeat in a while, so it’s a little shock — but it gives us fresh impetus going into the next games.”\n\nA common theme in recent games has been the size of support that United have brought along to away games, both at home and in Europe.\n\nSpeaking on this issue, Skinner explained, “they’re the life force behind us — the golden thread in everything we try to do. Honestly, they mean the world to us.”\n\nFeatured image Maja Hitij via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "The Sporting Tribune's Arash Markazi reflects on his 25-year friendship with Jim Hill as the broadcasting legend celebrates 50 years of covering sports in Los Angeles.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES – Jim Hill wouldn’t want me to write this column, but this is one of the few times I must ignore the advice of a man I have looked up to for as long as I can remember watching sports in Los Angeles.\n\nOn Sunday, the Los Angeles Lakers unveiled a statue of Pat Riley, the head coach of the Showtime Lakers, in a ceremony attended by Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Byron Scott, Michael Douglas and Michael McDonald, among others. Lionel Richie even took his courtside seat before the Lakers played the Boston Celtics, as John Tesh’s “Roundball Rock” blared through the arena. If the party had leaned any further into the 1980s, it might have been drenched in neon and simulcast on MTV.\n\nThe ceremony took me back to my childhood, watching Jim cover the Showtime Lakers for KCBS 2 and KABC 7. This month, Jim is celebrating his 50th year covering sports in Los Angeles. Next month, I’ll turn 46. Nearly every memory I have of sports in this city — from the Lakers’ 11 NBA championships to the Dodgers’ ifve World Series titles since 1980 — is connected to Jim talking to players in the locker room after the game.\n\nThe only thing more surreal than covering the teams I grew up watching today is doing it alongside Jim and calling him a friend.\n\nI always dreamed of becoming a sportswriter in Los Angeles. At USC, I won the Allan Malamud Memorial Scholarship and the Jim Murray Memorial Scholarship, named after my two favorite Los Angeles Times columnists. Both Malamud and Murray died while I was a student at Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks. I never had the chance to meet them let alone cover a game alongside them.\n\nTelevision never felt attainable to me. I grew up with a stutter so severe that I would invent excuses to skip class on days when I had to present a book report. On the first day of school, when students were asked to stand and say their name, I would sometimes pretend I needed to go to the nurse’s office.\n\nI’ll never forget the first time I saw Jim as a member of the media before a 2001 Lakers-Clippers game at Staples Center. I was a USC student freelancing for SLAM magazine. We were seated next to each other. He slapped me on the knee like we were old friends and introduced himself, as if I didn’t already know exactly who he was.\n\nWe stayed in touch as my career evolved as I became a staff writer at Sports Illustrated, senior writer at ESPN and a columnist at the Los Angeles Times. At every step, Jim would put me on the air, making me more comfortable with a microphone and a camera representing thousands of households. The kid who once struggled to say his own name was suddenly talking sports with Jim Hill on CBS in Los Angeles.\n\nAs someone who grew up in Los Angeles watching Jim Hill, it was pretty cool co-anchoring Sports Central on CBS after the Lakers-Celtics game on Sunday. pic.twitter.com/jqTe5ze7p8\n\n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) February 25, 2020\n\nWhen I became an adjunct professor at USC, Jim was a regular guest speaker. I wanted my students to hear the same advice he once gave me: It’s all about relationships and hard work — and how inseparable the two are.\n\nThe contact list on Jim’s iPhone reads like a Hall of Fame program — legendary players and coaches, Academy Award-winning actors and directors, even a former United States president. But the relationships he nurtures daily are with beat writers and public relations directors across the city. While many anchors prefer the comforts of the studio, Jim has always preferred being in the thick of the action — at every game, every press conference, often seated in the front row, asking the first question.\n\nOne of the greatest honors of my career came during the 2020 World Series, when I was asked to fill in for Jim as the Dodgers faced the Tampa Bay Rays in Arlington, Texas. As thrilling as it was to watch the Dodgers win their first title since 1988, the celebration felt muted 1,500 miles from home during a global pandemic.\n\nWe made up for it in 2024 when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees to win the World Series less than a month after my wedding. After finishing our postgame interviews in the clubhouse, Jim poured a bottle of champagne over my head while on the air and wrapped me in a hug.\n\nHighlight of the night? Jim Hill pouring a bottle of champagne on me while on air. 😂🍾 pic.twitter.com/Q9Gl7oq4YO\n\n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) October 31, 2024\n\nSunday was a celebration of Pat Riley and the Showtime Lakers. But as I watched Jim work the room after the ceremony as the only member of the media who covered every championship that team won it felt like something more.\n\nIt felt like a celebration of 50 years of Jim Hill telling the story of Los Angeles sports — and, in so many ways, shaping the dreams of a kid who grew up watching him do it.",

    "fullText": "Everton host Manchester United at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Monday night, knowing this is a chance to reset the mood around their season.\n\nEverton started the weekend eighth in the Premier League table, firmly in the European conversation.\n\nStill, frustration is growing on Merseyside after six games without a win at home in all competitions. Another defeat under the lights would only worsen the unease.\n\nHowever, Everton have already beaten United once this season and will take confidence from that win when they welcome the resurgent Red Devils for this tantalising clash.\n\nEverton boss David Moyes returns to face his former club at a delicate time. The 2-1 home defeat to Bournemouth before the break was particularly galling.\n\nEverton were in control before eight chaotic minutes flipped the game. A chance to consolidate a European push slipped away.\n\nTheir home form is now a concern. They have lost five of their last nine Premier League matches on Merseyside, as many as in their previous 28.\n\nThe new 52,000-seat arena is yet to feel like a fortress.\n\nIn contrast, their away record has been excellent. It is the inconsistency at Hill Dickinson Stadium that is holding them back.\n\nMeanwhile, Man United arrive in very different spirits. Since Michael Carrick replaced Ruben Amorim, United have rediscovered rhythm and resilience.\n\nNo side has collected more points in 2026.\n\nA stoppage-time equaliser from Benjamin Sesko at West Ham United extended their unbeaten run and underlined a growing belief. United are playing with freedom again.\n\nEverton are looking to complete just their second Premier League double over Manchester United after 2013/14. But the Toffees must be wary.\n\nUnited have 19 away wins and 42 overall victories against Everton in the Premier League, more than any team has against another in the competition’s history.\n\nEverton have lost five of their last nine home league games (W2, D2) while United are unbeaten in their last nine top-flight matches (W5, D4), their longest such run since 2021.\n\nJake O’Brien is suspended following his red card against Bournemouth, forcing a reshuffle in defence.\n\nLong-term absentee Jack Grealish remains sidelined, but Seamus Coleman is back in contention and could return at right-back.\n\nMore likely, Moyes will roll with Scottish international (15-caps) Nathan Patterson at right-back. Tyrique George, 20, should retain his place in the attack.\n\nIdrissa Gueye is available despite his dismissal at Old Trafford, while Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall will be eager to haunt United again after scoring the winner in November.\n\nJordan Pickford; Nathan Patterson, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; Idrissa Gueye, James Garner; Tyrique George, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Iliman Ndiaye; Thierno Barry.",

    "title": "Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, February 22, 2026: Still low (from 5.86% to 6.01%)",
    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates. The 30-year rate is near three-year lows on a popular lender marketplace. Shop for your best rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nToday's mortgage rates are near multi-year lows. While Freddie Mac reported the current 30-year fixed home loan rate at 6.01% this week, the Zillow lender marketplace is reporting an average rate of 5.86%. Is it a good time to buy a house or refinance your mortgage? Shop multiple lenders and you'll see just how much rates can vary.\n\nMORE: Sub-6% offers nearly double: Mortgage lenders with the best rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to refinance your mortgage.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use. It also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate today is 5.86%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.41% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.\n\nLet’s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 5.86% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,772, and you’d pay $337,826 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.41% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,437. But you’d only pay $138,650 in interest over the years.\n\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\n\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\n\nRead more about fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\n\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\n\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\n\nLearn 6 tips for choosing a mortgage lender.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate for purchasing a home is 5.86%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.41%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.86% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI).\n\nAccording to January forecasts, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.10% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate near 6% through the end of the year.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing. Learn how to qualify for this limited-time rate discount.\n\nMortgage rates inched lower this week as an upbeat jobs report bumped the bond market slightly higher.",

I’m most concerned about power outages here because we have this heavy, wet snow and some very strong winds.”\n\n“We’re looking at gusts anywhere from 30 to 60 mph, so with the heavy wet snow we’re looking at some power outages especially for the coast and southeastern Massachusetts. Something to keep in mind, Monday, the worst of the wind will be early on, eventually easing up late Monday,” said Graf.\n\nPower outages are a top concern in our Monday blizzard. Heavy, wet snow and 50-70 mph gusts will lead to widespread issues.

We’re looking at heavy wet snow initially, and then eventually a little bit of a lighter snow later in the day on Monday.”\n\nSouth of Boston into Rhode Island, including parts of the South Coast, South Shore, and Norfolk County are expected to see 18-24 inches.\n\nFrom most of Connecticut to Worcester County, up to the New Hampshire border, up to a foot of snow is possible.\n\n“The farther north and west you go, those totals will taper slightly,” Graf said.\n\nAntico added, “Just from the numbers alone, this will be a big storm.”\n\nMonday Blizzard Snowfall –\nThis will be our most impactful storm in several years.

    "description": "Trump shares statement from Laura Loomer calling on president to kill Netflix deal",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reposted a message calling Michelle Obama a “racist” and ranted against a former high-ranking official in Barack Obama’s administration as he prepares to face Democrats in Congress at the State of the Union address.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Saturday, the president reposted a message from far-right activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer describing the former first lady as an “anti-white racist.” In his own caption, the president took aim at another Black woman in the same administration: former White House adviser Susan Rice.\n\nThreatening Netflix to fire Rice, who serves on the company’s executive board, Trump wrote: “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences.”\n\nLoomer’s post was must more extensive and urged the president to kill an upcoming merger between Warner Bros. and Netflix, which the far-right activist feared would expand the Obamas’ influence within both companies. The former president and his wife own a production company, Higher Ground Productions, which produces a variety of content on Neftlix’s platform.\n\nOf the Obamas, Loomer wrote: “[P]ositive messaging of the Democrats' upcoming witch hunts against Trump from Barack Hussein Obama ... and his anti-White racist wife Michelle ... would likely be blasted across all streaming services as the Obamas' Higher Ground Productions continues to grow within Netflix.”\n\nThe two posts came in response to Rice warning that companies seen as guilty of cozying up to the Trump administration would face consequences of their own if Democratic lawmakers retake the House and Senate in midterm elections this fall — along with the White House in 2028.\n\nShe made the comments on a podcast hosted by Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney fired by Trump during his first term.\n\n“If these corporations think that the Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to, you know, play by the old rules, and, you know, say, ‘Oh, never mind. We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted.’ I think they’ve got another thing coming,” Rice said.\n\nTrump’s apparent support for Loomer’s description of Michelle Obama as “racist” comes as he has continues to refuse to apologize for a scandal that enveloped him this month around the posting of a bizarre AI video from his Truth Social account depicting her and her husband as apes.\n\nThe racist depiction of the nation’s first Black president was immediately condemned by politicians on both sides of the aisle, forcing the White House to offer a defense, then walk it back entirely and delete the post.\n\nRepublicans on the Hill were clearly uncomfortable with the video and called its posting a mistake. Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate’s only Black Republican, called it racist.\n\nThe former president responded on a podcast, stating that “it's important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling.\n\nTrump has blamed the post on a staffer who has access his Truth Social account, Natalie Harp, whom he said did not watch the video fully before posting it to his account.\n\nIn a statement to reporters on Air Force One, Trump claimed to have watched part of the video and sent it to his team for review and a possible post on his account. He denied seeing the part of the video where the former president and former first lady appeared.\n\n“I gave it to the people, generally they’d look at the whole thing but I guess somebody didn’t and they posted it. And then we deleted it,” said Trump.\n\nThis isn’t the first time he’s taken content or advice directly from Loomer, either.\n\nThe far-right activist found herself with new access to the Oval Office in 2025 as Trump returned to the White House and used it to direct a purge of figures tied to Michael Waltz, then-Trump’s national security adviser, for supposed disloyalty.\n\nLoomer has also supported a loyalty-driven purge of officials across other parts of the government, with one notable victim being the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. His daughter, Maurene, was fired from the Department of Justice in July.\n\nThrough her constant, vitriolic attacks on Democrats, Loomer has faced her own accusations of racism, including in the fall of 2025, when she was widely condemned for hurling a racist slur at Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, whom she called a “ghetto Black B****.”",

    "description": "\"The body is metabolizing its own muscle tissue for energy,\" Prokopenko said.",
    "fullText": "Four years after Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s economy has entered a “death zone,” said Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nIn a recent Economist op-ed, the former Russian central bank adviser drew on a term from mountain climbing when high altitude forces the body to consume itself faster than it can repair itself.\n\nWhat is Russia's economic 'death zone'?\n\nWhat signs indicate Russia may face economic crisis?\n\nHow has the war impacted Russia's economic structure?\n\nWhy can't monetary policy fix Russia's economic problems?\n\n“Russia’s economy is stuck in what might be described as negative equilibrium: holding itself together while steadily destroying its own future capacity,” she wrote.\n\nThe economy isn’t headed for an imminent crash, but GDP has stagnated, oil revenue has been halved amid Western sanctions, and the government’s budget deficit is rapidly draining reserves.\n\nAt the same time, two economic systems have emerged. One is comprised of the military and related industries that receive priority from the Kremlin. And then there’s everything else that’s been “left in the cold,” Prokopenko explained.\n\n“The most dangerous feature of this new structure is the fuel it burns,” she added. “Russia’s economy now runs on what might be called ‘military rent’: budget transfers to defense enterprises that generate wages and economic activity.”\n\nBut the transfers are aimed at assets designed for destruction, Prokopenko pointed out. In other words, the money that keeps Russia’s factories humming pays for tanks, armored vehicles and other weapons that eventually get destroyed or damaged, making them useless for future economic growth.\n\nSimilarly, money spent to attract fresh recruits to Russia’s army doesn’t retrain them to become more productive. Instead, many die or return home permanently wounded. The Center for Strategic and International Studies has estimated Russian military casualties at 1.2 million, including 325,000 killed.\n\n“The body is metabolizing its own muscle tissue for energy,” Prokopenko said.\n\nWhile the central bank has cut interest rates to prop up growth and the Kremlin has taken steps to rein in the budget deficit, Russia’s economic predicament can’t be fixed with monetary or fiscal policies, she wrote.\n\nIn fact, interest payments on government debt this year are already set to exceed spending on education and health care combined.\n\nUnlike a cyclical downturn such as a recession, Prokopenko argued that what Russia is suffering from is more akin to altitude sickness—”the longer you stay, the worse it gets, regardless of rest.”",

    "fullText": "It has been exactly three weeks since Nancy Guthrie was reported missing. Law enforcement continues to pursue thousands of leads in the search for the 84-year-old Tucson, Arizona resident, who is presumed kidnapped.\n\nAuthorities have struggled to come up with a motive for someone abducting Guthrie. Now, a former FBI agent has shared his own possible theory on what motivated the suspected perpetrator.\n\nJonny Grusing, a 25-year veteran of the FBI's Denver Division, spoke with Fox News Digital this weekend regarding Guthrie's case.\n\nGoing off public information only, the longtime investigator and published author hypothesized that an unknown \"personal grievance\" may be the explanation for the kidnapping of Today co-host Savannah Guthrie's mother.\n\n\"It's hard to be an expert in human behavior because it's so unique to that person,\" said Grusing.\n\n\"You know, I'm just trying to use the experiences of different cases and trying to apply any sort of logic to this in the hopes that someone from the public who has thought it might be someone they know whether it's his family or whether now it's a coworker or friend or associate or whatever, to put that one puzzle piece together that says, 'Yes, and now I think it could be him.'\"\n\nGrusing cited a number of factors, including the actions of the subject in the surveillance video released by the FBI earlier this month.\n\n\"The first thing he does is with his glove, and with his glove, it doesn't look like he's trying to take [the camera] off,\" Grusing said. \"It looks like he's trying to cover it with his right hand.And then he looks down, he looks around, and he gets the branches, and he puts the branches up in front of it.\"\n\n\"Is there a chance, since we don't have audio, that he is either knocking on the door loudly or that he has pressed the ring doorbell, [that] he's trying to get Nancy to answer the door, and he's shielding himself from being seen as a masked person, so she will, in her confusion, open the door?\" Grusing continued.\n\nIf this is the case, Grusing said the situation would not fit the home robbery gone wrong theory, since the suspect seemingly wanted to lure Nancy Guthrie onto the porch for a confrontation.\n\nGrusing also said kidnapping for ransom seems unlikely since none of the ransom notes were sent directly to the Guthrie family.\n\nOn Saturday, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos issued an update on DNA found in Nancy's home, calling it \"mixed,\" meaning there is material from more than one individual.\n\nThis makes DNA testing more difficult when entering the findings through national databases.\n\n“Our lab tells us that there’s challenges with it,” Nanos said before reiterating that \"we're not quitting\" and his department remains steadfast in locating Nancy, who was last seen on Jan. 31.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's executive arm requested “full clarity” from the United States and asked its trade partner to fulfill its commitments after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down some of President Donald Trump’s most sweeping tariffs.\n\nTrump has lashed out at the court decision and said Saturday that he wants a global tariff of 15%, up from the 10% he announced a day earlier.\n\nThe European Commission said the current situation is not conducive to delivering \"fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial” trans-Atlantic trade and investment, as agreed to by both sides and spelled out in the EU-U.S. Joint Statement of August 2025.\n\nAmerican and EU officials sealed a trade deal last year that imposes a 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the United States. The European Commission handles trade for the 27 EU member countries.\n\nA top EU lawmaker said on Sunday he will propose to the European Parliament negotiating team to put the ratifying process of the deal on pause.\n\n“Pure tariff chaos on the part of the U.S. administration,” Bernd Lange, the chair of Parliament’s international trade committee, wrote on social media. “No one can make sense of it anymore — only open questions and growing uncertainty for the EU and other U.S. trading partners.”\n\nThe value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.\n\n“A deal is a deal,” the European Commission said. “As the United States’ largest trading partner, the EU expects the U.S. to honor its commitments set out in the Joint Statement — just as the EU stands by its commitments. EU products must continue to benefit from the most competitive treatment, with no increases in tariffs beyond the clear and all-inclusive ceiling previously agreed.\"\n\nHe said he talked to his European counterpart this weekend and hasn’t heard anyone tell him the deal is off.\n\n“The deals were not premised on whether or not the emergency tariff litigation would rise or fall,” Greer said. “I haven’t heard anyone yet come to me and say the deal’s off. They want to see how this plays out.”\n\nEurope’s biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits. Among the biggest U.S. exports to the bloc are professional and scientific services like payment systems and cloud infrastructure, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, aerospace products and cars.\n\n“When applied unpredictably, tariffs are inherently disruptive, undermining confidence and stability across global markets and creating further uncertainty across international supply chains,” the commission added.\n\nAs primarily a trading bloc, the EU has a powerful tool at its disposal to retaliate — the bloc’s Anti-Coercion Instrument. It includes a raft of measures for blocking or restricting trade and investment from countries found to be putting undue pressure on EU member nations or corporations.\n\nThe measures could include curtailing the export and import of goods and services, barring countries or companies from EU public tenders, or limiting foreign direct investment. In its most severe form, it would essentially close off access to the EU’s 450-million customer market and inflict billions of dollars of losses on U.S. companies and the American economy.",

    "description": "Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau described Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera as \"one of the bloodiest and most ruthless drug kingpins.\"",
    "fullText": "After spending years evading authorities worldwide, a powerful Mexican cartel leader was killed during a military operation, Mexican officials announced on Sunday, Feb. 22.\n\nNemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, commonly known as \"El Mencho,\" rose through the ranks and launched a deadly coup to become the leader of the Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG). The criminal enterprise rapidly grew into a continent-spanning empire that rivaled its former allies in the Sinaloa Cartel, run by kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who is serving life in prison.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. Department of State offered a $15 million reward for information leading to Oseguera's arrest and/or conviction. After reports of his death surfaced, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau described \"El Mencho\" in a social media post as \"one of the bloodiest and most ruthless drug kingpins.\"\n\nHere's what to know about the Mexican drug lord:\n\nHe was born Rubén Oseguera Cervantes on July 17, 1966, in the small farming city of Aguililla in the western state of Michoacán, according to The Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network. He later adopted the name Nemesio, some say to honor his godfather. It was shortened to \"El Mencho\" and has no other known meaning.\n\nA powerful drug kingpin with 5,000 members spread across every continent except Antarctica, Oseguera's brutal cartel is blamed for kidnappings, torture, murders, cannibalism, and the spread of fentanyl — which surpassed heroin as America’s deadliest illicit drug.\n\n\"More recently, CJNG operatives, allegedly under Oseguera Cervantes’ direction, were involved in assassination attempts of Mexican government officials,\" the State Department said in December 2024.\n\nTargeting 'The Last Frontier': Mexican cartels send drugs into Alaska, upping death toll\n\nUnlike some cartel leaders who inherited leadership positions from family dynasties, his parents were farm workers who carved out a living in Aguililla, a city of fewer than 20,000 people in Michoacán, known as the world's avocado capital. Oseguera dropped out of school after the sixth grade to pick avocados.\n\n\"El Mencho\" eventually made his way to Tijuana, the prominent border town for American tourists and feuding Mexican cartels. There, he grew his drug-smuggling business in San Diego. Court and prison records show he has entered the United States at least three times and was repeatedly deported.\n\nAfter being ordered to leave the area by another organization, \"El Mencho\" joined the police force in Tomatlán, a small city south of Puerto Vallarta in the western state of Jalisco.\n\nEventually, Oseguera returned to his native Michoacán, where he joined the Milenio Cartel, an entrenched criminal organization operating since at least the early 1990s. Milenio eventually tapped \"El Mencho,\" a skilled sicario — or assassin — to lead one of its cells in Guadalajara as a cartel lieutenant.\n\nAs Oseguera rose through the ranks of Milenio, he expected to be rewarded with the top position. But when some of the cartel’s leaders were arrested or killed in 2008 and 2009, \"El Mencho\" wasn't promoted.\n\nIncensed, Oseguera plotted revenge in 2009 and 2010 with others who were unhappy with Milenio’s new leadership and spearheaded a deadly coup. He emerged victorious in early 2011, and his new cartel was christened the Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación.\n\nOseguera controlled several key drug trafficking routes and hubs in Mexico and gave orders to the \"capo,\" or plaza boss, similar to a mafia lieutenant.\n\nHis cartel dominates much of Guadalajara and controls the outskirts of Jalisco, as well as other states such as Colima and Michoacán. CJNG has spread to most of Mexico's 32 states, with an increasing presence in Tijuana and Mexico City.\n\nAs the boss, \"El Mencho\" set the piso, or tax, that business owners and independent drug traffickers had to pay the capos for protection. Oseguera also assumed control of corrupt police officers and politicians.\n\n\"El Mencho's Jalisco New Generation Cartel was one of the biggest buyers of politicians and political campaigns, which has given it an enormous social base,\" Edgardo Buscaglia, an organized crime expert at Columbia University, told Reuters.\n\nOseguera was the lead defendant in a federal indictment returned in the District of Columbia in 2017, accusing him of leading a continuing criminal enterprise. He was also charged with conspiring to send large amounts of drugs into the United States and using firearms during these drug trafficking crimes.\n\nOseguera also faced meth trafficking charges from a 2013 federal indictment in Gulfport, Mississippi.\n\n'That level of violence is terrifying': Mexican cartel targets tranquil Puget Sound city\n\nDespite a $15 million bounty, Oseguera stayed on the move for years and dodged manhunts that began within a year of his rise to power in 2011. He was rarely seen, staying in remote compounds that made it harder for police to breach, and didn't do drugs or drink alcohol to avoid slip-ups, the Courier Journal reported in 2019.\n\nU.S. drug agents and Mexican authorities teamed to root out El Mencho’s hiding spots at least three times. Police raided his secret compounds in 2012 and 2018, but he escaped, the newspaper reported.\n\nAccording to the Courier Journal, the Mexican military also learned Oseguera's hiding spot and headed to get him in two military helicopters in May 2015. But his men shot down one of the helicopters with a Russian-made rocket-propelled grenade launcher.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 'El Mencho' killed in Jalisco, Mexico.

    "description": "After the intentions of Trump's administration on environmental regulations, Christie Brinkley wasted no time in raising her voice.",
    "fullText": "There is no love lost between Christie Brinkley and President Donald Trump, and she is not even subtle about it.\n\nAfter the intentions of Trump's administration on environmental regulations relating to coal and mercury emissions made headlines, the author wasted no time in raising her voice, assigning the blame, and highlighting the negative impacts to ensue.\n\nOne thing Christie Brinkley will not do is watch in silence. She previously expressed her concerns about the issues with the environment when Donald Trump won the presidential elections in 2024.\n\nBrinkley seems distraught about the Trump administration's decision to ease pollution standards for limits on mercury from coal plants, and she has shared a piece of her mind. The author took to social media, writing that this environmental update is set to destroy lives.\n\nShe noted the pressing side effects that will occur, affecting the fragile population, on her Instagram Stories. \"Mercury causes deformities in babies and developmental disorders of the brain!\" she penned over a screenshot of the headline from Interval News.\n\nIn another slide, still on her stories update, she shared a quote which read \"'I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT TO DO TO THEM. I'M ALLOWED TO DESTROY THE COUNTRY.' -Donald Trump 2/20/26.\" To this, she added a footnote praising him for keeping up to the words in the quote.\n\n\"And I must say he is doing a good job of destroying the country,\" the model shared after stating that the regulations not only put babies at risk, but they target adults too, affecting their nervous systems and ultimately causing organ damage. Brinkley claims Trump's decision is at the expense of the citizens and stems from greed.\n\nWhile the Trump administration views rolling back the clean air regulations from an economic standpoint, public health groups and environmental agencies warn that the health of the masses will bear the brunt.\n\nThe announcement was made on Friday, February 20, 2026, stating that it will roll back clean air regulations limiting mercury and hazardous toxins from power plants. They shared that it will boost baseload energy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Environmental Protection Agency explained that easing the pollution standards would alleviate costs for utilities that run older coal plants.\n\nThe effectiveness of this move shines at a time when demand for power is massively increasing, with the expansion of data centers used for artificial intelligence.\n\nBrinkley particularly noted earlier that the administration has set out to undo the environmental protection regulations put in place by Joe Biden's administration. The Swimsuit model added that the effects on the climate and health will surely take a devastating turn as a result.\n\nThe Daily Mail shared that Brinkley wrote on social media, telling her followers that natural disasters and diseases will all intensify if the state of the planet is not placed at the top of a Scale of preference over profits for a handful of greedy corporations.\n\nShe acknowledged that while the effects of climate change are already being felt, working together in prioritizing the environment will go a long way to slow down or ultimately stop the blistering negative effects.\n\nBrinkley called for support from her online community, stating that nature does not have respect for race or skin color, as no one will survive without a healthy biodiverse environment.\n\nThe actress also admitted that the changes will not only affect the current population but also future generations as well. \"For the sake and well-being of our children, action is mandated,\" her words echoed.\n\nBig stars in the music industry like Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish endorsed Trump's opponent, Kamala Harris, during the 2024 presidential elections. After it was announced that Trump won, Eilish called his victory a \"war on women,\" seemingly referring to his take on female reproductive rights.\n\nQueen of Pop, Madonna, also expressed her views on the outcome of the election, uploading a photo on Instagram showing a cake with the words \"F-ck Trump,\" adding that she stuffed her face with it after the results were announced.\n\nMadonna also shared that she was \"trying to get her head around why a convicted felon, rapist, and bigot was chosen to lead the country because he's good for the economy?\"\n\nCardi B, along with other celebrities such as Christina Applegate and Lili Reinhart, also slammed his election win. The president also faced heat from the media as many voiced out their disappointment with the election results.\n\nBesides Brinkley's concerns with climate change and environmental regulations, she previously spoke out against Donald Trump, claiming that he had flirted with her when he was married to his first wife, Ivanna.\n\nBrinkley is all about effecting change in the environment and saving Mother Earth from devastating ruin. Still, an aspect of her life saw a painful nosedive, and it was not triggered by environmental destruction.\n\nIn her memoir \"Uptown Girl,\" released last year, she recounts the pain she went through when she discovered her fourth marriage had hit the rocks. She detailed how she discovered her ex-husband, Peter Cook, had cheated on her leading to the end of their eight-year marriage.\n\nThe Blast reported that she described the relationship as the \"most tortured relationship\" she ever had. It was revealed to her that her then-husband was having an affair with a teenage girl.\n\nUpon searching their family computer, she further discovered some incriminating proof and adult content, as well as several explicit photos. The shock she felt was overwhelming when her eyes were met with the truth, and she ultimately decided the union could not continue.\n\nWill Christie Brinkley's voice cause a positive turnaround for the environment?",

We were scraping by.\n\nI remember peak multitasking: listening to my 6-year-old read aloud while making breakfast, and trying to finish putting on eyeliner while the eggs finished cooking in the pan.\n\nMy husband and I longed for wide-open days to actually connect, but school holidays were never long enough to decompress. We could see how easily the years might slip by, buried in logistics, until suddenly the kids were packing for college.\n\nWe wanted to freeze time. So we hatched a plan to leave our \"normal\" life for a year and have a wild adventure together as a family.\n\nIn July 2024, we rented out our London home, stored our belongings, and took the bus to Heathrow with two backpacks and a carry-on.\n\nWe weren't wandering aimlessly. We planned to live in three locations, traveling for five weeks before and after each stop.\n\nI pivoted my marketing consultancy toward travel writing and speaking, while my husband's academic research guided our shortlist of places we wanted to live. His research enabled legal residency which allowed the girls to attend school. We chose Japan, the US, and the Netherlands, staying three to four months in each.\n\nWe picked Tsukuba, Japan, to immerse ourselves in a completely unfamiliar culture; Great Neck, New York, near where we're both from, to give our daughters a taste of American life and spend rare time with family; and Leiden, the Netherlands, to experience its bike- and water-centered lifestyle.\n\nResidency came with a lot of admin.\n\nFor Japan, we had originally planned to homeschool. Our 8-year-old surprised us by asking to attend a local Japanese school, despite only knowing a few phrases she had picked up during the three weeks we spent traveling around the country.\n\nThe school welcomed both girls. Like their classmates, they walked to school alone, changed into indoor shoes, helped serve lunch, and cleaned the classrooms.\n\nIn New York, we lived with family outside the city. The girls rode a yellow school bus for the first time, while my husband commuted by train. It was a stark contrast to London — no uniforms, more complicated mornings, and the sobering reality of active-shooter drills.\n\nIn Leiden, the girls attended a small international school. Students biked along canals and tended their own garden plots as part of a Dutch gardening program.\n\nLiving out of backpacks forced minimalism. I loved escaping the endless to-do list of home life and focusing on actually living.\n\nI wore a single black maxi dress almost every day in Asia — biking through alleys or hiking through the jungle — and it somehow worked.\n\nIf anything, I'd bring even less next time. With fewer possessions, our mental bandwidth expanded. We could focus on fun, without guilt.\n\nWhen we first told the girls about our plan, our youngest cried. They loved their friends, their teachers, and the rhythm of school. They couldn't imagine leaving and not coming back. We tried tempting them with volcanoes and snorkeling in Indonesia.\n\nThey came around, somewhat. They loved most moments, but they also always wanted to go home. We promised it would only be a year.\n\nOur priority was making them feel safe and secure. We talked about adaptability as a life skill, but we also held them close and reminded them they were loved.\n\nMost days, we'd say, \"We're still on the trip,\" and it made us feel like a team. The girls learned how to be the new kid, make friends, and settle into unfamiliar rhythms. They learned you can reinvent your life more than once.\n\nThe intensity bonded us. We had waterfalls to ourselves, watched wild snow monkeys, and made friends who invited us to visit them in Cozumel. I celebrated my usually grim January birthday on a Thai beach.\n\nIn the US, we were present for heavy family moments, including my grandfather's passing.\n\nReturning to London after 13 months felt surreal. Our 6-turned-7-year-old kissed the ground at Heathrow.\n\nThe trip changed us. It gave us shared memories — Hokkaido cream, a road trip from New York to Miami, sunsets from an Alpine hut — but more importantly, it clarified what matters: slow time together, not renovations or packed calendars.\n\nWe're happy to be home, blender included. But we're already dreaming about our next extended adventure.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share? Get in touch with the editor: akarplus@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "An AI product manager who worked at a Chinese tech giant explains what makes Chinese AI different from the West.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yilin Zhang, an AI product manager at AI startup Kuse who worked at Meituan for more than three years. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.\n\nI graduated from Tsinghua University with a master's degree in computer science in 2021 and then joined Meituan — one of China's biggest tech firms — as a product manager.\n\nAt Meituan, China's platform for local services, especially known for food delivery, I worked on two AI projects. One was a consumer-facing AI assistant that helps users complete various tasks, including ordering food. The other was a merchant-facing AI agent designed to help businesses manage their daily operations, including handling reservations, managing orders, and supporting routine operational tasks.\n\nThe main difference between how products are built in China and in the US comes down to the market.\n\nAcross most large Chinese tech companies, AI product development accelerated more aggressively around 2025.\n\nThe AI initiatives I worked on at Meituan started around April or May of that year. It coincided with the surge of interest around DeepSeek, when attention around AI agents took off.\n\nLarge companies began racing to build AI projects, and almost every business unit launched its AI initiative.\n\nFor a long time, especially before 2021 or 2022, Chinese tech companies were primarily focused on domestic competition rather than overseas expansion. Because competition in China is intense, tech companies were forced to become extremely efficient. Their execution methods have been sharpened to an almost frightening degree.\n\nConstraints have also pushed Chinese AI companies to pursue different paths, with a strong focus on open-source models and cost efficiency. These limitations forced exploration in new directions, and those paths have proven valuable in their own way.\n\nDeepSeek is a good example. Because of international restrictions, it couldn't access large numbers of GPUs and was forced to innovate around efficiency instead.\n\nChinese and overseas markets are fundamentally different, leading to distinct user bases, expectations, and product designs.\n\nChinese users have a much lower willingness to pay for software; hence, many mass-market AI products, such as Doubao, tend to be free. The core objective is often to scale active usage.\n\nMany capabilities are packaged into a single prompt you can ask, essentially a chatbox interface with a low barrier to entry.\n\nInternational AI products target users doing high-value tasks. They are more often designed for desktops than for mobile devices, with interfaces better suited to work contexts. These products explore how AI and humans can collaborate and intersect across different work scenarios, helping users complete tasks more effectively and efficiently.\n\nIn China, that user group is relatively small. That makes it harder for its mainstream AI products to move beyond chat-based forms into more advanced products.\n\nChina's internet success over the past decade has also largely come from consumer-facing apps. That environment forces product managers to obsess over user feedback and relentlessly polish even the smallest features.\n\nTeams may spend enormous effort refining a tiny feature just to win over a small group of users. In markets with less competition, that level of detail isn't always necessary.\n\nAfter three to four years at Meituan, I felt I had learned most of what I could from that environment. I left to join the AI startup Kuse in October.\n\nAI is evolving extremely fast. In large companies, iteration speed can be slower. Many of my friends across different Big Tech companies share this same frustration. Smaller, more agile companies can adapt faster.\n\nIn the past, top graduates had basically two paths: becoming a civil servant or joining a Big Tech company.\n\nThat's changing. Especially over the past year, many AI startups have emerged, and more young people are choosing entrepreneurship. AI has created a new path outside Big Tech.\n\nDo you have a story to share about working in a Chinese tech company? Contact this reporter at cmlee@insider.com.",

    "description": "Greg Kitzmiller was researching places to live with his wife and found out that Panama had a special visa for retirees.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Greg Kitzmiller, a 64-year-old American retiree living in Panama. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born and raised in Michigan, where I met my wife, Jen, and where we built our life together.\n\nIn 2016, I retired from my job as a manufacturing supervisor. My wife retired from her law career over a year later.\n\nThe year before she retired, my main goal was to find a place where we could live the best life during our retirement. I did a lot of research on various countries, and Panama kept coming to the top of the list.\n\nWe were eager to escape the snow, so my first priority was eternal summer. We also wanted to stay close to the US to make traveling back easy. The fact that Panama uses the US dollar only added to its appeal.\n\nWe hadn't spent our whole lives planning to retire abroad, but after watching HGTV shows, we both thought that this was something we could do.\n\nPanama also offers a special Pensionado visa for retirees, which comes with incentives such as discounts on utility bills, medication, and even transportation.\n\nBefore making the move, we took a few exploratory trips to Panama. Our first trip was a weeklong in October 2017. After my wife retired, we came back in February 2018 for a nine-week trip, touring different areas to see if it felt like the right fit.\n\nDuring that trip, the weather was beautiful. When we went home to Michigan and saw the snow on our driveway, my wife turned and said to me, \"We're moving, right?\" And I said, \"Yeah, we are.\"\n\nWe sold our house quickly. We held a few garage sales, donated what we didn't need, and fit our lives into five suitcases. In June 2018, we officially moved to Panama.\n\nWe have two daughters in Texas and one in Alabama. We're no further from them now than we were in Michigan. Moreover, the world has gotten so small. We can get on a video call with the kids and the grandkids anytime.\n\nWith the help of a real-estate agent, we bought our two-bedroom condo for $210,000 in Coronado, which is about an hour and a half from Panama City by car.\n\nOur condo is in a country club community, where the golf course wraps around our building, and we have 180-degree views of the ocean and the mountains.\n\nEven though I've joined several Facebook groups, it's the people we met at church that make up the core of our social circle.\n\nWhen we started talking about moving here, one of Jen's friends at work said, \"Well, you should write a blog.\"\n\nIt wasn't that easy, since I'm not very tech-savvy, but I did it. I still maintain the blog and publish a newsletter. And, right after we got here, I connected with a writer's group.\n\nBeing a part of that group led me to do a lot of things in my retirement that I never thought I would do.\n\nI published my first book in 2020 about our experience of retiring in Panama. Since then, I've started writing in different ways, including a detective fiction series — I'm working on the fourth installment.\n\nWriting wasn't something I expected to do in my retirement, but there's a strong community of artists, authors, and musicians here. When you surround yourself with other people who are talented in those ways, it fosters your own talent.\n\nOur health is better, too. It helps that there is always an abundance of fresh fruit and vegetables around.\n\nIf I had it to do over, I would've learned Spanish when I was young. When you're in your 60s, it's hard to learn a new language. I almost always understand what's being said, but don't verbalize very well, unlike my wife, who is fluent.\n\nEvery day's a little different. We have a few social groups, including one where we play dominoes every week. We rotate between houses, someone makes lunch, and we spend the afternoon playing.\n\nInitially, we figured we'd come for 10 years and then evaluate if we wanted to stay. It's only been eight years, but we've already decided that this is where we want to be.\n\nWe're not planning to move back to the US. There's honestly not much we miss.\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city? Contact this reporter at agoh@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Mikaela Shiffrin, 30, may be a three-time Olympic gold medalist, but there was a time when just hearing the name of the Games felt overwhelming.\n\nOn Friday's episode of \"Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce,\" Shiffrin said getting ready for one of the biggest competitions in sports took years of work, much of it away from cameras and crowds.\n\n\"My Olympic experiences have been so wildly different. Now it's four, and I'm really aware, right now, of all of the work that's gone into — actually, not the medal — but the work that's gone into showing up on race day, and being able to show up with the mentality and the skiing that I wanted to do,\" Shiffrin told podcast host Kylie Kelce.\n\nThe grind continued even away from the slopes, she said, especially when it came to managing the pressure that comes with the Games.\n\n\"Even this summertime, the amount of conversations I had with my psychologist talking about all the different feelings surrounding the Olympics, and like desensitizing to the word, and imagining the vibe, imagining the colors,\" Shiffrin said.\n\nShe added that she even visited Paris two summers ago to get a feel for the Olympic atmosphere and \"desensitize\" herself to it.\n\nNot only that, Shiffrin has structured her life around staying physically and mentally ready at all times.\n\n\"There's just so much life outside of the sport, but we do so much of our life, you know, it's all geared towards the sport,\" Shiffrin said, adding that she hasn't had alcohol in two years because it tends to make her sick.\n\n\"And I'm like, I can't afford to be sick, literally ever. So, we're just going to not have any alcohol. Like, we're going to drink electrolytes, man,\" Shiffrin said.\n\nIt still throws her off that something she's trained for over years can be decided in seconds.\n\n\"But you spend so much time doing all of this work and training for something, and then the moment it happens is, you know, 47 seconds, or like in the blink of an eye, and it's just really weird,\" she said.\n\nShiffrin is widely considered the greatest alpine ski racer of all time, with 108 World Cup wins. She made her Olympic debut at the 2014 Sochi Games at age 18, winning her first Olympic gold in slalom and becoming the youngest athlete in history to do so.\n\nOn Wednesday, nearly a decade later, she earned another gold medal in slalom — her first Olympic victory since 2018.\n\nThis isn't the first time Shiffrin has spoken about the steps she takes to stay focused.\n\nSpeaking to WDSU News on Friday, she said she deliberately avoided social media in the lead-up to her races at the Winter Olympics.\n\n\"If I was scrolling my feed or something, I just knew I was going to come across things that would get into my brain that would be not at all conducive to the experience that my team and I came for,\" Shiffrin said.\n\nOn Saturday, she told NBC Sports that she chose not to \"set expectations\" for herself heading into the Milan Cortina Games — a mindset she said ultimately helped her ski her best.\n\n\"On race day, I felt like I skied my best skiing, and that was really my goal,\" she said.",

    "title": "The 'Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' finale just blew up Dunk and Egg's biggest secrets",
    "description": "The season 1 finale of \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" implies that Dunk may not be a knight, and that Egg has been lying. Both are changes from the book.",
    "fullText": "Spoilers ahead for \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" season one, episode six, \"The Morrow,\" and the book \"The World of Ice & Fire.\"\n\nHBO's \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" stuck the landing on Sunday after a highly praised first season.\n\nThe prequel show, which was meticulously adapted from George R. R. Martin's \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" series, managed to toe the line between faithfully bringing Martin's characters to the screen and adding a few new twists.\n\nThat was especially true of the season one finale, \"The Morrow,\" which features several key scenes that don't exist in Martin's original novella \"The Hedge Knight\" — two of which have major implications for the show's plucky duo and their many adventures to come.\n\n\"The Morrow\" includes a flashback to Dunk's recent past, when he was a squire for Ser Arlan of Pennytree.\n\nAs Arlan is propped against a tree, pale and babbling and apparently dying, Dunk asks, \"Why did you never knight me? Did you think I'd leave you? I wouldn't have. Or was it something else?\" He doesn't get an answer.\n\nThe scene is filmed in the same place as the season opener — on the hillside where Dunk buries Arlan's body.\n\nBook readers have long suspected that Dunk is lying about his knighthood. He tells people that Arlan knighted him just before he died, with \"only a robin, up in a thorn tree\" to bear witness. When Dunk tries to enter the jousting tournament at Ashford Meadow, he's told to find a lord or another knight to vouch for him, but no one can verify his claim. Hardly anyone even remembers that Arlan existed.\n\nPrivately, Dunk struggles with his identity and how he presents himself to the world. In \"The Hedge Knight,\" after it's revealed that Egg is a Targaryen prince in disguise, Dunk is shocked and embarrassed for having been deceived, but he also feels a twinge of compassion and solidarity: \"He knew what it was like to want something so badly that you would tell a monstrous lie just to get near it.\"\n\n\"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" showrunner Ira Parker told Business Insider that he wanted the scene to be up for interpretation.\n\n\"A lot of the exposition around whether or not Dunk was knighted is internal thoughts in his head. And we get pretty, pretty close to him coming out and just saying it. It's just like, what else could he be thinking of? What else could he mean by this?\" Parker explained. \"But it's not said in black and white.\"\n\nThroughout season one, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" drops subtle hints that Dunk was only ever a squire — that he's lying to give himself a fighting chance at a better future. When he meets Egg in the premiere, the boy tells him plainly, \"You don't look to be a knight.\" In episode four, Dunk hesitates when Raymun Fossoway asks to be knighted so he can fight in Dunk's Trial of Seven.\n\n\"Go on, Ser Duncan,\" Lyonel Baratheon urges. \"Any knight can make a knight.\"\n\nStill, Dunk doesn't draw his sword to fulfill the request. Is that because he doesn't want his friend to die in a dangerous trial by combat? Or because he doesn't know the words to recite if he never heard them himself? (\"In the name of the warrior, I charge you to be brave. In the name of the father, I charge you to be just,\" etc.) It's also possible that Dunk doesn't want to risk Raymun's honor with a knighting ceremony by a fake knight.\n\nDuring his loaded pause, Lyonel gives Dunk a searching look, but these questions remain unasked.\n\nParker said he made sure to preserve the ambiguity surrounding Dunk's knighthood, which is \"100% the way George would like it.\"\n\nIn the finale's flashback scene, just when it seems like Arlan is gone forever, he startles awake. We never actually watch the old man die, so it's still possible that he knighted Dunk offscreen.\n\n\"It is just as wide open as it ever was,\" Parker said. \"So that was very important to maintain, but also — it's just fun. And I know fans of the book are going to be thinking about that question, so we're just trying to enjoy ourselves as much as possible with it. And it's a little bit of a tease.\"\n\nThe irony, of course, is that Dunk is a truer knight than most, even if he never took the sacred vows. He's brave and just, and he risks his own life to protect the innocent — quite unlike the dishonesty and bloodthirst of his Trial of Seven opponents. These characters ask us to consider what real honor looks like in a place like Westeros, and to question the substance of titles like \"ser,\" \"lord,\" and even \"prince.\"\n\nAfter the Trial of Seven is over, Egg's father, Maekar, asks Dunk to pledge himself to House Targaryen and return with their family to Summerhall. He says that Egg has grown fond of Dunk and wishes to serve as his squire.\n\nDunk offers instead to bring Egg on his travels. He believes that growing up among smallfolk rather than servants will help Egg learn compassion and humility.\n\nNaturally, Maekar says no. He's not about to let his youngest son, the latest in a long line of royal Aegons, wander around Westeros with only a hedge knight to protect him. \"Princes are not made for sleeping in ditches and eating hard salt beef,\" he tells Dunk in the book.\n\nDunk counters that Egg's older brothers, who are known as Daeron the Drunken and Aerion the Monstrous, never slept beneath the stars or ate less-than-perfect food. Maekar leaves without saying another word.\n\nThen, as Dunk is readying his horses to leave Ashford, Egg suddenly reappears.\n\n\"My lord father says I am to serve you,\" Egg says, and they ride off together, heading south toward Dorne.\n\nWhy and when does Maekar have a change of heart? In the book, it remains a mystery, but the show offers a plainer explanation: He didn't.\n\nThe final scene of the episode shows Maekar riding away from Ashford with the rest of the Targaryens. When he realizes Egg is nowhere to be seen, he begins panicking and shouting for his son.\n\nParker said he created the scene because it makes sense for the character of Egg. \"[The story] started by him sneaking off and getting into trouble. And of course, he just goes and he does the same thing, because we all make the same mistakes over and over and over again, and then we die.\"\n\nAs for Maekar, the added scene reflects his stubbornness as a father and his pride as a Targaryen.\n\n\"He's just a curmudgeon, and probably a shitty father, but I actually do think he really does love his children. I do think he cares about them, even though he's not able to raise them well, he still wants to,\" Parker said of Maekar. \"The idea of letting Egg go off with someone else just felt like too much for me. It felt like he could reasonably say no in this moment, even though he knows it would be better for Egg.\"\n\nAlthough the show's version of events doesn't directly contradict the book, it does add a troubling wrinkle to Egg's family lore. Maekar eventually becomes king of Westeros, and he may not take kindly to Dunk's absconding with his heir. He may even misinterpret the event as a treasonous kidnapping.\n\n\"We'll never be in Maekar's POV, but this will rear its head at some point,\" Parker hinted for future seasons. \"Many ways were discussed about how to deal with this. Hopefully, people like the way we've chosen.\"\n\nThe second season of \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\" adapted from Martin's \"The Sworn Sword,\" is slated for a 2027 release.",

    "description": "Tariffs have already added roughly 0.7% to core inflation through January.",
    "fullText": "Don't expect prices at the store to fall just because the Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nAt best, companies may slow the pace of future price hikes on goods that get tariff relief. But they're unlikely to cut prices outright, economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note published Sunday.\n\n\"We would not expect companies to lower prices in response to tariff reductions nearly as quickly as they increased them in response to tariff increases,\" the economists wrote.\n\nThe bank estimates tariff passthrough has already lifted core Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, by about 0.7% through January. It expects only an additional 0.1% increase over the rest of 2026.\n\nFriday's 6-3 Supreme Court ruling scrapped tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The White House quickly announced a 10% Section 122 tariff and then raised it to 15% the next day.\n\nThe shift would bring the increase in the effective tariff rate since the start of 2025 down from just over 10 percentage points to about 9 percentage points, Goldman estimates, leaving its inflation outlook little changed.\n\nOn economic growth, Goldman said imports from countries that see meaningful tariff reductions, particularly China, should rebound in the coming months.\n\nBut that likely won't give the economy much of a lift. Any rebound in imports from China would be offset by companies restocking shelves after earlier frontloading, trade reshuffling, and small declines in imports from higher-tariff countries.\n\nGoldman estimates first-quarter 2026 GDP growth at 3.4%, though that includes a temporary boost from the end of the 2025 government shutdown. It continues to forecast 2.5% growth by the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nFriday's ruling also sets up a fight over roughly $180 billion in tariffs already collected.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday it was \"unlikely\" Americans would ever see refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said during a speech before the Economic Club of Dallas, adding that the administration has other tools to reimpose tariffs and that sorting out any repayment could take years.",

    "description": "While Shield AI is looking into weapons for the V-BAT, the world's best militaries already have a slew of other strike options, Brandon Tseng told BI.",
    "fullText": "Brandon Tseng, Shield AI's cofounder, said there's a common misconception about his company's signature software-powered drone: People say it needs to be armed.\n\nThe more experienced militaries who work with Shield AI, however, know they don't need that capability in modern war, Tseng told Business Insider.\n\n\"Who doesn't ask for that? The US military doesn't ask for that because we understand joint fires. The Ukrainians don't ask for it anymore, either,\" said the former Navy SEAL, who is Shield AI's president.\n\nThe V-BAT, a vertical takeoff and landing drone that uses artificial intelligence to fly in jammed environments, has primarily been used for intelligence and reconnaissance missions in high-profile conflict zones such as Ukraine. Shield AI said the V-BAT flew over 200 missions there in 2025.\n\nThe drone is still meant to be a multi-mission platform, Tseng said, and Shield AI has been exploring ways to mount weapons on it. The firm announced a partnership last month with South Korean arms manufacturer LIG Nex1 to equip the V-BAT with six-pound guided missiles.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, look: I describe V-BAT as a mini predator, reaper drone,\" Tseng said. \"That's the mission it's doing, which is: It's finding targets. And it's hard to find targets, you have to be out there for a long period of time.\"\n\nTo be fair, the MQ-9 Reaper is also commonly equipped with missiles.\n\nHowever, Tseng said sophisticated militaries already have a vast array of other weapons that can turn the V-BAT's intel into a precision strike.\n\n\"If you have been in these combat zones, the US allies who fought closely with us in Afghanistan, they do not ask for organic fires on board the V-Bat,\" Tseng said. \"Because everybody is so used to just saying: 'Okay, I have a targeting package. What fires asset do I have lined up? Is it a one-way attack drone? Is it HIMARS? Is it artillery? Is it an SM-6? SM-3?\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter. You can find weapons,\" he added. \"The weapons are available. You need, actually, more intelligence.\"\n\nThis was a framework that Ukraine still needed to improve when the V-BAT began spotting targets there in early 2024, Tseng said. The drone is meant to fly for over 13 hours and be easily deployable, requiring a two-person launch crew and no runway.\n\nTseng said that while Ukraine excelled in tactical drone warfare, its troops weren't used to having a long-range asset that could spot targets for regular strategic attacks as the US military did.\n\n\"The strategic effects would happen, but they would be rare,\" he said. \"They'd be very, very deliberately planned operations, very expensive operations, things like what they did to the Russian runways with sending quadcopters deep into Russia via trucks.\"\n\nUkrainian drone teams would use the V-BAT to find important targets, such as Russian S-300 and S-400 air defense systems, only to realize they hadn't linked up with the right teams to strike them, Tseng said.\n\n\"We'd say: 'Why didn't you guys have these weapons lined up?' They'd say: 'Oh, well, we didn't think to coordinate,'\" Tseng said.\n\nSince then, Kyiv's forces have been using intelligence from V-BATs to carry out strikes with systems such as one-way attack drones or US-made HIMARS, Tseng said.\n\n\"There was a lot of learning over the past year for the Ukrainians,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Jackson Page has questioned the location of the Welsh Open, saying it \"should be staged in south Wales\".\n\nThe 2026 tournament, from Monday 23 February, will be the fourth-straight year in which the week-long event has been held at Venue Cymru in Llandudno in north Wales.\n\nSince the move to Llandudno, the Welsh Open has been won by an English player each year, with Mark Selby, Gary Wilson and Robert Milkins lifting the title at Venue Cymru.\n\nAnd while the 24-year-old praised the venue, he said a move to south Wales would benefit the Welsh players on the tour.\n\n\"I like the place and the venue but I don't think it is where the Welsh Open is staged,\" said Page.\n\n\"I feel like it should be in south Wales, 100%. Just because there is no player from north Wales, every pro on tour is from south Wales.\n\n\"So it doesn't really feel like a home event for us in all honesty.\"\n\nPage, who reached the quarter-finals last year in Llandudno, added that he is looking forward to the tournament despite its location.\n\n\"It is a great venue, I like playing there and there should definitely be an event there, a big event, I just don't think it should be the Welsh Open,\" Page added.\n\n\"It is still in Wales, so the fans still get behind you so I am looking forward to it, but it is a bit gutting for us south Walians that there is nothing down here for us to play in.\n\n\"Hopefully there will be more tournaments coming soon and we get something down here.\"\n\nPage's quest for Welsh Open glory was ended by former world champion Luca Brecel in 2025.\n\nThe Welshman was beaten 5-2 by the Belgian in the quarter-finals, ending his best run in the competition to date.\n\nAnd the pair now meet in the first round of the 2026 Welsh Open, with Page eyeing revenge against the 30-year-old.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to it,\" said Page.\n\n\"Luca beat me in the quarter-finals last year, so I owe him one in a way.\"\n\nPage came to prominence in the Welsh Open as a 15-year-old in 2017, beating Jason Weston and John Astley before losing to Judd Trump in the third round.\n\nAnd while Page says he is yet to reach the heights he had dreamed of as a teenager, he still believes he can turn things around.\n\n\"I've done alright but I'm nowhere near where I want to be, I want to be the best and I still think I can do it,\" said Page.\n\n\"I've had a pretty bad season, it's not been very good, so I need to kick on.\n\n\"Obviously last year was a great year, so I'm trying to turn it around to get confidence in myself and perform like I know I can.\n\nThe 2026 Welsh Open begins on Monday, 23 February, with the tournament running until the final on Sunday, 1 March.\n\nMatches are available to watch on the BBC Sport website, BBC iPlayer and live on BBC Two Wales - with the final shown on BBC One Wales.\n\nThere is also highlights from the best of each day's action on BBC Two Wales every evening.\n\nAll matches are best-of-seven frames until the quarter‑finals, at which stage the games become best-of-nine.\n\nThe semi‑finals will be the best-of-11, and the final will be best‑of‑17.\n\nThe winner will scoop a top prize of £100,000, with the runner-up winning £45,000.\n\nMark Williams [5] vs Michael Holt\n\nJak Jones [16] vs Liam Highfield\n\nNeil Robertson [4] vs Michal Szubarczyk\n\nKyren Williams [3] vs Liu Hongyu\n\nStuart Murphy [7] vs Chang Bingyu\n\nJackson Page [30] vs Luca Brecel\n\nXiao Guodong [9] vs Long Zehuang\n\nZhao Xintong [2] vs Fan Zhengyi",

    "fullText": "England went from bad to disastrous, France didn't fire on all cylinders but had enough to maintain their Grand Slam challenge, Scotland dug deep for a big win and Ireland were just tremendous.\n\nHere are five players who provided talking points in the third round of the Six Nations, with a two-week break to come before round four...\n\nThe opportunity and ability for teams to rewrite their own narratives in the space of just a few weeks is part of what makes the Six Nations so compelling.\n\nLacklustre and outgunned in Rome in week one, Scotland are now France's biggest challengers after following up the Calcutta Cup demolition of England with a nailbiting, nerve-wrenching win in Wales.\n\nThe hosts were 23-12 up with just over 20 minutes to go but Scotland roared back to win 26-23 after some brilliant quick thinking from fly-half Finn Russell.\n\nHe switched the momentum of the match with a kick that caught Wales out and allowed Darcy Graham to score in the corner. Yet again, the Bath number 10 was the difference-maker.\n\n\"Big-game players turn up when it matters and Russell had moments when he bailed Scotland out,\" former Wales captain Sam Warburton told BBC Rugby Special.\n\n\"He was exceptional at managing the team when they were down in the game. He waits for the perfect moment to get involved.\n\n\"He plays what he sees, he has that licence and his clutch kicking was immense. The big-game player rocked up in the last 30 minutes, he was immaculate and a big part of the comeback.\"\n\n\"Scotland found a way to win ugly,\" added their former flanker John Barclay.\n\n\"They found solutions and ground their way in. In some ways that was the most important win they have had in a while. It has given them a strong position in the table.\"\n\nUp next? France at Murrayfield on Saturday, 7 March, and the chance to end Les Bleus' Grand Slam dreams after three successive wins.\n\n'Scotland's terrible beauty reverses the narrative on extraordinary day'\n\nThe key moment for Scotland's win against Wales\n\nFrance remain in the driving seat for a 20th title - third in five years - and can seal it with a bonus-point win in Edinburgh.\n\nThey were made to graft by ever-improving Italy in Lille, but eventually streaked away to win 33-8, aided by another classy display from star scrum-half and captain Antoine Dupont.\n\nA brilliant kick set up the opening score for Louis Bielle-Biarrey, before Dupont then showed his defensive strengths during a dominant second-half spell from the visitors.\n\n\"It's perhaps unfair that we expect him to do outrageous things every week,\" said Barclay.\n\n\"He is coming back from a knee injury and was maybe a bit quiet in the first two games, but he really stepped up.\n\n\"You have to admire his ability to scan the play under pressure, see space and deliver the skill for France to score that first try. His physical side of the game is impressive, he makes tackles and does so much good stuff.\n\n\"He had a huge influence on the game which is what we have come to expect.\n\n\"France will be heavy favourites in Scotland but that is an exciting game. Perhaps only South Africa can match them for power at the moment.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bielle-Biarrey became the first player in Six Nations history to score in eight successive matches. He has scored 13 tries in 12 Six Nations games and 24 in 25 overall. Quite the strike-rate.\n\nFrance maintain Grand Slam dream with Italy win\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nWhile Scotland's campaign has been revitalised by back-to-back victories, England's has been utterly derailed by two losses.\n\nThey were blown away by Ireland at Twickenham as the men in green ran in five tries to embarrass Steve Borthwick's side 42-21.\n\nEngland entered the tournament with a settled-looking side, but now look a muddle with Matt Dawson calling for Fin Smith to replace George Ford at number 10.\n\nWarburton was confused by Ford's kicking - or lack of - against Ireland.\n\nHe said: \"England are normally patient in their kick battle but Ford missed some kicks that were a real momentum killer.\n\n\"England are a kicking team and when they do it well they look really good. He won so much territory against Wales and in the last two games it's been the other end of the spectrum.\n\n\"Ford is an exceptional tactical kicker but he has not been kicking in the last two games and they have struggled as a result of it.\"\n\n\"I am surprised by England,\" added Barclay.\n\n\"We thought it was a shootout between them and France for a Grand Slam before the tournament. The most concerning thing is the nature of the defeats. Where are England now? We don't really know.\n\n\"The last two performances have thrown up a lot of question marks about selection. What's the best back three, who should play at centre, is George Ford the man at 10?\n\n\"Rewind a few weeks and you could name the team. It seems to have fallen apart a bit.\"\n\nNext up for England is a trip on Saturday, 7 March, to Rome that looks anything but inviting.\n\n'England need players able to change tactics during games'\n\nIs Borthwick under pressure after nightmare defeat?\n\nIreland's resurgence was personified by Robert Baloucoune.\n\nThe 28-year-old had not featured for Ireland since November 2022 because of injury, but he started and scored against Italy before scoring again in an all-action performance against England.\n\nThe wing thought his international career was over but instead played a huge part in a famous win, troubling England speedster Henry Arundell with his work-rate.\n\n\"He was unbelievable,\" said Barclay. \"His willingness to work off the ball is how you win games.\n\n\"He put in dominant tackles, won turnovers. The mindset and energy he bought to the game away from home set the tempo.\"\n\n\"Ireland's desire and work-rate off the ball won them the game,\" added Warburton.\n\n\"Paul O'Connell's quote when I was on Lions duty with him was, 'Be the best at everything that requires no talent' - and Ireland were that.\n\n\"Their attack looks like the one of old. They were super-organised and their aerial dominance was a launchpad.

Bell was in the battle with Wallace, with Wallace taking the lead with 12 laps to go. As Wallace battled up front, his teammate Reddick, sans right front fender, made the run from 18th to fourth before a caution and red flag set up the first overtime finish.\n\nReddick, who rose through the Late Model ranks, won without a fender.\n\n\"That’s crazy isn’t its it,\" Reddick said on winning without a fender. \"This place over the years, man. It just puts on some amazing racing. Handling matters here, but I don't know, apparently determination outweighs handling.\"\n\nThe caution was called after William Byron had a tire go down, sending the Hendrick driver into the wall. He collected six cars with four laps remaining to set up an Overtime finish.\n\nCarson Hocevar, still chasing his first win, led last week on the white flag lap before crashing. He also matched performance this week, as a few aggressive moves in the closing laps nearly secured him the win. Known to make bold decisions and enemies, Hocevar and his spotter tried to negotiate with the leading Toyotas to push on the restart. Asking Wallace to 'Shake and Bake' and have the Reddick line up behind in the third row. Wallace instead opted to start on the bottom with Reddick lining up behind him, unsure if Reddick's damaged race car would be able to successfully push the teammates in tandem to the front.\n\nOn the overtime restart, Hocevar dove to a pocket in the middle of Bell, and Wallace bailed on pushing Bell when he got a major push from Ross Chastain. Hocevar crashed into Bell, and the Joe Gibbs Racing driver hit the wall, sustaining major front right damage.\n\nThe second overtime attempt saw Wallace and Reddick linked up again, now with JGR's Chase Briscoe behind for a three-car Toyota chain on the bottom against three Chevrolets on the top.\n\nIn the closing two laps, Wallace went high to block Hocevar and lost momentum, falling back through the field as his teammate passed on the bottom. In clean air, Reddick was able to hang on through the rough handling of his damaged race car to claim his second win ahead of Briscoe, Chastain, Hocevar, and Daniel Suarez.\n\nShane van Gisbergen, who was involved in two incidents in stage two, rebounded for a sixth-place finish, his best finish on an oval track.\n\nZane Smith, Wallace, Ryan Preece, and Ryan Blaney completed the top ten.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "description": "On the day his statue was unveiled outside Crypto.com Arena, Showtime era coach Pat Riley urged the Lakers to fight to create legacies worth chasing.",
    "fullText": "The fans never got an opportunity to give a grateful goodbye, Pat Riley resigning on an early summer afternoon 36 years ago after the end of a lost season.\n\nEveryone will have that chance now.\n\nWhen Riley left town at the wrong end of grumblings from players and fans, he was the greatest coach not only in Lakers history but also in basketball history, his .730 winning percentage and 102 playoff victories both NBA records at the time.\n\nHe has been Showtime’s forgotten kingpin, its lost leader, its missing warrior, a stylishly distant legend who had been overshadowed by the seven Lakers whose statues stand watch over the plaza outside Crypto.com Arena.\n\nRiley finally is coming home, returning Sunday with the unveiling of a long overdue statue in whose bronze reflection a couple of wistful realizations can be found.\n\nRiles has been terribly, terribly missed.\n\nThe Showtime era seems terribly, terribly distant.\n\nRiley hasn’t been with the Lakers in 36 years. The Lakers haven’t won an asterisk-free NBA title in 16 years. Maybe because Shaquille O’Neal spoke only via video Sunday, the greatness of this organization never felt further away.\n\nMark Walter, were you watching?\n\nThe Dodgers group that now owns the Lakers was granted a compelling history lesson during an hourlong ceremony that culminated in a theatrical unveiling of a Riley statue smartly situated between the bronzes of Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nLike Riley himself, his statue looked darn near perfect. There was the raised fist that was once a signal for Magic to pass to Kareem for a sky hook. There was the neatly coiffed hair, the nicely fitting suit, the smartly positioned tie, even the painfully stern expression from a guy who left no doubt who was running the show.\n\n“When I was told that the kid from Schenectady, New York, would be honored with a statue here ... I fell to my knees, humbled. I sobbed. ... Tears of joy and gratitude,” Riley said during his acceptance speech, adding “That statue right there … is loaded up with all of us who took that magical journey.”\n\nIt was a Showtime magic born of a commitment found in one of the two inscriptions on the statue.\n\n“There will come a time when you are challenged, and when that time comes, you must plant your feet. You must stand firm. You must make a point. About who you are, what you do, and where you come from. When that time comes, you do it.”\n\nRiley used those words to earn six Laker championship rings, four as a coach, one as an assistant coach and one as a player.\n\nAfter leaving town in 1990 and making a stop in New York, Riley carried those words with him to Miami, where he led the Heat to one title as a coach and two more as an executive, and where he still serves as president at age 80.\n\n“There will come a time when you are challenged …”\n\nFor the new Laker bosses, that time is now, as they find themselves with a product that is light years from the teams that Riley referenced during what amounted to a 30-minute sermon/history lesson prior to the unveiling.\n\nThis Laker organization is a bit of a mess, as evidenced by the speakers who joined Riley on the stage.\n\nThere was Magic and Kareem and Jeanie Buss, who all gave compelling talks, very appropriate. But oddly also speaking was Dwyane Wade, who played for Riley in Miami but was never a Laker. The group was interestingly joined by Michael Douglas, who spoke as Riley’s friend, while several Lakers Showtime greats watched from the audience.\n\nIt was all a bit disjointed, which is similar to the Lakers' current situation. They’re so defensively challenged they’re surely headed for an early playoff exit even though they have the stunningly great scorer Luka Doncic, and what happens next?\n\nDo they keep LeBron James? (Say no!) Do they pay Austin Reaves (Say yes!) Do they try to trade for Giannis Antetokounmpo (Go for it!).\n\nAll these are questions not unlike the one faced by the late Jerry Buss in 1981 when pondering the notion of hiring a kid who had never coached at any level. Buss trusted his instincts and went for it, the enlistment of Riley fashioning a culture that remained strong until his death in 2013.\n\nIt is a culture that Riley described when he left in 1990, quoting the late author Ernest Becker.\n\n“Man's greatest fear — and you've probably heard this before — is his fear of extinction,” he said in his farewell news conference. “But what he fears more than that is to become extinct with insignificance.”\n\nThe Showtime Lakers faced those fears and overcame them.\n\n\"What we accomplished was not insignificant,” he added in his farewell address. “All anybody ever wants to do is have the feeling that what they do counts and matters. I've always told the players that they don't just want to be the best of the best. There's nothing wrong with being unique. We were unique.\"\n\nRiley repeated many of those same words Sunday, and added some more wisdom about life with the legends.\n\n“That’s where I learned about commitment … there are only two options” he said. “You’re in or you’re out. Either you’re with us or against us. There’s no other way, there’s no life in between.”\n\nRiley said that through that commitment, the Lakers legacy had been formed.\n\n“The biggest footprint in Laker history had been planted,” he said, later adding, “You begin by chasing footprints, you grow by honoring them. And if you’re committed enough, you leave giant steps of your own.”\n\nHe then challenged today’s NBA players, even the ones getting dressed down the hall.\n\n“I ask even the players who play for the Lakers today, I ask you, whose footprints are you chasing today?” he said. “More important, what footprints are you leaving?”\n\nHe continued, saying, “When it comes time to kick some ass, you do it. And one day someone will follow the path you left behind and say, ‘Those are footprints worth chasing.”’\n\nRiley ended his talk with what was essentially an inspirational pregame speech as the Lakers prepared to play the rival he finally conquered, those Boston Celtics.\n\n“As my father’s words to me, they ring out loud and clear today,” he said with the sort of verve that is rarely heard around the team these days. “The time has come to kick some ass. To kick some Boston ass.”\n\nMark Walter, were you listening?\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Tyreek Hill next team odds. Chiefs drawing shortest NFL odds to land All-Pro wide receiver after release from Dolphins.",
    "fullText": "Want to get more Covers content? Add us as a preferred source on your Google account here.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins released wide receiver Tyreek Hill on Monday, February 16, finally ending a union that seemed destined for a breakup sooner rather than later.\n\nThe eight-time Pro-Bowler played in just four games in 2025 before suffering a season-ending ACL injury. What began as a perfect match, and briefly looked like the best offense in football alongside Jayden Waddle as Tua Tagovailoa's primary weapons, Hill's time in Miami appeared to sour by the end of 2024.\n\nNow, the hapless Dolphins and the 31-year-old receiver are embarking on different paths. Below, we'll look at the latest NFL odds for Hill's next destination — and why a reunion with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs feels inevitable.\n\nFrom 2016-21, Tyreek Hill was a mainstay in the Kansas City Chiefs offense, racking up 6,630 receiving yards and 56 touchdowns over 91 games. He made the Pro Bowl every season in Kansas City and was one of quarterback Patrick Mahomes' favorite targets.\n\nA reunion would make a ton of sense, especially after the Chiefs just missed the postseason for the first time since before either Hill or Mahomes debuted. The Chiefs struggled to establish a deep-ball threat this season, and an ancient Travis Kelce led the team in receiving.\n\nBringing Hill back into the fold immediately gives Mahomes an established weapon who, if he's 100%, can burn defensive backs better than almost anyone. And their familiarity should help him, figuratively and literally, hit the ground running in September and beyond.\n\nWhile the Chiefs are the logical landing spot based on \"narrative,\" the Buffalo Bills need a big-time receiver just as much. Quarterback Josh Allen relied more heavily on his tight ends in 2025, and giving him another option alongside top WR Khalil Shakir (who led the team with 72 receptions, while Dalton Kincaid was next with 39) would solve a glaring issue and take some of the pressure off.\n\nThe Bills' window isn't closed, but they did move on from head coach Sean McDermott this offseason, showing a desperation to get over the hump from \"great regular season team\" to \"legitimate Super Bowl contender.\" Hill would be a major upgrade.\n\nFresh off a disappointing showing in the Super Bowl, could the New England Patriots target Hill? Stefon Diggs is a $26.5-million cap hit next season, and is already being bandied about as a potential cut candidate.\n\nIt's doubtful that the Pats would employ both Diggs and Hill for a variety of reasons — both have had character and legal issues in recent years — and it may not make a lot of sense to replace Diggs with Hill, especially if the latter has questions about his health in the wake of his ACL tear and dislocated knee.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens committed to quarterback Lamar Jackson in moving on from head coach John Harbaugh, and bolstering the wide receiver corps may be a way to kickstart a new era.\n\nHe would help form a formidable duo with Zay Flowers, who had nearly 800 more receiving yards than his closest teammate in 2025. Veteran DeAndre Hopkins is a free agent, and Hill would be a significant upgrade at their respective points in their careers.\n\nFinally, this is an interesting option after Hill's former Miami Dolphins head coach, Mike McDaniel, was hired to serve as Jim Harbaugh's offensive coordinator. When Miami's offense was at its best before Tua Tagovailoa's concussions, the Dolphins looked virtually unstoppable.\n\nAssuming there's no bad blood, giving Justin Herbert a target of this caliber may unlock another level for the Los Angeles Chargers quarterback.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here and view our best betting sites or check out our top sportsbook promos.",

    "title": "The quirk of fate that saw sluggish Liverpool beat Forest and close in on Champions League places",
    "description": "Nottingham Forest 0-1 Liverpool: Alexis Mac Allister’s late, late winner snatched all three points for the champions",
    "fullText": "Perhaps it was football at its most illogical. Liverpool were triumphant after a first-half performance Arne Slot felt was their worst in his time at the club. They got a goal from a player who may have only been in a goalscoring position because one of his teammates was injured and after he had struggled in his original role, amid a collective malaise.\n\nA team who have been aggrieved by refereeing decisions of late saw a seeming winner disallowed in contentious fashion and yet made off with three points. And Vitor Pereira, who seemed to have had an immediate impact with Nottingham Forest, reacted to his first home game in charge by saying: “I am frustrated, angry with football. Very, very unfair.”\n\nHe had a point in his argument, if not in the result. For Liverpool, Florian Wirtz’s back injury produced a benefit. Their supporters ended up celebrating just their second win at the City Ground in more than four decades by chorusing the name of their resident World Cup winner.\n\nAs his habit of scoring against Real Madrid shows, Alexis Mac Allister can supply major moments. Twice it seemed he had a decider against Forest. The first was disallowed and yet perhaps Liverpool’s sense of injustice provided the platform for the second.\n\nBut he did so twice from a position within the Forest penalty box. Which, when Slot drew up his plans, was not his. Wirtz should have been there. When he withdrew, Curtis Jones was the emergency No 10. He floundered there, as Mac Allister did in midfield. So Jones was redirected to right-back, Dominik Szoboszlai and Mac Allister given more advanced roles. And an hour later, the Argentinian, who had started as a passenger, ended as the match-winner.\n\nAnd so Slot, who believes that decisions and fortune have gone against Liverpool this season, instead argued his side got lucky. “We have been on the wrong side of the score after a good performance too many times,” he said. “Today we got more than we deserved. A draw would have been a fairer result. The first half was really poor, the worst we have played. We lost almost every ball we touched.” The second period was better and, eventually, Slot could say: “My emotions were emotions of happiness and relief.”\n\nWhich came from Mac Allister’s late show. He had the ball in the Forest net twice: once seemingly inadvertently, once deliberately. The first was chalked off. The second also went to VAR, but this time the replays could not quash Liverpool’s joy.\n\nPaul Tierney, long Jurgen Klopp’s least favourite official, disallowed what seemed the breakthrough goal. It went in off Mac Allister’s upper arm and back. Not that there was any sense the Argentinian knew anything about it. After Hugo Ekitike should have scored, but met Rio Ngumoha’s cross with a header that Stefan Ortega saved, Mac Allister’s back was turned as Ola Aina’s clearance struck him and rebounded into the Forest net. He knew it had hit his elbow. “I feel like it's a bit harsh,” he said. “It's a bit of both but I understand the rules.”\n\nWhen it was ruled out, it seemed to cement Forest’s status as Liverpool’s bogey team. Until Szoboszlai, the one man taking his time as the clock ticked down, jinked to make a yard of space, whipped in a lovely cross and Virgil van Dijk’s goalbound header was blocked by Murillo. Mac Allister was the predator in the box again. “It was not a surprise to me that Macca was both times the goalscorer, he played with the mentality you need in these games and he was twice in the situation to finish,” said Slot.\n\nMeanwhile, Wirtz was only visible beneath his hood in the stands. It was a game when Liverpool missed the German when they were shorn of creativity and chemistry. They looked a prosaic outfit with the £100m man and yet found a way to record just their second victory at the City Ground in more than four decades. The first required a 99th-minute decider by Darwin Nunez. This was only slightly earlier, similarly dramatic.\n\nIt was a remarkable end to a forgettable game. Seasons can turn on such moments. Liverpool are now level on points with Chelsea and Manchester United, their immediate rivals for a Champions League spot. Forest, meanwhile, were seemingly making an auspicious start to Pereira’s reign but were nudged closer to the Championship by Mac Allister. They started superbly yet fell apart at the last.\n\nForest had won 3-0 at Anfield under Sean Dyche; yet Liverpool began worse in the rematch, slow and sluggish, off the pace and out of sorts. Meanwhile, Forest looked liberated, a group of talented players freed from Dyche’s restrictive tactics. Omari Hutchinson was excellent. Callum Hudson-Odoi almost scored in the third minute, when Alisson denied him. Elliot Anderson drove a shot wide. “The first half was just missing the goals,” said Pereira, but that has been a theme of Forest’s campaign.\n\nLiverpool had threatened only when Stefan Ortega made a close-range block from Jones; but part of Slot’s half-time message was that Forest, who had beaten Fenerbahce in Istanbul three days earlier, might tire. They did. “Our capacity to press them was not the same and in the end, we conceded,” rued Pereira. “But if we keep this mentality and organisation, we will get points, for sure.”",

    "description": "Miami Dolphins fans share what they think or want to happen with star running back De’Von Achane going forward.",
    "fullText": "Following the kick-off of our Miami Dolphins roster purge this past week, I pointed out that the team also had a decision to make on star running back De’Von Achane as he enters the final year of his rookie contract. I then asked the following question:\n\nWhat do you think that the new coaching staff and front office should do with De’Von Achane going forward? Should they extend him right now/before the season begins, should they allow him to play on the final year of his deal before deciding if they want to re-sign him to a new deal, or should they consider trading a player that they took in the third round who could now garner a first-round draft pick?\n\nBelow are some of your thougths and answers-\n\nNeenerWhacker wonders what a change in coaching and scheme will have on Achanes numbers in 2026.\n\nSide note on Achane: his stats and analytics are off the charts. How much credit are we going to give Mike McDaniel for Achane’s success?\n\nThere is a high probability that Achane regresses next year with a new play caller. McD had his flaws, but he knew how to scheme for Devon\n\nMiamiItaliano says trade him away if he doesn’t give the Dolphins a generous hometown discount on any extension.\n\nIf they get Malik Willis, that might take touches away from Achane since he’s a run first type of QB. Also, Achane might want too much money. Maybe trade him if he doesn’t agree to a team friendly contract. I don’t want him to go, but it’s better than him holding out throughout training camp.\n\nOldfinfan says he’s the best since Ricky and is a building block, not trade bait.\n\nBest Dolphins player we have seen since Ricky Williams. We do not trade him, we build around him. He has game breaking abilities you don’t just find every draft.\n\nkrammm is out on him, it seems.\n\nTrade him. He never wins the big game.\n\nFLexile seems to have two arguments for you.\n\nExtend him. If he is not the fastest guy in the NFL, he’s top 3. He can score ANY time he touches the ball.\n\nCome trade deadline, do the best thing for both parties and trade him. The Dolphins get a 1st rounder and Achane gets a ring and a Super Bowl MVP for whatever team is an electric RB away from a Lombardi trophy.\n\nSuperG! says extend him unless someone offers a first, and maybe more, for him.\n\nCould he garner a first-round pick? I’ve been told by super smart people on here that teams don’t offer a first round pick in a trade scenario for a running back. Especially a running back on the final year of his rookie contract. A first and a third would be considered a Godfather deal. Other than that, I wouldn’t trade him. I’d extend him instead.\n\ngo_canes who has a VERY solid screen name, says keep him because seeing him play is worth the admission!\n\nThe guy is one of those rare “worth the price of admission” players. I hope they keep him in a Dolphin uniform. It is worth the risk. There is also a risk to the complete tank approach – you could develop a loser mentality.\n\nUSMCFinzFreak lays out a 2-3 year plan for the team.\n\n1) Build the trenches through the draft.\n\n2) Obtain competent WRs and TEs.\n\n3) Get a bridge quarterback (I still have hope in Ewers).\n\nOnce those pieces are in place, go and get a young quarterback (if Ewers doesn’t cut the mustard).\n\nMIAMI235 believes it comes down to affordability.\n\nIf he stays healthy, a dynamic presence, when utilized properly. As others have stated, it may simply comedown too affordability.\n\ndavidson11 says if Tua’s gone, then just clean house.\n\nIf they’re not going to keep Tua, they might as well trade Achane and Waddle. Either tank or don’t.\n\nfinfanfromsiam believes in the build via the draft concept.\n\nVery good player that we drafted. Extend him to a decent contract. Keep our own when possible.\n\nMonix22 wants him traded based on an assumption of future injury.\n\nTrade him. Let him get hurt on another team.\n\nUpInPensacola wants to make it a package deal. Might be the only way to get a good package in return for Tua.\n\nIs it possible to trade him in a deal where Tua goes with him?\n\nPA phinphan say’s the idea of a team-friendly deal is unlikely, so maybe look for a first for him in trade.\n\nTo me this is tough decision. I would love to keep him on a team friendly deal but is that even a thing anymore? It seems like it’s all about making as much as you can with little loyalty. I get it. It’s like any other business.\n\nWith that said, if he could bring a first round pick maybe it’s best to trade him and give the new regime more picks to build their type of roster.\n\nThe Earl is a man of few words.\n\nWell, that’s our random 15 comments this evening. It seems there is no consensus on what should happen with Achane going forward, which means whatever happens with him will make some portion of the fan base unhappy. As always, thank you to each of you who took the time to join in on our question of the day and contribute to this and the prior post.

    "fullText": "The college football offseason overall is pretty quiet this time of year. In 2026, it has been a little bit louder with recent court rulings and ongoing battles.\n\nThis is also the time, however, that the NCAA works with college football programs to make changes to the game. Most recently, the running clock rule was changed, and a two-minute warning was also added.\n\nMORE: NCAA may appeal judge’s Trinidad Chambliss decision due to concerning details\n\nThe NCAA is looking to make a big change to a controversial college football rule: targeting. Targeting, of course, is when a player leads with the crown of their head for intentional contact with another player’s head or neck area.\n\nThe rule’s purpose is understandable. They want to protect all players from unnecessary hits and also protect those who tend to deliver those hits.\n\nWhat makes things controversial is the review, execution, and punishment of targeting. It can be difficult to determine if targeting in college football is malicious in nature or not intentional.\n\nMORE: Indiana gives head football coach Curt Cignetti a nice championship reward\n\nThe punishment is ejection and can also roll over into the next game for those penalized. The NCAA is reportedly aiming to change at least the rollover suspension aspect of targeting.\n\nThis is a relatively big step in addressing the difficult call to make in targeting. While some calls are very obvious–one way or another–it is still also difficult for other calls.\n\nCould the NCAA eventually change the punishment of targeting altogether?

    "fullText": "Your $1,000 laptop deserves a protective home on the road. A tech journalist and frequent traveler recommends his nine favorites\n\nThe four best personal-item backpacks that fit under US airline seats\n\nWhether you’re flying across the country on vacation, meeting with an important client downtown or just heading to your local coffee shop for work, there is a good chance you’re bringing a backpack along, with a laptop squirreled away inside.\n\nWhile you can toss a laptop into just about any bag, the best laptop backpacks are specially tailored to pamper what is probably one of your most expensive (and delicate) possessions. That means a padded pocket lined with soft non-scratch material, easy access to your computer without unpacking everything and lots of extra pockets for portable mice, chargers and other accessories. Add in all of the standard backpack considerations such as capacity, comfort and durability, and you have a lot of factors to consider.\n\nTo find the very best laptop backpack, I rounded up 11 of the top models and tested them over several months and many miles.\n\nBest overall: \n\n Mission Workshop Meridian backpack\n\nBest for travel:\n\n Peak Design Travel Backpack\n\nBest budget: \n\n The North Face Vault\n\nBest sling bag: \n\n Tomtoc Navigator – T24 Sling Bag (Small)\n\nBest rugged bag: \n\n Pelican PX25 Aegis Travel Pack\n\nI’ve been a tech journalist for 13 years, and a frequent traveler – in 2025 I flew more than 70,000 miles, across 41 flights and a total of seven days and six hours in the air. I visited 12 airports and six countries, to say nothing of countless steps, ride shares and hotels.\n\nAs someone who tends to pack more than I really need and has a bad back, I’m uniquely motivated to find the perfect backpack, and it’s been an obsessive quest of mine for years. Backpacks also speak to my love for planning and organization, which the testing process let me fully indulge.\n\nThe first thing I did to test these 11 backpacks was to pack for a trip. I put everything I typically carry for a work trip on to a table: a laptop that is anywhere from 13 to 16in, a tablet, several phones – because I have a weird job – multiple plugs, chargers, batteries and, of course, plenty of bungee cords. My loadout also includes three tech bags: one with video gear like a selfie stick and lav mics, one with flight essentials like snacks and battery packs and one with chargers, cables and adapters.\n\nThen, I packed up each backpack using the various compartments and pockets as designed, threw each backpack on to my back and I walked a half mile each. Since water is the mortal enemy of laptops, I also tested each backpack (empty – and thank goodness!) in my shower for one minute to simulate getting caught in the rain. I fully let out all the straps and donned the backpack to see how easily the straps adjusted. I zipped and unzipped each zipper 25 times to see how easy it was to use. Finally, I put a deck of playing cards in an easy-access pocket (if there was one) and timed how long it took for me to get it off my back and the cards in hand.\n\nMany manufacturers provided samples to test for this article, which I donated to my local library upon completion. It’d be a treat to see a school kid or even an adult strutting around town with one of these.\n\nMission Workshop’s Meridian backpack has pockets for days, a semi-modular design that lets you customize it with add-ons and tons of space.\n\nWhy we love it\nThis bag easily held everything I wanted to pack with room to spare, and a home for everything. All three of my tech bags fit in the main compartment, and everything else had its own pocket, making it very clear where everything lives. The sample I received included two add-ons: a slim side pouch that’s perfect for phones, battery packs or even a slim flashlight, and a bottle pouch. Laptop access on this bag is particularly nice because it has its own compartment, separate from the main compartment. It scored the highest on our waterproof testing, as well – everything inside was bone dry. The straps didn’t rest along my rib cage as well as I’d like, but it was definitely wearable.\n\nThis bag is probably overkill for a student just looking to tote a laptop and some books around campus, but it’s great for a professional who needs to schlep a bunch of gear comfortably and with easy access to everything.\n\nIt’s a shame that … It’s so big it might strain the personal item rules on most airlines. And there are no locks or hidden pockets if you’re worried about security. While it has a sleeve to slide over the handle on a roller bag, it’s situated sideways, which interferes with the side pouches and struck me as a silly design choice.\n\nMax laptop size: 17in\nCapacity: 28 litres\nEmpty weight: 2.74lbs\n\nThis bag has an unusual design: to pack it you need to rest it on its face and open the back, which hinges 180 degrees and gives you easy access to the whole main compartment.\n\nWhy we love it\nIf you’re headed out for a weekend, this is a lovely bag to comfortably bring a few changes of clothes, your laptop and all the goodies that go with it. Aside from the large main compartment, you’ll find a good amount of organization around the periphery of the main pouch, smaller zipped pockets along the side and two larger zipped pockets on the inside of the front of the bag.\n\nLoops along the periphery of the bag inside and out allow you strap even more gear to the bag, and Peak even includes tie-downs. With 30 litres of capacity, you probably won’t need to, though.\n\nIt’s a shame that … The unique design takes some getting used to. Adjusting the straps and fit is very difficult, and waterproofing was just OK. There was some water ingress, making the paper towels inside the bag damp, but not wet. The lining is also not absorbant, so it dries quickly.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 33 liters\nEmpty weight: 3.17lbs\n\nWhile it’s the most basic bag I tested, the North Face Vault is a perfectly competent laptop hauler at a fraction of the cost of most other bags on this list.\n\nWhy we love it\nBeing basic isn’t necessarily a bad thing – not every backpack needs 700 pockets for every little item. The Vault has a generous main compartment and a smaller top compartment with a few pouches and pockets for very small items, such as pencils and thumb drives. The top pouch takes away a bit of room into the main pouch, but the latter opens wide enough to easily work around it if you’re digging around for something.\n\nThis bag is deceptively deep, and it holds a lot, if pressed into service. I found it very serviceable for most tasks – the Toyota Corolla of backpacks. It will get you from A to B with no complaints. Just please don’t get caught out in the rain.\n\nIt’s a shame that … It’s not waterproof at all – water quickly works its way inside. It’s also not terribly comfortable for extended periods due to thin straps and little padding on the shoulder straps and back.\n\nMax laptop size: 15in \nCapacity: 27 liters\nEmpty weight: 1.68lbs\n\nThis isn’t technically a backpack – it’s a sling bag, but it’s delightfully small, it holds a ton of gear, and yet has enough space for a 14in laptop.\n\nWhy we love it\nThis is a great day pack, if you’re heading out for a day on the town. It only holds 7 liters, but those 7 liters are impeccably organized: there are pockets for your laptop, tablet and e-reader, plus smaller pockets for additional organization. An outer pocket is perfect for things you need to grab on the go, and a security pocket facing your back lets you safely stow your wallet, keys or passport in a tough-to-swipe location.\n\nIt’s a shame that … Adjusting the strap is very hard with the overengineered buckle. This is also the smallest bag on the list by a lot, and probably won’t hold everything you’ll want for plane rides.\n\nMax laptop size: 14in\nCapacity: 7 liters\nEmpty weight: 1.23lbs\n\nPelican is perhaps best known for its hardened cases used to carry delicate equipment, and the Aegis stays true to its roots with a super tough hard-shell design.\n\nWhy we love it\nUnlike all the soft options on our list, this model has a rigid exterior built to shrug off impact and general roughhousing. I didn’t drop the bag from my roof or anything, but if you find yourself in a harsh environment with gear that doesn’t take kindly to impact, this should be your first choice.\n\nThe backpack is essentially one large compartment, except for one small compartment at the top for odds and ends, and a laptop sleeve. If you want to more, Pelican sells stick-on Velcro “ModPaks” that add various pockets. Personally, I would need three or more, but if you want a lot of open space to work with, this is a good bag to consider. Like the Peak Design bag, it has tie-down loops inside to ratchet down your gear with cord or bungees.\n\nIt’s a shame that … There is virtually no organization in the bag – plan to use packing cubes. It also has almost no water resistance. Also, if you have a dog with not-black fur, carry a lint roller with you!\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 25 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.9lbs\n\nI prefer a messenger bag (AKA sling bag) when I need to dig into it frequently, like at a trade show, but a backpack is more comfortable for extended wear. Since I switch between them frequently, this convertible bag piqued my interest. It offers the best of both worlds: when you want to convert it, the backpack straps zip up into their own pocket, and you attach the shoulder strap to two loops and just like that, you have a messenger bag.\n\nThe main pocket is surprisingly large, and the two auxiliary pockets also hold a lot. When I was done packing in the items I used to test these bags, this one had a lot of space left over. But it didn’t reign in any one category, which knocked it down a few pegs from its competitors.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … There is no organization nor security in the bag.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in\nCapacity: 25 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.09lbs\n\nThe Knack Medium Backpack has a highly unusual design that expands out to leap from 24 to 35 litres. You actually access the laptop sleeve from the side, rather than the top, which is a novel approach. While there are some smaller pockets around the periphery of the bag, the main pocket is just one big open space with a divider, which is designed to separate clothes from other gear.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … It felt like the designers had a few clever ideas, but couldn’t quite bring them together coherently. It’s also not water-resistant at all.\n\nMax laptop size: 16in \nCapacity: 35 liters \nEmpty weight: 3lbs\n\nIf you’ve ever found yourself with the unexpected need to check a bag for a flight as I have, a lockable backpack provides welcome piece of mind. This Tomtoc has lock latches – holes where you can insert a lock to attach the zippers to each other – on both of its sets of zippers. You can’t lock up the front pockets, which is unfortunate, but you can secure the main pouch, which is probably where your most expensive goodies live.\n\nTwo zippers access the main pocket: one in the back that facilitates slipping a laptop into the sleeve, and a second one at the front that gives you a wide mouth to put other items in. They both open to the same space, which seemed a bit redundant.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … It has terrible water resistance, and it’s not terribly comfortable to carry.\n\nMax laptop size: 17.3in\nCapacity: 24 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.2lbs\n\nIf you’re a new parent, this bag is a no-brainer, but it’s also great for travelers. I’ve taken it on several trips with no screaming babies in tow and I really dig it. It offers tons of places to stick items like phones, a top pocket for quick-access items and a large stretchy pocket on the front of random odds and ends. If you’re using it as intended, there’s a space at the bottom designed to hold dirty diapers and one pocket designed for baby wipes.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … There’s no security in the bag at all, and the baby features waste a bit of space for non-parents.\n\nMax laptop size: 17in\nCapacity: 20 liters\nEmpty weight: 2.1lbs\n\nPeak Design Everyday Backpack 20L\n\nThink about capacity, organization, security, waterproofing and comfort. To prioritize, consider what you’ll be carrying and in what circumstances. A bag for day tripping to the coffee shop requires less capacity than a weekend travel bag, for instance.\n\nObviously, nothing beats trying it on. Fully extend out the straps, put it on your back and then adjust the straps to fit. If you can, toss in some dummy weight.\n\nIf you’re shopping online, examine how the straps are sewn to the backpack. If they attach vertically, they’ll run along your torso more comfortably than those attached horizontally. Also, consider the zipper pulls. As you get older, zippers with fabric or cord loops can be much easier to pull than bare metal tabs. Also look for retailers with a good return policy in case reality doesn’t match expectations.\n\nBottom padding matters more than anything. Backpacks will be slung down off your back and on to the floor hundreds, if not thousands, of times, and bottom padding is the only thing between your $2,000 laptop and a concrete floor. Also consider waterproofing – if the bag isn’t very waterproof and you get stuck out in the rain, the padding of the sleeve might absorb water and take a long time to dry out.\n\nWhile I prefer a backpack with a pocket for everything, others prefer the versatility of an open compartment. To prevent all your gear from mixing together, use packing cubes and specialized tech bags, like the Peak Design Tech Pouch I use, to hold cables and chargers. Many companies offering backpacks with open compartments also sell organizational packs to go inside.\n\nSome high-end backpacks shed water like ducks; others may as well be made of gauze. If you’re stuck in the rain with the latter, find a garbage bag to put over the backpack, making a slit for the straps if necessary (or just carry it by the handle if it has one, and most all of the bags in this list do). A friendly business may even let you have one if you ask nicely.\n\nWhen you get home, empty the backpack completely, place it in a room with a lot of air circulation and place something inside the laptop sleeve to prop it open so it can dry out. If you don’t, water can get trapped in there for days.\n\nAdam Doud is a freelance product journalist and frequent traveler who carries a ton of tech with him wherever he goes. He’s been on a low-key quest to find the perfect bag/backpack since 2020, and he has strapped more gear to his back than Hannibal’s elephants – though not all at one time. He is also a compulsive organizer, so the more pockets the better",

    "description": "A mom explains why she pulled her high school son out of school for a three-week trip to Antarctica to ease college anxiety and gain perspective.",
    "fullText": "My high school son, Jack, was overwhelmed with college anxiety — SAT prep, AP classes, acceptance rates, and all the pressure that comes with being a New York student.\n\nIt was hard to quiet the noise, so I decided to make a radical — and unconventional decision: I pulled him out of school and took him to Antarctica for three weeks over winter break.\n\nEveryone told me it was a terrible idea, but I thought it was exactly what he needed.\n\nJack and I have been traveling together since he was 3 months old. I'm a huge traveler, and when I had my first son, I decided to take him along for the ride.\n\nIn elementary school, I didn't think twice about pulling him out in order to explore the world (Costa Rica, Mexico, Nevis, Finland). Against the judgment of some parents (and some school officials), I thought it was important to expose him to travel — different cultures, different ways of doing things, different ways of thinking. He quickly became my favorite travel companion, and I often thought travel Jack was the best version of himself.\n\nIt became more difficult to pull him out in middle school (but I still did — he missed eighth-grade graduation — to go on a trip to Sri Lanka). Once he entered high school (where, according to him, grades matter), it became really difficult to make up the work if I pulled him out.\n\nThen came junior year and all the stress that comes with college prep settled upon us. Not only was he balancing a bunch of AP classes, but he was also studying for the SAT and doing all the college prep work. Basically, he (and therefore I) became slightly unhinged.\n\nSo when I floated the idea of going on a trip — just the two of us — Jack was instantly in, but I got tons of pushback from everyone else. Junior year is the most important year for college prep; he's in AP classes, and it's super hard to make up the work. Did I have my priorities straight? Now is the time to lock in, not travel.\n\nBut I ignored the noise and booked us on a three-week cruise to Antarctica — he had two weeks off for the holiday break and would miss one week of school. I had him talk to all his teachers about missed work and make-up, and, surprisingly, while a lot of parents thought I was nuts, the teachers were supportive of this once-in-a-lifetime trip.\n\nAnd off we went on a three-week trip to Antarctica, South Georgia, and the Falkland Islands. I purposefully chose this cruise itinerary because it included South Georgia, which everyone says is a must if going to the white continent. It definitely made the trip long (by a week), but it turned out South Georgia was both Jack and my favorite part of the cruise (we saw thousands of king penguins in their beautiful orange plumage, alongside their baby chicks, which looked like they were wearing lush fur coats).\n\nEvery day was a different adventure: hiking up snow-capped peaks; kayaking among icebergs looking for whales and seals; getting face-to-face with several types of penguins (we quickly learned the difference between rockhopper, macaroni, gentoo, Adelie, and chinstrap varieties).\n\nFar from GPAs and college chatter, surrounded instead by penguins, elephant seals, and endless ice, Jack's perspective started to shift. College stopped feeling like the entire world — and started looking like just one chapter.\n\nOne night we had dinner with Rich Pagen a naturalist and Kristen Wornson the Young Explorers guide. When Jack asked them how they knew what they wanted to do with their lives, they shared their experience of trying to find the right college and then moving into different career circles. It was great for Jack to hear that their path wasn't always straightforward, but they ultimately found jobs they loved.\n\nFor Jack to see people loving their jobs — and to realize that no one thought they'd end up where they did, leading expeditions in Antarctica — was a great wake-up call.\n\nAlso, because this was the family holiday cruise, several other families with teens were on board. It was great for Jack to get out of his comfort zone and talk to teens from all over the world. One was taking a gap year before college, and it really got him realizing that there are so many paths out there.\n\nThe trip also brought Jack and me closer together; away from the distractions of everyday life, we connected in a way that's rare during the teenage years.\n\nOn this trip, Jack and I always did the excursions together, and we ate dinner together every night. But on sea days, I attended every lecture, and he opted to go to the gym or sleep. By giving each other space, we really enjoyed the time we did spend together. I didn't nag him, and he, in turn, didn't give me an attitude.\n\nIt was one of our favorite trips together.",

It's a deliberate choice. And a basic part of our society. It's not like that in the United States, where it costs money to go to the doctor,\" he wrote. \"We are always open to dialogue and collaboration. Also with the U.S. But talk to us now instead of just coming up with more or less random outbursts on social media.\"\n\nTrump has had his sights set on the Arctic island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory, since his first term in office. Trump has suggested the US could buy Greenland or even take it by force.\n\nThe president says Greenland's location makes it strategically important as the melting of Arctic ice opens up new shipping routes and intensifies competition with Russia and China.\n\nThe island is also rich in critical minerals and already hosts a key US military base, which American officials say is vital to missile defense and Arctic security.\n\nMajor European leaders, including those from France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Denmark, released a joint statement last month defending Greenland.\n\n\"Greenland belongs to its people,\" the statement said. \"It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",

    "description": "The president now routinely tells companies how to run their businesses and threatens them if they don't comply.",
    "fullText": "Netflix wants President Donald Trump's stamp of approval as it maneuvers to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNow, Trump has a demand for Netflix: unseat board member Susan Rice.\n\nIn normal times, we would all be marveling at the spectacle of the US president telling a company in the midst of a merger fight (Paramount also wants to buy Warner Bros. Discovery) how to structure its board. During Trump 2.0, though, this has become standard stuff. Trump routinely tells companies to fire someone he doesn't like or do something he does like.\n\nThat doesn't mean Trump always gets what he wants. The demands alone, however, are an extraordinary use of power. We should make sure we don't become inured to it.\n\nTrump's Truth Social post is a reminder that the future of Warner Bros. Discovery will run through the White House, no matter what Trump says at any given moment. (Refresher: In December, Trump said, \"I'll be involved\" in the fight between Netflix and Paramount. Earlier this month, he announced that \"I've decided I shouldn't be involved.\" Now he's telling Netflix it will \"pay the consequences\" if it doesn't fire Rice, which sure seems like he's involved again.)\n\nTrump himself doesn't have the authority to stop Warner Bros. Discovery from selling itself to Netflix or Paramount, which is controlled by David Ellison and his father, the prominent Trump supporter, Larry Ellison. He can, however, instruct Attorney General Pam Bondi to sue to stop a deal on antitrust grounds.\n\nModern presidents have traditionally assumed an arm's-length distance from federal law enforcement. And it's entirely possible that any other president's Department of Justice would also look into an antitrust case against Netflix, given its enormous market power.\n\nTrump, however, has made it clear that he expects Bondi to act on his behalf. So if he doesn't want Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, he can certainly make it more difficult for them.\n\nWhich makes it puzzling that Rice, who held senior roles in the Clinton, Obama, and Biden administrations, would sound off on a podcast, announcing that \"elites\" and \"corporate interests\" who accommodated Trump would one day \"be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\"\n\nThis wasn't a mere gaffe or misstatement. She went on at length. It was, regardless of how she intended it, a provocation aimed at the Trump White House — at the exact moment the company she's supposed to help govern is seeking Trump's approval.\n\nI've asked Netflix for comment on Rice's comments and Trump's response.\n\nWe should also note that Trump's most consistent trait is his inconsistency and that he frequently reverses himself. Last summer, for instance, he announced that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was \"highly CONFLICTED\" and must resign. Days later, Trump met with Tan and described him as a \"success.\" Weeks after that, the US government acquired 10% of Intel.\n\nNor does Trump always follow through. Last fall, he demanded that Microsoft fire Lisa Monaco, an executive who had also worked for Clinton, Obama, and Biden. Monaco still works for Microsoft.\n\nHowever, just because we don't know how serious Trump is about pushing Rice out of Netflix — or how his administration will ultimately rule on the Netflix/Paramount race — doesn't mean we should shrug this off.\n\nWe're in a place where the president routinely tells companies how to run their businesses and threatens them if they don't comply. If we get used to that, we shouldn't be surprised when future presidents decide they can do it, too.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "The Monday morning commute won't be messy in New York City. It will be nonexistent.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declared a state of emergency and a travel ban during a press conference on Sunday as a giant winter storm bore down on much of the Northeast.\n\nThe National Weather Service said to expect blizzard conditions and up to 20 inches of snow over the next 24 hours. Parts of New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts could get up to 25 inches.\n\n\"The state of emergency closes the streets, highways, and bridges of New York City for all traffic,\" Mamdani said. The travel ban begins at 9 p.m. Sunday and lasts until 12 p.m. on Monday. DoorDash, notably, also said it was suspending deliveries Sunday night.\n\nUS airlines, meanwhile, are canceling and delaying thousands of flights. As of Sunday afternoon, airlines had canceled over 3,000 flights and delayed over 2,900, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nNew York City's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports have the highest number of cancellations, followed by Newark Liberty International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and Boston Logan International Airport.\n\nAnyone hoping to catch a flight in the region on Monday can also expect major disruptions, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. At LaGuardia Airport, for example, 82% of flights scheduled for Monday have been canceled.\n\nAdding to what will likely be a chaotic 48 hours for travelers, the Department of Homeland Security announced Saturday night that it was suspending TSA PreCheck and Global Entry due to the partial government shutdown.\n\nDespite the announcement, however, TSA Precheck and Global Entry lanes remained open at major airports on Sunday. In a statement, the Transportation Security Administration said it is evaluating the situation \"case-by-case.\"\n\n\"At this time, TSA PreCheck remains operational with no change for the traveling public,\" a spokesperson said. \"As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case-by-case basis and adjust operations accordingly.\"\n\nThe federal government entered a partial shutdown earlier this month, delaying funding for some agencies, like DHS. TSA agents are essential workers, so they're still working — for now. During the full government shutdown earlier this year, TSA agents and air traffic controllers went 43 days without a paycheck.",

The area gained fame from the 70s and 80s show \"The Love Boat,\" which was often set there.\n\nThe Mexican government said the retaliatory violence came after it killed Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes, the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, on Sunday.\n\nThe State Department announced last week that it had sanctioned Kovay Gardens — a Mexican timeshare resort — and 17 other companies and five individuals linked to \"timeshare fraud schemes\" organized by the Jalisco cartel.\n\n\"Many of these individuals and entities are based in or near Puerto Vallarta, a popular tourist destination that also serves as a strategic stronghold for CJNG,\" a press release from the Treasury Department said.\n\nIn 2024, the US State Department said it would pay a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Cervantes.

Imageless electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) provides a non invasive alternative to electrical mapping from body surface potentials, but conventional ECGI is confined to epicardial reconstructions and can miss arrhythmias originating in deeper myocardium. We address this by reconstructing three dimensional cardiac activity with a volumetric formulation that solves an inverse source problem via Green's functions, enabling full volume activation mapping and improved localization in anatomically complex regions. We evaluate the approach on simulated premature ventricular beats and on four challenging patient cases, a right ventricular outflow tract premature ventricular contraction, a left bundle branch block, a ventricular tachycardia, and Wolff Parkinson White, and additionally assess performance on an open source myocardial infarction dataset. Results show that volumetric ECGI recovers 3D activation and sharpens arrhythmia origin localization, achieving a 59.",

    "fullText": "Oliver Glasner says it is \"absolutely OK\" to \"face criticism\" after some Crystal Palace fans again questioned his immediate future as manager.\n\nGlasner, who led the Eagles to their first major honour last May, said last month that he will leave the club when his contract expires in the summer.\n\nSome fans called for him to leave now during their Europa Conference League draw at Zrinjski Mostar in midweek, and a banner held during Sunday's Premier League win over bottom club Wolves said he is \"finished\".\n\nThat was the Eagles' first home win since early November and just their second overall since early December.\n\nAnother banner called the club's board \"inept\" as there had been \"opportunities missed\" since last season's FA Cup triumph.\n\nGlasner told Sky Sports after Sunday's 1-0 victory that he saw the banners and said: \"It's OK. The fans are as disappointed as we are and they can't talk to us directly, so it's their opportunity to express their mood.\n\n\"That's what we have to accept. On the other side, they supported the team right until the end and that's why I think they helped [us] to win the game. But when we face criticism, it's absolutely OK.\"\n\nAlthough Palace claimed their first win in 13 at Brighton two weeks ago, they then let a 2-0 lead slip to lose 3-2 at home to second-bottom Burnley.\n\nIn a news conference after Thursday's 1-1 draw in Bosnia, Glasner told disgruntled fans to \"stay humble\" and was far from convincing when asked whether he wants to stay at Selhurst Park until the summer, saying \"let's see what the future brings, you never know.\"\n\nOn if he has the drive to continue leading the club, he replied \"yes, I think so\" before adding \"I'm just not good enough to replace the players we sold. I'm just not good enough to integrate the new players to play the same way like we did, and I'm not good enough that we can cope with the schedule we had.\"\n\nBut Glasner provided more clarity after Sunday's game, stressing he remains committed to the club.\n\n\"For me, Oliver Glasner is not important,\" he told the BBC's Match of the Day. \"If the club had thought they need a change, then I don't want to be in the way. That is what I meant.\n\n\"I spoke to the board, to the chairman, to the sporting director and they said 'no, we think you are the right one'.\"\n\n'Stay humble' - Glasner reacts to fan backlash as future in doubt\n\nThe Austrian added: \"The most important thing is Crystal Palace, and I am here 100% to be successful for Crystal Palace.\n\n\"I need the players. It's important that the players are believing in what we are telling them - I and the staff. It's important that the club is believing in us, that we can get this turnaround and end this season successfully.\"\n\nThe Eagles were fortunate to beat Wolves, with Evann Guessand scoring a 90th-minute winner after the visitors missed a first-half penalty and spent more than 30 minutes with 10 men.\n\n\"Of course, the fans are like us all, disappointed with some results and some parts of the game. That's normal,\" said Glasner.\n\n\"I don't expect them to celebrate us when we don't win, when we don't perform right, but on the other side, since I was here, I felt support from the first day.\n\n\"Hopefully we face more wins and the mood around the club will be better and we will enjoy our life much more.\"\n\nLatest Crystal Palace news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Crystal Palace - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "For those who have followed Eberechi Eze's career, the sight of him wheeling away to celebrate an important goal towards the end of the season will not come as a surprise. And he 'proved something' as he scored twice as Premier League leaders Arsenal beat Tottenham 4-1.",
    "fullText": "For those who have followed Eberechi Eze's career, the sight of him wheeling away to celebrate an important goal towards the end of the season will not come as a surprise.\n\nTottenham Hotspur fans, though, will be happy not to come up against the Arsenal forward again until next season.\n\nEze has scored 40 Premier League goals in his six league seasons, with 19 coming from the 30th game onwards.\n\nBasically, the England international has a record of netting goals late in the campaign, when it matters most.\n\nEze, who scored the winning goal for Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final last season against Manchester City, has tormented Spurs since turning them down last summer to sign for the Gunners.\n\nHaving netted a hat-trick in the 4-1 north London derby win back in November, another two followed in Sunday's crucial encounter at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\n\"He had that belief and I'm really happy with him. He's really trying to mould and adapt into what we want from him,\" said boss Mikel Arteta.\n\nIronically, Eze's other league goal this season came against his former side Palace in a 1-0 win in October, which means all his league goals this term have come against those two teams.\n\nAnd after his brace in Arsenal's latest thumping of their rivals, only Robert Pires (seven) and Emmanuel Adebayor (six) have more Premier League goals for the Gunners against Tottenham than Eze's five.\n\nHe is also the first Arsenal player to score five or more goals against an opponent in the same top-flight season since Adebayor against Derby in 2007-08 (six).\n\nSupporters had already taken to the 27-year-old because of the way he signed for the club, turning down Spurs to join them instead in a £60m deal, but the goals he has scored are the icing on the cake.\n\nArsenal pass derby test of nerve as title race looks set to go to wire\n\nEze Arsenal's derby hero again as leaders sink Tudor's Spurs\n\n'Who's going to get this fine?' - Arteta on derby technology delays\n\nIt's been a difficult period for Eze, who has found minutes in the league hard to come by and this was was only his second start in the league since December.\n\nHe has a tough route into the team with captain Martin Odegaard a key part of Arteta's first-choice midfield when he is fit and Leandro Trossard being in good form on the left wing, which is the other position Eze might feature.\n\nThe Arsenal boss did trial Eze on the left, but he switched off when Matty Cash scored Aston Villa's opener in their 2-1 defeat in December and, despite starting the following game, he was left on the substitute's bench for the next four league matches.\n\nArteta opted to play England winger Bukayo Saka from the start in the disappointing 2-2 draw with Wolves in midweek as a number 10 - ahead of Eze, who started on the bench.\n\nAnd the Spaniard admitted: \"He was upset, even with me, because I didn't play him the other day from the beginning, and some of the decisions that I made. And I just have to understand how we're going to get the best out of him now.\"\n\nArteta was asked by BBC Sport whether Eze's record of producing goals at the end of the season was one of the reasons they signed him.\n\n\"We looked at every stat, but that one, to be very honest, no,\" he added while laughing.\n\n\"He scored five goals in the last few games against them, which is extremely difficult to do. But I could see that he wanted to prove something.\"\n\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel was in attendance at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Eze will have hoped to have caught his eye after a recent lack of game time to boost his World Cup hopes this summer.\n\n\"Today it's worked out, we thank God for it,\" Eze told Sky Sports. \"We put in a good performance. We did what we needed to do, which was the main thing.\n\n\"I'm always trying to get in those positions to be ready and to find the space and to work hard to get those opportunities. It takes a lot to get there and it's worked out today.\"\n\nIt was also an important day for Eze's team-mate Viktor Gyokeres.\n\nThe Swedish international has been criticised at times this season for his performances but since the turn of the year has started to find some form.\n\nAnd after a double himself at Spurs, no Premier League player has scored more goals in 2026 across all competitions than Gyokeres with eight of his 15 for his club coming in this calendar year.\n\nThe 27-year-old linked up with Eze and played a big part in Arsenal's third goal, while he seemed to visibly grow in confidence after scoring.\n\n\"For me, the best, the most complete, and especially when we need him most and that is when big players and big clubs have to stand up when you are needed,\" added Arteta when asked about his £64m summer signing from Sporting.\n\nArsenal are now five points clear of Manchester City, although they have played one more game and visit Pep Guardiola's men at Etihad Stadium in April - and Eze and Gyokeres look like they are starting to find the net at just the right time.\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, launching a book tour widely seen as a prelude to a presidential run, discussed with CNN the possibility of running against former Vice President Kamala Harris, another longtime figure in California politics.\n\n“What happens if and when those parallel careers intersect and collide?” CNN’s Dana Bash asked Newsom in an interview that aired Sunday.\n\n“Well, I’m San Francisco now, she’s LA,” Newsom said at first. “So there’s a little distance between the two of us. You know, fate will determine that.”\n\n“I’ve never gotten in the way of her ambition, ever,” he added. “I haven’t. And I don’t imagine I would in the future.”\n\n“But if you run against each other for president,” Bash followed up. Newsom responded, “Yeah I just – that’s fate. I don’t – you know, you can only control what you can control.”\n\nNewsom has been forthright about his interest in the 2028 presidential race. Harris opted out of running to succeed Newsom as California governor but has left open the possibility of a third presidential bid.\n\nHarris served as district attorney in San Francisco before being elected the California attorney general and then a US senator before serving as vice president. Newsom was San Francisco’s mayor prior to becoming lieutenant governor and then governor.\n\nThe two have collided at times – Harris wrote in her most recent book, “107 Days,” that when she called Newsom to ask for his support after former President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid, Newsom texted back, “Hiking. Will call back,” and never did. (Newsom, who did endorse Harris quickly, later told reporters the call came from an unknown number.)\n\nSpeaking to Bash, Newsom emphasized that he would carefully weigh the decision with his family. Asked if his family was on board, Newsom responded, “I don’t know. It depends on the day.”\n\nAnd he shared concerns from one of his sons about a potential presidential bid.\n\n“My son … it was very powerful, texted me a few months ago when there was some headline that suggested that I made some decision, and he goes, ‘Dad, are you running (for) president?” Newsom said.\n\nHe continued, “I said, no, we’ll make this decision as a family. And he goes, you can’t. And I said, why? He goes, ‘I’m too young. You need to spend more time with us.’\n\n“I mean, how do you deal with that one?” he said.\n\n“How do you deal with that one?” Bash responded.\n\n“Exactly – I’m asking you,” Newsom replied with a smile.",

    "description": "I chose a hypothetical scenario and asked ChatGPT to construct a retirement plan that would allow a retiree to live on $100,000 a year.",
    "fullText": "People use artificial intelligence (AI) for many things: meal planning, budgeting and interior design. But can you use a platform like ChatGPT for tasks that normally require a professional, like financial planning? \n\nI chose a hypothetical scenario and asked ChatGPT to construct a retirement plan that would allow a retiree to live on $100,000 a year. I assumed an annual income of $125,000 for a 40-year-old who wants to retire in a fully paid-off home in Tennessee at age 65. After setting the parameters (and asking ChatGPT if they were realistic) I asked the generative AI to create a retirement plan.\n\nThen, I asked Eric Franklin, CFP, managing principal at Prospero Wealth to review and assess it.\n\nWhen I first reached out, Franklin said it sounded interesting; he’d never been enlisted to critique an AI system before. With 23 years of tech experience, he was the perfect choice.\n\n“I had no idea what I was going to get,” he said.\n\nThe results were alarming. Not because ChatGPT’s output was immediately, obviously awful or right on the money.  It was scary because it fell into a gray area that artists call “the uncanny valley.”\n\nAt first glance, ChatGPT didn’t seem to be completely wrong.\n\nFind Out: Here’s How Much You Need To Retire With a $100K Lifestyle\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\n“I read it through and, at first, at the top level, it passed the sniff test. It looked fairly realistic,” Franklin said. “If I weren’t pushing on it too hard, I’d probably feel like it was somewhat accurate. Those were my first impressions.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the plan I presented was only one aspect of what financial advisors at Prospero Wealth offer clients. “It doesn’t include a lot of the things we’d normally include, like stress tests, accounting for changes in your career, changes in your family or possible relocations.”\n\nBut as Franklin dove deeper, he realized something that could be dangerous for anyone trying to use ChatGPT as a retirement planning tool without knowledge and experience to back it up.\n\nIt started with false premises, failed to adjust for inflation and created an unrealistic scenario. Granted, there were limitations in the exercise because the prompt was designed to be broad and concise. It was written by someone who is not a financial planner and intentionally didn’t flag anything that seemed off throughout the process. This prompt was designed for someone who thinks they can use ChatGPT to help them plan for retirement, plugging in basic information and expecting actionable insights. That probably describes a lot of people using ChatGPT.",

    "description": "General Caine warned Trump an attack on Iran would be \"far more difficult\" than the operation that captured Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is weighing options to avoid a major military conflict with Iran if the country does not ditch its nuclear program after General Dan “Raizin” Caine told him an attack would be “far more difficult” than the operation that captured Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, The New York Times reported on Sunday evening.\n\nThe report said Trump and key members of his administration are heading to Geneva on Thursday to meet with Iranian negotiators; the meeting appears to be a “last-ditch” effort to avoid a military conflict.\n\n“President Trump has told advisers that if diplomacy or any initial targeted U.S. attack does not lead Iran to give in to his demands that it give up its nuclear program, he will consider a much bigger attack in coming months intended to drive that country’s leaders from power,” the report said, based on “people briefed on internal administration deliberations.”\n\nThe Times story has four reporters on the byline — Julian E. Barnes, David E. Sanger, Tyler Pager, and Eric Schmitt.\n\nMembers of Trump’s team and on the Iranian side are both considering an “off-ramp to military conflict,” which would include a “very limited nuclear enrichment program” that would only be used for medical research, the report said. That is because some members of the administration have expressed “doubts” a full dismantling of Iran’s nuclear program occur, if the U.S. only conducts airstrikes.\n\nHere is a key section on Caine warning Trump that attacking Iran could be harder than first expected:\n\nDuring the discussions of the operation last month to seize President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, General Caine told Mr. Trump there was a high likelihood of success. But General Caine has not been able to deliver the same reassurances to Mr. Trump during the Iran discussions, in large measure because it is a far more difficult target.\n\n[Vice President JD] Vance, who has long called for more restraint in overseas military action, did not oppose a strike, but he intensely questioned General Caine and Mr. Ratcliffe in the meeting. He pressed them to share their opinions of the options and wanted more of a discussion of the risks and complexity of carrying out a strike against Iran.\n\nThe report comes a few days after CBS senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs reported top military officials told Trump the military is ready for a potential strike as soon as this weekend. And Axios’s Barak Ravid reported on February 18 that “a U.S. military operation in Iran would likely be a massive, weeks-long campaign that would look more like full-fledged war than last month’s pinpoint operation in Venezuela, sources say.”\n\nAll of this comes amid months of protests against Iran’s theocratic regime inside the country.\n\nThe Times report added Trump is leaving open the possibility for a “military assault later this year intended to help topple Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It appears this could go a number of ways heading into the big summit this Thursday.\n\nThe post US Mulling an ‘Off Ramp’ On Iran As Top General Advises Trump Iran Attack Would Be ‘Far More Difficult’ Than Venezuela: NYT first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Arsenal passed the north London derby test with flying colours as Premier League title race looks likely to go to the wire, says chief football writer Phil McNulty",
    "fullText": "Arsenal answered questions posed about their nerve under pressure in the most emphatic fashion in the north London derby to suggest this is a Premier League race that will go down to the wire.\n\nThe manner in which Mikel Arteta's side collapsed in losing a two-goal lead at doomed Wolverhampton Wanderers saw old uncertainties and past pain resurface as hunters Manchester City scented blood.\n\nIt made the meeting with arch-rivals Spurs even more hazardous, especially with the toxic air around this dysfunctional club partly cleared by the sacking of unpopular head coach Thomas Frank and his replacement by Igor Tudor.\n\nArsenal need not have worried as, even with the imposing figure of the giant Croatian prowling his technical area clad in black, they were the beneficiaries of the latest cure prescribed by \"Dr. Tottenham\", always on hand to provide help to any opponent in times of strife.\n\nThe Spurs stadium announcer attempted to rally the crowd with a growled pre-match message delivered at ear-splitting volume, bellowing: \"They are worried. They are nervous as hell. We are calm. We are ready. The fire is ready to be lit.\"\n\nSadly for Spurs, the final score on that one was zero out of five.\n\nArsenal were the furthest thing from \"nervous as hell.\" Spurs were the furthest thing from calm and ready. No fires lit here.\n\nSpurs were almost cruelly outclassed as Arsenal's advantage at the top of the table returned to five points, although Pep Guardiola's City have a game in hand.\n\nEze 'wanted to prove something' as he torments Spurs again\n\nEze Arsenal's derby hero again as leaders sink Tudor's Spurs\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nTo sum up this latest Premier League weekend, Manchester City threw down the gauntlet by closing the gap to two points with a tension-filled win against Newcastle United. Arsenal picked it up with relish in this thumping 4-1 win.\n\nIt means that even before the end of February, sights are starting to turn to what might just be a title decider between City and Arsenal at Etihad Stadium on 18 April.\n\nIn the interim, Arsenal have home games against Chelsea, Everton and Bournemouth, along with a visit to Brighton. City travel to Leeds United, West Ham and Chelsea, with relegation strugglers Nottingham Forest to come to the Etihad.\n\nAnd, of course, there might just be a psychological blow to be struck when Arsenal and City meet in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on Sunday 22 March.\n\nArsenal are now 10 games from the glory that has eluded them since Arsene Wenger's \"Invincibles\" in 2003-04. Destiny is their hands. The twist in the tale is that the same applies to Manchester City.\n\nFor all Arsenal might have wished to play down the significance of this single game in the title context, it was a win and performance they needed desperately to calm concerns on and off the pitch.\n\nAnd this was a consummate display, cool and measured with a ruthless edge, even if it came against this dreadfully poor Spurs side.\n\nEberechi Eze picked the perfect time to return to his best, playing his part as derby tormentor again with two goals to add to the three he got in the 4-1 win at Emirates Stadium in December.\n\nSince that hat-trick, Eze had featured in all 15 of Arsenal's subsequent league games, but had made only four starts and played just 360 minutes before this derby.\n\nIn his last start he was substituted at half-time against Brentford, so credit to Arteta for having the instinct to feel that this was the sort of occasion to suit him, deploying him in the \"number 10\" role against the club who thought they had signed him until Arsenal stepped in to clinch a £60m deal with Crystal Palace.\n\nAnd there was more good news with much-criticised striker Viktor Gyokeres also scoring two fine goals on a perfect day for the Gunners and their ecstatic fanbase.\n\nArsenal were not knocked out of their stride, even after Randal Kolo Muani's bustling equaliser for Spurs two minutes after Eze struck the first blow. This was a confident, reassuring performance.\n\nArteta told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"This was outstanding. I think you have to bring context to the situation and this is the beauty of football.\n\n\"You go to Wolves and you drop two points in the last kick of the match. Watching it back, there is no understanding from my perception how the hell that happened.\n\n\"It feels like the end of the world, but then you have another opportunity and that is the beauty of it. In a difficult stadium, against our rivals, and seeing how much it means to us in the league and all our supporters.\"\n\nHe added: \"This chapter we wanted to write. We have managed it.\"\n\nBBC Sport pundit Danny Murphy expects the race between the two to go right to the finishing line.\n\nHe said: \"The title race is still on massively for both. It's in both their hands, that's unusual. Normally it's in one team's hands and you are just waiting for them to slip up.\n\n\"I have been very much in the Arsenal camp in terms of my eyes telling me they are the best team. The last couple of results have given Man City that little bit of hope. They have a lot of players in the squad who have been there and done it.\n\n\"Speaking from experience, when you have got over the line, the next couple feel easier. Every time Arsenal go on the pitch the pressure is on at the minute. It's great for us and I hope it goes to the wire. I don't see any winning all games from now until the end of the season.\"\n\nArsenal's nerve was put the test. They passed - and more tests will come for the Gunners and Manchester City as the Premier League pursuit reaches its climax.\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team",

    "description": "Liverpool's late 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest puts the Reds firmly in the Champions League hunt after a \"robbery\" of a victory at the City Ground.",
    "fullText": "Carnage would be an understatement to describe the closing moments of Liverpool's victory at the City Ground, but it would not be over the top to call the win a heist - one that puts Arne Slot's side firmly in the Champions League hunt.\n\nThe fact that Nottingham Forest boss Vitor Pereira said he was \"angry with football\" summed it up. Forest did not deserve to lose.\n\nFor large parts of the afternoon, the home fans chanted \"In your head, Arne, Arne, Arne\" to the tune of Zombie by The Cranberries as Pereira's side dominated the defending champions.\n\nBefore today, Slot had failed to beat Forest in any of his previous three attempts as Liverpool boss.\n\nYet as the Liverpool players made their way to the away end after snatching a remarkable victory through Alexis Mac Allister, the same chant came from the travelling support, who could hardly believe their luck.\n\nLiverpool were dull for most parts but deserve praise for their resilience and the importance of Mac Allister's 97th-minute winner cannot be underestimated in the sense that it took Liverpool level on points with Chelsea and Manchester United, in fourth and fifth.\n\n\"It's one of the biggest robberies I've seen in the Premier League this season,\" said Jamie Carragher on Sky Sports.\n\nFor Slot, who has regularly insisted that Liverpool have been unfortunate on many an occasion this season, there was an acceptable that his side had finally got the rub of the green.\n\n\"My emotions were emotions of happiness and relief because this is the first time I have to do a different post match press conference,\" said Slot.\n\n\"We did not play a good game. We have been on the wrong side of the score after a good performance too many times.\n\n\"We got more than we deserved. A draw would have been a fair result. We needed to be on the right side of things once in a while. It felt we have been lucky.\"\n\nThe first was his disallowed goal that came after Stefan Ortega had made a great save to deny Hugo Ekitike. As Ola Aina tried to clear the ball, it hit Mac Allister and flew into the net. But what would have been a fortuitous goal was chalked off because the ball was deemed to have hit his elbow, which was tight to his body.\n\n\"It hit my back and my elbow. I understand the rule but if you understand football, that goal should have stood,\" Mac Allister told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The first half wasn't good at all; positioning, pressing, intensity. It was not our standard. The second half, I wouldn't say it was good but it was better,\" he added.\n\nMac Allister scores late winner in frantic finish at Forest\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nFor Liverpool, the journey back to Merseyside will be sweet. There really is nothing like a late winner, particularly in extra time of extra time as Slot stated, but the Dutchman will know that his team must improve.\n\nMohamed Salah had an off day and though he has upped his workrate off the ball since returning from the Africa Cup of Nations, he has now gone nine Premier League games without a goal.\n\nAgainst Forest he was replaced by Rio Ngumoha, who put in the cross that led to Mac Allister's disallowed goal, and once again showed exactly why he's so highly rated with an energetic performance.\n\n\"Ngumoha came on and had a bigger impact than Salah,\" was the verdict of BBC pundit Pat Nevin on Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"He absolutely changed the game, this kid,\" said Carragher.\n\nSlot added: \"He has incredible potential, otherwise, at 17 years of age, you don't play as many minutes as he does in the Premier League, let alone at Liverpool.\n\n\"I don't think there is any other 17-year-old who has played as many minutes in the Premier League.\n\n\"That tells you how much of a talent we think he is. He is making progress and that's why you see him playing more and more.\"\n\nNgumoha is yet to start a Premier League game for Liverpool but surely the wait won't be long now.\n\n\"He gets stronger and stronger,\" added Slot. \"Apart from his moment when he had his one-v-one, there were also one or two other moments where he stood his ground.\n\n\"For him to show this already at 17 years of age, it says something about his talent.\n\n\"But as we all know, talent is only the start of his career, you need so many other things. Macca is a great example of mentality and that is something you need to have a career at this level.\"\n\nLiverpool certainly didn't scintillate with their display in the Midlands but they showed the resilience of champions.\n\nAnd there is still plenty of life in their season yet.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Grounded until at least April, NASA’s giant moon rocket is headed back to the hangar this week for more repairs before astronauts climb aboard.\n\nThe space agency said Sunday it’s targeting Tuesday for the slow, four-mile (6.4-kilometer) trek across Kennedy Space Center, weather permitting.\n\nNASA had barely finished a repeat fueling test Thursday, to ensure dangerous hydrogen fuel leaks were plugged, when another problem cropped up.\n\nThis time, the rocket’s helium system malfunctioned, further delaying astronauts’ first trip to the moon in more than half a century.\n\nEngineers had just tamed the hydrogen leaks and settled on a March 6 launch date — already a month late — when the helium issue arose. The helium flow to the rocket's upper stage was disrupted; helium is needed to purge the engines and pressurize the fuel tanks.\n\n“Returning to the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy is required to determine the cause of the issue and fix it,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\nNASA said the quick rollback preps preserve an April launch attempt, but stressed that will depend on how the repairs go. The space agency has only a handful of days any given month to launch the crew of four around the moon and back.\n\nThe three Americans and one Canadian assigned to the Artemis II mission remain on standby in Houston. They will become the first people to fly to the moon since NASA's Apollo program that sent 24 astronauts there from 1968 through 1972.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "Wayne Gretzky is on hand for the men's gold medal game between the United States and Canada on Sunday.\n\nYou would think that it would be obvious that Gretzky, the Chosen One, would be rooting for Canada. Gretzky was born and raised in Canada. He's widely considered the greatest hockey player of all-time. But in recent years, Gretzky has been friendly with President Trump, who has threatened Canada and suggested that it could become America's 51st state.\n\nGretzky was asked who he'll be rooting for on Sunday. He's making it clear he's rooting for Canada.\n\n“I’m a hockey player. I’m a Canadian, a true Canadian. I want Canada 🇨🇦 to win a gold medal. I’ve never wavered from that. I’ve been friends with prime minsters and presidents. Somehow there’s been a little bit more tension than normal. At the end of the day, Canada and the US are like brothers and sisters, they’re gonna fight and argue but eventually they’ll come together. That’s the way I see it,\" he said.\n\nGretzky has faced criticism for his friendship and relationship with President Trump, amid the ongoing U.S.-Canada tensions.\n\nBut while Gretzky has faced criticism, he hasn't backed down.\n\n“People are going to say and believe what they want,” Gretzky said on an episode of the “100% Hockey” podcast co-hosted by Darren Millard and John Shannon. “The bottom line is, I know in my heart I’m Canadian, I’ve stayed Canadian and I’m a Canadian for life.”\n\nGretzky has been booed by some Canadians, which he's glad his late father hasn't been around to see.\n\n“You’ve got to take the good with the bad,” Gretzky said. “I’m glad he didn’t have to see it.”\n\nWhile Gretzky has been friendly with President Trump, he claims he's not really into politics.\n\n“I’m Canadian,” Gretzky said. “I can’t vote in the U.S. because I live in the U.S. and I’m Canadian. I can’t vote in Canada because I don’t live in Canada.\n\n“I’m not into politics. And so I can’t stop the prime minister from saying something. I can’t stop the president from saying something. I just kind of like, well, I’m just a hockey player, simple as that.”",

    "description": "Over and over, the Republicans and former Republicans who gathered just outside Washington this weekend warned that President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress are tearing at the very fabric of ...",
    "fullText": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. (AP) — Over and over, the Republicans and former Republicans who gathered just outside Washington this weekend warned that President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress are tearing at the very fabric of American democracy.\n\nA former congressman described the president's party as an “authoritarian-embracing cult.” A prominent conservative writer said Trumpism is an \"existential threat.\" And a retired Army general, his voice shaking with emotion, cited post-Nazi Germany as a roadmap for the nation's post-Trump recovery.\n\nIt's unclear how many people are listening.\n\nThe main convention hall at the sixth annual Principles First summit on Saturday and Sunday was half empty. About 750 chairs were set up in a room that could have fit thousands, and many were unfilled. Not a single current Republican elected official participated in the two-day program.\n\nThis is what remains of the Grand Old Party’s Never Trump movement, a coalition of Republicans, former Republicans and independents who banded together as Trump consolidated power. They largely remain political exiles — not quite at home among Democrats yet disgusted by how the president has abandoned Republicans' longstanding commitments to free trade and limited government.\n\nJohn McDowell, 69, who was a lifelong Republican before Trump’s emergence, acknowledged that the diminished group had virtually “zero” political clout within his former party.\n\n“It’s just a fact. We’re losing good people,” said McDowell, a former Capitol Hill staffer and county Republican official from San Carlos, California. “The party is becoming more and more MAGA-fied.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson dismissed all the criticism from what she called “a bunch of deranged has-been politicians.”\n\n“The only people who will pay attention to this event are the journalists who are forced to cover it,” she said.\n\nVirtually everyone who gathered at the hotel in National Harbor, Maryland, said they are rooting for Democratic victories in this fall's midterm elections. One of the only Democrats there was Conor Lamb, a former congressman from Pennsylvania who lost his party's primary to John Fetterman four years ago.\n\nDespite dire concerns, there was a slight sense of optimism among the half-empty convention hall and quiet hotel hallways.\n\nSeveral people cheered last week’s Supreme Court decision to strike down Trump’s tariffs, the economic tool he has wielded without congressional approval in his attempt to force friends and foes around the globe to bend to his will. Trump insisted he would implement a new round of tariffs despite the ruling.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a former Trump adviser, highlighted recent AP-NORC polling showing that 1 in 4 Republicans nationwide do not approve of Trump's job performance.\n\n“It’s like any show that’s on TV for a long time — the ratings start to go down. And the ratings are going down,” Christie said. “I am willing to bet you that by next February, this room is going to be twice the size of what it is now. After the midterms, you watch.”\n\nEx-MAGA diehard Rich Logis, wearing a red “I left MAGA hat,” hopes to see “an electoral revolt against MAGA” in the midterms.\n\n“I think there’s a shift in our country right now,\" he said. \"It happens slowly.\"\n\nLogis was promoting support groups for friends and family of Trump loyalists at a table outside the convention hall. Nearby, someone was selling books about how to escape cults.\n\nAt the podium, former Republican Rep. Joe Walsh implored Trump's critics not to downplay the seriousness of the threat the president poses to the nation.\n\n“He’s everything our founders feared. Say it. Believe it,” Walsh said. He said his former party is “an authoritarian-embracing cult\" and \"a threat to everything I love.”\n\nRetired Gen. Mark Hertling, who once commanded the U.S. Army's European forces, said he's “haunted” by allies who ask him “whether American institutions ever can be trusted again.”\n\n“Our nation's institutions have been shaken. Our alliances have been strained. Our credibility has been damaged. And our nation’s values have been cast aside,” Hertling said. He suggested the U.S. should look to the reconstruction of Germany after the defeat of Nazism if it hoped to to restore the damage caused by Trump and his allies.\n\nThe nation's recovery, he said as his voiced cracked, would be something people have to earn over many years.\n\nBill Kristol, who worked in previous Republican administrations and helped found the Weekly Standard magazine, described Trump and his Republican supporters in Congress as “an existential threat” to the nation. But he was also optimistic about the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nKristol said Democrats are “almost certain to win the House,” “could possibly win the Senate,” and have “a good chance to win the presidency” in 2028.\n\nBrittany Martinez, executive director of the host organization Principles First, also tried to cast an optimistic tone, even after describing the many reasons why she couldn't bear to continue her career as a Republican staffer on Capitol Hill.\n\n“I hope that Republicans continue to wake up,” she said. “I do think that those folks exist. And I hope that they exist in greater numbers.”",

    "description": "MOTD pundit Danny Murphy explains why, as well as Arsenal's superior quality in Sunday's north London derby, they exploited Tottenham's tactical weakness too.",
    "fullText": "Arsenal's superior quality ultimately showed in their 4-1 north London derby win, but they were also very clever with the way they exposed Tottenham's tactical weaknesses too.\n\nSpurs' 3-5-2 shape under new boss Igor Tudor, and the fact they did not just sit in, left space for Arsenal to exploit in forward areas on Sunday.\n\nThe Gunners ran away with the game in the end but, in the first half, when it was still in the balance, the area where they had the most attacking edge was down their right-hand side, where Bukayo Saka and Jurrien Timber were dominant.\n\nIt's never easy to stop a team like Arsenal when so many of their players are playing well, but what the Gunners did really well was produce moments of quality or skill in attack when it mattered.\n\nThey looked back to the levels we have seen them perform at for so long this season - this was a great performance by them, not just a brilliant result.\n\nArsenal pass derby test of nerve as title race looks set to go to wire\n\n'Who's going to get this fine?' - Arteta on derby technology delays\n\nEze 'wanted to prove something' as he torments Spurs again\n\nPremier League Review: Do City smell Arsenal blood despite derby win?\n\nTimber is one of the best attacking right-backs in the Premier League, if not the world, and I have seen him cause many teams problems with the way he mixes his runs up - sometimes he supports, sometimes he overlaps and he can make runs inside too. He is an intelligent footballer.\n\nSaka has had a few people question him recently, but against Spurs he was back on it and back to his confident best.\n\nWith the understanding those two have got, it was always going to be difficult to stop them down Arsenal's right but it was even harder for Spurs because they were reactive rather than proactive in dealing with the danger.\n\nAt times Xavi Simons, who was playing as a second striker, was having to run back to the left-back position to help. On other occasions it was Pape Matar Sarr coming over from midfield, or Mickey van de Ven covering from centre-half.\n\nSpurs' system saw Simons and Sarr left to cover long distances to get back and it also meant there was often a mixture of someone who is not used to defending in those areas - as Sarr was when he was left one-on-one with Saka for Arsenal's first goal - and also not being sure who was doing what, and when.\n\nThat's not ideal against any team, let alone one as good as Arsenal, and Mikel Arteta's side started getting more and more joy down that flank, with Timber often having time on the ball to pick his passes - like he did to find Viktor Gyokeres for their second goal.\n\nTottenham battled really well in the first half and, although the game got away from them after the break, it wasn't through any lack of effort.\n\nThey were set up okay too, but I think it did help Arsenal that Spurs were at home and under a new manager because they were expected to have a go rather than just park the bus.\n\nSpurs tried to press Arsenal at times which leaves you open to counter-attacks and also leaves space in behind, which the Gunners are good at exploiting.\n\nIn the second half, Arsenal's quality shone through and Tottenham looked tired - their lack of numbers because of injuries began to show.\n\nStill, what was impressive from Arsenal when they were 2-1 up is that they did not sit back and try to see out time.\n\nInstead, they were quite ruthless and kept coming forward. That's understandable when you think about what happened to them on Wednesday when they were pegged back by Wolves after leading 2-0.\n\nI wondered what would happen if they got in front this time, and they had obviously talked about what they would do differently.\n\nSo, from that point of view, because of the doubts over their mentality after their past couple of results, it was important to see them play so positively.\n\nThe same applies for some of their individual players, as well as the whole team.\n\nAs well as his two goals, Eberechi Eze had a great game overall. I was pleased for him because he has had a few question marks over his form recently, and we know he is a super talent.\n\nWith him playing so well in the central areas as a number 10, Tottenham's midfielders had something else to worry about - and being busy there meant they could not easily help deal with Saka and Timber out wide.\n\nDeclan Rice was making all these runs too, bursting forward to try to make amends for his mistake for Tottenham's equaliser, so there was all sorts going on.\n\nRice is always influential, of course, but he was especially impressive here. Instead of dwelling on his mistake, he used it to focus and bring more energy and clarity to what he was doing.\n\nWhen he dropped into defence after that, he played it simple and quick with his goalkeeper or centre-half - he didn't risk anything again.\n\nBut when he was going the other way, he was trying everything - making runs, getting on the end of knockdowns, bombing forward and occupying defenders.\n\nHe is always totally focused anyway so it is hard to judge exactly how much difference that mistake made to his performance but it felt to me like he actually upped his game, which takes great mental strength.\n\nThere have been times in the past where, when you are playing Arsenal, Saka and Odegaard are the two players you know you need to stop.\n\nTeams would think, if you can condense play in their areas, you can control them - and if it goes over to another part of the pitch, you can cope with it.\n\nOn Sunday, however, it felt like Arsenal were coming from every angle in the end. Eze, especially, was getting on the ball in these pockets of space in front of the Spurs defence.\n\nThat helped Gyokeres too, because it meant there was more room for him as well.\n\nGyokeres had started well anyway, and had a great early chance which he made himself, but this ended up being one of his best games in an Arsenal shirt.\n\nIt probably helped that he had a yard of pace on Radu Dragusin, who is not the quickest defender, but he played on him nicely and it was clever of him to stay on the left side.\n\nI remember watching a lot of Gyokeres' goals for Sporting and he liked to come off that flank a lot, and we have not seen him do it enough this season.\n\nThat might change now and, when he got his first goal, it was like the weight had been lifted off his shoulders.\n\nSome of the Arsenal fans who are not convinced by him are going to be more on his side now he has scored twice against Tottenham, and his goals were top quality too.\n\nI'd say that was one of his best games in an Arsenal shirt and to do it in a north London derby will do him the world of good.\n\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "fullText": "Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare and Sunderland winger Romaine Mundle have become the latest Premier League players to be sent racist abuse on social media on an \"appalling weekend\" when four footballers from the top tier of the English game were targeted.\n\nArokodare and Mundle detailed their experiences on Sunday, a day after Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri and Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana both received racist abuse on Instagram after their sides drew 1-1 at Stamford Bridge.\n\n\"This has been an appalling weekend after four players called out the racist abuse they've received on social media,\" anti-discrimination group Kick It Out said on Sunday evening. \"But the sad fact is, we know it happens regularly.\n\n\"The message from them is loud and clear: action must follow. Players cannot be expected to tolerate this behaviour, and nor should anyone else.\"\n\nWolves said they were \"disgusted\" after Arokodare was sent abuse by \"multiple perpetrators\" following his side's 1-0 loss at Crystal Palace and they condemned the \"abhorrent and unlawful behaviour in the strongest possible terms\".\n\nBoth the Nigeria international and Wolves shared a number of screenshots of private messages the 25-year-old received after the game in which he had a first-half penalty saved, before Evann Guessand scored an injury-time Palace winner.\n\n\"It's still unbelievable to me that we're playing in a time where people have so much freedom to communicate such racism without any consequences,\" wrote Arokodare on his Instagram story.\n\n\"These individuals should have no place in our game and collectively we have to take action to punish everyone who taints the sport like this, no matter who they are.\"\n\nIn a statement, Wolves added: \"Tolu has our full and unwavering support. No player should be subjected to such hatred simply for doing their job.\n\n\"We stand firmly alongside him, and alongside all footballers who are forced to endure this abuse from anonymous accounts acting with apparent impunity.\n\nSunderland said they are \"appalled by the vile\" abuse Mundle received after his substitute appearance in the 3-1 home defeat by Fulham.\n\nThey said: \"The abhorrent behaviour displayed by multiple individuals is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the club under any circumstances.\n\n\"These individuals do not represent Sunderland AFC, our values, or our community - and they are not welcome on Wearside.\"\n\nThe Sunderland Echo reported the 22-year-old English forward has since deleted his Instagram account.\n\nIn February 2025 while playing in the Championship for the Black Cats, Mundle shared a discriminatory post sent to him on his Instagram account.\n\nWolves and Sunderland said they are working with the relevant authorities and online platforms to identify those responsible.\n\nThe Premier League condemned the abuse and said there are \"serious consequences for anybody found guilty of discrimination and we will offer our full support with their investigations\", which can include club bans and legal prosecution.\n\nOn Saturday, Frenchman Fofana wrote: \"2026, it's still the same thing, nothing changes. These people are never punished.\n\n\"You create big campaigns against racism, but nobody actually does anything.\"\n\nTunisia international Mejbri, 23, called on people to \"educate yourself and your kids\".\n\nThese latest incidences of racist abuse towards players follow the alleged racial abuse of Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr during last week's Champions League knockout round play-off tie at Benfica, which Uefa is investigating.\n\nIn a statement earlier on Sunday, Kick It Out said: \"Players are standing up to discrimination, and we've had record reports to Kick It Out from across football this season, but we recognise the frustration in how it continues to fester online.\n\n\"Words matter, but actions are more important. Football is working together to tackle this issue alongside the UK Football Policing Unit and Ofcom, but social media companies must do more to offer protections to players and help improve accountability when incidents occur.\n\n\"Those who face this disgusting abuse must always be the priority.\"\n\nResponding to the Fofana and Mejbri abuse, a spokesperson for Meta told BBC Sport: \"No-one should be subjected to racist abuse, and we remove this content when we find it.\n\n\"No one thing will stop racist behaviour overnight, but we'll continue working to protect our community from abuse and co-operate with police investigations.\"\n\nLast November, a BBC investigation found more than 2,000 extremely abusive social media posts - including death and rape threats - were sent about managers and players in the Premier League and Women's Super League in a single weekend.\n\nThe season-opening Premier League game between Liverpool and Bournemouth last August was stopped in the first half after then-Cherries forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by someone in the Anfield crowd.\n\nA Liverpool man has denied the abuse and his trial is scheduled to take place in April.\n\nIn January, Newcastle United said they had contacted the police after midfielder Joe Willock was the subject of \"disgusting\" racial abuse and \"deeply disturbing threats\" on social media.\n\nTottenham forward Mathys Tel was also the subject of racist abuse on social media after being one of two Spurs players to miss in their Super Cup penalty shootout defeat by Paris St-Germain in August.\n\nEngland defender Jess Carter was another target of racist abuse during Euro 2025 in July.\n\nAnd England internationals Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were all subjected to racism in the aftermath of the Euro 2020 final, which the Three Lions lost to Italy in a penalty shootout.\n\nLatest Wolves news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Wolves - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "IOC president Kirsty Coventry says the athletes \"showed us that the Olympic Games are a place for everyone\" as she closes this year's Winter Games.",
    "fullText": "The Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics have officially ended following the closing ceremony in northern Italy.\n\nIt took place at Verona Olympic Arena, despite none of the sporting events happening in the city, which is 75 miles from Milan.\n\nAfter beginning with a tribute to classic Italian opera, flagbearers representing the 92 competing nations entered the stadium through large props from Aida and accompanied by a tribute to Italian film music.\n\nThe 'Drop of Fire' – the Olympic flame carried in a small glass vessel – was brought into the ancient arena to light up the rings before the parade of athletes.\n\nWhile athletes are supposed to come in all mixed together, here they were still largely in national groups.\n\nThe final medals from Milan-Cortina 2026 were awarded in the women's and men's 50km mass start cross-country skiing events, before a tribute to the Games volunteers.\n\nThe ceremony finished with performances from popular Italian musicians Major Lazer and singer-songwriter Achille Lauro.\n\nIn her speech to close the Games, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Kirsty Coventry said: \"You have been incredible – every one of you. Brave. Fearless. Full of heart and passion. You left it all on the snow and ice.\n\n\"Two unforgettable weeks, living every moment to the fullest. You gave everything – and you shared it with all of us.\n\n\"This is the true Olympic spirit: competing, embracing, lifting each other up, whatever the result. You showed us what excellence, respect, and friendship look like in a world that sometimes forgets these values.\n\n\"You showed us that the Olympic Games are a place for everyone. A place where sport brings us together.\"\n\nIt ended a Games which saw 116 medal events, and historic sporting success for several of the competing nations – including Great Britain.\n\nTeam GB won five medals, including three golds, to finish 15th in the table. Britain has never previously won more than one gold at a Games before.\n\nMatt Weston, the male flagbearer, won two golds in skeleton – the men's event and the team competition with Tabby Stoeker.\n\nThe female GB flagbearer was Charlotte Bankes, who won gold in the team snowboard cross with Huw Nightingale; it was the first Olympic event on snow won by British athletes.\n\nTeam GB also won silver in the men's curling, while Zoe Atkin claimed bronze in women's ski halfpipe on the final day.\n\nBrazil's Lucas Pinheiro Braathen took the men's giant slalom title to register a first Winter Olympic gold won by a South American nation.\n\nWhy 2026 marks a Winter Olympic turning point for Team GB\n\nWeird and wonderful stories from the Winter Olympics\n\nUSA win men's Olympic ice hockey gold for first time in 46 years\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nGeorgia earned their first Winter Olympic medal with silver in pairs figure skating, while Spain collected their first gold medal for 54 years in the men's ski mountaineering. Benin, Guinea-Bissau and United Arab Emirates competed in their first Winter Games.\n\nFor hosts Italy, Milan-Cortina marked their best Winter Games with 10 golds among 30 medals to put them fourth in the table.\n\nNorway topped the medals table for the fourth successive Games. They collected 18 medals, including six for Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo, the king of cross-country skiing.\n\nHad Klaebo, who set a record for the most golds won by an individual athlete at a single Games, competed as a nation on his own, he would have been ninth in the medal table. Fittingly, his sixth gold - in the men's 50km cross-country skiing - was presented at the closing ceremony as the final medal awarded at the Games.\n\nThe oldest individual medallist was Elana Meyers Taylor of the United States, who broke the Games record by winning monobob gold, aged 41.\n\nSkiing great Lindsey Vonn saw her Olympic career end with a broken leg.\n\nThe Games also had controversial moments.\n\nUkraine's Vladyslav Heraskevych wished to compete in the men's skeleton while wearing a remembrance helmet featuring artwork depicting athletes killed during the Russian invasion of his country.\n\nBut the IOC said this contravened Games rules and, after Heraskevych refused to back down, disqualified him from competing.\n\nThere was also a silver medal, in men's ski mountaineering, for Russian athlete Nikita Filippov. He competed as an Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) because Russia were banned from the Games because of their aggression in Ukraine.\n\nFilippov, along with other AIN competitors, was allowed to take part in the closing ceremony having been banned from the opening event.\n\nMen's curling gold medallists Canada had their campaign dogged by allegations of cheating.\n\nThe ceremony included the handover of the Olympic flag to the delegation representing the French Alps, which will host the next Winter Games in 2030.\n\nThe presidents of the two French regions to host the Games, Renaud Muselier and Fabrice Pannekoucke, enthusiastically accepted the flag from Coventry.\n\nThere was a performance of the sixth verse of La Marseillaise, the French national anthem, as it was deemed to be more universal and less patriotic. The arrangement changed throughout into a more contemporary style with an electronic base.\n\nAs well as a video showcasing the Alps, there was also a performance by 25 musicians and 24 athletes – the first time Olympians have featured in the artistic elements of the closing ceremony.\n\nRelive the 2026 Winter Olympics on BBC iPlayer (UK only)",

    "description": "After a defeat for Celtic and surprise draw for Rangers, where does the latest weekend of drama leave the Scottish Premiership title race?",
    "fullText": "\"The two teams from Glasgow have buckled under the pressure.\"\n\nThat was the assessment of former Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart after the Scottish Premiership title race delivered yet another weekend of high drama.\n\nWith Rangers held to a 2-2 draw at bottom club Livingston and defending champions Celtic beaten at home by Hibernian on Sunday, Hearts boss Derek McInnes must have been watching on with a big grin.\n\nHaving eked out a narrow win over Falkirk 24 hours earlier his side now lead Rangers by four points and Celtic - who have played a game fewer than the teams above them - by six with 10 matches left.\n\nThe other big winners over the weekend were fourth-placed Motherwell, with their 5-0 thumping of St Mirren.\n\nJens Berthel Askou's side also have a game in hand on the top two, trailing Hearts by 10 points.\n\nThey have only conceded three goals in their past 15 matches and lost once in 19, all while playing the most expansive football in the top flight.\n\n\"Motherwell win emphatically, Hearts win as well and that applies pressure,\" Stewart said.\n\n\"The two teams from Glasgow have buckled under the pressure.\n\n\"It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Motherwell could finish above Celtic or Rangers, maybe both of them.\n\n\"Celtic and Rangers could be third and fourth in the table.\"\n\nNext weekend follows a similar pattern as Hearts and Motherwell play at home on Saturday - against Aberdeen and Dundee United respectively - before Rangers host Celtic in the derby on Sunday.\n\nMotherwell could be just one point behind Celtic by then, while Hearts could be seven clear of Rangers and nine above Martin O'Neill's side.\n\n\"It looks like Hearts are the team that can only throw it away,\" former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner said. \"They are in an unbelievable position.\"\n\nStewart added: \"Everything is on the line. The permutations from all these games are incredible. That's what makes this season so exciting.\"\n\nPodcast: Reaction to day of title drama as Celtic lose & Rangers draw\n\nRangers scramble draw at 10-man Livingston\n\nHibs stun Celtic with late Andrews winner\n\nIt is no secret things are far from rosy at Parkhead, with fan protests during almost every home match.\n\nO'Neill is in charge until the end of the season - his second interim spell in this chaotic campaign - and cracks are starting to appear despite the Northern Irishman's legendary status at the club.\n\nSupporters continue to demand boardroom change, there are obvious holes in O'Neill's squad and they have now lost seven league matches. That's as many as they lost in the previous two seasons combined.\n\nCeltic fell behind to Felix Passlack's header and rallied to equalise through Benjamin Nygren's 18th goal of the season, but went down to 10 men when centre-back Auston Trusty was sent off for violent conduct.\n\nKai Andrews fired in a late winner for Hibs, making it successive defeats for Celtic after Thursday's Europa League reverse against Stuttgart.\n\n\"It's a setback, that's all it is,\" O'Neill said. \"We're still in the race.\n\n\"I thought we were absolutely terrific. The players put heart and soul into the game. No complaints on that side whatsoever.\n\n\"We've been chasing for months now. There's not much room for error but we can still fight back. The players are disappointed but it's not over.\"\n\nDespite O'Neill's defence of his players, others were less complimentary.\n\n\"It all changed with Trusty's sending off,\" Bonner said. \"Hibs handled the game very well after that.\n\n\"Celtic couldn't get any momentum and it's a brilliant goal from Kai Andrews. Celtic didn't create anything. They ran out of luck.\"\n\nO'Neill brought in Tomas Cvancara, Junior Adamu and Joel Mvuka to bolster his attacking options in January, but Adamu was an unused substitute against Hibs and Mvuka wasn't in the matchday squad.\n\n\"Without doubt, there is a lack of cutting edge at Celtic,\" Stewart said.\n\n\"What's up with Adamu? They need a goal and they put on [Daizen] Maeda, who is nowhere near the levels he was at before.\"\n\nWhile some would have tipped Hibs to get a result at Celtic Park, Rangers were expected to continue their excellent recent form at Livingston, who have won only once in the Premiership all season.\n\nHowever, Marvin Bartley's side profited from two set-pieces to take a two-goal lead.\n\nGoalkeeper Jerome Prior made a string of superb saves and there were several last-ditch challenges as the West Lothian outfit kept Rangers at bay.\n\nBut Cristian Montano's sending off on the hour mark sparked a Rangers onslaught and they drew level through Emmanuel Fernandez's strike and Mikey Moore's header.\n\nThere was late controversy too as Moore was wiped out by Cammy Kerr when through on goal.\n\nReferee Ryan Lee gave no foul and video assistant referee David Dickinson ruled the incident to be outside the box and not denying a goalscoring opportunity.\n\n\"It had a bit of everything,\" former Rangers midfielder Kevin Thomson said.\n\n\"Livingston were terrific. Marvin Bartley will be delighted - he would have taken a point before the game.\n\n\"For Rangers - too much huffing and puffing, they lacked a little bit in the final third.\"\n\nHead coach Danny Rohl was baffled his side were not given the chance to take all three points from the penalty spot.\n\n\"I can't understand when you see the replay and it's a clear foul, then the decision. In my view it was on the line and it's a penalty,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a clear foul. Mikey said to me and you see on the replay. It's a pen but we have to move forward.\"\n\nWith next Sunday's Old Firm derby looming large, Rohl is relishing the run-in.\n\n\"We showed again our comeback character,\" he said. \"Ten games to go and it is an exciting race.\n\n\"We are disappointed but we go again. We have to carry on. We cannot think too much about the past and I totally believe, the players believe, the club believe and the supporters believe we can do it.\n\n\"We showed against Hearts that we can beat top of the league. Next week we have the next challenge. We will hunt again and again.\"",

    "fullText": "McDonald’s Big Arch burger is rumored to finally make its way to the U.S. after appearing on overseas menus.\n\nThe burger is described as two Quarter Pounder patties, three slices of white cheddar, two types of onions, and a new Big Arch sauce.\n\nFans in the comments are hyped to try it, with reports pointing to an early March rollout.\n\nSomething very large may be heading to McDonald's menus in the U.S., and the internet has already started planning accordingly.\n\nFood blogger Snackolator recently posted about a rumored new burger called the Big Arch, describing it as a stacked situation with two Quarter Pounder patties, slivered onions, crispy onions, three slices of white cheddar, and an all-new Big Arch sauce. The comment section is already sold (and likely drooling on their screens). \"I've been eyeing this one! Happy is finally coming!\" one person wrote, while another skipped straight to logistics with a simple \"Let's go.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time the Big Arch has popped up, though. McDonald's had already been testing a larger-format burger in three international markets as far back as 2024, including Portugal and Canada. Since then, it's shown up on menus overseas—and in the U.K., it's not even a test anymore. It's a permanent item.\n\nWhich might explain why some people seem a little too ready for it to land here. \"Just what I been waiting for!! 😋” one commenter said, while someone else admitted, \"I'm embarrassed by how excited I am.\"\n\nAs for whether it's actually headed stateside soon, Snackolator claims a March 3 drop. And judging by the replies, at least a few people already know exactly what they're doing if it shows up. My advice? Wear a dark shirt and maybe bring some extra napkins from home.\n\nInsanely Easy Weeknight Dinners To Try This Week\n\n29 Insanely Delicious Vodka Cocktails",

Earlier this month, Eddie Bauer LLC voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement with secured lenders.\n\nA press release about the development said the company planned to “conduct liquidation sales at its stores while continuing to pursue an ongoing sale process.” Storefronts in the United States and Canada will continue operating for now, and the company said it may “depart from a full wind down of operations” if there is a sale.\n\nCatalyst Brands CEO Marc Rosen said the company has faced supply chain issues, declining sales and other challenges.\n\n“Over the past year, these challenges have been exacerbated by various headwinds, including increased costs of doing business due to inflation, ongoing tariff uncertainty, and other factors,” Rosen said. “While the leadership team at Catalyst was able to make significant strides in the brand, including rapid improvements in product development and marketing, those changes could not be implemented fast enough to fully address the challenges created over several years.”\n\nOnline operations and wholesale will continue, the press release said, as it is handled by a separate LLC.

    "description": "Mexican drug lord Nemesio Oseguera, commonly known as 'El Mencho,' infamous for the bloody trail of bodies he left behind in battles with government",
    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Mexican drug lord Nemesio Oseguera, commonly known as 'El Mencho,' infamous for the bloody trail of bodies he left behind in battles with government forces and rival gangs, died in a military raid on Sunday.\n\nAn ex-police officer, Oseguera, 60, was the shadowy leader ‌of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), an international criminal enterprise widely viewed as one of Mexico's most powerful.\n\nOver a relatively short period of time, Oseguera masterminded ‌the CJNG's emergence as a criminal empire rivaling his former allies in the Sinaloa Cartel. He managed to evade arrest for years despite a $15 million bounty from the U.S. for information leading to his arrest or ​capture.\n\nCJNG has been blamed for smuggling vast quantities of drugs into the U.S., including the synthetic opioid fentanyl, which has been linked to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths in recent years.\n\n\"Apart from the heads of the Sinaloa cartel, 'El Mencho' has been the biggest prize for many, many years,\" said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a security expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"And it’s really stunning, just like the heads of the Sinaloa cartel, how long he managed to evade U.S. and Mexican law enforcement gunning for him.”\n\nArguably Mexico's most influential crime boss after captured ‌kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, now in a U.S. prison, Oseguera diversified ⁠into rackets such as stolen fuel, forced labor and human trafficking.\n\nBut unlike Guzman, who became a media celebrity, El Mencho preferred to remain in relative obscurity. He achieved notoriety for expletive-laden recordings leaked on social media in which he threatened enemies and officials.\n\nOseguera was also known ⁠for evading capture in spectacular fashion. In May 2015, as Mexican forces closed in on him, his tipped-off henchmen shot down a military helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade to give their boss time to escape.\n\nTargets of his hit men were rarely so lucky. His gang routinely employed beheadings and other gory means of intimidation.\n\nIn one six-week period in 2015, the gang killed two dozen police in ​western ​Mexico as a warning to authorities.\n\nIn 2020, Mexico City's then chief of police Omar Garcia Harfuch survived ​an assassination attempt that killed two of his bodyguards in an ‌attack authorities blamed on the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Harfuch is now the country's security chief and helped oversee the operation against Oseguera.\n\nOseguera was born in 1966 in a poor village in the mountains of the rugged and notoriously lawless western state of Michoacan. There, cultivation of opium poppies and marijuana have competed with avocado production for decades.\n\nAs a boy, he worked the fields, and later went to seek his fortune in the U.S., where prosecutors said he got into the heroin trade. After a few years, he was arrested and served time in a U.S. prison.\n\nHe was deported back to Mexico, where he joined the police before entering the Milenio Cartel, a satellite of the Sinaloa Cartel. Eventually, he ‌became a top enforcer after stints as a sicario, or cartel assassin.\n\nAfter a failed attempt at taking ​over the Milenio Cartel, he struck out alone, declared war on Sinaloa, and founded the CJNG in alliance ​with a local gang of money launderers.\n\nThe cartel is named for the western ​state of Jalisco, home to one of Mexico's largest cities, Guadalajara.\n\nThe CJNG mixed Sinaloa-style drug trafficking and community outreach with the ultra-violent methods ‌of the Zetas Cartel, a gang that used paramilitary tactics to diversify ​into criminal enterprises such as extortion and ​kidnapping.\n\nFor years, Oseguera paid off police to cover his back as he operated with near-total impunity inside Jalisco. He also sought political protection.\n\n\"El Mencho's Jalisco New Generation Cartel was one of the biggest buyers of politicians and political campaigns, which has given it an enormous social base,\" said Edgardo Buscaglia, an organized crime expert at ​Columbia University.\n\nNoting El Mencho's ability to win public support, ‌Buscaglia pointed to footage broadcast during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic of people lining up for CJNG-stamped food packages handed out by cartel gunmen, not government ​workers, to help cushion the economic blow of lockdowns.\n\n\"Compared to the Mexican government,\" said Buscaglia, \"he was the least bad option.\"",
