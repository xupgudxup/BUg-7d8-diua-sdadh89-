    "fullText": "CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (WCIA) – Illinois men’s basketball will be without its best defender for multiple weeks, a challenge which looms largest in matchups which were already daunting – like Purdue, Nebraska and Michigan State.\n\nHowever, the Illini won’t have it easy in their first Boswell-less outing unless someone steps up to guard Maryland’s David Coit.\n\nCoit, the reigning Big Ten Player of the Week, is coming off a 43-point performance on Sunday as the Terrapins beat Penn State to pick up their first Big Ten win of the season. Last Tuesday, he scored 30 points. He posted 31 against Michigan and scored 41 in a non-conference game.\n\nIllinois head coach Brad Underwood says it will take a full team effort to slow down the Maryland senior.\n\n“[The] guy is on a heater,” Underwood said. “He’s veteran. He’s coming off a 43-point game, he had 30 in a half. He made nine [three-pointers.] He’s the ultimate green light. People have thrown a lot at him and he’s found ways to to get baskets and yet there’s more to Maryland than just him.”\n\nUnderwood says Maryland presents challenges in its ability to get to the free throw line, offensive rebounding and an ability to mix-up defensive looks.\n\nIllinois will put its seven-game winning streak on the line on Wednesday and seek to turn the tide on recent history between these two programs. Maryland has won 12 of the last 15 meetings dating back to 2016.\n\nMaryland enters Wednesday’s contest 8-10 overall on the year and 1-6 in conference play. The game is scheduled to tip-off at 6 p.m. on Big Ten Network.",

    "fullText": "A PGA Tour veteran has sent a jolt through the golf world with a candid take on LIV Golf’s ripple effect. While many criticize LIV Golf and the professionals who play in it, Tom Hoge doesn’t. The reason – the Saudi-backed league has helped him financially in a unique way.\n\n“Well, I would say personally speaking, I’m probably the player that’s benefited absolutely the most from LIV coming along. I played well in 2022 right before LIV got going, which brought an offer from LIV, so I went down that road for a little bit. But, sticking with the PGA Tour and the changes they made, I’ve played in every signature event since they were established. And I would say nobody’s benefited more financially than I have cuz I’ve played well in some of those events and been in all of them,” Tom Hoge revealed in conversation with Trey Wingo.\n\n“So, it’s been fantastic for me. So, I shouldn’t be the guy here, complaining about any of that coming along. But it is tough for the game of golf that there’s a lot of great players that are on LIV that we’re not competing with against every week like we were.”\n\nThe 36-year-old PGA Tour professional from Statesville, North Carolina, stated that LIV’s inception has brought him financial benefits. However, he is not the only one. Many professionals on the PGA Tour have benefited indirectly from LIV’s inception. As former CEO Greg Norman highlighted, the Saudi-backed league disrupted the market, which was essential to restoring balance.\n\nBefore LIV’s arrival, the prize pools for PGA Tour events weren’t that large. And there weren’t many additional benefits that athletes enjoy today. For instance, the PGA Tour started its for-profit entity and offered equity stakes to golfers. The standard prize pool on the PGA Tour was around $8-$9 million. Then came LIV Golf, offering $20-$25 million per event. This put pressure on the PGA Tour to pay golfers more.\n\nThus, the PGA Tour started elevating events in 2023, which officially became the Signature Events in 2024. These events feature higher prize money of around $20 million or more.\n\nSince Tom Hoge performed well in 2022, he has been eligible to play Signature Events until now. In 2025, too, he was eligible for and played all Signature Events. He posted strong results in many of them, including T8 at The Sentry ($550,000), T3 at THE PLAYERS Championship ($1,325,000), T5 at Valero Texas Open ($304,000), T14 at the Masters ($336,000), and T7 at the Memorial ($603,200). These finishes underscore his claim of major financial gains from post-LIV Tour upgrades.\n\nIn 2024, he also finished strongly at many events. Hoge received $642,500 at the 2024 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, $646,000 at the 2024 The Genesis Invitational, $389,666 at the 2024 Arnold Palmer Invitational, and $1,160,000 at the Travelers Championship. This shows that a large part of his official money came from the Signature events in both 2024 and 2025.\n\nWhile he enjoys the financial benefits, he also misses playing with some of the best golfers. Playing against strong competitors makes an athlete strong. Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau, Joaquin Niemann, and Patrick Reed are some of the many gold golfers playing LIV Golf. Their exclusion from PGA Tour events influences the field’s strength, which also impacts the OWGR points.\n\nAlthough Tom Hoge is happy with almost every change the PGA Tour has gone through after LIV’s inception, he dislikes one thing that may come from 2027.\n\nTiger Woods’s Future Competition Committee (FCC) planned for a redesigned schedule from 2027. The new schedule will likely feature fewer events and may start in February instead of January. Woods and the FCC aim to mitigate viewership competition from the NFL in January. CEO Brian Rolapp supports this view and the redesigned schedule. However, Tom Hoge doesn’t.\n\nHoge told Golf Channel the pre-LIV model worked well. It allowed players to pick events freely with equal stature throughout the season. He praised past flexibility where stars like Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson elevated chosen events without a rigid top-heavy structure. If the redesigned schedule reduces the number of events, it will take away this flexibility. Therefore, Hoge opposed a reduced schedule. Instead, he valued the ability to take a month off or play four straight weeks.\n\nTom Hoge’s comments highlight how LIV Golf’s arrival reshaped his financial outlook while also changing the competitive feel of the PGA Tour. As golf moves toward another possible shift, his perspective reflects both gratitude for new opportunities and concern for what may be lost.\n\nThe post Greg Norman Was Right All Along as PGA Tour Champ Owns Up to Benefiting from LIV Golf appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "Aryna Sabalenka and a near-flawless Coco Gauff surged into the Australian Open third round on Wednesday ahead of top-ranked Carlos Alcaraz resuming his quest for tennis history.\n\nThree-time finalist Daniil Medvedev also stayed alive, but he needed four sets to keep his Grand Slam dream on track at a cooler and overcast Melbourne Park after days of hot weather.\n\nFour-time major winner Sabalenka raced 5-0 clear of qualifier Bai Zhuoxuan, ranked a lowly 702, on Rod Laver Arena before wobbling to give the Chinese player a glimmer of hope.\n\nBut the top seed quickly snuffed it out to race home 6-3, 6-1 and set up a clash next with Russian-born Anastasia Potapova, now representing Austria, who dispatched 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu.\n\n\"Super-happy to close the (first) set, it gives me confidence that my game is there, my focus is there,\" said Sabalenka, who is bidding for a third Australian Open title in four years.\n\n\"Step by step. Super-happy with my win. There is always a little gap to improve.\"\n\nSabalenka has dropped just nine games so far as she looks to make amends for her upset in last year's final to Madison Keys.\n\nThird seed Gauff was equally clinical against Serbia's Olga Danilovic, who ended Venus Williams' tournament in round one.\n\nThe two-time major winner took just 78 minutes to get the job done, racing home 6-2, 6-2 on Margaret Court Arena.\n\nIt set up a showdown next against fellow American Hailey Baptiste, ranked 70, who downed home hope Storm Hunter in straight sets.\n\n\"Near perfect,\" said Gauff, whose best performance in Melbourne was a semi-final in 2024.\n\nUkrainian 12th seed Elina Svitolina, Turkish prospect Zeynep Sonmez and in-form Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko also won on day four, all sweeping past their opponents in straight sets.\n\nThe unpredictable Medvedev, runner-up in 2021, 2022 and 2024, is trying to keep his emotions in check this year and was on his best behaviour against Frenchman Quentin Halys.\n\nHe lost a tight first set but the result was never in doubt as he surged to the finish line 6-7 (9/11), 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.\n\n\"It was a very tough match, happy I managed to fight,\" said the Russian, who faces Fabian Marozsan of Hungary next.\n\nAmerican Tommy Paul and Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo also safely negotiated the second round.\n\nAlcaraz started his bid for a career Grand Slam with a three-set defeat of home hope Adam Walton and faces hard-hitting German Yannick Hanfmann later Wednesday.\n\nThe Spanish superstar Alcaraz already has six major titles aged 22 but success on the Melbourne Park hardcourts remains a glaring hole in his resume.\n\nHe has not made it past the quarter-finals in four trips to Australia.\n\nIf he does complete the career Grand Slam of all four majors he will be the youngest man to do it.\n\n\"I just really want to perform better than I did previous years,\" said Alcaraz.\n\nAlexander Zverev is in action in an evening match against France's Alexandre Muller, the latest challenge in the German's decade-long quest for a first Grand Slam title.\n\nThe world number three, runner-up last year to Jannik Sinner, dropped a set in his opening clash but said it was good to be stretched early in the tournament.\n\n\"It's a positive for sure,\" he said.\n\nHome hopes dominate the evening action on centre court with sixth seed Alex de Minaur facing Serbia's Hamad Medjedovic before Priscilla Hon meets American Iva Jovic.",

    "title": "The two Chelsea omens which excite Liam Rosenior ahead of Champions League bow",
    "description": "Mid-season changes have reaped glorious rewards for the Blues in previous years - could it happen again?",
    "fullText": "As befuddling as Chelsea’s parting with Enzo Maresca seemed when the statement arrived on New Year’s Day, there’s something about mid-season changes at Stamford Bridge which should give fans, and new boss Liam Rosenior, cause for dreamy enthusiasm.\n\nIn fact, the revolving door of the head coach hotseat, that unshakable new manager bounce, has given Chelsea their most glorious moments on the European stage. Five years ago, it was Thomas Tuchel who replaced Frank Lampard in January and, amid the silent hum of the Covid era, guided the Blues to an improbable second Champions League title in Porto.\n\nBefore that, it was 2012, when Roberto Di Matteo galvanised an ageing squad for a series of dramatic nights under the lights to, against all odds, capture that long-awaited first Champions League trophy. That year, the choice to replace Andre Villas-Boas didn’t come until February but the remarkable turnaround in mood, and obviously results, was unambiguous.\n\nOf course, there is some way to go before Chelsea fans can start plotting their route to Budapest in May. But the omens and the narrative are clear as day. And they are not lost on Rosenior, ahead of his debut in the competition on Wednesday night against Cypriot side Pafos.\n\n“Hopefully third time lucky!” he remarked, before the inevitable dose of reality. “You're not lucky to win a Champions League.\n\n“I've said to the players, if we focus on each game, not think too far ahead, perform as well as we possibly can, I never limit the ambitions of my group, no matter what group I'm working with.\n\n“But those games and those trophies don't exist if you don't do the job now. We have to focus on this game and hopefully another three points puts us closer to that target.”\n\nRosenior can take plenty of solace from not only Chelsea’s impressive home results in Europe this season – wins against Barcelona, Ajax and Benfica – but also his own impressive start to 2025-26 on the continent.\n\nAs Strasbourg boss, he guided the French side to top spot in the Europa Conference League table, winning five and drawing one of their six games; one of only two unbeaten teams in that competition. Yet now, focus is on the top-tier.\n\n“I think your dream is whether you're a player or a coach or a manager is to be at the very top of the game – the Champions League is a signal of that,” he noted.\n\n“It's not about me. It's not about me or my ambitions. I'm proud to be here, like I've said before. My focus is on winning the game. My focus is on being successful here. So, I'm preparing the game like we would for any game, to make sure we put in the best performance, to give us the best chance of winning the game.”\n\nRosenior’s men could be without star midfielder Enzo Fernandez, who has been struck down by illness. Tosin Adarabioyo is also out but Estevao, Malo Gusto and Jamie Gittens are back in contention.\n\nMuch was made when the schedule was concocted back in September of how the game against Pafos – who have performed admirably on their Champions League debut, with one win, three draws and two losses from their six games – would set the scene for a poignant return to west London for David Luiz, twice of this parish. Yet the 38-year-old Brazilian defender sustained an injury over the weekend and is a doubt for Wednesday’s game.\n\nLuiz was instrumental in 2012, scoring a penalty in the final shoot-out win against Bayern Munich. That mid-season change worked, but some have obviously failed: Frank Lampard’s caretaker spell in 2023 saw Chelsea knocked out to Real Madrid in the quarter-finals, while Guus Hiddink’s two temporary spells in 2009 and 2016 resulted in a semi-final (that Barcelona game) and last-16 exits.\n\nPhase one is clear, though. A win on Wednesday – and a positive result at Napoli next week – could see Chelsea through in the top-eight, without the added hassle of a February play-off match. For Rosenior, someone who’s made no secret of craving any minute on the practice pitch, it would be a massive early tick in his tenure.\n\n“It would be optimal,” he said of a top-eight finish. “It would be great. Especially when you're a new manager coming in, you want those training days so you can imprint a little bit more.\n\n“But we need to go out and perform really, really well and not think too much about how important it is to miss out on games. The most important thing is qualifying.”",

    "description": "The Lakers overcame a 16-point deficit to notch one of their most significant wins of the season, taking down the Nuggets.",
    "fullText": "The first time chants of “Let’s go, La-kers” rang out in Ball Arena, Denver’s rowdy home crowd booed the unwelcome slogan into silence. Minutes later when the game ended, there weren’t enough home fans left to quiet the purple and gold faithful.\n\nThe Lakers overcame a 16-point deficit in the third quarter to notch one of their most significant wins of the season, taking down the Denver Nuggets 115-107 on Tuesday. Luka Doncic recorded his fifth triple-double of the season with 38 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists while LeBron James had 19 points, nine rebounds and eight assists.\n\nDespite losing center Deandre Ayton to a left eye injury in the second quarter, the Lakers still dominated the shorthanded Nuggets in the paint, outrebounding Denver 51-31. The Nuggets were playing without star center Nikola Jokic (knee) and backup center Jonas Valanciunas (calf).\n\nThe Lakers (26-16) slowly are returning to full health as guard Austin Reaves’ calf injury is “progressing well,” coach JJ Redick said before the game, and they Lakrs hope he could play on the eight-game trip that will stretch until Feb. 3. Reaves is approaching the four-week point after aggravating his calf injury on Christmas Day.\n\nFor the first time since the injury, Reaves went on a trip with the team. He blended seamlessly into the bench group, wearing head-to-toe black next to the coaches.\n\nOn the other bench, Denver’s injured superstar was dressed in a forest green suit. Jokic, the Nuggets' two-time most valuable player, has been sidelined because of a knee injury since Dec. 30. As significant as the Lakers’ injuries have been with the team having all 14 of its standard contract players available for only two games this season, the Nuggets’ problems could be even worse.\n\nThree members of the Nuggets’ season-opening starting rotation were sidelined Tuesday. Starting guard Christian Braun has been out since injuring an ankle Nov. 12 and Cameron Johnson has missed 15 games because of a knee injury. Valanciunas, who has missed the last 11 games, sat next to Jokic.\n\nDenver (29-15) still had no problem controlling the first half, finishing the second quarter on a 14-3 run to claim a 14-point lead. Jamal Murray drained a three-pointer from almost three-quarters court at the buzzer to punctuate a chaotic final 35 seconds that included Doncic’s 13th technical foul of the season and an 8-0 run for the Nuggets.\n\nMurray, who finished with 28 points and 11 assists, is angling for his first All-Star appearance. If coaches select the 28-year-old guard as a reserve, it would be the first time in Jokic’s career that he had a teammate named to the All-Star team.\n\nDoncic, who was named a starter for next month’s midseason showcase Monday, showed why he led the league in fan voting. He had nine points and four assists in the third quarter as the Lakers trimmed a 16-point deficit to two entering the fourth quarter. Doncic scored or assisted on 11 unanswered Lakers points.\n\nAfter Doncic’s third-quarter domination, James tagged in and scored five consecutive points to end the quarter. He assisted on a basket by Drew Timme on the Lakers’ opening possession of the fourth quarter that tied the score 88-88.\n\nThe Lakers took the lead for good with a 16-0 run, holding the Nuggets scoreless for more than 6½ minutes. Marcus Smart scored 11 of his 15 points during the run, while Denver missed nine consecutive shots.\n\nWhile Doncic will return to the All-Star stage next month at Intuit Dome, James was not named a starter for the first time in 21 years. He will have to wait for a vote from coaches or a special selection from NBA commissioner Adam Silver to earn his 22nd All-Star honor.\n\n“Given the missed games early, wasn't surprised,” Redick said, referring to James missing the first 14 games because of sciatica. “I believe he'll be in the All-Star game.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

For a moment, it felt like Los Angeles might steal one.\n\nThen Chicago slammed the door shut with a 13-0 run, featuring five different scorers, showing the kind of balanced attack that makes this Bulls team dangerous when they're clicking.\n\nThe Clippers were already without Kawhi Leonard, who was sent home from the road trip with a left knee contusion and has now missed three straight.\n\nWithout their star, Los Angeles never found their footing.\n\nJames Harden poured in 24 points, and Collins added 23 off the bench, but it wasn't nearly enough against a Bulls squad that couldn't miss.\n\nLos Angeles shot just 3-for-13 from three in the first half and trailed by as many as 31 points.\n\nStill, the bigger picture isn't all bad for the Clippers.\n\nThey finished their grueling road trip with travel across the continent with a winning record, and the young guys stepped up throughout the stretch, and that depth will matter down the line.\n\nMatas Buzelis added 21 points for Chicago while Nikola Vucevic chipped in 19 points and eight boards.\n\nAyo Dosunmu had 18 off the bench, and Tre Jones stuffed the stat sheet with 15 points and 10 assists as the Bulls improved to 13-9 at home.\n\nJosh Giddey sat out with a hamstring strain but could return Thursday when Chicago heads to Minnesota.\n\nThe Clippers have won 13 of their last 15 games after starting 6-21 👀\n\n🔹+9.3 net rating (3rd in NBA)\n🔹121.0 offensive rating (3rd in NBA)\n🔹111.6 defensive rating (5th in NBA)\n🔹39% 3PT (4th in NBA)\n🔹31% opponent 3PT% (1st in NBA) pic.twitter.com/XI44K9KmNn\n\n— ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) January 21, 2026\n\nThe Clippers, meanwhile, head back to Los Angeles for a Thursday night showdown against the Lakers.\n\nIt was an ugly finish to the road trip, but 2-1 is nothing to be upset about, especially with Leonard set to be reevaluated once the team gets home.",

    "description": "Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga finally cracked the rotation following the Jimmy Butler injury. Here's how he did vs. the Toronto Raptors.",
    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO — Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga finally was called off the bench and into action during a 145-127 loss to the Toronto Raptors at Chase Center on Tuesday night.\n\nOn the second night of a back-to-back — with the Warriors now having to go forward without Jimmy Butler, who suffered a season-ending ACL tear Monday night — head coach Steve Kerr said he would look more toward his bench depth, including Kuminga who hadn't played in 16 games due to a coach's decision.\n\nKuminga received a roar from the Chase Center crowd when he subbed into the game to start the second quarter of the contest.\n\nHe finished with 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting in 21 minutes. He added five rebounds and two assists. Teammate Buddy Hield led the team in scoring with 25 points off then bench, including a perfect 6-of-6 from deep, in 19 minutes of play.\n\nThe Warriors were down 41-28 after the first quarter before Kuminga was subbed into the game to start the second period.\n\nIn his first stint, a little under five minutes, Kuminga missed his only shot attempt: An alley-oop tip-in on a pass from Draymond Green. He was fouled but missed both free throws. He managed to grab two rebounds in his limited action.\n\nHis plus/minus was a minus-10 in four minutes and 39 seconds of playing time.\n\nGolden State is looking for a spark from their bench depth after Butler was lost for the season with a torn ACL.\n\nKerr said the Warriors' win over the Miami Heat that Kuminga could see the floor following Butler's devastating injury.\n\n\"Sure, absolutely,\" Kerr said responding to a question about Kuminga playing against Toronto.\n\nWarriors trailed 91-63 when Kuminga returned to the game at the 6:12 mark of the third quarter.\n\nHe scored 12 points in the period, throwing down a ferocious two-handed slam off an alley-oop pass from Green, a couple of mid-range shots through contact and going the length of the court to make a buzzer-beating layup to end the third.\n\nGolden State trailed 108-94 at the end of three quarters. Kuminga played the remainder of the quarter since subbing in at the 6:12 mark and was a plus-4 after the period.\n\nKuminga played the entire fourth quarter as his play continued to help the Warriors to cut into that huge double-digit deficit. It was cut to as low as 11 points.\n\nHowever, the Raptors ran the score back up late and held on to win the game.\n\nHere are Kuminga's average statistics so far though the 2025-26 regular season, prior to Tuesday's game against the Raptors:\n\nThese are Kuminga's career averages through five seasons in the NBA, prior to Tuesday's game against the Raptors:\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Jonathan Kuminga returns to court in Warriors' loss to Raptors",

    "description": "Could the Miami Dolphins replace Tua Tagovailoa with Malik Willis this offseason?",
    "fullText": "The Miami Dolphins officially have a new general manager and head coach for the first time in over a decade. Now, with the new era set to begin, the duo must find a way to improve a position that has plagued the Dolphins since the day Dan Marino retired.\n\nTua Tagovailoa showed flashes, but his day as the Dolphins’ starting quarterback is over, with reports surfacing that the team was ready to move on and find someone else to lead the new era of Miami football.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s NFL Insider, Jeremy Fowler, that player could be someone both Jon-Eric Sullivan and Jeff Hafley have familiarity with from the last few years in Green Bay.\n\nA player who just so happens to be a free agent this season.\n\n-Lamar Jackson to the Raiders\n-A.J. Brown to the Bills\n-Malik Willis to Dolphins or Browns\n-Kyler or Geno to New York\n\nExecs/scouts/coaches make bold predictions on 2026 offseasonhttps://t.co/vrn0rBuPCN\n\n— Jeremy Fowler (@JFowlerESPN) January 20, 2026\n\nIn a recent ESPN article breaking down some of the off-season’s most probable trades and signings, Fowler suggests that Sullivan and Hafley could bring in a quarterback whom they saw first-hand take over when Jordan Love went down. And to be quite honest, he played some pretty damn good football.\n\nSo much so that it won’t be just the Dolphins jockeying for his services. As Fowler writes, if Daniel Jones returns to Indianapolis, there’s a very good chance that Willis could be the top quarterback on the market. (He probably still is even if Jones does hit the open market, but that’s a conversation for another day)\n\nAnother team that league executives believe could be interested in Willis is the Cleveland Browns.\n\n“I just don’t think [the Browns] go into the season with Shedeur [Sanders] as their top option,” an NFC personnel man said. “And getting the right quarterback in the draft isn’t a guarantee based on where they pick.”\n\nCleveland has two first-round picks, but with Oregon’s Dante Moore returning to school and other key factors, Willis could be their best bet for adding legit competition to a room that has Shedeur Sanders and Dillion Gabriel currently battling for the QB1 spot.\n\nBut as Fowler says, Miami will have a better beat on Willis and his potential over any other team.\n\n“No regime will know Willis’ strengths better than Miami, which just hired a brain trust of GM Jon-Eric Sullivan and head coach Jeff Hafley from Green Bay. The Packers valued Willis’ development and Miami could bear the fruits of that labor.”\n\nI know this is giving some of us older folks a bit of ‘déjà vu’ as it feels eerily similar to the days of Joe Philbin and everyone wanting Matt Flynn, because we were QB-starved and unquestioningly believed things might be different.\n\nBut Willis has legit tools (I’ll do a breakdown in the coming weeks) and could be the perfect QB to help usher in this new era of Dolphins football, while allowing Sullivan and Hafley to find the future in the 2027 or 2028 draft class.\n\nMalik Willis pic.twitter.com/iV0XCHJNZl\n\n— Ian Hartitz (@Ihartitz) January 14, 2026\n\nLast season in Green Bay, Willis completed 85.7 % of his passes for 422 yards and 3 touchdowns in four appearances (1 start). In total, the former third-round pick of the 2022 NFL Draft (86th overall) has started six games, finishing with a 3-3 record.\n\nThe cap situation is bleak, and the Dolphins have to find a suitor for Tua. But if Brandon Shore and Sullivan can find a way to make it work, I think Miami fans would be delighted to have a player like Malik Willis behind center.\n\nThen again, all of this sounds too good to be true.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the Miami Dolphins signing free agent quarterback Malik Willis this offseason? Do you think he’d be the perfect fit for this next era of Dolphins football? How do you feel saying goodbye to Tua Tagovailoa after what appeared to be a promising start to the McDaniel era? Are you happy with the head coach/GM duo Miami now has? Let us know in the comments section below!",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kevin Fiala had a goal and an assist, and Anton Forsberg made 28 saves after taking over for the injured Darcy Kuemper in the Los Angeles Kings’ 4-3 victory over the slumping New York Rangers on Tuesday night.\n\nAdrian Kempe, Taylor Ward and Andrei Kuzmenko also scored for the Kings, who snapped a four-game skid with only their second regulation victory in January.\n\nKuemper allowed two goals on eight shots before abruptly leaving with 38 seconds left in the first period following a collision in the crease with a charging Jonny Brodzinski.\n\nForsberg played superbly after taking over for Kuemper, a member of Canada’s Olympic roster. Kuemper also missed 2 1/2 weeks last month after taking a hit to the head during a loss at Dallas.\n\nJ.T. Miller scored two goals for the Rangers, who are last in the Eastern Conference after losing seven of eight.\n\nJonathan Quick made 23 saves in his third start and fourth appearance against the Kings, who drafted him in 2005. Quick, who turns 40 years old on Wednesday, won 370 games — 199 more than any other Kings goalie — while backstopping the club to two Stanley Cup championships during his 16 seasons in LA.\n\nKempe scored 18 seconds after the opening faceoff.\n\nOnly 42 seconds after Will Cuylle’s goal for New York, Fiala scored his 18th goal by intercepting an unwise pass by former Kings teammate Vladislav Gavrikov.\n\nMiller evened it again late in the first off Mika Zibanejad’s pass.\n\nWard put the Kings back ahead early in the second, banking in a skittering shot off Quick’s far post for his first goal of the season. After Los Angeles killed a five-on-three disadvantage for 96 seconds, Kuzmenko backhanded home a rebound of Fiala’s shot.\n\nMiller scored his 13th goal in the final seconds with Quick pulled for an extra attacker.\n\nRangers: At San Jose on Friday.\n\nKings: At St. Louis on Saturday to open a six-game road trip.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona have been dealt a massive injury blow after confirming that Ferran Torres will miss the next three games due to a muscle issue.\n\nThe Catalan giants confirmed the setback on their official X account, saying “Torres has a strain in the semimembranosus muscle of his right leg and is out”.\n\nBarcelona went on to confirm that the Spanish forward will be out for around 10 days, ruling him out of the next three games in all competitions.\n\nTorres will be unavailable for Wednesday’s Champions League trip to Slavia Prague, as well as upcoming matches against Real Oviedo and FC Copenhagen.\n\nBarcelona are hoping that their La Liga top scorer will return in time to face Elche on January 31, but his involvement in that match will depend on how well his recovery progresses.\n\nTorres started in Barcelona’s shocking 2-1 defeat against Real Sociedad, but was on the pitch for just over an hour before he was replaced by veteran striker Robert Lewandowski.\n\nWhile the result was disappointing, the bigger worry came later when Torres was forced to play through discomfort before eventually being assessed by the club’s medical team.\n\nThe timing of the injury is far from ideal, especially for Barcelona’s Champions League ambitions.\n\nBarcelona head into the Champions League clash sitting 15th in the league-stage standings, with qualification for the knockout rounds still far from secure.\n\nThe Blaugranas are just three points outside the top eight, but anything other than a win in Prague could be devastating for their automatic qualification hopes.\n\nTorres isn’t the only Barcelona star giving Hansi Flick a headache at the moment. The German head coach will also be without Lamine Yamal, who is suspended for tonight’s clash.\n\nHowever, Raphinha’s timely return offers some reprieve, particularly after the Brazilian forward missed the defeat to Sociedad.\n\nWith Torres sidelined, Barcelona will turn to Lewandowski to lead the line, although the Polish striker’s long-term future at the club has been called into question.\n\nMarcus Rashford will also be hoping to help Barcelona skip past Slavia Prague by adding to his four-goal tally in the Champions League.",

    "fullText": "Fulham have opened talks to sign Manchester City winger Oscar Bobb, according to Fabrizio Romano.\n\nThe Cottagers are exploring the possibility of bringing the 22-year-old talent to Craven Cottage as they look to bolster their attacking options, particularly with Adama Traore linked with an exit.\n\nFulham have enjoyed a decent campaign so far, with Marco Silva forced to work with what’s available.\n\nThe Portuguese tactician has done a brilliant job so far. Despite sitting 11th in the Premier League table, Fulham are just five points off fourth-placed Liverpool.\n\nSecuring Champions League football might be a step too far, but the Cottagers have a serious chance of qualifying for Europe this season.\n\nSilva is keen to make sure his squad is in the best possible position to push for a top-seven finish, and the board has decided to back him this January.\n\nFulham are hoping to make Bobb their first winter addition and have even tabled a £35 million bid for the highly rated forward.\n\nThe Norwegian winger has struggled to establish himself in the Man City first team squad since coming up through the club’s revered academy.\n\nInjuries have also impacted his development, with Bobb managing just 47 appearances for the senior team. However, that hasn’t stopped Fulham from exploring a deal.\n\nSilva already has experience with rejuvenating players who flopped in previous clubs.\n\nHe has transformed the likes of Raul Jimenez and Emile Smith Rowe, and Bobb could be the latest to thrive under his leadership at Craven Cottage.\n\nBobb has made 15 appearances for Man City this season. Nine have come in the Premier League, but he has only been named in the starting XI five times.\n\nWith Antoine Semenyo coming in, the Norwegian’s battle for first-team minutes only gets more complicated.\n\nSemenyo can play on either side of the frontline, and his arrival pushes Bobb further down the pecking order. Man City are also willing to sanction a permanent move for Bobb.\n\nFulham want to add more creativity and pace to their squad to reduce the burden on Smith Rowe and Harry Wilson. Bobb checks that box, and a change of scenery could do him the world of good.",

    "fullText": "One player who has been tipped to come in and add options on either side of the attack is Yan Diomande. The young Ivorian’s reputation has exploded over the last few months - since he joined RB Leipzig from Leganes in Spain.\n\nDiomande, 19, cost only £18m last summer and following his move he has become an undroppable star in the Bundesliga as well as a full Ivory Coast international.\n\nDespite a contract until 2030 it’s widely expected that the winger will be LEAVING next summer and right now it’s Liverpool who are in the driving seat.\n\nThat’s according to a new report in Caught Offside which claims a bid will be made by the Premier League champions in the next few months.\n\nBidding will start for the forward at €100m (£87m) who Liverpool view as a “perfect fit” for their post-Salah rebuild.\n\n“The Bundesliga club have informed all interested parties that any negotiation will only begin at €100 million,” the report reads. “Liverpool’s interest is currently the strongest.\n\n“The Reds are expected to make a formal approach in the coming months, viewing Diomande as a long-term successor to Mohamed Salah and a perfect fit for their new system.”\n\nLiverpool have had success in dealing with the Red Bull group in the past - signing the likes of Ibrahima Konate and Dominik Szoboszlai from their Leipzig club.\n\nWith Jurgen Klopp in place at Red Bull as their Global Head of Football the Merseysiders will no doubt be hoping their contacts will offer them favourable conditions ahead of rival clubs as we approach the summer transfer window.",

    "title": "Token Issuer Metadata: A Proposal for Config-as-Code SSO",
    "description": "A CIMD extension for passive token validation that eliminates manual SSO configuration",
    "fullText": "This is a thought experiment: what if embedded services could just be plopped in your frontend with zero configuration while still being secure? This isn’t something I plan to implement, but I thought it was interesting and worth sharing.\nWhat if embedded services never needed manual SSO configuration? No dashboard. No shared secrets. Customers host a metadata file declaring their identity provider, and any service that implements the spec can validate their users’ tokens automatically.\nThis document explains the problem, proposes a solution, and sketches a specification.\n\n​Part 1: Why Self-Hosted Bootstrap Matters\n​What Char Does Today\nChar validates tokens from your identity provider. It doesn’t initiate authentication. It receives tokens your app already obtained and verifies them using public keys.\nThis is different from “Login with Google” flows. When Slack implements Google login, Slack acts as an OAuth Client. Slack needs its own Client ID registered with Google. Every vendor needs their own registration.\nChar acts as a Passive Validator. We don’t initiate auth. We don’t need our own Client ID with your IDP. We validate tokens that were already issued to your app: the tokens your users already have.\n\nThe question Char needs answered: which IDP issued this token? Once we know that, validation is standard OIDC: fetch the IDP’s public keys, verify the signature, check the issuer and audience claims.\n​Manual Configuration Today\nYou tell us which IDP to validate against by configuring it in our dashboard:\n\nLog into Char dashboard\nNavigate to Settings → Integration\nSelect your IDP type (Okta, Google, Auth0…)\nCopy your Client ID from your IDP\nPaste it into our form\nCopy your IDP domain\nPaste it into our form\nAdd your application’s domain to our allowlist\nClick Save\n\nThis works. But it’s friction. Every form field is a potential mistake. Every context-switch between your IDP console and our dashboard is a chance to abandon the integration entirely.\nThe deeper problem: this configuration is redundant. You already know your IDP configuration (it’s in your IDP). You already control your domain (that’s where you’re embedding the agent). We’re asking you to re-state facts that already exist elsewhere, in a format we invented, in a system you have to learn.\n\nThe dashboard step disappears. Configuration moves from our system to yours.\n​Declarative Configuration\nWhat if you declared your IDP configuration in a file you control? You host a JSON document at a well-known URL. When a request arrives from your domain, we fetch the file, learn which IDP to validate against, and proceed.\nNo dashboard. No copy-paste. The configuration lives in your infrastructure, under your version control.\nThis isn’t a new idea. Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD) emerged from a similar frustration in the OAuth world. The MCP ecosystem faced a scaling problem: AI clients connecting to thousands of servers, each requiring registration. CIMD inverts the model. Instead of clients registering with servers, clients publish their own metadata at a URL they control. The URL is the identity. Domain ownership becomes the trust anchor.\nThe MCP spec adopted CIMD in November 2025. Auth0, Stytch, WorkOS, and others have published guidance and product support for CIMD in the MCP context (availability varies by provider).\nThis isn’t OIDC Federation. OIDC Federation solves a different problem: “Should this IDP issue tokens to an unknown Relying Party?” That requires trust chains, signed Entity Statements, and complex machinery, because the IDP is making a consequential decision.We’re solving a narrower problem: “Which IDP should I validate this token against?” We don’t ask the IDP for permission. We just fetch its public keys (which are public) and verify signatures. Domain ownership is sufficient trust for that question.\n​CIMD Extension\nExtend CIMD with IDP configuration. A customer hosts a file at /.well-known/oauth-client that includes:\n<code language=\"json\" numberOfLines=\"9\"><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">{</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"client_id\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: </span><span style=\"color:#0A3069;--shiki-dark:#CE9178\">\"https://crm.acme.com/.well-known/oauth-client\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"client_name\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: </span><span style=\"color:#0A3069;--shiki-dark:#CE9178\">\"Acme CRM\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"token_issuer\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"issuer\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: </span><span style=\"color:#0A3069;--shiki-dark:#CE9178\">\"https://acme.okta.com/oauth2/default\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"expected_audience\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: </span><span style=\"color:#0A3069;--shiki-dark:#CE9178\">\"0oa...\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\"> }</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">}</span></span>\n</code>\nWhen Char receives a request from crm.acme.com, we fetch this file, learn that tokens should be validated against the declared issuer with that expected audience, and proceed. The customer declared their truth in a file they control. We read it. No dashboard required.\nThis isn’t just about reducing clicks. It’s about putting configuration where it belongs: with the customer, in their infrastructure, under their version control.\n​The Trust Model\nThe elegance of this approach is that it doesn’t require new trust mechanisms. It composes existing ones:\nDomain ownership is already how the web establishes identity. If you can host files at crm.acme.com, you control that domain. HTTPS and DNS provide that guarantee. CIMD simply uses it.\nIDP tokens are already how enterprises establish user identity. The customer’s IDP signs tokens with keys only it possesses. We validate signatures against published public keys. This is federated authentication, and we already do it.\nAudience claims already prevent token confusion. A token for one application can’t be used for another. We already validate this.\nCIMD-based discovery just connects these existing mechanisms. The customer’s domain proves they’re legitimate. Their CIMD declares their IDP. Their IDP’s tokens prove user identity. No new cryptography. No new trust assumptions. Just composition.\n​What This Enables\nInstant trials. Embed the agent, host a CIMD, it works. No account required. Conversion happens when customers hit limits, not before they’ve seen why the product matters.\nConfiguration-as-code. The CIMD is a file in the repository. It goes through code review. It deploys through CI/CD. Staging and production differ by environment, not by dashboard.\nSelf-service onboarding. If you can host a valid CIMD, you’re onboarded. No waiting for us to approve anything.\nSingle source of truth. Configuration lives in one place: yours. We don’t have a stale copy that disagrees with your IDP.\n​Broader Applicability\nThis pattern isn’t specific to Char. Any embedded SaaS that needs to verify user identity faces the same problem.\nToday, services like Intercom and Zendesk use HMAC shared secrets: the customer generates a secret, passes user data server-side, and the service validates the signature. This works, but it requires server-side integration and secret management. Every vendor has their own approach.\nToken Issuer Metadata eliminates this. If your app already authenticates users via OIDC (most do), you’re already issuing tokens. Third-party services embedded in your app can validate those tokens directly. One CIMD file, hosted once, works for any service that implements the spec.\nThe network effect: once a customer hosts a CIMD with token_issuer, every third-party validator benefits. The first vendor to push adoption creates value for the whole ecosystem.\n​The Tradeoffs\nThis model has genuine limitations worth acknowledging:\nGitOps vs. ClickOps. This model shifts configuration from “ClickOps” (admins pasting values into dashboards) to “GitOps” (engineers committing config to code). For engineering-led organizations, this is a feature: version control, code review, reproducible environments. For non-technical teams who can’t easily host a JSON file, it’s a barrier. The hybrid approach (supporting both CIMD and dashboard) bridges this gap.\nNo pre-flight validation. With dashboard configuration, customers can click “Test Connection” before users arrive. With CIMD discovery, the first real user is the test. Errors surface in production. A char cimd validate CLI tool or web-based validator could help customers catch errors before deploying.\nBootstrap, not runtime. CIMD fetch happens once, when we first see requests from a new origin. After that, the configuration lives in our infrastructure. This means CIMD availability isn’t a runtime concern: if your app loads, we can reach your CIMD. (Char is embedded in your page. If your CDN is down, the page doesn’t load, and we never receive a request.) What does matter is config drift. If you rotate your Okta client ID but forget to update the CIMD file, tokens will fail validation.\nDomain compromise scope. If an attacker gains control of a customer’s domain, they can modify the CIMD. This is true of any domain-based trust model (it’s the same threat model as HTTPS itself), but worth noting explicitly.\nStandardization. The token_issuer extension doesn’t exist as a standard yet. This document proposes one. Adoption depends on whether other vendors see value in a shared approach.\n\n​Part 2: Technical Specification\nThe following sketches what a specification for CIMD-based IDP discovery might look like.\n​Extended CIMD Document\nA standard CIMD document contains OAuth client metadata. We extend it with identity provider configuration:\n<code language=\"json\" numberOfLines=\"11\"><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">{</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"client_id\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: </span><span style=\"color:#0A3069;--shiki-dark:#CE9178\">\"https://crm.acme.com/.well-known/oauth-client\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"client_name\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: </span><span style=\"color:#0A3069;--shiki-dark:#CE9178\">\"Acme CRM\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"client_uri\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: </span><span style=\"color:#0A3069;--shiki-dark:#CE9178\">\"https://crm.acme.com\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"redirect_uris\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: [</span><span style=\"color:#0A3069;--shiki-dark:#CE9178\">\"https://crm.acme.com/callback\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">],</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"token_issuer\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"issuer\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: </span><span style=\"color:#0A3069;--shiki-dark:#CE9178\">\"https://accounts.google.com\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"expected_audience\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: </span><span style=\"color:#0A3069;--shiki-dark:#CE9178\">\"123456789.apps.googleusercontent.com\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\"> }</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">}</span></span>\n</code>\nThe token_issuer object declares how to validate tokens from users of this application. Validators fetch {issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration to discover the JWKS endpoint, then verify that the token’s aud claim matches expected_audience.\nOn standardization: The token_issuer field is a proposed extension to CIMD. While CIMD itself is an IETF draft with growing adoption, there is no standard for declaring IDP configuration inside a client metadata document. This proposal suggests one. Char is an early implementer, but the pattern is designed to be vendor-neutral and adoptable by any service that validates tokens passively.\n​Token Issuer Fields\nFieldRequiredDescriptionissuerYesFull issuer URL. Must match the token’s iss claim. JWKS discovered via {issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration.expected_audienceYesExpected value of the token’s aud claim. This is typically the OAuth client ID of the customer’s application.typeNoOptional hint: google, okta, azure, auth0.

this email becomes the organization owner.\n​Discovery Flow\n\n​Auto-Provisioning Behavior\nWhen Char receives a request from an unknown origin with a valid-looking token:\nDiscovery: Fetch {origin}/.well-known/oauth-client. If not found or invalid, reject the request (fall back to requiring dashboard configuration).\nValidation: Parse the token_issuer extension. Validate the token against the declared IDP: fetch JWKS, verify signature, check issuer and audience claims.\nProvisioning: If validation succeeds, create an organization record with:\n\nThe origin as the primary allowed domain\nIDP configuration from the CIMD\nFree tier defaults\nThe authenticated user as the first end-user\n\nPersistence: The organization record lives in Char’s infrastructure (Durable Objects). Subsequent requests validate against the stored config. We don’t re-fetch CIMD on every auth. CIMD is the bootstrap mechanism, not a runtime dependency. Periodic re-fetching could detect config changes, but token validation doesn’t depend on it.\n​Dashboard Access Flow\nFor customers to access the dashboard after auto-provisioning:\n\nMatching logic:\n\nFor Google: match by hd (hosted domain) claim\nFor Okta/Auth0: match by issuer URL\nFor Azure: match by tid (tenant ID) claim\nFallback: match by email domain\n\n​Security Considerations\n​Core Validations\nCIMD URL validation: The client_id field in the CIMD must exactly match the URL it was fetched from. This prevents an attacker from hosting a CIMD that claims to be a different domain.\nHTTPS required: CIMD must be served over HTTPS. HTTP URLs are rejected.\nIssuer validation: The token’s iss claim must match the expected issuer for the declared IDP type. A CIMD declaring type: google cannot be used to validate tokens from Okta.\nAudience validation: The token’s aud claim must match the expected_audience declared in the CIMD. This prevents tokens intended for other applications from being accepted.\nOrigin binding (preventing token replay): A natural concern: “If you accept tokens meant for other apps, can’t I steal a token from App A and use it on App B?” No, because the CIMD is fetched from the request’s origin:\n\nAttacker steals token from app-a.com (where aud: \"client-id-A\")\nAttacker sends token to Char from app-b.com\nChar fetches CIMD from app-b.com\nCIMD declares expected_audience: \"client-id-B\"\nToken’s aud doesn’t match → Rejected\n\nThe token is bound to the origin that declares it. A token valid for one domain cannot be used from another domain, even if both use the same IDP.\nOn Origin headers: Origin can be spoofed by non-browser clients. Origin binding is a routing hint, not a cryptographic proof. The actual security boundary is audience validation: the token’s aud claim must match the CIMD’s declared expected_audience. If an attacker could forge a valid token with the correct audience, they wouldn’t need to spoof Origin in the first place.\n​SSRF Hardening (Normative)\nFetching customer-hosted metadata creates SSRF risk. Implementations MUST:\n\nReject non-HTTPS URLs. No http://, file://, or other schemes.\nBlock private/loopback addresses. Resolve DNS before connecting and reject private ranges (10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x, 127.x, ::1, link-local). Re-check after any redirects.\nCap response size. 5 KB maximum for metadata documents.\nUse aggressive timeouts. 5 seconds connect, 10 seconds total.\nRate limit per origin. Prevent abuse from repeated fetch attempts.\n\n​Domain Compromise Scope\nA natural concern: “What if an attacker gains control of a customer’s domain?” The blast radius is more contained than it might appear.\nEven with full domain control, an attacker must still present tokens from a valid IDP. They could modify the CIMD to point to an IDP they control, but tokens from that IDP would only grant access to the organization associated with that domain. They cannot use a compromised domain to attack other organizations. Each org is isolated by its origin.\nThe attacker is essentially attacking themselves. They control the domain, they control the CIMD, they control the IDP, and they get access to… an organization scoped to their own domain. This is the same trust model as HTTPS itself: domain ownership is the root of trust.\n​Token Lifecycle as Defense\nThe short-lived nature of OAuth tokens provides defense-in-depth:\n\nID tokens expire quickly. Best practice is 5-60 minutes. Even if a CIMD is compromised, existing user sessions expire naturally within this window.\n\nRefresh tokens rotate. Modern IDPs issue new refresh tokens with each use. A stolen refresh token becomes invalid after one use. Many IDPs also detect reuse and revoke the entire token family.\n\nCIMD changes invalidate sessions. If a domain changes hands and the new owner modifies the CIMD, existing tokens fail validation immediately. The issuer or audience no longer matches. There’s no persistent access that survives a CIMD change.\n\nThe attack window is bounded by token lifetime, not by how long it takes someone to notice the compromise.\n​Edge Cases Worth Noting\nSubdomain takeover: If a customer has dangling DNS records pointing to decommissioned services (e.g., old Heroku or S3 deployments), an attacker could claim that subdomain and host a malicious CIMD. This is a real attack vector, but it’s a general web security issue, not specific to CIMD. The mitigation is the same: customers should audit their DNS records and remove dangling entries.\nDomain expiration: If a customer’s domain expires and someone else registers it, the new owner could claim the auto-provisioned organization. This is concerning for abandoned deployments. Mitigation options include:\n\nPeriodic re-validation of domain ownership\nAlerting on CIMD changes (especially IDP changes)\nRequiring explicit confirmation for significant configuration changes\n\nFirst-user-as-admin race: If using admin_contact with an email, an attacker who knows that email and can obtain a valid token for it could beat the legitimate admin to claiming the org. This is a narrow window (only during initial provisioning) and requires the attacker to have legitimate IDP access. Low risk, but worth documenting.\n​What We’re Trusting\nTo summarize the trust model:\nWe TrustBecauseDomain ownership proves legitimacyHTTPS + DNS (same as all web security)CIMD content is authoritativeOnly the domain owner can host itIDP tokens prove user identityCryptographic signatures we verifyToken audience prevents confusionStandard OIDC claim validationShort token lifetimes limit exposureIndustry best practice, IDP-enforced\nThis isn’t a novel trust model. It’s composition of existing, battle-tested mechanisms.\n\n​Relationship to OpenID Connect\nThis proposal occupies similar territory to existing OIDC specs, but it’s solving a narrower problem, which is why it can be simpler.\n​What OIDC Federation Solves\nOpenID Connect Federation 1.0 addresses a broad challenge: how can an Identity Provider accept authentication requests from Relying Parties it has never seen before?\nThe answer is sophisticated. Trust anchors issue signed statements about entities. Intermediate authorities form chains. RPs publish Entity Statements (signed JWTs) containing their metadata. When an RP initiates auth, the IDP walks the trust chain, validates signatures, applies federation policies, and decides whether to proceed.\nThis machinery exists because OIDC Federation enables the full authentication flow: authorization requests, token issuance, consent, scopes. The IDP is actively participating. It needs strong guarantees before issuing tokens to an unknown party.\n\n​What We’re Actually Solving\nOur problem is narrower: how can a third party know which IDP to validate tokens against, without pre-registration?\nWe’re not participating in the auth flow. The customer’s IDP already issued the token. The user already authenticated. We just need to validate what we received. We’re asking a simpler question: “which IDP does this domain use?”\n\nThe IDP doesn’t know we exist. We don’t ask it for permission. We just fetch its public keys (which are public) and verify signatures. This is standard OIDC token validation. The only question is which IDP to validate against.\n​Why Our Approach Is Simpler\nThe simplicity isn’t a shortcut. It’s appropriate for the scope:\nOIDC FederationThis ProposalQuestion answered”Should I issue tokens to this RP?\"\"Which IDP issued this token?”Who’s decidingThe IDP (active participant)Us (passive validator)What happens nextFull auth flow, token issuanceToken validation onlyTrust requirementsIDP must trust RP before issuing tokensWe just need to know which IDP to checkFailure modeAuth blockedValidation fails, user re-authenticates\nOIDC Federation needs signed statements and trust chains because the IDP is making a consequential decision: issuing tokens that grant access. Getting that wrong has security implications.\nWe’re making a simpler decision: validating tokens that were already issued. If we get it wrong, the token fails validation. The user re-authenticates. There’s no token leakage, no unauthorized access, just a failed validation.\n​What We Build On\nTo be precise about lineage:\nWe build on CIMD. The core pattern (publish metadata at your domain, domain ownership = trust) comes directly from OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents. We’re extending CIMD with IDP configuration fields.\nWe use OIDC. Token validation is standard OIDC. We fetch the IDP’s JWKS via /.well-known/openid-configuration, verify signatures, check issuer and audience claims. Nothing novel here.\nWe occupy similar space as OIDC Federation. Both enable dynamic discovery without pre-registration. But we’re not building on Federation’s trust chain model because we don’t need it.\n​Summary\nOIDC Federation is the right tool when IDPs need to trust unknown RPs before issuing tokens.\nFor token validation by third parties, that machinery is overkill. Domain ownership is sufficient trust. The token itself carries cryptographic proof of the IDP’s involvement. We’re not asking the IDP to do anything, just reading its public keys.\nThis proposal achieves dashboard-free SSO bootstrap for embedded agents by recognizing that token validation is a narrower problem than token issuance.\n\n​Current Status\nThis is exploratory work. CIMD itself is an IETF draft with growing adoption, but the token_issuer extension described here doesn’t exist as a standard.\nI’m not actively building this, just documenting an idea that seemed worth sharing. If it resonates, or if you see problems with the approach, I’d be curious to hear.\n​Further Reading\nFederated AuthenticationHow Char validates tokens from your IDPIdentity ProvidersCurrent (dashboard-based) IDP configuration\n​References\n\nOAuth Client ID Metadata Document (IETF OAuth WG Draft)\nMCP Authorization Specification\nWorkOS: CIMD in MCP\nAuth0: CIMD is the Future of MCP",

    "description": "In a client-server world, identity and authority are anchored in a server that logs people in and enforces\npermissions. When you take the server away, though, it might seem like there’s no solid foundation for\nauthentication or authorization. Is there a principled way to establish trust in a distributed application?",
    "fullText": "When I first started thinking about authentication and authorization in a local-first context I\nfound it super weird and confusing, like I’d stepped through the looking-glass. I found myself\nwrestling with big philosophical questions like “where does authority ultimately come from?” and\n“what does it mean to know someone?“.\n\nI’m going to walk you through my journey, from that initial disorientation to what I believe are\nsolid, principled approaches, in the course of developing the @localfirst/auth library.\n\nIt might not be obvious why this might be disorienting, so I’ll explain.\n\nWithout a server, it’s not clear where authority or identity come from.\n\nTraditional authentication and authorization ultimately “root out” in a physical piece of hardware,\nowned and controlled by a company that you’ve decided to trust. The hardware is a server that has\nyour username and password and rules about what you’re allowed to do. It might be controlled by your\nemployer, or a SaaS provider, or a big tech company.\n\nThe server is like a guard at the castle gates. If the server doesn’t recognize you, it doesn’t let\nyou in. If the server doesn’t think you should be allowed to have something, it doesn’t give it to\nyou.\n\nOf course, the whole point of local-first software is that we don’t love that arrangement.\n\nBut when you take away that central server, you’re losing the thing that all our notions of security\nare anchored to.\n\nIf all you have is clients, who are peers — which means they relate to each other as equals — then\nhow do we know who is who? How do we know who to trust? What do permissions even mean — who exactly\nis “giving permission”?\n\n“Bootstrapping” has become a word that we associate with something as easy and routine as turning\nyour computer on. But the whole point of bootstrapping as a metaphor is that it’s supposed to be\nimpossible: You can’t lift yourself up by pulling on your bootstraps.\n\nIt’s like living in a monarchy and realizing that the king is just another person, and not someone\nappointed by the gods. Just like countries making that transition from monarchy to democracy, we’re\nsuddenly adrift, and have to come up with completely new arrangements to solve problems that were\nalready solved — even if in a suboptimal way.\n\nWithout a server, it feels like we’re having to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps on some\nfundamental questions:\n\nIn 2020, a couple of weeks into the pandemic, I started work on a library that became\nlocalfirst/auth.\n\nI had to learn about modern cryptography starting from zero.\n\nI was immediately fascinated by how empowering public-key cryptography is, in the sense that it\ncan put me on an equal footing with even very powerful adversaries.\n\nThe movies would lead you to believe that defeating encryption is something a dude in a hoodie can\ndo just by typing really hard.\n\nBut in the real world strong cryptography can’t be defeated.* It just\ncan’t.**\n\nHere is legendary cryptologist and mathematician Daniel J. Bernstein writing over a decade\nago:\n\nFor most cryptographic operations, there exist widely accepted primitives that have been\nextensively studied, and breaking them is considered computationally infeasible on any existing\ncomputer cluster.\n\nThe point is you don’t need a lot of money, or computing power, or specialized equipment. Strong\nencryption doesn’t cost any more than weak encryption. It doesn’t cost any more to use a long\nencryption key than a short one. It’s just math. It’s just code.\n\nSo anyway I’m sitting down to work on this, and the first thing that makes my head spin is, how do\nyou know you’re talking to?\n\nWhen we collaborate or communicate online using a traditional cloud-based platform, we can think of\nthe service provider as vouching for us — introducing us to other people and confirming our\nidentity.\n\nIf I’m using Slack to talk to you, you know it’s me because Slack says it’s me, and you trust Slack.\nAnd maybe Slack knows it’s me because I logged in with Google: Google vouched for me, and Slack\ntrusts Google.\n\nIf we don’t want to put our trust in a centralized third party, then who will vouch us?\n\nIn a system where everyone’s a peer, then maybe peers could vouch for peers, in some kind of chain\nof trust.\n\nBut that chain has to be anchored somewhere: Maybe Charlie vouches for Bob to Alice, but who vouches\nfor Charlie?\n\nIgnoring the infinite regress problem for the moment, it seems clear that the solution will be\nsomething something public-key cryptography. But to do public-key cryptography, you need to know\npeople’s public keys.\n\n”Crypto is a tool for turning a whole swathe of problems into key management problems. Key\nmanagement problems are way harder than virtually all cryptographers think.”\n\n— Dr. Lea Kissner\n\nDr. Kissner was the head of information security at Twitter and I don’t think they meant the above\ntweet to be encouraging.\n\nBut I do find it encouraging. Even granting that key management is a hard problem, the idea that you\ncan collapse lots of different problems into this one problem is exciting, because you just have to\nfocus on solving that thing. If you can succeed at the key management thing — it’s is a big if — but\nif you can, then you can solve this “whole swathe of problems.”\n\nSo how do we learn people’s public keys?\n\nHere in Spain, I can obtain a certificate from the treasury department to install in my browser,\nwhich allows me to transparently authenticate to government websites and sign official documents\ndigitally.\n\nThe most obvious solution is to have some trusted party keep a directory of people and their public\nkeys, and of course that’s totally a thing that exists.\n\nThe certificate authorities (CAs) that make secure https connections possible are an example. Some\nbig companies have their own certificate authorities to anchor their employees’ digital identities.\nAnd countries can do the same for residents.\n\nThis is what my public PGP\nkey looks\nlike.\n\nBut we’re trying to do this without depending on centralized services.\n\nIf you want a decentralized solution, the alternative seems to be for people to actively share their\nown keys directly with each other.\n\nThis was the approach taken by PGP (“Pretty Good Privacy”) in the 1990s.\n\nPGP was the first encryption toolset intended for ordinary users. The idea was that people would put\ntheir public keys on their websites and in their email signatures. Apparently there were key signing\nparties where people exchanged and signed each other’s keys.\n\nFrom the looks of it these parties were lit.🥳\n\nIn 2014, Keybase had a better idea: People can just post their public keys in\nmachine-readable form on public sites where they have accounts, like Twitter or GitHub. They called\nthese “social proofs”. Then anyone can look up a person’s public keys by username, and use them to\nverify their identity.\n\nI’ve used Keybase to “verify myself” by posting machine-readable statements on\nTwitter,\nGitHub, and\nReddit\n\nThe first applications to truly bring end-to-end encryption to the masses were messaging apps. The\nSignal protocol came out in 2013, and two years later WhatsApp brought it to their entire customer\nbase, and overnight about a billion people were using encrypted messaging. Since then WhatsApp’s\nuser base grew to two billion and then to three billion, making it one of the most widely used\ncommunication tools in all of human history.\n\nThis succeeded because they made encryption transparent to the user. The key insight is that a\npublic key will never be like an email or a telephone number. It’s not a stable component of our\ndigital identity. Wrangling encryption keys is a job for computers, not for people. Devices should\njust generate keys as needed and we should never see them or have to think about them. Private keys\nshould never leave the device, and public keys should be shared automatically with other devices.\n\nWe’re agreed, then, that device-to-device sharing of keys is better than key signing parties. But\nAlice’s device still needs to know that Bob’s device is really Bob’s device, and not Eve’s device\npretending to be Bob’s device.\n\nTOFU considered squishy. Image: Yoav Aziz\n\nWhatsApp and Signal take an approach called “Trust On First Use”, or TOFU. Here’s how that works:\n\nThere’s a little risk there, they’re both taking a little leap of faith, but it’s a one-time thing,\nit’s probably fine.\n\nThat seems reasonable. The problem, though, is that the “first use” bit is kind of misleading,\nbecause in practice TOFU doesn’t happen just once.\n\nRemember, the keys we care about are device-level keys, not user-level keys. So what happens when\nBob gets a new phone, or Alice reinstalls the software on her laptop?\n\nWhat happens is an “account reset”, and at that point we’re back to TOFU — except that now, the\nattack scenarios are a bit more plausible: an impostor might have engineered the reset, and it would\nbe more feasible to exploit it.\n\nWhen a user has an account reset, the messaging apps suggest to everyone they communicate with that\nthey compare “security codes” or “safety numbers”. Most users don’t do this — I never have, I can’t\nimagine that people less technical than me do this.\n\nAnd anyway this is bad enough for a single pairwise connection; where this all really falls apart is\nin a large group, where the number of pairwise connections scales exponentially with the size of the\ngroup.\n\nWith a balanced PAKE, both parties need to know the password.\n\nSo when you want to connect with someone and don’t know their public key, is there an alternative to\nTOFU for securing that initial connection?\n\nThe most promising approach is to first share a single-use password out of band (in person, or via a\nchannel you already trust). There is whole a family of cryptographic protocols that support this,\ncalled PAKEs (for “password-authenticated key exchange”).\n\nWe’re saying “password” but it’s generally presented as an invitation code.\n\nIn the most common forms, both parties need to know the secret code; this is called a balanced\nPAKE.\n\nThe downside is that the inviter and invitee need to connect directly to validate the invitation.\n\nWith an asymmetric PAKE, a third party can verify the password without knowing it.\n\nWith an asymmetric PAKE (asymmetric because the verifier doesn’t need to know the password) a\nthird party can validate an invitation code without knowing it in advance or asking for it.\n\nThis brings us back to Keybase. In 2017 or so, they decided to try to monetize by building a\nSlack-but-encrypted thing for enterprise customers. They quickly realized that even if the global\nnerd population thought the idea of putting your public key on Twitter was really cool, Jim in\nAccounts Payable is probably just not going to do that. Sorry, it’s just not going to happen.\n\nSo they needed a way to bootstrap that initial key exchange, and they proposed something called a\nSeitan Token Exchange (presumably “seitan” because it’s not as\nsoft as tofu).\n\nThis is the approach I stole for localfirst/auth. At the time I didn’t know a PAKE from a hole in\nthe ground, but as it turns out this is essentially an asymmetric PAKE.\n\nWe’ve been talking about “identity”; but the beauty of this approach is that identity doesn’t need\nto mean “who you are in the world”, in the sense of linking to your real name or email or whatever —\nit can just mean “who you are to me“.\n\nRather than linking identity to a name or an email address, we link it to a relationship.\n\nFor example, in Ink & Switch’s Backchannel project one\nof the motivating use cases was connecting an anonymous source to a journalist. With a system like\nthis the source doesn’t have to have a name at all; the only thing that matters is that they’re able\nto interact once.\n\nTrust and identity are ultimately rooted in real-world relationships and interactions between human\nbeings. I know you because we interact, whether that’s face-to-face or online. That’s what it\nmeans to “know” someone. And we can use that interaction to bootstrap cryptographically secure\nconnections going forward. And if you have those secure connections with other people and I trust\nyou, I can benefit from your connections, and so on, forming a network of trust relationships.\n\nThat helps us clear up our thinking about identity:\n\nA. Real-world human interactions and relationships.\n\nThis feels correct to me: It’s natural, human-scale, and rooted in social reality.\n\nThe server-centric model roots our identity in getting distant corporations to vouch for us.\n\nWith this model, instead can we vouch for ourselves:\n\nAnd we can vouch for each other:\n\nIs it possible to have a secure, distributed access control list?\n\nSo now I have a way of knowing it’s you. But how do I know if you’re on my team? How do I know if I\nshould share this document with you, or if you should be able to edit it?\n\nOn a server this information is often recorded in some kind of access control list (ACL). So\nmaybe we need that, but distributed — everybody needs a copy of the same list. How would that work?\n\nMy first thought was that we could just put this information in an Automerge document and replicate\nit across everyone’s devices that way. But we can’t just let anyone edit this document at will. It\nshould be obvious if anyone changes the permissions, and we need to know who changed the\npermissions, and if they … had permission to do so? Do we need an ACL for the ACL?\n\nLet’s ignore that rabbit hole of infinite regress for the moment and focus on the mechanics. We need\na way of replicating a document that is:\n\n✅ tamper-evident: it shouldn’t be possible for someone to surreptitiously modify the list\n\n✅ eventually consistent: everybody should have the same list\n\n✅ authenticated: we need to know who has written changes to the list\n\nSo let’s look at some options for data structures.\n\nWhen we say “tamper-resistant” the first thing you might think of is a hash chain (or\nblockchain), where each link contains a cryptographic hash of the previous link, so it’s\nimpossible to modify one link or change the order without breaking the chain.\n\nThe problem is that this chain needs to be linear. Replicating it while ensuring consistency\nrequires enforcing a strict ordering; and cryptocurrency blockchains are famously … not optimized\nfor efficiency.\n\nTo accomplish this without burning enough fossil fuels to power multiple small countries, we could\nuse a hash graph. A hash graph is a hash chain plus branching. A CRDT like Automerge combines a\nhash graph with automatic conflict resolution logic to support replication with eventual\nconsistency. Git works the same way but with manual conflict resolution.\n\n✅ tamper-evident\n\n✅ eventually consistent\n\nSo far so good. But we still need a way of verifying who made which changes to our distributed\naccess control list.\n\nA signature graph is a hash graph where the individual operations are signed by the author. This\ngives us all three things.\n\n✅ tamper-evident\n\n✅ eventually consistent\n\n✅ authenticated\n\nIf you look at the work of anyone who’s trying to tackle this problem, you’re going to see some kind\nof signature graph: the Matrix protocol,\nDXOS’s HALO, Fission’s\nUCANs, etc. It’s a case of convergent evolution — we’ve all more\nor less independently landed on this data structure.\n\nThe way this works, concretely, is that there’s a series of operations on the group:\n\nThe first link, the root of the chain, marks the creation of the group and by definition adds\nthe founder to the group as an admin. It also includes the founder’s public keys.\n\nEach subsequent link represents an administrative action such as inviting a member, removing a\nmember, promoting a member to admin (or another role), or demoting a member.\n\nEach link contains a cryptographic hash of the preceding link, so the order of the links\ncannot be altered.\n\nEach link contains a digital signature of its content by the member making the change, so that\nits authenticity can be independently verified, and so that the link body cannot be tampered with.\n\nWhen I found a group, I am the only member and the only authority. I can decide to add members, and\nI can decide to delegate authority to them as well. Another member with admin authority could even\nremove me from the group.\n\nThis is a key point that we’ll come back to: In a group, authority is rooted in the act of\ncreating the group.\n\nTo be replicable, this data structure needs to be a CRDT. However, you can’t model group permissions\nusing a JSON CRDT like Automerge. I’ll explain why.\n\nHere we have two concurrent actions, but there’s no conflict, and we can resolve this by picking one\nor the other in an arbitrary but deterministic order. So far, nothing a generic CRDT couldn’t handle.\n\nWhat if someone takes actions while concurrently being removed? For example, what if Bob adds\nCharlie to the group and concurrently, Alice removes Bob from the group? Now we have a conflict.\n\nQ. Is Charlie in the group or not?\n\nIt’s important to resolve this correctly, or else Bob could circumvent his removal by writing a\nconcurrent operation adding proxy-Bob to the group.\n\nA: No. Removals always take precedence. We resolve that conflict by prioritizing removals. A\ngeneric CRDT like Automerge won’t be able to resolve this conflict in a principled way; it won’t\neven see it as a conflict. So this has to be implemented as a custom CRDT engine.\n\nWhat if two admins remove each other concurrently? (Or more generally, what if there’s a cycle of\nconcurrent removals?)\n\nAs a scenario involving two legitimate members of the group, this is far-fetched and unlikely to\nhappen. A more realistic and worrying scenario might be, for example, a compromised and revoked\ndevice trying to undo its revocation.\n\nOption 1: Remove both The logical conclusion of “removals take precedence” is to remove both.\n\nHowever, this seems unlikely to be the correct way of resolving the issue. It leaves Charlie\norphaned in a group without admins and creates an opening for a denial-of-service attack, where a\nrogue device blows up the group rather than allowing itself to be removed.\n\nOption 2: Fork the group Another approach is to “fork the world” into two parallel versions of\nthe same group: one where Alice stays and one where Bob stays. Then each member decides which world\nthey want to live in. This reflects the reality of a decentralized system.\n\nI suspect that in practice it’d be hard to communicate what’s going on to most users, and it would\njust be confusing and upsetting.\n\nI call option 2 the “Papal Schism” approach, in honor of the time when there were two popes and all of\nCatholic Christendom had to decide which one to follow.\n\nOption 3: Keep the senior member The solution I settled on is to let seniority be a proxy for\nwho is more likely to be in the right. In this case, Alice has been in the group longer than Bob, so\nshe stays.\n\nThe key insight for me was that the root node of a signature graph gives you an anchor for\nauthority. If I create a group, by definition I get to decide who’s in it.\n\nAt the moment of creation, Alice is the absolute dictator of a group with no other members: Alice\ndecides who to add to the group. Alice decides if she wants to delegate her authority to other\nmembers. She can make everyone else an admin too.\n\nThis delegates the right to remove anyone, including herself, from the group. But even once she’s\ngone, the authority behind any action — any addition or removal of members, any further delegation\nof authority — can always be traced back to the authority inherent in her act of creation.\n\nWe started with two big questions about how we find our footings in a local-first world.\n\nThe Seitan protocol that I decided to use, like any other flavor of PAKE, is complex and involves\nmany cryptographic subtleties. But any invitation protocol, no matter how involved, has something\nvery simple at its core: An interaction that takes place in the context of some existing\nrelationship.\n\nIn the beginning there was a relationship.\n\nAt first, it felt like cheating, or a cop-out, to rely on a “pre-existing trusted side channel” to\ntransmit this invitation. But it’s not at all. And it’s not a minor thing or an implementation\ndetail either — in fact, it’s the core of this whole thing.\n\nHow does Alice know it’s Bob? Because Alice and Bob had that interaction where Alice communicated\nthe invitation code to him, and Bob is able to prove that he’s the one she had that interaction\nwith.\n\nThe fact that this pre-existing channel exists at all is very significant; it only exists because\nthere is some kind of pre-existing relationship between Alice and Bob in the real world.\n\nSo, that’s our answer: preexisting human interactions and relationships are what anchor\nidentity.\n\nWhen you found a company, you decide who you want to invite to work with you. Depending on how you\nset things up, you might end up being removed from the company later on. But the authority to do\nthat can ultimately be traced back to delegations of authority you made.\n\nWhen you start any kind of project, you decide who you want to go on that journey with you, or if\nyou want to go it alone.\n\nWhen you begin writing a document, you don’t have to share it with anyone - you could keep it to\nyourself forever. If you do share it, the details are up to you: Do you share it with the whole\nworld? Just with your team? Just with one person? Whose input will you pay attention to?\n\nNone of this gives you any power over anyone outside the context of the thing you created: They can\nchoose whether to accept, and they can stop collaborating with you at any time.\n\nIt only recently occurred to me that authority and authorship come from the same root word.\n\nAuthority is rooted in authorship, in the act of creation.\n\nSo. These are the answers I’ve found to our big questions. I think they’re good answers. As it\nturns out, not only you can anchor decentralized security on something solid, but the foundation\nwe’ve found is something more legitimate, more satisfying, more human than a distant company’s\n“because I said so”.\n\nIf you’re looking to secure a local-first application, take a look at my\n@localfirst/auth library, which is a working\nimplementation of these ideas, including an auth provider for integration with\nautomerge-repo.\n\nAt some point in the process of creating localfirst/auth, I realized that I’d made a custom CRDT; so\nI extracted the machinery for creating, validating, and interpreting signature chains into the\nCRDX package. This can be used on\nits own to create an encrypted, authenticated CRDT with bespoke conflict detection and resolution\nlogic.\n\nIf you take any of this out for a spin — or if you have questions about how it works — please get in\ntouch with me — via one of the (pre-existing, trusted) channels listed below!\n\nThis library’s shape emerged from a series of conversations early on with Peter Van\nHardenberg of Ink & Switch. Peter drilled\ninto my head the idea that device keys should be generated locally and never leave the device, and\npointed me towards Keybase’s signature chains.\n\nMartin Kleppmann of Cambridge University has been very generous\nwith his time and expertise. Martin is the creator of\nAutomerge and co-author with Peter of Ink & Switch’s\nlocal-first manifesto. Much of localfirst/auth is an\nexpression in code of his theoretical work. Every time I’ve been stuck on something, Martin has\nco-written a paper that solves that exact thing. These two papers were particularly helpful:",

    "fullText": "When I swapped my iPhone for a Nokia, Walkman, film camera and physical map, I wasn’t sure what to expect. But my life soon started to change\n\nWhen two balaclava-clad men on a motorbike mounted the pavement to rob me, recently, I remained oblivious. My eyes were pinned to a text message on my phone, and my hands were so clawed around it that they didn’t even bother to grab it. It wasn’t until an elderly woman shrieked and I felt the whoosh of air as the bike launched back on to the road that I looked up at all. They might have been unsuccessful but it did make me think: what else am I missing from the real world around me?\n\nBefore I’ve poured my first morning coffee I’ve already watched the lives of strangers unfold on Instagram, checked the headlines, responded to texts, swiped through some matches on a dating app, and refreshed my emails, twice. I check Apple Maps for my quickest route to work. I’ve usually left it too late to get the bus, so I rent a Lime bike using the app. During the day, my brother sends me some memes, I take a picture of a canal boat, and pay for my lunch on Apple Pay. I walk home listening to music on Spotify and a long voice note from a friend, then I watch a nondescript TV drama, while scrolling through Depop and Vinted for clothes.\n\nI’m constantly contactable, I have no personal boundaries, and my attention span disappeared a long time ago. Since the first iPhone in 2007, smartphones have become indispensable to modern life, with the average person in the UK spending four hours and 20 minutes online per day. “Social media provides frictionless access to an infinite universe of mostly free digital drugs,” says Anna Lembke, author of Dopamine Nation. “And the algorithm tailors the experience for each unique brain, making it very reinforcing, while also injecting just enough novelty in the infinite scroll to overcome boredom and tolerance. All these features combined keep us clicking and swiping long after we want to.” Over time we develop tolerance, which means “we need more of it and a more potent form to get the same effect.”\n\nIncreased screen time has been associated with depression, anxiety and poorer sleep. But is it possible to live lo-fi in a hi-tech world? For a month, I tried: swapping my iPhone for a Nokia which I can only use to text, call and play Snake; also, a Walkman and a film camera. I picked up physical copies of books, newspapers and magazines; I used a London A-Z for directions, and hunted down my physical bank cards or tried to use cash. The only screen time exception was for work, where from 9-5 I used my laptop to respond to emails and write.\n\n“You’re going to look like such a performative hipster,” my flatmate Ben says, as I’m setting up my new devices. He’s right. I leave the Walkman behind, but my bag is still heavier than usual with my book, notepad, A-Z and wallet. I haven’t taken the bus into work yet from my new home so I follow a hand-drawn map to the stop and run for a bus. I stupidly didn’t write down the bus number but that one sounds familiar. It’s not the one, two friendly strangers tell me, but I can swap on to another at Angel. “We’ve outsourced our memory to our phones,” says Nicholas Kardaras, author of Digital Madness and a former assistant clinical professor of psychology at Stony Brook University, New York. “And unfortunately the ease and comfort of being lubricated by technology just means our human skills atrophied. It is use it or lose it.”\n\nThe bus is crawling. Normally, I would have looked up a different route. I try to message a friend back but it’s difficult having to click each button multiple times for the letter I want. “Hard work,” I manage. I read for the rest of the journey.\n\nOn my lunch break, my sister and I go for a walk around the park. When she leaves me to do another lap, I have an urge to check Instagram and my emails but I’m only getting the odd SMS. I’m craving the back-and-forth WhatsApps with friends telling me fun facts about their day. I feel a little unsettled, but I try to focus on the changing leaves on the trees. I have thoughts that wouldn’t usually have the time to surface. How stressful.\n\nAfter work, I go to see the saxophone player cktrl at the ICA. I’m a little worried about collecting the tickets without access to the Dice app I bought them on, but I show them my passport instead. I would normally join the throngs of people filming a song or two, so I could upload some blurred clips with poor sound to social media to show that I had a great time. But I can’t, so I watch him play, undistracted. Then a flashlight glares behind me, as someone films an entire track. I vow never to be that annoying person again.\n\nMy digital detox is starting to stress out my friends. Nicole finally gets through to me, saying: “I hate your dumb phone.” She’s been texting, but didn’t realise you had to click twice to make it send as an SMS not an iMessage. Another friend wants to share a dating story and texts: “Omg this is a terrible time not to access voice note.” And, when my landlord messages asking us to send pictures of the new carpet on WhatsApp, which I can’t do, Ben texts: “You’re going to be such a liability this month.”\n\nIn the evening, my date sends me the address of a pub to meet him at “for your A-Z”. I allow lots of time to decipher its tiny font and navigate my way there. He’s running late, so I sit by the fireplace in the pub and read my book. I look like I’m waiting for someone to chat me up. When he arrives, he shows me how to turn on predictive text, which is a relief for my very tired thumbs.\n\nAt lunchtime, I put on the terrestrial TV and watch Escape to the Country, where I learn about the housing market in Herefordshire. I want to cook myself an elaborate meal – for dinner, and also for entertainment, but when I get to the shops, I remember that I can’t look up a recipe on my phone, so I settle for tomato pasta.\n\nMy flatmate picked up a Nina Simone CD for me in a charity shop. I try to play it on my Walkman, but realise it needs batteries. On my lunch break I buy some (who knew there were so many sizes?) and walk home from the office listening to it. Spotify can be overwhelming with its hundred million tracks, so it’s nice to remove the element of choice and focus on the album as it was intended, not scrambled by shuffle mode. Rosanna Irwin, who runs Samsú – a collection of digital detox cabins in Ireland – knows the importance of analogue listening: she leaves her guests with cassette tapes she makes with her father. After reaching a state of burnout, working long hours in tech – first at Meta and later for a climate tech company – she visited the Danish island of Samsø with her husband in 2023, and found peace amid the scrappy phone service and incredible nature.\n\n“My mental health was very poor,” she says. “I was spending a lot of time online and I did an accidental digital detox on this island and came back invigorated from the experience.” She recommends a three-day retreat. “There’s a lot of science to show that it’s around 72 hours in nature where the true magic starts to happen.”\n\nI meet my friend at Vauxhall station, and we walk to a cafe for breakfast, then to Tate Britain. Camilla is pretty offline: she’s a doctor and doesn’t have social media. She rarely responds to texts and is maybe one of the most joyful people I know. But she says she feels so much guilt about not replying sooner and hates the fact that phones are like this ever-present person in the room, distracting you from being totally engaged with the real-life friends around you.The sentiment resonates with me; we both want to be more spontaneous.\n\nInspired by our conversation, I call Aakriti, who doesn’t live too far away. I meet her and two of her friends and we eat empanadas. On the way home, I have to ask the only man on the platform for help. The overground isn’t due for 24 minutes, so I wonder if there is a faster route. There isn’t, so I shiver at the outdoor station wishing I could book an Uber.\n\nIt’s tipping down with rain when I arrive at Canada Water, and I don’t want to ruin my A-Z to search for Rotherhithe Street. I know The Mayflower pub is on the river and ask a man at a convenience store to point me in the right direction. I’m early, so I squint at my book in the candle-lit pub, feeling very Victorian. There’s a hilarious waiter, who is telling dating stories from Grindr, and it’s much better than my book. This no-technology thing is making me nosy. I pay for my roast with cash, which feels almost fake now, like I’m in a game. Then my friend and I go to the cinema – the Picturehouse in central London, because it’s in between where we both live. They charge us £20 for a ticket, which I would never have paid had I known before we made the trip. I’m left fuming, but luckily the movie is good.\n\nI need to call the bank. My flatmate has sent rent money to my Monzo account, which I can only access on the app, and I get a text saying that I’ve gone into an unarranged overdraft. When I get to the tube in the morning, my Oyster card has run out, so I top up the credit and miss my train – I would usually have used a payment card on Apple Pay instead. I have to wait eight minutes for the next one. I’m flustered by the time I get to the office and feel stressed about not being able to check how much money is in my account or transfer money between accounts.\n\nThere’s a group of children on a school trip on my train. The teacher is trying to keep them entertained by getting them to play a word association game. “When I say ‘bread’,” she says. “You could say, ‘sandwich’. Let’s have a go. ‘School,’” the teacher says. “Prison,” a child shouts back. When I arrive in Notting Hill, I study the map at the station to make sure I surface from the correct exit. I memorise key landmarks so I know where to turn – the Gate Cinema is by the road I need to get to Uxbridge Street. I’m late, and don’t have time for mistakes, so I start walking down the street quickly, scouring every restaurant until I find the Palestinian cafe I’m looking for.\n\nThe worries I felt at the start of the experiment about getting lost and not being able to communicate with friends seem to have diminished. I’m calmer, and present when I’m with people. I look around the train on my morning commute and notice that everyone except one person has their eyes glued to their phones. The man opposite me doesn’t have earphones, a phone or a book. I try not to catch his eye, as I’m worried I’ve been staring. Things are less relaxed when I try to meet my friend Navid after work. We can’t pick a place to meet and he is frustrated because he can’t send me links: “Please return to WhatsApp you Neanderthal.” He’s late, so I wait outside the station for 45 minutes. He arrives with a big grin, knowing I’m a bit irritated, but I get my own back by torturing him with two hours of experimental jazz.\n\nAfter work, I go to see my friend Scarlett, who is being held captive by a corgi puppy. It’s dark and damp when I arrive in south-east London but I’ve written out the directions to the house as carefully as I can. I didn’t bring my A-Z because my bag was too heavy, but I’m certain I can’t mess up the 10-minute walk. I call my mum and we natter for 20 minutes before I realise I haven’t spotted the turning. In a panic, I ask her to look up my location on Google Maps, which is obviously cheating, but I’m now late and in the middle of a cemetery. I’ve gone completely the wrong way and she has to narrate the route to my destination.\n\nIt’s been a busy weekend so far and I feel like having a lazy day. I walk to a yoga class and then go for a wander. As I’m walking, and listening to my one CD, I get a call from the guy I’m dating who has just finished work. We try to hunt down a board game to play, but when the local charity shops fail us, we pick up some newspapers and magazines and the ingredients for a roast chicken instead. We then sit on the sofa playing music and reading in the old fashioned way. It feels like we’ve retired.\n\nI finally get around to calling the bank to pay my rent, which is late for the first time. I’ve been putting off the inevitable 20-minute call that includes reading out lots of sort codes and bank numbers and spelling the names of my landlord along with the various friends I owe money to. It’s quite unnerving transferring money without checking the details with my own eyes, and the woman on the phone keeps telling me that it would be much easier to do this online.\n\nFor all the frustrations of the month, I’m sad the experiment is over. I’m left with the feeling that living offline puts other people out: if we’re looking for a place to eat or a pub to go to it’s down to them, they’re on map duty, and I’m not able to book Ubers. But I was happier and calmer – relieved of the endless scrolling, waiting for texts back, and the need to communicate with people all the time. After about a week, I wasn’t reaching for my phone and I had the patience to read. It was nice not to be able to look at my work emails in the evening. I’m determined to delete my main distractions: Depop, Hinge and Instagram. Scouring charity shops for clothes is much more satisfying; dating with no distractions is so much easier; and I can live without reels about botched Botox and AI animals. “Big tech platforms are not addictive accidentally, they’re addictive by design,” says Kardaras. “They’re selling their product by targeting the vulnerable: if the algorithm detects that a young person has a body image issue or is struggling with self-harm or depression, then they bombard them with content on that subject that exacerbates their mental unwellness.” On my last day, I get an email from Scarlett: “Splashed my phone with water whilst listening to the Lily Allen album in the bath, now phoneless and actually want to copy you.” It seems I’m not the only one keen to disconnect.",

    "fullText": "The Newbridge Cutlery Company said today it will stop production of silver-plated cutlery and tableware at its factory in Newbridge in Co Kildare.\n\nThe factory, which employs 11 people, will officially cease operations on 10 April.\n\nFounded in 1934, the company said that given its long and proud heritage in the industry the decision to close the factory was an extremely difficult decision and came after a comprehensive strategic review of the loss-making cutlery business.\n\nThe company said the closure of the factory will not affect the broader Newbridge Silverware business which will continue to operate as normal.\n\nThis includes the Newbridge Visitor Centre in Newbridge, its six standalone stores and the 250 local stockists of Newbridge Silverware around the country.\n\nA consultation process with impacted workers is underway, the company said.\n\nIn a statement, the Newbridge Cutlery Company said today's decision follows several years of falling sales due to reduced demand for silver-plated tableware such as cutlery driven by changing tastes and dining habits at home and across the hospitality sector.\n\n\"Traditional purchases like silver cutlery canteens for wedding gifts have also become increasingly rare. This has resulted in a steady decline in sales and demand for this product,\" the company said.\n\nThe Newbridge Cutlery Company opened as a local co-operative in 1934 with a view to leveraging skills from the former military barracks to craft silver-plated tableware for the Irish market. In the 1990s the company expanded into the jewellery and homeware market which operates under the Newbridge Silverware brand.\n\n\"We have taken the difficult decision to cease operations at our cutlery factory from mid-April. Since 1934, we have built a long and proud history in silver cutlery and tableware manufacturing and have earned a reputation as a centre of excellence in the industry. Today's announcement reflects sustained changes in market demand, and it is with deep regret that we are ceasing operations,\" Martin Kilduff, Operations Director at The Newbridge Cutlery Company, said.\n\nHe said the decline of silver cutlery manufacturing is not unique to Ireland and has been a long-term, Europe-wide trend in line with changing consumer tastes.\n\n\"In addition to this, over the past 12 months, the price of silver bullion has risen by approximately 150%. Absorbing an increase of this magnitude is not feasible without significantly impacting retail pricing. This is a challenge currently being faced across the entire industry,\" he said.\n\n\"We fully understand the impact this decision will have on those craftsmen and women who maintained the tradition of crafting silver plated tableware in Newbridge for generations,\" Mr Kilduff said.\n\n\"We are committed to a meaningful consultation process and to supporting affected employees through clear communication, engagement with their representatives, and access to appropriate supports during this time,\" he added.",

So we first expose the idea to the AI to get an requirement document (PRD) and we work on it !\n\nHow ? you'll need to read first ! and straight away update parts you don't agree with or things you need to be more thorough !\n\nOnce that is done, ask AI models to ask You questions about the PRD and give all those, the PRD and your replies to another AI for update\n\nRince, Repeat, until you are satisfied with the document.\n\nYou can even get multiple model go at it to then compare and merge the outputs, using AI, of course :D\n\nThis is where we start diverging from the basic Ralph loop. instead of just passing that to the AI and hoping tasks will be implemented properly we get an AI to pre split and formalise the tasks and sub tasks into a list !\n\nThe rift grows further as we split the task implementation in several steps with:\n\nOnce all that is done ? the Eric loop goes on for the next phase of the plan, just like Ralph !\n\nYes models have gotten smarter, but if you played around with sub agents and skills, you know that prompting is not dead (yet...)\n\nHaving a neat separation like that helps you have better prompts for each phase of the task execution.\n\nAs a side effect, it mmeans you can control which model is used for which phase maybe you dont need Opus the whole way if it made a banger plan !\n\nWe are going to create a small project from an idea I have, you can do it to if you like !\n\nIt's called Tiny-till, a small app to have a simple till for itinerant merchants.\n\nBut we are going to need a tool to help us ...\n\nYep, I already kind of made said tool :D ! task-o-matic\n\nI'll write more about it in a future post ! but you already have plenty of content to go through on the site itself.\n\nI made sure to generate a lot of docs and a couple tutorials so you can already give it a try if you'd like !\n\nBut in a nutshell, it helps you create PRDs, refine them , split into tasks and subtasks and finally wiring all that to your favorite AI harness !\n\nFor the AI to operate properly, we need a specific stack, that way, we limit hallucination !\n\nTask-o-matic uses better-t-stack under the hood to bootstrap the stack so let's do that !\n\nBoom, a monorepo for Tiny-till ! Batteries included : tailwind, shadcn, build script and all :D\n\nWhy init init ? you might have missed the whole using AI to code whole projects, sometimes... it is not aesthetically pleasing, and you should learn not to care to much (is my take on that... or lazyness...)\n\nYou will need a .env file to configure the AI stack.\n\nNow, we tell the AI what we want to do, but why would we limit ourselves to 1 ?\n\nAm I using free endpoints for \"real\" work ? Yes, yes I am ! Does it distort my views on how much AI work should cost ? ... Why would it ? No, no, you just being a killjoy right now !\n\nA few minutes later... I got myself this (cat .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md)[/assets/blackhole/from-ralph-to-eric/prd-master.md] it doesn't really need more questions, but let's see what Claude has to say, shall we ?\n\nWell, let's answer those... some are pertinant ! I guess that's why we bring out the big guns !\n\nQuestions are asked interactivelly ;)\n\nWell, this little stunt just costed me a nice 15 cts, more or les 10x more than the first PRD generation...\n\nI don't know what is the most amazing... that\n\nI haven't decided yet...anywooooooo, time to move on and not get siderated !\n\nWhen i said seconds, i lied, I spent 5 minutes editing the file. to fix lib versions, marked install and config work as done, and, finally, set expectation for the design.\n\nthe last thing we have to do, is ask an AI to split into main tasks.\n\nonce again, i wont only do 1, but this time, I'll ask Claude to be the final task creator, from others input !\n\nAnd there goes another 8.2 cents burnt for the token Gods, but in return, we get a detailed breakdown of the tasks required to complete the project !\n\nWe still have to split those tasks though... To make them more palatable for the current crop of AI models !\n\nYou should really consider reviewing the tasks in detail before spliting, not vibe planning like a muppet ! (guess what I did ^^)\n\nI think Claude is not necessary here, but I had me $3 of openrouter credit i have to burn before the end of the month soooooo... big guns it is !\n\nBurnt a tenth of that ! but now... we are actually ready ! Almost...\n\nOr CLAUDE, or GEMINI, depends on your harness of choice, For me, it is opencode i'am going to run the /init prompt in opencode !\n\nit is not mandatory, but it is a good way to prevent dumb mistake and set some proper behavior regarding a few things, for me, i'll add the following\n\nI might add more as the agent works if i see reccuring errors and dumb things happening\n\nWell, guys, stash your parents away cause we are going to let Eric go at it !\n\nBecause I am El CheapoDev DelBrokeCasa, i am going to use my GLM coding plan to code, that way, i wont break the bank and it is OK enough for something like that i think !\n\nIf you'd rather use claude code, use the --tool claude option. (or codex/gemini/kilo) but opencode is nicer as it stream the content out (in part at least) so you see what is happening !\n\nAnd now, you wait, coffee, snacks, more coffee, diner and breakfast probably, it gonna take a while ^^\n\nHalf a day later, Eric has successfully completed the task. yaaay \\o/\n\nnpm run dev, browser to http://localhost:3001 aaaaand, it does not work.... XD\n\nI have a very fancy error page telling me about some kind of \"exceeded depth error blablabla\"... Zustand... i bloody fucking HATE Zustand !\n\nI could have gone in, open the project, read some of the 35970 lines of... 35970 LINES OF CODE ??? Naaah, dude, ain't no way i'm even thinking about that !\n\nOf course, i asked GLM to fix this obviously terrible usage of Zustand, and I even have to spend another few minutes screaming about some redirection to the / issue... I still felt like a caveman though !\n\nI mean, having to open a tool ? To do ... work ?? Like it's 2022 or something !\n\nI haven't been testing anything yet, so i'm pretty sure there'll be a few more issues, but the dev server runs, i can navigate the app without error (even in console) so it is not bad at all !\n\nI might do a follow up later on, to update you on what i had to do to get it a bit closer to the original idea (if needed ^^)\n\nSo that's the end (of this article) ! What do you think ? did you try a similar technique ? What's the plan next, cause...\n\nIf you are interested, the repo can be found on github. Is the code great ?\n\nAs for task-o-matic, the repo is on github so feel free to poke around ;)\n\nWhat about the \"Eric Loop\", how can you do that yourself ? Well, the beautiful thing with AI is that, you can actually ask it to write code ! So a quick\n\nthis being the result, your own Eric Loop, ain't life beautiful ?\n\nHope you enjoyed, I'll see you around",

    "fullText": "Embeddings are a core AI concept that underpin a great deal of what we today think of as being AI. This article is going to give you an accurate and intuitive understanding of what an “embedding” is in less time than it takes to eat a (very large) bagel, and possibly make you think they’re as cool as I think they are. It even explains how we got to embeddings as a solution, by looking at everything else we tried along the way. If you’re comfortable with even very simple Excel formulas, you’ll understand all the maths, and there’s even a cute graph with dogs on it.\n\nLet’s start by thinking about dogs, and by classifying them by their attributes:\n\nFor each dog, we’ve defined a vector where the first column is size, and the second column is intelligence. A vector is a fancy name for a row of numbers. And in two dimensions, we can plot this really easily:\n\nLet’s do some vector maths using Manhattan distance. A Great Dane ([5,5]) is 5 units away from a Beagle ([2,3]):\n\n(we’re using Manhattan distance here because it’s simple, but you might well use Euclidean distance instead)\n\nA vector can be both a specific point in our dog-embedding space, but it can also be a direction:\n\nWhat’s like a Bulldog ([3, 2]) but smaller ([-1, 0]) and smarter ([0, 1])?\n\nKey point: if we start to plot things by their attributes, and we give each attribute a number, we can use simple maths to find items that are close together (clustering) and we can easily find items that differ from a starting point in a certain way.\n\nAND WHAT’S MORE: this holds up over as many dimensions as we want to define, not just two:\n\nWe can do the same distance calculations again, even with more vectors:\n\ntldr; an embedding is a vector of numbers that describes something, and that you can use to cluster things by similarity\n\n(vector databases, like Pinecone or pgvector, are simply databases that are fast at calculating the distance between vectors, and finding vectors that are close to other vectors)\n\nDogs are easy mode, because there’s a limited number of breeds and attributes. Also, coming up with attributes ourselves is hard work, and laziness is an inarguable virtue, so let’s see if we can make the computer do the work for us here.\n\nIf we wanted to classify books instead, we’d need to do something different. Let’s start by defining a table of every book, and every word in the English language, with the values being the occurrences of each word in the book:\n\nTable 1: Number of word occurrences in each book\n\nOur vocabulary of words becomes our dimensions (or columns) and each book becomes a vector in those dimensions (rows). This is called a bag of words, a “bag” being the technical term for a mathematical object that counts the occurrences of things (but discards the order they’re in).\n\nBag of words was state of the art in approximately the 1950s for classification. There are lots of problems with this approach, and understanding those problems and how they’re solved starts to bring us closer to understanding embeddings!\n\nOne problem with our Bag of Words is that we end up with values that are proportional to the size of books, which might mean that two very similar books are quite far apart, just because they’re of very different lengths. If George RR Martin rewrote Animal Farm, it might end up very far away from the Orwell original simply due to his overly-lax editorial staff.\n\nThere’s a particularly elegant solution to this in terms of determining how close two items are by measuring the difference in angles from the origin towards them (cosine similarity), BUT there’s also the highly effective and really simple solution of just dividing the count of each word by the length of the book (normalization):\n\nTable 2: Distribution of word occurrences in each book\n\nwhich gets us most of the way there without fancy maths or words like cosine.\n\nWe’ve also got a problem here with our Bag of Words by a bunch of noise being introduced by words that are frequent but unspeakably dull, like “a”, “the”, and “of”. Different authors may lean more heavily on some than others (meaning their books are further apart in the dimensions of “of” and “a”), but that gives us absolutely no useful information about the meaning or content of what they’re writing about: what we care about is occurrences of words like dragon and android and lascivious.\n\nWe could maintain a list of dull words (often called “stop words”), and strip them out, but that’s fiddly, insufficiently lazy, and doesn’t account for the fact that what we consider to be a “stop word” might differ depending on the context.\n\nInstead, we can use some simple statistics to look at how often a word (or “term”) appears in a given book/document compared to how frequently it appears across all of the books or documents we’re looking at; this is called “TF-IDF”, and it was state-of-the-art circa 1972:\n\n(you can see the actual formula and learn more about TF-IDF here)\n\nKEY POINT: We’re still very firmly in a “words are dimensions, and books exist as points in that high-dimensional space” place here. We’re still representing books by a vector of numbers and looking for similarity by searching how close these books are to each other in a high-dimensional space. We’re just using a slightly fancier way of determining what those numbers should be.\n\nOur approach has gotten us some of the way towards classifying books well, but we start to hit some insurmountable problems in this approach:\n\nIf we have a dimension for every word in English, we have waaay too many dimensions. One for each word, and each variation of each word. At least 50,000 if we’re just covering common English words. This starts to be cumbersome and computationally expensive to do maths on.\n\nFantasy authors who insist on inventing spellings for “Sir”; there’s quite a lot of semantic information about a book embedded in having nobles with fancy titles prancing around, but our current approach gets confused when authors decide to start calling their characters “Ser” or “Syr” or “Sür” to try and sound more mysterious. More generally, we treat words with similar meanings but different spellings or forms as completely different dimensions\n\nBarking up the wrong tree: sometimes two different words are spelled identically (eg “bark”), and we don’t especially want to say that books on forestry and similar to books on puppies\n\nWord order is important! If your main character is a “dog who bites a bone” that’s likely quite a very different story from your “bone who bites a dog” character, even if the bone is haunted in both cases\n\ntldr; vectors that are simply word frequency counts are a good start, but have a whole host of problems: we need something even smarter (embeddings) to do really good clustering and classification\n\nWe have until this point been thinking about how we would classify a whole book, and using word counts as dimensions. But what if we wanted to classify just one word instead?\n\nIf we were able to come up with vectors for individual words, we could start to address the problem that “dog”, “puppy”, and “pooch” are all treated as completely different things when classifying text, and we’d also get some other useful features, like it would make it easier for us to build things like fuzzy-search for users: “pooch pics” and “dog photos” should return much the same results when a user is searching for them.\n\nWe could hand-pick some dimensions to use for this:\n\nThis … might work pretty well with enough dimensions! But hand-choosing each of the dimensions we’d need and then manually classifying (and tweaking) 50,000 words feels like it might be a lot of hard work. Hard work that the computer should be doing for us… But how do we get the computer to do that for us? The computer would need to know already what the words meant in order to do the classification, so we need a way to bootstrap that process.\n\nOne intriguing idea might be to suck in a dictionary, and to use our bag-of-words techniques on the definition of each word to come up with a vector for each word. This however gives us our own bootstrapping problem: if we look at the dictionary definition for “puppy”, it’s very different for the one for “dog”: instead, it points us to the one for “dog” instead, and solving all of this starts to sound like complicated maths will be needed.\n\nWhat if we instead tried to “know a word by the company it keeps”? It’s an idea that’s been floating around linguistics for decades, and suggests that words appearing in similar contexts probably have similar meanings. If you constantly see the words “dog” and “pooch” surrounded by words like “walk”, “leash”, “bark”, and “treats”, maybe you don’t need a dictionary to figure out they’re related?\n\nLet’s game out how this could work: you could take every piece of written text you could lay your hands on, and go through it word by word, looking at the two words ahead of it and the two words behind it. For every word, you could start to build out the probability that any other word was in those four surrounding words.\n\nFigure 1: a sliding context window, associating each word in a sentence with the two words before and after it\n\nYou could use those probabilities as the values in your vector for each word, with every other word being a dimension still, and voila, you have per-word vectors that put “pupper”, “dog”, and “pooch” very close to each other.\n\nThis is almost the massive breakthrough that researchers at Google had in 2013 inventing “Word2Vec” (word to vector), but there’s one further, crucial refinement.\n\nOur method above has two big problems. The first is one we’ve already identified: you still end up with an absolutely massive number of dimensions! These are unwieldy, difficult to work with, and computationally expensive to work with. But secondly, there’s just not enough reading text out there to make this work: there are infinite possible and sensible combinations of words, and while us humans have written down a lot of stuff, it turns out there’s simply not enough training data to make the above approach practical, IN ADDITION TO having all the drawbacks that come with these huge, unwieldy vectors.\n\nSo, when in doubt, make the computer do the work. And the tool that proved exceptionally useful for this is the mighty Neural Network.\n\nA deep-dive into how they work is out of scope, even for this increasingly long article, but the key things to know are:\n\nThey take vectors as their inputs and spit out vectors as their outputs\n\nThey’re specialized tools for learning things through giving them examples\n\nThey’re really good at prediction tasks\n\nAnd so we can flip our earlier method on its head:\n\nRather than building a huge matrix of every word and its neighbours, how about we train a Neural Network to predict what a word is, based on some neighbours?\n\nThe process for this sounds like magic:\n\nWe choose a number of dimensions we want to use, let’s say 300\n\nWe literally just make up a 300-number-long vector for every input word: it’s literally just random to begin with\n\nWe show the Neural Network billions of sets of four words, and ask it to guess the middle word\n\nWe make tiny adjustments to each of those initial random vectors based on how well the Neural Network did at guessing it (using some complicated maths called “back-propagation”)\n\nAnd over the billions and billions of times we do this, the computer eventually comes up with its own vectors for every word: vectors that really are good enough to predict what a word is going to be given its neighbours.\n\nThese same “guessing” vectors encode the meaning of words in a truly jaw-droppingly effective way. Again, it’s the principle that ‘a word is known by the company it keeps.’ If the network gets good at predicting surrounding words, the vectors it develops for each word must encode information about that word’s typical context, which relates closely to its meaning.\n\nFirst of all, it puts related words close together. “Pupper”, “pooch”, and “doggo” now all sit really close together in our dimensional space. “Sir/Ser/Syr” basically sit on top of each other. We can’t really figure out what each of these dimensions means individually: there’s not a dedicated dimension for “dog like”, but they seem to work.\n\nSecondly, remember how a vector can be either a point or a direction? Well it turns out if we start out at the vector for “king”, we subtract the vector for “man”, and add the vector for “woman”, we end up with a vector that’s almost identical to the one for “queen”. Complex semantic meaning has been encoded into our dimensions and embeddings. This shows the model learned abstract relationships (like gender and royalty) from the text data alone, encoding them into the vectors.\n\nThe above is the essence of “Word2Vec”.\n\nDo we know why this works so well? NO\n\nIs this some bad-ass alien technology shit? YES\n\nIsn’t this a cause for alarm given how much we’re starting to rely on this technology and its successors? Please take your negativity out of the AI acceleration seminar\n\nThese dense vectors that capture semantic information along dimensions that the computer literally just made up are “embeddings”. These word embeddings can then be combined (using various methods, from simple averaging to more complex techniques) to create embeddings for sentences or even whole paragraphs: you have a long list of numbers that encodes the meaning of that sentence or that paragraph.\n\nThese dense vectors help solve our earlier problems: the fixed, lower dimensionality (e.g., 300) is manageable; words with similar meanings learned from context (like ‘Sir’ and ‘Ser’) end up close together; and the context-based learning helps differentiate meanings of words like ‘bark’ depending on surrounding words (though context handling gets even better later).\n\nThese paragraph-level embeddings are what underpin most RAG systems; in practice, people use the more clever versions of embeddings that the rest of the article covers, but still. An embedding is a row of numbers that describe the meaning of some words, and then we can use simple linear algebra to cluster related things together, or move around inside the vector space using abstract paths such as “positive sentiment” or “more feminine”\n\nYou can at this point leave the article, with a pretty good idea of what embeddings are. You won’t have learned how they deal with misspellings, words that are written the same and are completely different, or word ordering, BUT, you will know that it’s possible to encode semantic meaning into vectors of a few hundred numbers. Rather than leaving the article, you can also skip ahead to Part 3, which explains how embeddings are actually used in AI.\n\nWith Word2vec, we end up with vectors that capture semantic meaning of words, and the vectors exist in a dimensional space that the computer learned by playing a guessing game over and over again. That the computer learned these dimensions by itself, and each dimension has a subtle and dense meaning means that we call those vectors “embeddings”.\n\nWe’ve also covered that you can average out these embedding to get a meaning for a sentence or a paragraph, but because this averaging process is treating those vectors as a “bag” (an unordered count of items), we lose a huge amount of meaning: the vectors for “man eats shark” and “shark eats man” are identical, even though the actual meanings differ substantially.\n\nSo rather than averaging our embeddings together, we need an operation that takes into account the sequence of the embeddings.\n\nOne of the first successful ways of doing this was with “Recurrent Neural Networks” (RNNs) – “recurrent” in this case means a neural network that accepts its last output as part of its next input (the state “recurs”). (there’s a little white lie here about the order in which these events happened that we’ll address later)\n\nHere we start out with a base vector, and we imprint each vector in the sequence on it, one at a time. After we’ve stamped each vector representing a word onto the base vector, the base vector ends up changed in a way that reflects the sequence.\n\nHere’s some Play-Doh as an example. The Play-Doh square is our base vector, and each stamp we apply over the top of the last one is the vector for a word. You’ll note that the order matters, and also that the most recent word vector ends up playing a larger role in the overall pattern we end up with than the previous ones.\n\nFigure 2: Pressing the same shapes into Play-Doh in different orders results in subtly different patterns, with the last shape often over-represented, and a faded initial shape\n\nWith Play-Doh, the more shapes you overlay on top of each other, the more you lose the previous shapes. If you add too many, you’ll end up with a complete mess you can’t make any sense of. This happens with actual Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) too! Despite this, it represented a significant improvement over just averaging together vectors.\n\nSome clever mechanisms were invented to try and prevent earlier vectors getting completely wiped out by later ones, with fancy names like LSTMs and GRUs, but both represented incremental improvements over RNNs rather than a huge leap forward.\n\nHistorical note: the above describes events as if the sequence of events was: Word2Vec -> RNNs -> LSTMs and GRUs, which isn’t accurate! RNNs as a concept and LSTMs as a refinement of them actually predate Word2vec. So, what were they using as their input vectors before we got the rich “embeddings” that Word2vec gives us? They were either using the huge “one dimension per word” vectors we discussed near the beginning of the article, or were feeding in one character at a time with each character being a dimension. Using neural networks that can understand sequences rather than bags has all sorts of uses outside of text classification, but using the newly invented Word2vec “embeddings” with these techniques was a massive leap forward.\n\nSo at the end of this section, we have improved on our Word2Vec embeddings by building embeddings that combine other embeddings in the right sequence, which solves our problem of “man eats shark” / “shark eats man”. However, we have serious problems with losing information over sequences of any real length: by the time we get to the end of “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy sheep dog”, we’ve added so much extra information that “quick” and “brown” have kind of been smushed together, and we’re very much more “dog” focused than we are “fox” focused because it occured later in the sentence.\n\nFigure 3: After each addition of a vector onto our hidden state, previous vectors get “blurrier” and more recent vectors dominate\n\nRNNs gave us much stronger embeddings than we had before, but ultimately these days we derive embeddings from the same technology that powers Large Language Models: a technique called attention and the system that uses it, the transformer. A proper deep-dive into the steps that take us from RNNs to transformers is too big for this already unwieldy article, but in short we train the computer to pay more attention to some words in a sentence than to others.\n\nThat’s probably how us humans do it too: your brain naturally ‘pays attention’ to the most important words (like the subject and verb, or key nouns) and how they relate, even if they are far apart. The ‘attention mechanism’ in AI tries to mimic this.\n\nWhen processing a sequence of words, with attention we keep track of all the intermediate embeddings we’d generated rather than mashing them all together into one single vector. We add an extra neural network over that where we train further vectors to correlate how important each word is to every other word in the sequence. This whole system – including the new neural network – is trained the same way as we trained RNNs: by playing “guess the word” and getting the computer to update its internal parameters when it gets something right or wrong, until it’s usually getting them right!\n\nTransformers take this attention mechanism even further, and are the technology that powers large language models. Using those to generate our embeddings, we get embeddings that can accurately describe even pretty long pieces of text well, and are free of almost all of the issues we’ve identified so far in this article. Commercial vendors like OpenAI offer very effective (and cost-effective!) general-purpose APIs for turning large chunks of text into embeddings for use in your applications.\n\nFirst of all, rather than using whole words as inputs, LLMs use tokens. These are fragments of words that are chosen (by the computer) during training to be a representative sample of commonly-appearing sequences. By using bits of words instead of whole words, we gain the ability to deal with words we haven’t seen before, which includes misspellings of words. For example, it might understand ‘embeddingtastic’ by recognizing the known tokens ‘embedding’ and ‘tastic’.\n\nFigure 4: the OpenAI tokenizer in action. Common words are their own tokens, but less common words are split into fragments to help deal with the vast range of possible words including misspellings.\n\nSecondly, chances are the majority of time you spend using LLMs you’ll be using “autoregressive” ones: they generate the next token for you, token by token. There are however important LLMs that are trained to guess the missing token inside a block of text, that will use the tokens both before and after the target token to try and figure it out: guess the word, but the word in the middle of the sentence instead of the next word.\n\nOK, so we’ve learned what embeddings are, and they’re pretty darn cool, but why do we care? When are you, the busy young lady or young man, actually going to interact with an embedding? We hand-waved over it a little before, but the embeddings created using the same mechanism as LLMs (transformers) can take in very long pieces of text and give back exceptionally sophisticated vectors that capture complex meanings from that text. These aren’t just theoretical toys; they’re the mechanism behind a surprising amount of what we call AI today.\n\n(we’ve also pretended that embeddings are just for working with text, which also isn’t true, but we’re already at over 5,000 words here…)\n\nRemember classifying dogs? We picked the features: size, intelligence, fluffiness. Easy for dogs, but hopeless for text. Trying to hand-pick features for classifying emails or news articles (“Does it mention ‘invoice’?” “How many times does ‘politics’ appear?”) is fragile and labor-intensive. Embeddings flip this entirely. Instead of us telling the computer what features matter, the computer learns the important features itself when creating the embedding, using the guessing game we outlined above. These aren’t just keyword counts; they’re learned features capturing the underlying topic, the vibe, the subtle nuances.\n\nThink about classifying customer reviews as ‘Positive’ or ‘Negative’. A simple keyword approach gets tripped up by sarcasm, varied phrasing, or subtleties in word ordering. Embeddings, however, capture the overall essence. They turn the review into coordinates in a high-dimensional ‘meaning space’. A happy review’s embedding might land near coordinates representing ‘joy’ and ‘satisfaction’ (dimensions the model learned!), while an angry one lands near ‘frustration’. The magic is that embeddings handle nuance: synonyms like “happy,” “pleased,” and “elated” end up in the same positive neighborhood.\n\nSo, you feed this rich embedding – these coordinates packed with learned features and context – into a classifier model. The classifier’s job becomes much simpler: it just learns to draw boundaries in that meaning space. “Everything landing in this region is Positive, everything over there is Negative.” The embedding does the heavy lifting of understanding the text; the classifier just reads the map. It’s spookily effective.\n\nSometimes you don’t know in advance what categories you want to put things into. You’ve got a mountain of customer reviews, research papers, or social media posts, and you just want to know “what are the main themes here?” This is where clustering comes in, and embeddings super-charges it.\n\nBecause embeddings place texts with similar meanings close together in that high-dimensional space we keep talking about, we can use algorithms to automatically find groups, or “clusters,” of related items. Think back to our dogs: if we plotted thousands of individual dogs based only on their learned embeddings (without knowing breeds), clustering algorithms could find the clumps corresponding to Poodles or Beagles just by seeing which dogs’ vectors are close together.\n\nIt’s the same for text: these algorithms scan the positions (embeddings) of your documents in meaning-space and identify these natural groupings. Suddenly, you can see that your customer reviews naturally fall into clusters like “Complaints about Shipping”, “Praise for Product Quality”, and “Confused People Asking How To Turn It On”. No predefined categories needed, the structure just emerges from the meaning captured in the embeddings.\n\nThis is the technique du jour for making LLMs smarter and more factual, and it leans heavily on embeddings. The core idea is surprisingly elegant: when you ask an LLM a question, you first use the embedding of your question to find relevant pieces of information (like paragraphs from a document) from a database.\n\nHow? Because of a slightly magical property: the embedding for a question is often geometrically close to the embedding of the text containing its answer within that vector space. It’s like the question “Where is the Eiffel Tower?” generates a vector that points towards the same region of meaning-space as the text “The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.”\n\nSo, in a RAG system, you take the user’s query, generate the embedding for it, and then use a vector database (a fast database optimized for finding close vectors) to retrieve the chunks of text from your provided documents whose embeddings are closest. You then stuff these relevant chunks from your knowledge base into the prompt you give the LLM along with the original question. Voilà! The LLM now has the specific information needed to answer accurately, rather than just relying on its (potentially outdated or hallucinated) general knowledge. It’s like giving the LLM an open-book exam, using embeddings to find the right page in the textbook.\n\nOkay, slight caveat here: the final output embeddings we’ve discussed (like the ones you get from OpenAI’s API) aren’t exactly what LLMs use second-by-second to generate text. But the underlying principle is deeply connected.\n\nWhen an LLM is writing text, predicting the next token (word fragment), it maintains an internal “state.” This state is essentially a complex, evolving vector representation that captures the meaning and context of everything generated so far. Think of it as a temporary, super-sophisticated embedding of the preceding sequence. This internal state vector is what the LLM uses to figure out the probabilities for what the very next token should be.\n\nSo while you don’t directly use a final document embedding to generate text token-by-token, the same transformer architecture and attention mechanisms that create those powerful final embeddings are also at work inside the LLM, constantly creating and updating internal context vectors (which behave a lot like embeddings) to drive the generation process. It’s all part of the same family of vector-based meaning representation.\n\nSo, there you have it! Embeddings! Aren’t they cool?! We started with simple lists of numbers describing dogs, wrestled with the messy realities of counting words in books, and journeyed through decades of AI research, from Bag of Words to TF-IDF, Word2Vec, RNNs, and finally the mighty Transformers.\n\nWhat we ended up with are these dense, powerful vectors – embeddings – that somehow manage to capture the meaning of text in a way that computers can work with mathematically, while just literally being lists of numbers. They’re not just lists of word counts; they’re rich representations learned by machines playing incredibly complex guessing games, encoding semantic relationships, context, and nuance along dimensions we didn’t even know we needed.\n\nAre they slightly mysterious? Yes. Do we understand every nuance of why they work so well? Not entirely. But are they incredibly useful? Absolutely. From classifying spam, to finding themes in data, to making LLMs smarter with RAG, embeddings are a fundamental building block of modern AI. They might just be weirdly effective rows of numbers, but they’re our weirdly effective rows of numbers, and they’re changing how we interact with information. Thanks, embeddings.",

    "fullText": "The European Commission has proposed new cybersecurity legislation mandating the removal of high-risk suppliers to secure telecommunications networks and strengthening defenses against state-backed and cybercrime groups targeting critical infrastructure.\n\nThis move follows years of frustration over the uneven application of the EU's voluntary 5G Security Toolbox, introduced in January 2020 to encourage member states to limit reliance on high-risk vendors.\n\nAlthough the proposal does not name specific companies, EU officials have expressed concerns about Chinese tech companies (such as Huawei and ZTE) when the 5G Security Toolbox was implemented.\n\nThe new cybersecurity package would grant the Commission authority to organize EU-wide risk assessments and to support restrictions or bans on certain equipment used in sensitive infrastructure. EU member states would also jointly assess risks across the EU's 18 critical sectors based onthe suppliers' countries of origin and national security implications.\n\n\"Cybersecurity threats are not just technical challenges. They are strategic risks to our democracy, economy, and way of life,\" EU tech commissioner Henna Virkkunen said today.\n\n\"With the new Cybersecurity Package, we will have the means in place to better protect our critical ICT supply chains but also to combat cyber attacks decisively. This is an important step in securing our European technological sovereignty and ensuring a greater safety for all.\"\n\nThe legislation also includes a revised Cybersecurity Act, designed to secure information and communication technology (ICT) supply chains, that mandates removing high-risk foreign suppliers from European mobile telecommunications networks.\n\nThe revised Cybersecurity Act will also streamline certification procedures for companies, allowing them to reduce regulatory burdens and costs through voluntary certification schemes managed by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA).\n\nAs the Commission further explained, the new legislation empowers ENISA to issue early threat alerts, operate a single entry point for incident reporting, and help companies in responding to ransomware attacks, in cooperation with Europol and computer security incident response teams.\n\nENISA will also establish EU-wide cybersecurity skills attestation schemes and pilot a Cybersecurity Skills Academy to build a European cybersecurity workforce.\n\nThe Cybersecurity Act will take effect immediately upon approval by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, with member states having one year to implement cybersecurity amendments into national law.\n\nWhether you're cleaning up old keys or setting guardrails for AI-generated code, this guide helps your team build securely from the start.\n\nGet the cheat sheet and take the guesswork out of secrets management.",

The plane is set to be replaced in 2028 by two newer, modified 747-8s estimated to cost over $5 billion in total.\n\nAmid frustrations over delays to the new aircraft, Trump has courted the idea of using another 747-8, gifted to him by the Qatari government, as Air Force One instead.\n\nThe president has said that he plans to keep the $400 million luxury aircraft, which the Defense Department accepted as a gift in May 2025.\n\nThe press pool report sent on Tuesday evening said that Leavitt had joked to reporters that the Qatari jet sounded \"much better\" after the recent technical issue. The report added that the lights in the press cabin went out briefly after takeoff, but that the reason was unclear.\n\nTrump's threats to take over Greenland have been a huge talking point at Davos. He has repeatedly said he wants to buy the semi-autonomous territory, which is governed by Denmark, and is not opposed to using military force to take it.\n\nBefore taking off on Tuesday, the president said in a press briefing that he has a \"lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland\" at Davos.\n\n\"I think things are going to work out pretty well,\" he said to reporters.\n\nHe also said on Saturday that he would impose an additional 10% tariff on Denmark, as well as Sweden, Norway, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, if the European countries do not strike a deal with the US to hand over Greenland.",

    "fullText": "Adios to casual dating: Young Americans are seeking committed life partners to split bills with.\n\nQuincy Yang, the co-CEO of dating app Coffee Meets Bagel, told Business Insider that money and economics are huge considerations for Gen Z when choosing a partner.\n\n\"It's so hard to afford to buy a house, or any property,\" Yang said, adding that a lot of younger people are staying at home with their parents. He said for older generations, it was more affordable to \"live the American dream\" of buying a home and starting a family.\n\n\"Now, you need dual incomes to afford just the median condo or house. You need to have a pretty good job; you can't slack off too much,\" he said.\n\nYang said the affordability crisis has affected dating. \"There's an incentive now to find a good partner who is financially stable and ambitious.\"\n\nShn Juay, Yang's co-CEO, said that this is evident in Gen Zers not being as into hookups as older generations.\n\n\"When you talk about dating apps, the first thing that comes to mind will be hookups,\" she said. \"But the Gen Zs are really more conscious about more real things in their life, they're not into hookups. Unlike the previous generation, what they imagine of an ideal partner is very pragmatic.\"\n\nThe CEOs said that daters should choose dealbreakers judiciously while finding a partner.\n\n\"You can always go for a higher degree, or you get promoted along the way, but not at age 28 years old, where everybody's probably still really early in their career,\" Juay told Business Insider.\n\nLiving in the US is more expensive than ever.\n\nHousing costs have been rising faster than incomes over the last two decades, according to a June 2024 report by the US Treasury Department.\n\nGrocery prices are not providing any relief. US food prices rose nearly 25% from 2020 to 2024, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on foreign goods this year has exacerbated this problem by forcing retailers like Walmart and Target to raise prices.\n\nIn this climate, living alone has become an unaffordable luxury for many Americans.\n\nA Pew Research Center study released in January said more US adults are living with a partner. The study analyzed US Census Bureau data and found that the percentage of adults living without a partner decreased from 44% in 2019 to 42% in 2023.\n\nSo naturally, finances are a big priority for daters.\n\nIn November, the dating app, which has around 20 million users worldwide, conducted a survey of about 1,050 of its users in the US between the ages of 21 and 35. The respondents were working professionals who said they were either actively seeking a relationship or open to one.\n\nThe survey revealed that financial stability was a top priority for them, with 54% of the respondents listing it as such. Almost 60% labeled \"ambition/drive\" as a must-have in a potential partner, even more than having shared interests.\n\n\"While many are looking for someone to spend their life with, practical matters still reign supreme,\" said Coffee Meets Bagel, which markets its app as \"for serious daters.\"",

    "fullText": "Tariff price hikes are starting to show up in your Amazon shopping cart.\n\nThe CEO of Amazon, Andy Jassy, told CNBC in an interview with reporter Becky Quick at the World Economic Forum in Davos that vendors are running out of stockpiled goods imported ahead of Trump's tariffs, and that consumers will be \"starting to see more of that impact.\"\n\n\"So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items,\" said Jassy, \"And you see some sellers are deciding that they're passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they'll absorb it to drive demand, and some are doing something in between.\"\n\nJassy also said that though the company is striving to \"keep prices as low as possible,\" price hikes may sometimes be inevitable.\n\n\"At a certain point, because retail is, as you know, a mid-single digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it,\" Jassy added. \"You don't have endless options.\"\n\nWhile Amazon's shopping business has its own products, it mainly serves as an ecommerce platform for other independent sellers, so it cannot control price hikes. Earlier in Trump's tariff push, a rumour that Amazon would start displaying exactly how much tariffs contributed to the cost of an item drew the president's ire. Amazon said it never made such plans.\n\nIn June 2025, Jassy told CNBC in an interview that many of Amazon's third-party selling partners \"forward deployed a lot of inventory\" to avoid \"issues with the uncertainty around where tariffs are going to settle,\" adding that at that point, he did not see \"prices appreciably go up.\"\n\nThe bulk of Trump's tariffs have been enacted under presidential emergency powers, including the 10% baseline levy on almost all imports. His right to impose such duties is being reviewed by the US Supreme Court after multiple small businesses filed lawsuits.\n\nIf SCOTUS rules these tariffs unconstitutional, Scott Bessent, the Secretary of the Treasury, said in a court document that the government could be on the hook to refund $1 trillion to businesses that paid. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank, 96% of the new revenue collected by the US Customs is being paid by American consumers, while foreign exporters only shouldered 4% of the burden.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday seeking to limit large Wall Street investors from buying single-family homes, as part of his push to make essentials more affordable for Americans.\n\nThe order details a multi-pronged plan targeting large investors. It includes measures that would restrict institutional investors from buying homes that individuals could purchase, combat speculation in the single-family housing market, and conduct antitrust reviews of acquisitions.\n\nThe order comes with an important exception: build-to-rent properties that were designed and constructed as rental communities. The order also says there may be other \"narrowly tailored exceptions.\"\n\nPer the order, the Treasury Department has a month to develop definitions of \"large institutional investors\" and \"single-family homes.\" Relevant federal agencies have 60 days to look at ways to prohibit the buying of single-family homes by large entities.\n\n\"Neighborhoods and communities once controlled by middle-class American families are now run by faraway corporate interests. People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump said in the order.\n\nTrump first proposed the order in a Truth Social post earlier this month. \"For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,\" Trump wrote. \"That American dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans.\"\n\nA day later, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Trump's proposal would not force large entities to sell their current holdings.\n\n\"These big institutions buy housing, then rent them out, and they're able to depreciate it. They hide their earnings, pay lower taxes,\" he said.\n\n\"The idea here is bygones are bygones,\" Bessent added. \"We're not going to have a forced sale here.\"\n\nAfter Trump's Truth Social post earlier this month, shares of asset manager Blackstone fell 5.6%. Blackstone, which manages $1 trillion in assets, oversees one of the largest rental housing portfolios in the US, with several hundred thousand single-family homes and apartments. Other stocks similarly fell.\n\nCritics say firms like New York-based Blackstone put pressure on the housing market, reducing the availability of homes and driving prices up.\n\nThe institutional players, meanwhile, say lack of housing supply — not big-business ownership — is pushing prices up.\n\nAmong Trump's efforts to address affordability concerns, the president also called for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates, arguing that consumers are being \"ripped off\" by rates that he said can be as high as 20% or 30%. Banks and business leaders said that the rule would ultimately curtail the availability of credit for borrowers who rely on it.",

He said fiber was \"going to be big\" this year.\n\nPepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta predicted in an October earnings call that \"fiber will be the next protein.\"\n\nThe term \"fibermaxxing\" was a viral health trend on social media in 2025, with dieticians saying that it helps aid gut health, lower cholesterol, and reduce the risk of colon cancer.\n\nAnd cabbage, a fiber-rich vegetable, is having its moment on social media, with Pinterest predicting that the vegetable would trend highest on social media in the US in 2026.\n\nPinterest released its annual trends report in December, which showed that the search term \"cabbage dumplings\" rose 110% from September 2024 to August 2025, compared to the same period the year before.",

Business Insider reached out to the contact provided on the website and did not immediately get a response.\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration has been aggressively executing on immigration enforcement; some of the tactics have led to highly publicized clashes between local community members and ICE agents.\n\nMinneapolis — the city where George Floyd was killed by a police officer — recently became a focal point of an immigration crackdown, and where an ICE officer fatally shot Renee Good, a US citizen.\n\nThe Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, an AFL-CIO affiliate, endorsed a move on Saturday encouraging local residents to skip work on January 23.\n\nThe White House has also targeted the tech industry by attaching a higher fee to the H-1B visa — a program tech companies and other industries have relied on to hire overseas talent.\n\nThe move has seen ripple effects from Big Tech, down to higher education.\n\nData from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center showed a 5.9% decline in enrollment at US universities by graduate international students for the Fall 2025 semester.",

    "description": "A new report warns the U.S. could lose the ability to sustain combat within weeks of a China war over Taiwan, as munitions run dry, logistics collapse and global markets face a $10T shock.",
    "fullText": "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration asked for redactions to a sweeping new Heritage Foundation report modeling a potential U.S.–China war over Taiwan, even though the analysis relied entirely on publicly available, unclassified data, according to the report’s authors.\n\nThe redacted report, TIDALWAVE, warns that the United States could reach a breaking point within weeks of a high‑intensity conflict with China — conclusions that the authors say prompted senior national security officials to seek redactions over concerns adversaries could exploit the findings or use them to identify U.S. and allied military vulnerabilities.\n\nThose conclusions include warnings that U.S. forces would culminate far sooner than China, suffer catastrophic losses to aircraft and sustainment infrastructure in the Pacific, and still fail to prevent a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, nearly a tenth of global GDP.\n\nSKIES AT STAKE: INSIDE THE US-CHINA RACE FOR AIR DOMINANCE\n\nAccording to the report's authors, the AI‑enabled model drew exclusively on open‑source government, academic, industry and commercial information. An unredacted version of the report was provided to authorized U.S. government recipients for internal use.\n\nUnlike traditional tabletop war games, TIDALWAVE employs an AI‑enabled model that runs thousands of iterations, tracking how losses in platforms, munitions, and fuel compound over time and drive cascading operational failure early in the conflict.\n\nAccording to a Heritage spokesperson, the report had been shown to \"high-level national security officials\" who requested some of the specifics be crossed out in black ink before its release to the public. The report still details how quickly U.S. forces could reach a breaking point and why the conflict would carry global consequences.\n\n\"Redactions were made at the request of the U.S. government to prevent disclosure of information that could reasonably enable an adversary to (1) re mediate or ‘close’ critical vulnerabilities that the United States and its allies could otherwise exploit, or (2) identify or exploit U.S. and allied vulnerabilities in ways that could degrade operational endurance, resilience, or deterrence,\" the report said.\n\nA Department of War spokesperson declined to comment on discussions surrounding TIDALWAVE's publication, but added: \"The Department of War does not endorse, validate, or adjudicate third-party analyses, nor do we engage publicly on hypothetical conflict modeling. As a general matter, we take seriously the protection of information that, if aggregated or contextualized, could have implications for operational security.\"\n\nThe White House could not be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to the report’s redacted findings, the U.S. would culminate in less than half the time required for the People's Republic of China in a high-intensity conflict. Culmination is defined as the point at which a force becomes incapable of continuing operations due to the loss of platforms, ammunition and/or fuel.\n\nThe report is explicit that the first 30 days to 60 days of a U.S.-China war determine its long-term shape and outcome, as early losses in aircraft, ships, fuel throughput and munitions rapidly compound and cannot be recovered on operationally relevant timelines.\n\nThe report concludes that the U.S. is not equipped nor arrayed to protect and sustain the Joint Force in a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. Rapid platform attrition, brittle logistics, concentrated basing and insufficient industrial surge capacity combine to force an early operational breaking point for American forces.\n\nThe report warns that U.S. reliance on a few large, concentrated forward bases — particularly in Japan and Guam — leaves American airpower dangerously exposed to Chinese missile forces.\n\nIn multiple scenarios, up to 90% of U.S. and allied aircraft positioned at major forward bases are destroyed on the ground during the opening phase of the conflict, as runways, fuel depots, command facilities and parked aircraft are hit simultaneously.\n\nThe report finds that critical U.S. precision‑guided munitions — including long‑range anti‑ship missiles, air‑to‑air interceptors and missile‑defense systems — begin to be unavailable within five to seven days of major combat operations. Across most scenarios, those critical munitions are completely exhausted within 35 days to 40 days, leaving U.S. forces unable to sustain high‑tempo combat.\n\nFuel emerges as the most decisive vulnerability of all. The report makes a critical distinction: the U.S. does not run out of fuel in most scenarios — it loses the ability to move fuel under fire.\n\nCHINA’S MISSILE SURGE PUTS EVERY US BASE IN THE PACIFIC AT RISK — AND THE WINDOW TO RESPOND IS CLOSING\n\nChinese doctrine explicitly prioritizes attacks on logistics vessels, ports, pipelines and replenishment tankers. Even limited tanker losses, port disruptions or pipeline severance are sufficient to drive fuel throughput below survivable levels, forcing commanders to sharply curtail air and naval operations despite fuel remaining in aggregate stockpiles.\n\nChinese ammunition stockpiles of critical munitions begin to be depleted after approximately 20 days to 30 days of major combat operations. However, substitution effects extend China’s ability to sustain combat operations out to months — well beyond the point at which U.S. forces culminate, according to the report.\n\nThe consequences extend far beyond the battlefield.\n\nThe redacted report concludes the U.S. is highly unlikely to prevent massive global economic fallout once a Taiwan conflict begins.\n\nDisruption of shipping lanes, destruction of critical infrastructure and the collapse of Taiwan’s semiconductor production would trigger a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, with enduring ripple effects across financial markets, manufacturing and global trade.\n\nThe report comes amid years of concern over U.S. military readiness and industrial capacity, as China rapidly expands its naval forces and shipbuilding base.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates a smaller fleet than planned, while American shipyards face workforce shortages, aging infrastructure and chronic delays — even as China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, continues to outpace the U.S. in producing new naval hulls.\n\nWar Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders have vowed to put the Pentagon on a wartime footing for industrial capacity.\n\nPerhaps most alarming, TIDALWAVE warns that the scale of losses in the Indo‑Pacific would leave the U.S. unable to deter or respond effectively to a second major conflict elsewhere in the world.\n\nA war over Taiwan could open the door to follow‑on aggression by adversaries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, fundamentally destabilizing the global security order.\n\nThe report is blunt in its assessment: existing Pentagon programs and congressional funding are too slow, too fragmented and too modest to address the scale of the challenge. In many cases, the timeline required to fix critical vulnerabilities exceeds the likely timeline to conflict.\n\nTo avoid what the authors describe as a strategic defeat, the report urges Congress to immediately expand munitions stockpiles, strengthen fuel reserves and distribution infrastructure, harden and disperse forward bases, and accelerate sustainment and logistics reforms. Without rapid action, the authors warn, the U.S. risks entering a conflict it is structurally unprepared to fight or sustain.\n\nWith intelligence warnings mounting that China could move on Taiwan before the end of the decade, TIDALWAVE cautions that the window to correct these deficiencies may be closing faster than Washington is prepared to act.",

    "title": "If You Feel Relieved After Someone Cancels Plans Here’s What It Says About You",
    "description": "Here what it means if you feel relieved when someone cancels plans.",
    "fullText": "If your first emotion after someone cancels is relief instead of disappointment, it’s worth paying attention to that reaction. Relief is data. It tells you something about your energy, boundaries, and how that relationship fits into your life. If this happens more often than you expect, these reasons may explain why.\n\nRelief often shows up when your schedule is stretched thin. You may have agreed to plans out of habit, not capacity. The cancellation gives you breathing room you didn’t realize you needed. Your body relaxes before your mind catches up.\n\nBurnout research shows that chronic overcommitment dulls our ability to notice exhaustion until it’s relieved. Relief is the signal. It means rest mattered more than attendance. That’s not laziness—it’s self-preservation.\n\nSometimes, relief simply means the plan didn’t align with your desires. You said yes to be polite, loyal, or avoid awkwardness. The cancellation removes the obligation. Honesty arrives late.\n\nThis pattern often reflects people-pleasing tendencies. Psychologists note that suppressed preferences resurface as relief when obligations disappear. It’s not antisocial—it’s misaligned consent.\n\nIf relief follows a cancellation consistently with the same person, the relationship may require more energy than it gives. Conversation feels effortful. You prepare emotionally before seeing them. The relief tells you something isn’t balanced.\n\nEmotional labor research shows that one-sided relational effort increases fatigue. Relief is your nervous system standing down. It doesn’t lie.\n\nPlans made out of obligation often feel heavy. You may have worried about expectations, small talk, or performing socially. When those pressures vanish, relief follows. Your system returns to baseline.\n\nSocial anxiety studies highlight anticipatory stress as a major driver of avoidance relief. Even enjoyable people can feel overwhelmed under pressure. Relief reflects reduced threat, not rejection.\n\nSpontaneous free time can feel like oxygen. If relief shows up, it may mean you’re craving autonomy. Plans remove flexibility. Cancellation restores choice.\n\nTime-use research suggests unstructured time improves mood and creativity. Relief is your mind welcoming space. It’s a legitimate need, not a flaw.\n\nEmotional capacity fluctuates. On days when you’ve already held space for others, additional interaction feels taxing. Cancellation gives you permission to stop giving. Relief follows naturally.\n\nTherapists often describe this as emotional saturation. When capacity is exceeded, even neutral interactions feel heavy. Relief is a sign that you reached your limit.\n\nSome plans require energy you don’t have—enthusiasm, conversation, presence. If relief appears, you may have been bracing for performance. Cancellation removes the stage.\n\nSocial performance fatigue is increasingly discussed in mental health research. Constant self-monitoring drains energy. Relief is rest from being observed.\n\nIf you feel relieved not to engage, it may be because the interaction doesn’t feel fully safe. You filter yourself. You manage reactions. That vigilance is exhausting.\n\nPsychological safety research shows that environments requiring self-censorship increase stress. Relief means the vigilance stopped. That matters.\n\nSometimes, relief signals transition. What once fit no longer does. The cancellation confirms a quiet truth you’ve been avoiding. Growth creates distance.\n\nDevelopmental psychology notes that relational needs evolve over time. Relief doesn’t mean the relationship was bad—it means it may be complete.\n\nConnection is valuable, but so is recovery. If relief shows up, your body may be asking for stillness instead. Rest becomes the priority. That’s information, not failure.\n\nBurnout studies consistently show recovery is essential for relational health. You can’t connect well when depleted. Relief honors that limit.\n\nSometimes plans don’t account for your needs or preferences. You go along anyway. Cancellation feels relieving because it removes that invisibility. You don’t have to adapt.\n\nRelational satisfaction research links feeling seen to engagement. Relief signals that visibility was missing. That’s worth noticing.\n\nHabitual yeses disconnect you from desire. Relief interrupts that pattern. It creates a pause. You get a moment to recalibrate.\n\nBehavioral studies show automatic compliance increases resentment over time. Relief is the emotional correction. It invites choice back in.\n\nAt its core, relief is physiological. Tension leaves your body. Shoulders drop. Breath deepens. That response doesn’t happen without reason.\n\nSomatic psychology emphasizes that the body registers truth before the mind does. Relief isn’t random. It’s communication. And it deserves your attention.",

    "fullText": "In aviation, the Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) is the primary certification that allows a civil airline to start running and selling flights to passengers.\n\nIn the U.S., it is given out by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), while equivalent government agencies granting AOCs include the Civil Aviation Authority in the United Kingdom, Transport Canada, the Direction générale de l’aviation civile in France, and Luftfartsverket, or the Swedish Civil Aviation Administration, in Sweden.\n\nReceiving the AOC requires the airline to prove that it has the necessary planes, staff, safety systems and financial resources to both run flights and remain a functional airline into the coming years.\n\nAs aviation is a particularly costly industry, lack of funds has caused multiple airlines to shut down and eventually lose their AOC license in the last year.\n\nLast November, Lithuanian aviation company Aviation Solutions Group ended all operations of the SmartLynx airline when authorities in Estonia revoked its license in the country. The AOCs for branches in Latvia and Malta were subsequently sold to Dutch hedge-fund company Stitching Break Point, in the hopes that an airline may be able to relaunch after finding an investor.\n\nIn the U.S., charter seaplane airline Tailwind Air lost its license in January 2025 after branding itself as a luxury transportation company, but then struggling to bring in the necessary traffic on its routes between Northeastern cities like New York and Boston.\n\nAs first reported by ch-aviation, the latest airline to lose its AOC license is Swedish charter airline H-Bird. A spokesperson for the Swedish Transport Agency (Transportstyrelsen) confirmed that the airline, launched in 1991 to run charter flights to remote parts of Swedish from Stockholm and several other European cities, lost its operating license on Dec. 5, 2025, over financing issues.\n\nWhile very few details around whether it has filed for bankruptcy are publicly available, the situation looks very similar to that of Tailwind Air. The airline targeted high-end travelers who book charter flights, but it was unable to bring in enough customers to remain profitable.\n\nThe airline has not run any flights since the start of 2026; it is unclear whether any travelers were affected by cancellations.\n\nSpirit Airlines (Spirit Aviation Holdings, Inc.): Filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time on August 29,2025.\n\nRavn Alaska: Ceased operations in August 2025 after earlier Chapter 11 proceedings; shut down flights and folded into other operations such as New Pacific.\n\nCorporate Air: Filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (restructuring) in September 2025 as part of a planned sale, according to Bondoro.\n\nPlay Airlines: The Reykjavik-based airline shut down operations and entered involuntary bankruptcy in September 2025.\n\nBraathens Airlines:The airline was forced to file for bankruptcy and canceled all of its flights in September 2025.",

    "fullText": "Earlier this month, NASA announced that it had to cancel a scheduled spacewalk, citing a “medical situation” affecting a “single crew member who is stable” on board the International Space Station.\n\nThe mystery illness eventually led to the space agency staging the first medical evacuation in 25 years of continuous operation on board the aging orbital outpost, rushing four astronauts back to Earth in a move that brought the station’s number of occupants from seven to a skeleton crew of just three.\n\nWhile the medical incident only affected a single astronaut, who has yet to be identified for privacy reasons, all four members of the Crew-11 mission cut their time on board the ISS short by weeks, safely splashing down off the coast of San Diego early Thursday morning.\n\nThe four astronauts were airlifted to the Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego via helicopter for a “planned overnight stay at a local medical facility for additional evaluation,” according to a January 16 statement. After being “released as expected,” they continued their journey to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will “continue standard postflight reconditioning and evaluations.”\n\nDo you know anything about what caused the evacuation from the ISS? Drop us a line at tips@futurism.com. We can keep you anonymous.\n\n“All crew members remain stable,” the space agency reassured. “To protect the crew’s medical privacy, no specific details regarding the condition or individual will be shared.”\n\nIt’s an exceedingly rare event, highlighting the challenges inherent to providing healthcare in space. While hundreds of miles above the surface, specialized care is hard, if not impossible, to execute. While astronauts undergo rigorous EMT-level training so they can respond to emergencies on board the station, they aren’t full-blown medical professionals, and can only do so much under the direction of doctors back on Earth.\n\nThere’s a lot to still learn about providing care during medical emergencies, particularly when it comes to long-duration space exploration missions into deep space. According to a 2022 study, there still are plenty of “gaps in knowledge regarding the potential for unanticipated in-flight medical events to affect crew health and capacity, and potentially compromise mission success.”\n\nAs researchers from Northumbria University in Newcastle point out in a recent essay for The Conversation, medical emergencies are remarkably rare on the ISS, despite being expected to occur on average every three years. Studies have shown that the most common health issues astronauts experience are skin irritation, congestion, disruptions to sleep, and in-flight injuries — most of which are ironically caused by exercise, which is designed to protect astronauts’ long-term health.\n\nSpending prolonged periods in a microgravity environment has also been shown to affect astronauts’ vision and blood pressure.\n\nNow that there’s finally been a medical emergency on the station, though, it’s unclear whether the public — or even the broader medical community — will ever find out any details.\n\nMore on the evacuation: Entire Space Station Down to Skeleton Crew After NASA Evacuation",

    "description": "Scientists discovered ancient micro-burrows in desert rocks likely made by microbes millions of years ago, though their exact identity and fate remain unknown.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nMysterious micro-burrows in desert marble and limestone were probably made by microbes that lived millions of years ago.\n\nExactly what kind of microbes bored into the rock remains unknown, as does whether they still exist or have long since gone extinct.\n\nWhatever formed the burrows had to be alive, since researchers were able to rule out weathering and abiotic processes.\n\nFor most organisms on Earth, rocks are objects, not food. But for one oddball microbe, desert limestone seems to have been on the menu. Whether or not this mysterious form of life still exists or went extinct eons ago is, however, yet unknown.\n\nRecently, geologist Cees Passchier from Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz came across what looked like tiny burrows in marble and limestone in the deserts of Namibia, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. Erosion had exposed the fossil burrows, and while nothing was crawling in there anymore, Passchier and his research team investigated further and found biological material inside.\n\n“A biotic origin of the observed structures supposes the presence of liquid water, without which biological growth would be impossible,” the team said in a study published in the Geomicrobiology Journal. “The investigated areas are currently arid, but experience occasional rain showers and regular dense coastal fog, while wet periods occurred in the past.”\n\nSo, what type of microogranisms could have made the burrows? Bacteria, fungi and lichens have shown that they can survive extreme conditions, and some of them are endolithic, meaning they live inside rocks. Passchier wanted to see if the organisms that created the burrows could possibly belong to any of these groups. Fungi can bore through rocks and leave behind tubes, and some types of cyanobacteria also thrive off limestone or marble.\n\nIt is unlikely that the mystery organisms were cyanobacteria—they need sunlight for photosynthesis, so they don’t bore nearly as deep into rock as the burrows that the team found. Fungi secrete digestive agents that were not present in the rock, and they also create a complex network of hyphae, or filaments, known as a mycelium. Mycelial networks tend to have order to them. The burrows were parallel and evenly spaced, which would be unusual for fungi, and there were no other patterns observed. So, they probably aren’t the culprits, either.\n\nBecause the burrows were found to be too wide to have only been made by one organism at a time, and they showed growth rings, its was more likely that they were formed by colonies of microbes. Calcium carbonate dust found in the tunnels is also a common excretion from microbes that live in these types of rocks. However, no fossilized organisms have yet been found—just evidence of their existence.\n\nThese setbacks, however, did not rule out the idea of life. On the contrary—while weathering or abiotic chemical processes can create structures mistaken for signs of life, a thorough microscopic examination showed this was not the case. The chemical composition of rock samples from inside the burrows showed that whatever made them had to have been alive.\n\n“As no known chemical or physical weathering mechanism can explain this phenomenon with the microstructural and geochemical observations presented here, and the micro-burrows form inside the host rock,” Passchier and his colleagues said in the same study, “we suggest that they are of biological origin.”\n\nWhatever microbes carved out the tunnels have been long dead, though there are questions around whether the mystery species still exists. Maybe it’s still creeping around somewhere, digging new tunnel systems for us to one day uncover.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

Now, Ghori said he sees Tyler's Cybertruck outside his lunch window.\n\nIt's yet another example of Musk's drive for efficiency in execution. Employees at his companies are known to accept lower salaries but higher stock grants, betting their compensation on the company's performance. That's partly because of Musk's track record of growing startups into highly valued companies.\n\nFour days after the podcast was published, Ghori revealed that he left xAI. \"Nothing but love to my former team and coworkers!\" he wrote on X.\n\nSome famous faces popped in to question the timing of his exit. \"Is it because of the podcast?\" MrBeast replied, adding a popcorn emoji.\n\nMusk has been known to make bets with his employees. Almost two decades ago, he reportedly wagered against early SpaceX employee Steve Davis. Davis put up $20; Musk put up the possibility of a SpaceX frozen yogurt machine. Davis won, and employees on the Hawthorne campus enjoyed their free fro-yo.\n\nIt helps that Musk's companies tend to have a flat org structure, giving Musk one-on-one contact with many of his employees. In the interview, Ghori said that there were three levels at xAI: individual contributors, cofounders, and Musk himself.\n\n\"No one tells me 'no,'\" Ghori said. He explained that, if he has a good idea, he can pursue it that same day and show it to Musk or the relevant customer.\n\nThere are also few deadlines, Ghori said, because projects are pitched and completed quickly.\n\n\"We don't have due dates,\" he said. \"It's always yesterday.\"\n\nThe fast-paced, individualistic culture may take some getting used to. Ghori came to xAI after years as a startup founder. There was little guidance.\n\n\"Nobody told me what to do,\" Ghori said. \"My first day, they just gave me a laptop and a badge.\"",

His attorneys say it resulted in a brain injury.\n\nProsecutors had not revealed a potential motive for the shootings but in a court filing said they had intended to prove Thompson's actions, among other factors, were “especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel” and that he attempted to avoid custody.\n\nTuesday’s filing by Thompson’s attorneys said that while “the serious brain injury he suffered has made it such that Austin cannot explain why he committed this shooting, he has always accepted that he did this.”\n\nThompson was charged as an adult on five counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon and one count of assault of an officer with a gun. A sentencing hearing would be held later after any plea.\n\nBecause of his age at the time of the attack, Thompson could not receive the death penalty if convicted. The case judge could decide to sentence him to life in prison without parole on murder counts, or the judge could grant at sentencing the possibility of parole after at least 25 years.\n\nWake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman said Tuesday that she was aware of the plea notice. “We are ready to move forward. Our thoughts are with the families of the victims,\" Freeman added in a text message later.\n\nThompson hopes “that the material presented at the sentencing hearing brings as much peace and closure as possible,” his attorneys wrote.\n\nProsecutors contend that Thompson shot and stabbed his brother James, whose body was found in their home.\n\nPolice also said they believed Thompson then shot multiple neighbors on the Hedingham community's streets, killing off-duty Raleigh police Officer Gabriel Torres, 29, and Nicole Connors, 52. Another neighbor who was wounded survived.\n\nThey also alleged that he later fatally shot two others on the nearby Neuse River Greenway trail: Mary Marshall, 34, and Susan Karnatz, 49.\n\nDressed in camouflage with multiple weapons strapped to his belt, Thompson was located by law enforcement in a shed nearby and arrested after an hourslong standoff that resulted in another police officer being wounded.\n\nThompson’s attorneys had indicated last year that they intended to use “diminished capacity” and “voluntary intoxication ... of a prescribed medication” in his defense.\n\nIn 2024, Thompson’s father pleaded guilty to improperly storing a handgun that authorities said was found with his son after the shootings. He received a suspended sentence and probation.\n\nInvestigators seized 11 firearms and 160 boxes of ammunition — some of them empty — from the Thompson home, according to search warrants.",

    "description": "He isn't known for having the most refined palate, so it's no surprise that President Donald Trump eats this instead of the fancy food at state dinners.",
    "fullText": "A White House insider shared the go-to meal that President Donald Trump likes to fill up on before attending formal engagements with esteemed guests, and to absolutely no one's surprise, it's a burger. In an episode of the Daily Beast's show \"Inside Trump's Head,\" journalist Michael Wolff said the president eats a burger meal prior to attending state dinners. He reportedly pokes at the fancy food he's routinely served on the job, using the strategy of talking constantly to distract other attendees from noticing that he's barely eating.\n\nTrump has a well-documented love affair with fast food, dating back to his first term when he served a spread of burgers and pizza to the Clemson University football team after they won the college national championship. He favored fast food on the campaign trail for his second term, even stopping to pose for a now-famous photo op with McDonald's fries in hand. Trump has reportedly reasoned that eating fast food makes him relatable to average Americans.\n\nThe president's association with fast food earns him both praise and criticism. With his long history of showmanship, some observers, such as the users on Reddit's r/Pics, have even questioned whether his preferences are authentic or endorsed. But as Wolff confirmed, Trump's love for burgers is the real thing — even behind closed doors.\n\nFurther into the episode of \"In Trump's Head,\" Wolff reveals that staff traveling with Trump aboard Air Force One are given care packages of fast food as perks of the job. Apparently, most staff members don't eat the White House food, which Wolff describes as being bland and mass produced in banquet fashion — similar to something served at a wedding. When host Joanna Coles read through a menu of courses served at a 2018 state dinner in honor of French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron, Wolff replied that Trump would not have touched any of it.\n\nWhile it's not uncommon for what President Trump eats in a typical day to end up in the news or even his personal social media, perhaps lesser known is the fact that former presidents and their inner circles also favored burgers and fries. Fast food appears to have been woven into the culture in Washington for decades. Our list of other politicians who are obsessed with fast food includes Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Ted Cruz, and others. Most figures on our list are noted to blur the lines between business and pleasure when it comes to their love of fast food, similar to the way Trump does.\n\nFor more food and drink goodness, Get taste tests, food & drink news, deals from your favorite chains, recipes, cooking tips, and more!",

The Single Best Piece of Dave Ramsey Advice I Think About Almost Every Day",
    "fullText": "Personal finance icon Dave Ramsey is among the leading voices on everything tied to individuals' personal finances across America. His call-in radio show, seminars, books and other information on how individuals can achieve financial freedom have provided millions with a road map for how to get out of debt and break into a stage of abundance in life.\n\nLiving on less than you make creates margin for debt payoff and retirement investing.\n\nRamsey recommends investing 15% for retirement and maximizing Roth IRAs below income thresholds.\n\nPaying off vehicles creates additional margin before tackling mortgage paydown.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.\n\nNow, Dave Ramsey has some rather controversial views around debt, with an overarching theme that debt is far too risky for most households and should be paid off. His personal mantra is to be debt-free, invest at least 15% for retirement, and pay off one's house as soon as possible to achieve these goals. His \"baby step\" program provides the roadmap for how investors can become debt free and invest for one's future, with relatively simple concepts put forward in a bid to speak to every American wherever they are on their journey.\n\nThat said, aside from the baby steps program (which I'd argue is great, particularly for those who are deep in the hole in terms of their debt load), there's one piece of financial advice Dave Ramsey continues to espouse I think applies to everyone, no matter their current financial state.\n\nNo matter whether you make $50,000 per year, $100,000 per year or $1 million per year, achieving any level of financial success simply isn't possible over the long-term without adhering to this simple (but essential) principle of living on less than you make.\n\nDave Ramsey and other personal finance experts all point to the fact that plenty of folks with ultra-high levels of income can, in many cases, have a smaller investing portfolio than teachers, firefighters and others with modest salaries who consistently put capital away in their employee retirement accounts and other vehicles such as Roth IRAs.\n\nIndeed, Ramsey is among the growing chorus of experts who suggest that investors who are below the income thresholds which exclude some from investing in Roth IRAs to maximize these accounts first. Receiving one's employee match, and other key pieces of advice around investing are included in the later stages of the baby steps, with the first few steps tied mostly to building an emergency fund and paying down debt.",

    "title": "It's been 1 year of Trump's second term. More Americans than ever think he's 'changing America for the worse.'",
    "description": "A growing number also say Trump has been a worse president than they expected, according to a new Yahoo/YouGov poll.",
    "fullText": "It has been exactly one year since Donald Trump was re-inaugurated as president, becoming just the second U.S. commander in chief to return to the White House after losing reelection four years earlier.\n\nNow, at the end of Trump’s first year back in office, a new Yahoo/YouGov poll finds that more Americans than ever think he’s been a “worse president than they expected” — and that he’s “changing America for the worse” as well.\n\nThe survey of 1,709 U.S. adults was conducted from Jan. 8 to 12, right after Trump toppled Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, threatened to forcibly take Greenland from Denmark and mused about using the Insurrection Act against anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis — and right before he and his team celebrated “One Year of MAGA” with a series of posts on social media.\n\n“One year ago, everything changed,” the official White House account wrote on X. “The return of strength. The return of America First. The era of winning is here — and it’s just getting started.”\n\nBut a growing number of Americans seem to disagree. For instance, 49% now say Trump is changing America for the worse — compared to just 34% who say he is changing America for the better. (Only 7% say he’s “not really changing anything.”)\n\nLast March, Trump’s “for the worse” number was 6 percentage points lower (43%) and his “for the better” number was 6 points higher (40%). The gap between the two numbers was 3 points; now it’s 15.\n\nWhy? Because among independents, there has been a significant shift away from Trump.\n\nBefore Trump took office, more independents said they expected Trump to change America for the better (41%) than said they expected him to change America for the worse (34%).\n\nThen in March, two months into Trump’s second term, 46% of independents said the president was changing America for the worse; 36% said he was changing America for the better.\n\nToday, those numbers are 57% (worse) and 22% (better). In other words, Trump’s “changing America for the worse” rating among independents has risen by 23 points over the course of his second term, while his “changing America for the better” rating has fallen by 19.\n\nFor many Americans, Trump’s performance is increasingly falling short of expectations. After his first year back in office, just 28% say he has been a better president than they expected. More than twice as many (49%) say he has been worse. (Another 20% say he has been “about the same” as they expected.)\n\nThat gap between worse and better — now 21 percentage points — has doubled since last March. Back then, 41% of Americans said Trump had performed worse than they expected; 30% said better.\n\nAmong Republicans, Trump’s numbers haven’t changed at all: they were 63% “better than expected” to 9% “worse than expected” in March, and they are exactly the same today. But among Democrats, Trump’s “worse than expected” number has climbed 10 points (to 86%) as his “about the same” number has dropped 8 points (to 10%).\n\nMeanwhile, a clear majority of independents (57%) now say Trump has been worse than they expected; just 16% say he’s been better. Those numbers were much closer — 44% to 26%, respectively — in March.\n\nTrump’s overall job-approval rating (40% approve to 56% disapprove) has not budged over the last few months; his ratings on individual issues have held steady, too. But looking back over a longer time frame — the first year of Trump’s second term — a clear pattern emerges. Simply put, more and more Americans think the president has the wrong priorities.\n\nIn March, Yahoo and YouGov asked respondents whether Trump had spent the last two months focused on “America’s most important issues” or “issues that aren’t very important.” At the time, they were evenly split: 43% said the former and 45% said the latter.\n\nBut that’s no longer the case. Today, a majority of Americans (51%) say Trump has spent his second term focused on relatively unimportant issues; just 38% say he has focused on the most important things.\n\nThe cost of living remains the biggest drag on Trump’s presidency. A full 70% of Americans now say he has “not focused on it enough”; less than a quarter say he’s focused on it “the right amount” (21%) or “too much (2%).\n\nIn contrast, most Americans (52%) say Trump has focused too much on “arresting and deporting immigrants.”\n\nAs Trump’s poll numbers have declined, he has increasingly blamed his predecessor, President Joe Biden. Yet just 22% of Americans agree that Biden is “most responsible” for “the current state of the country.” A majority (53%) say Trump is most responsible. The rest (25%) say “both equally.”\n\nPessimism about the country’s future is becoming more prevalent as well. In the summer of 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, just 25% of U.S. adults said America’s “best days” were “behind us”; nearly twice as many (46%) said they were “still to come.”\n\nTrump was president at the time, yet Democrats (51%) were nearly as likely as Republicans (53%) to say America’s best days were ahead. Less than a quarter of each said the opposite.\n\nNow, however, more Democrats say America’s best days are behind it (42%) than say they’re still to come (29%). Those numbers are nearly identical among independents.\n\nOnly Republicans remain convinced — 63% to 17% — that the country’s future will be brighter than its past.\n\nThe Yahoo survey was conducted by YouGov using a nationally representative sample of 1,709 U.S. adults interviewed online from Jan. 8 to 12, 2026. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, 2024 election turnout and presidential vote, party identification and current voter registration status. Demographic weighting targets come from the 2019 American Community Survey. Party identification is weighted to the estimated distribution at the time of the election (31% Democratic, 32% Republican). Respondents were selected from YouGov’s opt-in panel to be representative of all U.S. adults. The margin of error is approximately 3.1%.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 20 (Reuters) - China plans to roll out new policies from 2026 to 2030 to spur domestic consumption and tackle \"prominent\" imbalances in supply and ​demand, with the services sector becoming a key focus, the country's state planner ‌said on Tuesday.\n\nChinese leaders have pledged to \"significantly\" lift household consumption's share of the economy over the next five ‌years, though they have not given a specific target.\n\n\"The issue of having strong supply but weak demand in the current economic operation is indeed a prominent problem,\" Wang Changlin, vice head of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said at a press conference.\n\nChina's economy grew 5% ⁠last year, matching the government's ‌target, as a boom in Chinese exports offset weak domestic consumption, a balancing act that is expected to be difficult to replicate.\n\nIndustrial output rose ‍5.9% in 2025, outpacing the 3.7% growth in retail sales, underscoring the supply-demand imbalance.\n\nOn Tuesday, China's finance ministry said it would extend interest subsidies for consumers, consumer-service enterprises and businesses in need of ​equipment upgrades to the end of 2026 to revive softening domestic demand.\n\nThe extension seeks ‌to \"further boost consumption and expand domestic demand, continue to reduce the cost of personal consumer credit, and enhance residents' willingness to spend,\" the finance ministry said.\n\nThe ministry will also roll out interest subsidies for up to two years for loans issued to micro, small and medium-sized private enterprises from this year. It also introduced a guarantee plan totalling 500 ⁠billion yuan ($71.83 billion) over two years for private ​investment.\n\nZhou Chen, an official at the NDRC, said the ​government would continue to use trade-in subsidies to support consumption of goods like electric vehicles, but its focus was shifting toward services.\n\nOfficials say services, ‍including elderly care, healthcare ⁠and leisure, offer substantial room for growth.\n\n\"The services sector has now become a key focus in efforts to expand domestic demand,\" Zhou said.\n\nIn December, China deployed 62.5 ⁠billion yuan ($8.98 billion) in special treasury bond funds to support its 2026 consumer trade-in scheme for appliances ‌and new-energy vehicles.\n\n($1 = 6.9606 Chinese yuan renminbi)",

    "description": "\"Just go to a local pool...we’re advising that the beaches are unsafe.”",
    "fullText": "Yet another surfer has been attacked by a shark in New South Wales, Australia.\n\nThis time, it was a 39-year-old man (identity as of yet revealed) who was in the water at Point Plomer in the mid-north coast of the region. Details are scarce surrounding the incident as of now, but it appears the attack happened early Tuesday morning.\n\nThe surfer’s board showed distinct teeth marks, and he was taken for bite wounds.\n\nSurf Life Saving NSW chief executive, Steve Pearce, who has had his hands full over the past couple of days with the excessive amount of shark encounters said:\n\n\"The area is known to have some shark activity up there,\" he told the ABC. [He's] very fortunate to not have sustained any serious injuries.\"\n\nThis most recent attack comes after a rampage of others – first a child was bitten while swimming in the Sydney harbor; then an 11-year-old was chomped while surfing at Dee Why (where Mercury Psillakas was killed by a great white last September); and a man in his 20s was mauled while surfing at North Steyne beach. All within two days.\n\nRegarding the latter incident, the man is reportedly in critical condition. A Good Samaritan who assisted in the rescue of the 20-something victim recounted:\n\n“My mate put him on his board and was pushing him into shore and there was blood on the board and I was trying to pull them to help out. The guy was silenced from the pain, but still conscious, and I kept telling him to not look at his leg and we just kept paddling.”\n\nSo, why are shark attacks raging currently in NSW? Well, it’s likely bull sharks that are responsible, and it probably has to do with the weather. Pearce continued:\n\n“We have such poor water quality that’s conducive to bull shark activity. We have two people critically injured in hospital this morning. Just go to a local pool, because at this stage, we’re advising that the beaches are unsafe.”",

    "fullText": "ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Federal immigration agents bashed open a door and detained a U.S. citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out onto the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by The Associated Press.\n\nChongLy “Scott” Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law alerted him on Sunday afternoon that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St. Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.\n\n“I was shaking,\" he said. “They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.\"\n\nAmid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.\n\n“ICE is not doing what they say they’re doing,” St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. “They’re not going after hardened criminals. They’re going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.”\n\nThao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn’t want to see it.\n\nInstead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.\n\nVideos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.\n\nThao said agents drove him “to the middle of nowhere\" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.\n\nAgents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.\n\nHomeland Security defends the operation\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a “targeted operation\" seeking two convicted sex offenders.\n\n“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said. “The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID’d. He matched the description of the targets.”\n\nThao's family said in a statement that it “categorically disputes” the DHS account and “strongly objects to DHS’s attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.”\n\nThao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.\n\nDHS later released the names and photos of two people it described as “violent illegal alien sexual offenders” that it was seeking to detain in St. Paul. Thao said he had never seen these men before and they did not live with him.\n\nDHS did not respond to an earlier request from The Associated Press asking why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.\n\nThao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend, whose first name matches that of one of the men DHS said it was seeking. Chris Thao said he did not know the boyfriend's last name.\n\nFamily fled Laos after helping US\n\nThe family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao’s treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.\n\nThao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's “Secret War” from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.\n\nChoua Thao, who passed away in late December, \"treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,\" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.\n\nChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.\n\n“I don't feel safe at all,” Thao said. “What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.”\n\nBrook is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "description": "New Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Andruw Jones was one of the few to solve Ben Sheets when the Brewers hurler struck out 18 batters in a 2004 game.",
    "fullText": "“It’s funny,” former Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Ben Sheets said in 2024. “When they hit it like that, nobody says nothing about them shadows.”\n\nSheets, speaking to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Curt Hogg, was referring to the infamous stadium shadows that often make day games a challenge for hitters at American Family Field, and potentially something that contributed to Sheets' dominance on May 16, 2004. He was also talking about a pitch that new Baseball Hall of Famer Andruw Jones hit out of the park.\n\nThe Braves slugger was in the prime of his career in 2004, though it would be the only year in a run of five when he wasn't named to the All-Star Game and finished with fewer than 30 home runs. Still, one of his 29 homers that year threw a small wrench into one of the greatest pitching performances in Brewers history, when Sheets struck out 18 batters in a game.\n\nJones, one of two players inducted for the Class of 2026 by the Baseball Writers Association of America, belted a home run against Sheets in the seventh inning that afternoon, accounting for the only Atlanta run in a 4-1 Brewers win. Sheets induced a Mark DeRosa lineout to end the inning, then recorded his final six outs via strikeout.\n\nWhen Jones stepped to the plate with two outs that inning, Sheets had retired 20 of the last 21. Sheets himself said that it was a good pitch.\n\nThe homer spoiled the shutout and perhaps served as a small karmic kickback after Jones had swung through a curveball in the fifth for strikeout No. 8. \"A really good hitter swung through a really crappy hanging breaking ball,\" Sheets recalled.\n\n\"Dang. That was such a bad pitch. But sometimes pitches are so bad, they’re good. That’s what the fastball could do. He was probably just off time. I mean, hitting’s hard. Usually he rips that 450 feet.”\n\nJones hit 434 career home runs, including 51 the following season, though he was on the hook for two of Sheets' franchise record-setting 18 strikeouts that day. Only two pitchers have reached that single-game strikeout mark in the years since: Corey Kluber for Cleveland in 2015 and Max Scherzer for Washington in 2016. Scherzer recorded 20 strikeouts in his game.\n\nSheets gave up a leadoff double to Dewayne Wise starting the game, so he wasn't flirting with a no-hitter at any point. The Brewers scored three times in the bottom of the first to grab an early lead, and Bill Hall's RBI groundout in the bottom of the seventh answered Jones' solo home run.\n\nSheets was added to the Brewers Walk of Fame in 2024. No Brewers pitcher has truly threatened Sheets' strikeout tally; Corbin Burnes got as close as 15 in a 2021 game.\n\nJones received 78.4% of the Hall of Fame vote, ahead of the 75% necessary for induction. The five-time All-Star and 10-time Gold Glove winner joined Carlos Beltrán in the modern-ballot Class of 2026.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Andruw Jones kept Ben Sheets' epic 2004 game from being even better",

    "fullText": "For weeks, WWE fans have questioned the whereabouts of former United States Champions Rusev. In the case of former WWE Tag Team Champions Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins, that same uncertainty has lingered for months. Thanks to a new report, though, it can finally be put to rest.\n\nAccording to PWI Elite, the absence of Rusev and The Street Profits (Ford and Dawkins) on WWE television is the result of an internal decision to not waste them from a creative standpoint. As such, Rusev and The Street Profits are not currently involved in any storylines, reportedly as an effort to keep them \"fresh\" for when WWE officials approach them with new TV programs.\n\nRusev's last television match came on the December 6 edition of \"WWE Main Event,\" in which he defeated Alpha Academy's Otis. Prior to that, \"The Bulgarian Brute\" took on Jey Uso in the quarter finals of \"The Last Time Is Now\" tournament, but lost.\n\nThe WWE Universe last saw The Street Profits in the ring on the November 1 episode of \"Main Event,\" with the pair defeating Los Garza's Angel and Berto in tag team competition. Throughout 2025, Ford and Dawkins were a regular fixture in the \"WWE SmackDown\" tag team division, even holding the WWE Tag Team Championships from March until July.\n\nIn recent weeks, Rusev, Ford, and Dawkins have all appeared on promotional materials for the 2026 WWE Royal Rumble, which will emanate from Saudi Arabia on January 31. As of this writing, it is unknown if it will also bring about their on-screen returns.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "The arrival of Robert Saleh in Tennessee makes the AFC South spicier, thanks to the presence of Saleh's nemesis, Jaguars coach Liam Coen. The arrival of Kevin Stefanski in Atlanta makes the NFC South spicier, too.\n\nIt started when D. Orlando Ledbetter of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution posted a surprisingly aggressive tweet: \"Falcons’ [coach] Kevin Stefanski had a dumpster fire at quarterback in Cleveland — Baker Mayfield and Deshaun Watson failed, which started a chain reaction to 11 other starters. QB Shedeur Sanders closed out last season with seven starts.\"\n\nMayfield saw it, and responded.\n\n\"Failed is quite the reach pal,\" Mayfield said. \"Still waiting on a text/call from [Stefanski] after I got shipped off like a piece of garbage. Can’t wait to see you twice a year, Coach.\"\n\nMayfield is right; it was and is a reach. Mayfield took the Browns to the postseason in 2020, leading them to the divisional round against the Chiefs. Kansas City narrowly escaped, 22-17.\n\nIn 2021, Mayfield played through injuries, and the Browns missed the playoffs. In early 2022, someone in Cleveland got the bright idea to mortgage the future for (and pay a king's ransom to) Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson. The Browns traded Mayfield to the Panthers, who at the time were nearly as dysfunctional as the Browns have been for more than a decade.\n\nMayfield's three years with the Buccaneers have proven that he's not a \"dumpster fire\" quarterback. The Browns were the dumpster fire.\n\nNow, the smoke has spread to Atlanta and Tampa Bay, where the perpetual chip on Mayfield's shoulder has gotten a little bigger. And it's awesome.",

    "description": "A pair of former Yankees outfielders are heading to Cooperstown.",
    "fullText": "There are two new members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and both of them are ex-Yankees. On Tuesday night, the BBWAA released the results of this year’s Hall of Fame ballot: Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones have been elected as part of the class of 2026. The pair will be enshrined in Cooperstown alongside Eras Committee pick Jeff Kent on July 26th.\n\nThe pair were born just one day apart in April of 1977 and have now been elected to the Hall of Fame on the same day. Only two center fielders had been elected to Cooperstown in the last 45 years, so to induct a pair in on the same day is a relative bonanza.\n\nBeltrán topped balloting in this cycle, receiving 84.2 percent of the vote in his fourth year on the ballot. It’s a jump of almost 13 percentage points from last year, when Beltrán narrowly missed out on election.\n\nBeltrán played 20 seasons in the big leagues with the Royals, Astros, Mets, Giants, Cardinals, Yankees, and Rangers, slashing .279/.350/.486 with 435 home runs, 1,587 RBIs, 312 stolen bases, a 118 wRC+, and 67.4 fWAR. He was a nine-time All-Star, three-time Gold Glover, two-time Silver Slugger, the 1999 AL Rookie of the Year, and the 2013 Roberto Clemente Award winner. He hit the fourth-most home runs of any switch-hitter in league history behind only Mickey Mantle, Eddie Murray, and Chipper Jones, and is one of only eight players in MLB history with at least 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases alongside Willie Mays, Bobby Bonds, Andre Dawson, Barry Bonds, Steve Finley, Reggie Sanders, and Alex Rodriguez.\n\nBeltrán played two-and-a-half seasons for the Yankees in his late-thirties and was one of their more productive hitters upon signing with them in the mid-2010s before being traded to the Rangers for a trio of prospects at the 2016 Trade Deadline. He would go on to win his lone World Series ring a year later with the Astros (dispatching his old teammates in a seven-game ALCS), but was named as one of the architects of their 2017 sign-stealing scandal, which was one of the principal factors in not being elected to the Hall in his first three years of eligibility. Nonetheless, Beltrán becomes the sixth player from Puerto Rico to be elected to Cooperstown.\n\nJones sneaks in with 78.4 percent of the vote, representing just over a 12 percentage point increase from his vote share last year. It was Jones’ ninth year on the ballot, his penultimate year of eligibility.\n\nJones becomes the first player born in Curaçao to be elected to the Hall of Fame. He was considered one of the all-time great defensive center fielders in MLB history, his 126.4 UZR ranking him second all-time behind Ichiro Suzuki and his 150 total zone runs ranking him fifth all-time behind Clemente, Mays, Barry Bonds, and Jesse Barfield. He blended that defense with prodigious power — he is one of only four players in history with at least 10 Gold Gloves and 400 home runs, joining Mays, Ken Griffey Jr., and Mike Schmidt.\n\nIn his 17 big league seasons, Jones played for the Braves, Dodgers, Rangers, White Sox, and Yankees, making five All-Star appearances. He slashed .254/.337/.486 with 434 home runs, 1,289 RBIs, 152 stolen bases, a 111 wRC+ and 67 fWAR. His career is bookended by encounters with the Yankees. As a rookie in 1996, he became the youngest player in MLB history to homer in the World Series at just 19 years old, breaking the record set by Mickey Mantle when he hit home runs in his first two at-bats of Game 1 of the 1996 World Series. He played the final two seasons of his big league career with the Yankees in 2011 and 2012 before a two-season swan song in Japan with the NPB’s Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, where he was teammates with future Yankees ace Masahiro Tanaka.\n\nAndy Pettitte experienced one of the biggest jumps in vote share, going from 27.9-percent of the vote last year to 48.5-percent of the vote in this cycle. It’s an encouraging sign for Pettitte in his eighth year on the ballot — if he can experience similar jumps in his final two years of eligibility there is a real chance he could be elected. There will always be questions of the effect his admission to using HGH will have on future voting, but the all-time postseason wins leader is certainly trending in the right direction.\n\nAs for other former Yankees on the ballot, Alex Rodriguez remained relatively stagnant, going from 37.1-percent of the vote last year to 40-percent in this, his fifth year of eligibility. Bobby Abreu experienced a nice jump from 19.5-percent last year to 30.8-percent this year, but with only three more years on the ballot, he will need to be handed even bigger boosts in future voting cycles to have a shot. Edwin Encarnación received just six votes (1.4-percent) in his first year on the ballot and will therefore fall off the ballot as he comes up short of the five-percent threshold needed to maintain eligibility.\n\nCongratulations again to Beltrán and Jones on this fantastic achievement. The full voting can be found below.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL doesn't need help in scheduling blockbuster games, but Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield has done just that.\n\nWith the Atlanta Falcons hiring Baker's former head coach in Cleveland, Kevin Stefanski, as their head coach, now Mayfield will see his former head coach twice a year.\n\nAnd yeah, he's more than ready for it.\n\nBaker posted on X that Stefanski, while in Cleveland, shipped Mayfield off \"like a piece of garbage\" before saying \"can't wait to see you twice a year, coach.\"\n\nAnd that, my friends, is the NFL's top Week 1 matchup.\n\nBaker has done all the heavy lifting here.\n\nThe Buccaneers vs. the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday Night Football. Done? Done.\n\nMore:Bucs' Baker Mayfield offers explosive 'garbage' quote to Kevin Stefanski\n\nDespite the Browns going 11-5 and making the playoffs in 2020, Baker and Stefanski's first year together, the franchise followed it up with an 8-9 record.\n\nSo, things weren't all bad, but it was clear Mayfield had run his race in Cleveland after four years.\n\nBut Baker is clearly ticked off with how he was treated by Stefanski during his time with the Browns, and now that Kevin is with the Falcons, he gets a shot at retribution.\n\nHaving been nothing short of a revelation in Tampa Bay, Baker is nothing like the player he was with the Browns.\n\nAnd if the NFL schedule-makers know what's good for them, Week 1 will see the Bucs and Falcons face off on primetime.\n\nBills already have perfect Sean McDermott replacement\n\nWild trade idea for Ravens' Lamar Jackson surfaces involving Pro Bowl QB\n\nHas Bills' Super Bowl window closed with Josh Allen?\n\nWhy Texans are shaking at the thought of C.J.

    "title": "Don’t let the shooting stats fool you, Dallin Hall remains crucial to UVA basketball’s success",
    "description": "Hall continues to help the ’Hoos in more ways than one despite his scoring struggles.",
    "fullText": "Things are going well for Ryan Odom and the Virginia Cavaliers, to say the least. The ’Hoos are firmly back in the top-25 once again at 16-2 overall and 5-1 in the ACC, with a gigantic opportunity this Saturday against a struggling North Carolina team at home inside JPJ.\n\nA huge part of this team’s success, despite what anyone who only looks at the scoring column might tell you, is the leadership and all-around play of Dallin Hall.\n\nThe easy-to-knock, low-hanging fruit of his game as of late has been his shooting, rather the lack thereof throughout stretches this year, especially in UVA’s last three games. In the last three wins over Stanford, Louisville, and SMU, Hall’s combined for an ugly 3-of-16 from the floor, with all but three of those attempts coming from beyond the arc.\n\n19% shooting is bad; there’s no defending it in a vacuum. But pointing at that percentage alone to poke a giant hole in Hall’s game, as UVA’s narrow leader in minutes played per game (27.5), would be disingenuous for what he does for this team, and a misunderstanding of why Odom and his staff brought him to Charlottesville in the first place.\n\nHall does a handful of things well that you’ll never see in the box score or on a graphic flashed across on TV. He boxes out guards gunning for boards to open space for others to get their hands on rebounds, plays sound team defense, and does the things that make coaches pump their fist in a film session like funneling ballhandlers into the human skyscrapers of Johann Grunloh and Ugonna Onyenso for tough looks around the basket, or simply making the easy, productive passes in halfcourt offense for second or third assists.\n\nYou’ll never hear anyone talking about a hockey assist in a basketball game, but those are the plays that shine like flashing green lights to a coaching staff making playing time decisions.\n\nDallin Hall is a box score-watcher’s worst nightmare.\n\nAffects the game even when shots aren’t falling pic.twitter.com/JcBRSsykev\n\n— Garrett Keogh (@garrett_keogh01) January 19, 2026\n\nBesides, was the expectation when UVA secured his commitment in the summer that he would be averaging 13 points a night? Safe to say, probably not. In his first three years at BYU, he averaged 7.3, 9.0, and 6.8 points per game, respectively. Today, his scoring average sits at 5.8. And while there was serious talent on a few of those Cougar teams, the jury is still out on whether or not this UVA group is the best Hall’s been a part of — I lean more toward that being the case.\n\nHall starts and plays heavily because of his ability to distribute, defend intelligently, and be in the right spots. Guys like Thijs De Ridder, Malik Thomas, Chance Mallory, and Sam Lewis have shown they’re able to carry the scoring load. That’s part of why this team is up to No. 14 in the AP Poll. Odom and co. constructed this roster with a clear vision in mind for each guy’s role. Hall is out there to help run the show on both ends of the floor.\n\n\"He's just a winner.\"\n\nUVA coach Ryan Odom says Dallin Hall has made a tremendous impact on the team both on and off the court this season. Adds how valuable his mentorship with Chance Mallory is this year.\n\nAlso says he wants Hall to continue shooting.\n\n— Preston Willett (@PrestonWillett) January 19, 2026\n\nAnd sure, I can find clip after clip of great plays, and if you think differently, you can go find a share of bad ones. That’s as endless a game as someone still saying the SEC is the best conference in college football at this point. But overall? Hall is a net positive when he’s out there.\n\nIn fact, the analytics suggest that to be true when you look at how effective UVA’s lineup combinations are with him on the floor. Of the ACC’s top 15 rated three-player lineups measured by CBB Analytics, the ’Hoos own four of them. The only player included in each of those four? Dallin Hall.\n\nThe top '3-player lineup combos\" by Net Rating in the ACC (min. 150 MP) pic.twitter.com/OU4uh1AlJK\n\n— CBB Analytics (@CBBAnalytics) January 18, 2026\n\nNow, this isn’t to say UVA’s starting point guard should be free from criticism should he continue to not make shots for three or four straight games coming up, but to not acknowledge the little things, in addition to the fact he pulled down 12 rebounds against Louisville, and dished out nine assists at SMU — which now has him at a 19:4 assist to turnover ratio across the last three games — would be criminal when it comes to recognizing his overall value. He isn’t just logging 30+ minutes of cardio each night. He’s making winning plays, no matter how small some might seem.\n\nAnd, like the Maryland game when he went for 20 points, I wouldn’t be surprised if we see a time in the near future when this team is starving for a scoring lift, and it comes at the hands of a few big shots from No. 30.",

The jam electrified the Sixers' bench and the 18,005 spectators on hand at Xfinity Mobile Arena.\n\nKnown as a high-flyer, Edgecombe has had quite a highlight reel through his first 37 career games with the Sixers, from soaring chasedown blocks to acrobatic finishes.

He is also one of three rookies to score at least 20 points in four straight games this season.\n\nThough Edgecombe doesn't appear to be a likely contestant in the Slam Dunk Contest, the former Baylor guard is considered a lock for the Rising Stars Game on Feb. 13 as one of the top rookies.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rookie Wire: Sixers news: VJ Edgecombe dismisses Slam Dunk Contest question",

The 21-year-old was the Cowboys' first-round draft pick back in April, being selected No. 12 overall out of Alabama.

    "fullText": "Gabriel Jesus said he had \"tears in my eyes\" after scoring twice to help Arsenal win 3-1 at Inter Milan and seal their place in the Champions League last 16.\n\nThe 28-year-old was making only his third start since returning in December from 11 months out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury.\n\nJesus has been at Arsenal for four seasons but feels like he has played only \"one and a half or two\" having endured a series of setbacks.\n\nThe Brazil forward has shown flashes of his quality following his comeback, scoring an excellent fourth goal in Arsenal's 4-1 thrashing of Aston Villa last month but, against Inter, he looked back to his best.\n\n\"It's a dream night,\" Jesus told Amazon Prime after the Gunners maintained their 100% record in this season's Champions League with a club-record seventh successive win in the competition.\n\n\"I always dreamed of being a footballer. I watched when I was a kid. I watched a lot of Serie A, so to be here in this stadium and score here is tears in my eyes because I always dreamed of being here.\n\n\"There is always a reason that things happen, whether it's good things or difficult things. I learned that during my 11 months out of the field.\n\n\"It is always difficult to play against Inter Milan. We came here last season and lost. Tonight we played better than them, we controlled them but they are a top team and they attack.\n\n\"We scored at the end and got the three points. We have to keep going because we have another one at the weekend.\"\n\nHis two goals ended a run of 10 Champions League games without scoring - the last one coming in a 6-0 win over Lens on 29 November, 2023.\n\nGunners fans have been calling for Jesus to start since he came back to full fitness, with summer signing Viktor Gyokeres struggling for form and goals.\n\nThe Swede got on the scoresheet in Milan with an fine curling effort, but his strike for Arsenal's late third was just his second from open play in his past 13 games.\n\nGyokeres, though, does have two in his last three games after netting in the Carabao Cup semi-final first-leg win at Chelsea, while Kai Havertz offers another forward option following his return from a knee injury.\n\n\"Everyone wants to start,\" added Jesus. \"I am a very respectful guy. I am not a kid anymore, I am 28, so I understand football.\n\n\"I am very happy Vik came on and scored a goal. I am so happy I scored and Vik scored. I am confident Kai will score when he gets the chance.\"\n\nJesus stars as Arsenal beat Inter for landmark win\n\nWith Gyokeres and Jesus both on target in Milan, it marked the first time this season two centre-forwards had scored in the same game for the Gunners.\n\n\"We have been missing Gabi a lot,\" said manager Mikel Arteta. \"I think it is going to raise his confidence levels and the team's because we now have different profiles in that position, like we have with the wingers and in other positions.\n\n\"And the fact the players are playing at that level. Viktor [Gyokeres] comes in and makes a great impact in the game - and it only makes us better.\"\n\nJesus' two goals took the former Manchester City frontman's tally to 26 in the Champions League on his 53rd appearance, with the only Brazilians to reach 25 in fewer games in the competition being Neymar (44) and Jardel (45).\n\n\"In the end it's not even about competition between the players [for places]. The words Jesus said, even if the next player comes, he will still score his goal to help the team,\" four-time Champions League winner Clarence Seedorf told Amazon Prime.\n\n\"These are words I like to hear because they're coming into a different level now because, yes they are competing, but whoever plays needs to perform.\n\n\"If I'm not playing you perform because next game will be easier for me when the team is winning. I like that.\"\n\nWayne Rooney, whose former club Manchester United visit Premier League leaders Arsenal next on Sunday, added: \"If I was Gabriel Jesus now I'd be saying, 'I want to start the game on Sunday'.\n\n\"He's come here, scored two goals and played really well so if I was him, I'd be putting it in the manager's mind that I really want to play.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "Cooperstown calls: Carlos Beltrán, Andruw Jones and Jeff Kent lead class of 2026",
    "description": "Former White Sox ace Mark Buehrle gains traction as Hall of Fame debate evolves",
    "fullText": "It’s a tale of sustained excellence, peak brilliance and overdue redemption: Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones each surpassed the 75% needed for election by members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America on Tuesday, while Jeff Kent was formally awarded his place in Cooperstown this winter by the Contemporary Era Committee. The trio will headline the Hall of Fame Class of 2026.\n\nKent was announced as a Hall of Fame inductee in December, finally receiving long-overdue recognition for his sterling work at second base. His 377 homers are the most all-time at second base, while his 1,518 RBI and eight 100-RBI seasons are unmatched for a player at Kent’s position. Kent was a five-time All-Star and four-time Silver Slugger Award winner who slashed .290/.356/.500 with 55.4 WAR over 17 seasons. Simply put, Kent was a generational talent who did things at second base that most didn’t think were possible.\n\nBeltrán, meanwhile, fell just short of Cooperstown last year in his third trip on the BBWAA ballot, receiving 70.3% of the vote. But the writers have spoken this year, elevating Beltrán to the HOF with 84.2% of the vote. Beltrán appeared in 20 seasons and 2,586 games over his career, slashing .279/.350/.486 with 2,725 hits, 435 home runs, 312 stolen bases and 70 WAR. His counting numbers are all the more impressive considering he’s one of only five players in AL/NL history to post 500 doubles, 400 homers and 300 steals. Beltrán was a nine-time All-Star and won three Gold Gloves, as well as earning American League Rookie of the Year honors in 1999. What sets Beltrán apart from others, though? His resume in October. Beltrán was a different beast during postseason play, slashing .307/.412/.609 with a 1.021 OPS, which ranks among the best postseason performances ever.\n\nUnfortunately for Beltrán, his career wasn’t all sunshine and roses as he was named in the report on the Astros’ sign-stealing scandal and admitted to using text messages to share scouting information during his tenure with Houston. After apologizing to MLB, he stepped away from baseball for several years.  As time went on, it seems the writers, at least this year, decided to overlook his role in the scandal and accept his apology. Today, he serves as the Mets’ special assistant to the president of baseball operations, David Stearns.\n\nThe eventual election of Jones is just one of the many reasons that Hall of Fame voting can change drastically over time. He surpassed the 75% mark this year in his ninth year on the ballot, eventually landing at 78.4%. It wasn’t always pretty for Jones, who came alarmingly close to falling off the ballot in his first year of eligibility after recording just 7.3% of the vote. But each year, Jones gained steam as voters began to understand the value of his elite defense at a premium position, combined with plus power at the plate. During his best years, Jones was one of the best center fielders the game has ever seen, winning Gold Gloves for 10 straight seasons while also hammering 434 home runs over his career. Prior to this year, only eight center fielders were enshrined in Cooperstown; with the election of Beltrán  and Jones, that number now sits at 10.\n\nA deeper dive into Jones’ prime reveals just how good he was. At age 19, Jones homered twice in his first two career World Series at-bats. He hit seven 30-homer seasons, led MLB with 51 homers in 2005, and was a five-time All-Star. Unfortunately, injuries cut into Jones’ career after age 30 and prevented him from adding even more to his eye-popping stats. Jones spent one lone season in 2010 in Chicago, where he posted a 120 OPS+ and put up a 1.9 WAR across 107 games for the White Sox. His career was also not without issue, as an off-field arrest for domestic violence in 2012 may have stalled his early ballot progression to the HOF.\n\nFinally, reaching career highs on Monday was former White Sox southpaw Mark Buehrle, who saw his vote total jump from 11.4% in 2025 to 20% in 2026. It’s a steady increase over the course of his six years on the ballot, and one that could continue to trend upwards as seasons pass. Buehrle has one of the best pitching hallmarks of all time, tossing at least 200 innings in 14 straight seasons. Only seven Modern Era pitchers were able to reach that milestone at least once, and six of those pitchers are already in the Hall of Fame. Buehrle won 214 games, logged over 3,200 innings since the start of the 21st century, had elite defensive metrics earning him three Gold Gloves, and had signature moments, including a perfect game, a no-hitter, and an ALCS complete game. Hopefully, his case will only grow stronger with time, and the momentum eventually works in Buehrle’s favor.",

    "fullText": "Obviously frustrated by the heavy defeat suffered at the Santiago Bernabéu against Real Madrid (6-1), the English central defender spoke in the mixed zone after the match.\n\nThey were powerless against the Madrid steamroller. Pegged back very early in the match, the AS Monaco players ultimately succumbed to a heavy defeat against Real Madrid on Matchday 7 of the Champions League (6-1). It was obviously a disappointment, and one that Eric Dier sought to analyze in the mixed zone post-match. 🎙️\n\nGood evening, Eric. What happened tonight?\n\nIt’s difficult to explain right after the match, but it simply wasn’t a good performance from us. We’re obviously very disappointed, and there’s not much else to say. We just need to try to understand what went wrong, especially since when you lose by that score, it means a lot of things didn’t work. We now need to process this and move forward. I’m obviously very disappointed in myself, but everyone needs to do some self-reflection; that’s the most important thing.\n\nWe weren't surprised by the quality of this Real Madrid team; everyone knows them and was aware of their capabilities. We had a few chances  in the first half, which was quite open. Unfortunately, we left ourselves too exposed after halftime, and we conceded goals due to silly mistakes.\n\nWere you surprised by the level of your opponent?\n\nWe weren’t surprised by the quality of this Real Madrid team; everyone knows them and was aware of their capabilities. We had a few chances  in the first half, which was quite open. Unfortunately, we left ourselves too exposed after halftime, and we conceded goals due to silly mistakes. Their counter-attacks really hurt us.\n\nHow can you defend against a player like Kylian Mbappé?\n\nIn my opinion, football isn’t an individual sport; it’s always about collective play, and it’s often characterized by mistakes. Even if you’re a very good team, you’re bound to make mistakes, and when you’re struggling, you’re even more vulnerable. We now need to show a different attitude, both individually and collectively. But the best news is that we have another match in four days.\n\nNo, I don't think so. It's never too great a challenge, and we've shown in the past that we can perform well against very strong teams. But our performance was simply not good enough today. We need to learn from these kinds of matches as a team.\n\nEric DierOn the lessons to take from the amtch\n\nHow can we explain the team’s performance?\n\nIt’s sometimes difficult, when you’re on the inside, to find rational explanations for what’s happening, especially since we’re currently going through a difficult period. When everything is going well, it’s easy to make the right choices and show character. But we need to show that character precisely in these kinds of situations.\n\nWas the challenge too great tonight against Real Madrid?\n\nNo, I don’t think so. It’s never too great a challenge, and we’ve shown in the past that we can perform well against very strong teams. But our performance was simply not good enough today. We need to learn from these kinds of matches as a team.\n\nWhen you lose 6-1, you obviously have to change a lot of things. We need to be better in every aspect of the game. How do we bounce back? The advantage is that we have another match in a few days against Le Havre in the league to show a different side of ourselves. Again, when everything is going well, it’s very easy to have the right attitude, show personality, and demonstrate character, but it’s precisely in these difficult moments that it seems the hardest. But we have to face this challenge.",

    "fullText": "Union Saint-Gilloise head coach David Hubert thinks that his team’s Champions League showdown against Bayern Munich is the biggest match in the club’s history.\n\n“It doesn’t get any bigger than this – it’s the biggest game in the club’s history. Bayern are right up there when you look at the best teams in Europe. You can’t find a bigger challenge. But there’s confidence and hunger in our team. We want to show ourselves tomorrow. You see, everything is bigger here, even the microphone is bigger,” Hubert said with a laugh (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “The danger comes to you from all sides against Bayern. I like to review the chances an opponent creates before we play them. Normally, that takes two hours, but with Bayern it took two days. They have all the qualities, both collectively and individually.\n\n“Aggressive pressing, playing between the lines, down the wing, they have some truly exceptional players. They’re a team with no limits. But as long as the odds aren’t zero, you have a chance. We have to try to seize it. And after all, it’s eleven people against us. They have two legs, two arms, two lungs, just like us… We’re looking forward to it.”\n\nYup, Hubert is impressed with the Bavarians. However, the manager’s message is that in the Champions League…anything can happen.\n\n“In the Champions League, you compete against the best, and Bayern are currently the best in Europe. We want to show our best side. That’s why we play this sport. In football, there’s always a chance,” Hubert said.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "description": "The Boston Red Sox aren’t rushing their Plan B after the Alex Bregman miss.",
    "fullText": "The most revealing part of Chris Cotillo’s update wasn’t the name attached to it. It was the lack of movement.\n\n“Very little traction” on Eugenio Suarez is not the kind of phrasing that signals a deal is imminent, but it does tell you something important about where the Red Sox actually are right now.\n\nNot where they were a week ago, not where fans want them to be, but where the front office has landed in the immediate aftermath of losing Alex Bregman.\n\nThe loud part of the offseason is over. What’s left is quieter, more uncomfortable, and far more reflective of how Boston wants to operate.\n\nThe Bregman chapter closed loudly, expensively, and with more friction than the organization would ever admit publicly. He was the clean solution - the one that made sense on paper, in the clubhouse, and in the lineup. Boston pursued him seriously, but deliberately (to a fault), and when the bidding crept past their internal line in the low-$160 million range, they stopped.\n\nThat decision didn’t just cost them Bregman. It reshaped everything that followed.\n\nIn that context, Suarez becoming a legitimate Plan B option made perfect sense.\n\nAccording to Cotillo and Sean McAdam earlier this month, the Red Sox “like” him. That word matters. It’s not urgency. It’s not aggression. It’s interest, filtered through restraint.\n\nSuarez is not Bregman. He’s not Bo Bichette, either. What he is, however, is a very specific kind of bat - one Boston’s lineup has lacked at times.\n\nForty-plus home run power is not a projection with Suarez; it’s the foundation of his value. He launched 49 home runs in 2025 between Arizona and Seattle, and for a Red Sox offense that too often stalled when the ball stopped leaving the yard, that kind of thump plays.\n\nA near-30% strikeout rate isn’t a footnote. It’s a defining trait.\n\nHis defense at third base is serviceable at best, and nobody is confusing this with a long-term, stabilizing solution at the hot corner. Suarez doesn’t smooth out a roster. He fits into it, warts and all.\n\nAnd that’s where Cotillo’s report starts to read less like a dead end and more like a snapshot of Boston’s current posture.\n\n“Very little traction” suggests the Red Sox are not pushing. It suggests they’re content to let the market breathe, to see whether price and years come down, to avoid another negotiation that forces them to choose between structure and star power. After how the Bregman talks ended, that’s not surprising - it’s instructive.\n\nRemember to join our RED SOX on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

We’ll Let’s do that.”\n\nHarbaugh, who was fired by the Ravens earlier this month, was talking about the successful second act he envisions with the Giants.\n\nThe difference, of course, is that Harbaugh won a Super Bowl with the Ravens, and Reid came up short in Philadelphia. No head coach has ever won a Super Bowl ring with two different franchises. Can Harbaugh make history after failing to reach the big game with quarterback Lamar Jackson?\n\nHarbaugh got his start in the NFL with the Eagles in 1998.

He is averaging a team-high 19.2 points, 8.9 rebounds and 9 assists, and has seven triple-doubles.\n\n“I don’t know what the cutoff point is in terms of missed games and things like that, but before he got hurt, I think you could certainly make the argument he was playing at that level for strong consideration,” Donovan said.\n\nThe Bulls were ninth in the Eastern Conference at 20-22 entering Tuesday's game.

    "description": "Many Tottenham fans have already lost faith in Thomas Frank - but did Tuesday's 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund give cause for optimism?",
    "fullText": "Speaking to Tottenham fans on their way to Tuesday's Champions League game with Borussia Dortmund, almost none retained any belief in Thomas Frank.\n\nIt felt as though a bad defeat against the German side - which would have been a fourth loss in a row in all competitions - would not only have led to more boos and more toxicity inside the stadium, but the end of his reign as manager.\n\nInstead, a 2-0 win thanks to first-half goals from Christian Romero and Dominic Solanke is likely to buy Frank some time. An encouraging performance from his depleted team could even give him more than that.\n\nJust a few days earlier, loud boos greeted the final whistle at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as West Ham snatched a last-minute winner.\n\nBefore kick-off on Tuesday there were some jeers once again when Frank's name was read out, but they turned into cheers at full-time as Spurs secured a win that now puts them in a strong position to qualify automatically for the Champions League knockouts.\n\nThe question now is: was this a temporary reprieve for Frank or a platform to build on? And is it enough to win back the fans who had turned against him?\n\nIt was clear many fans had turned on Frank during the defeat by the Hammers, with large numbers singing \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" at him.\n\nThat feeling remained evident before Tuesday's match.\n\n\"I really do think 99% of this stadium are Frank out,\" said Spurs supporter Sarah Sturgeon-Scraggs, who has been attending home games with her dad Ronnie since she was nine.\n\n\"I have enjoyed coming to the matches because of the people we sit with and I get to spend time with my dad, but we get so little joy.\"\n\nRonnie added: \"Barring some sort of miracle on player support, style and results instantly the fans have abandoned him and I feel personally that he must go.\"\n\nThis win and the much-improved first-half performance was still not enough to change their view, with a return to a more conservative and unadventurous display in the second half a cause for frustration.\n\n\"The first half was really enjoyable,\" said Sarah. “There was a lot more movement, a lot more forward passing and a press. However, the second-half performance shows why Frank is not the right person to be managing this team. We went to five at the back, the game ground to a halt. It sucked the joy out of it yet again.\n\nFellow Spurs supporter Ali Speechly held a similar view before kick-off.\n\n\"If we could see signs of what he is trying to achieve we might have more patience,\" she said.\n\n\"It looks like a bunch of players doing what they want.\"\n\nAny change of heart after the game?\n\n\"Much better first half, where has that been? But second half we were dead again,\" she said. \"They either play a good first half or second half. It feels Thomas Frank can't string the two together.\"\n\nSome, however, did see enough to believe Frank can build on this.\n\nAlfie said before the match that Tottenham were playing “like a Championship team”, but after he said: “The first half was brilliant. The second half wasn’t great but we didn’t concede.\n\n“But I am really happy with the result and I think Frank might have a lot more up his sleeve than we think.”\n\nMany of the fans may still need some convincing - but what the display did suggest is that Frank retains the support of the dressing room.\n\nThe players' work rate, intensity and desire was there to see in the first half and when the whistle went for half-time they all gathered before heading down the tunnel together.\n\n\"What I saw tonight was not a performance where the manager had lost the dressing room,\" former Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk of a disjointed dressing room. That wasn't there [against Dortmund].\n\n\"It wasn't full here, the fans voted with their feet, but that was a group of players that played for their manager.\"\n\nThat is something Frank himself was keen to stress in the post-match press conference.\n\n\"The players are giving everything,\" he said.\n\n\"That is an extremely good sign about the culture. An extremely good sign they are together and we are together.\"\n\nFor Tottenham supporters, this season will be providing a sense of deja vu.\n\nThey were dreadful in the Premier League under Ange Postecoglu last term but it was a different story in Europe as they went on to win the Europa League.\n\nIt is a similar story under Frank, with Spurs languishing 14th in the league but in Europe they have lost just once in seven games and are likely just a win away from a place in the Champions League knockouts.\n\n\"There's two Tottenhams running about this season,\" former Scotland striker Ally McCoist said on TNT Sports.\n\n\"Fortunately it was the Tottenham that have been doing well in the Champions League who turned up tonight.\"\n\nRobinson added: \"When your back's against the wall, in adversity, you dig in and get a result.\n\n\"The thing that will frustrate Thomas Frank and these Tottenham fans is where was this in the Premier League? Where was this at the weekend?\"\n\nThere is never long in football to sit back and enjoy a result, and the pressure will be on Frank once again when they take on struggling Burnley in the Premier League at the weekend.\n\nWin that with another impressive performance and some might start to see green shoots of recovery.\n\nLose and the pressure on Frank will once again be immense, something he is all too aware of.\n\n\"The big thing is of course is to build on this with a performance and win against Burnley on Saturday,\" he said.\n\n\"What I would say is it is a big skill to be able to produce in the Premier League and Champions League every week.\n\n\"We just need to keep doing the same thing, keep believing and things will turn.\"\n\nIt has been a difficult few days for Frank, with the negative reaction after the West Ham loss, while news that the club's hierarchy are considering ending his seven-month reign broke on Monday.\n\nAfter all of that, Frank welcomed the opportunity to be able to savour this win against Dortmund for now.\n\n\"Two big glasses of red will be necessary,\" he said. \"I will enjoy them.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Head Coach Cael Sanderson, PJ Duke, and Mitchell Mesenbrink spoke to media ahead of Friday's dual vs. Indiana in Rec Hall.",
    "fullText": "This afternoon, Head Coach Cael Sanderson, 157 lbs starter PJ Duke, and 165 lbs starter Mitchell Mesenbrink spoke to media ahead of Friday’s dual vs. Indiana in Rec Hall.\n\nTranscript Readers: Be sure to watch the first few seconds of Mitchell’s video for a glimpse into his carefree way of being.\n\nYeah, I think the weekend went well. I think just a fun environment. Going on the road and competing is a lot of fun as a team. Obviously, a lot of little things we can improve on collectively and individually—just part of the process of figuring things out and I mean we say this every time we wrestle Iowa, but they do a really good job preparing and they kind of always give you an idea of what you need to get better at and just good competition, good wrestlers, good coaching staff there. So yeah, I think we come away with some ideas on how we can get better. (0:12 – 0:48)\n\nYeah, I don’t know. I mean it’s always just preparation for the next match. So a match comes and goes quickly. Everything comes and goes quickly. So it’s all just preparation. And so I don’t know if anyone’s patting themselves on the back or anything as much as just seeing what can we do better and continue to approach things with enthusiasm and gratitude is kind of the key. (0:58 – 1:28)\n\nYeah, it just depends. I mean the double dual is a double weigh-in. You get a pound now that second dual enough to—I mean the guys love that obviously but I’m not a big deal. But yeah, we’ll just continue to improve our conditioning. I mean we have eight or nine weeks until the nationals, I believe. So we’ll, you know, we got a lot of time to get better and technique and then take our shape up a notch or two. (1:42 – 2:13)\n\nI think Luke [Lilledahl] is just a competitor, number one. He just loves the sport. And he’s just going to keep getting better because that’s just his mindset and he has aspirations of being an Olympic champion and if that’s what you’re trying to do, it’s got to be little steps every day, every week, every month, each year obviously. So yeah, he’ll just keep getting better. He’s definitely the student of the game and a great competitor. Very technical in addition to just being a really good athlete and fast and just having a great feel. So yeah, he’s just a great competitor. He’ll just keep getting better and that’s just his plan. (2:30 – 3:19)\n\nI think they both have done a great job. I mean, they’re competitors. They’re going to go out there and be themselves and the bigger the moment, the better they’re going to wrestle. That’s just what they’ve done their whole lives and that’s what we do as a program. Yeah, great matches. Marcus [Blaze] wrestled a guy he could see in the NCAA finals, right? And [PJ] Duke wrestled an All-American and so it could be the same kind of a situation but the trick is just be yourself regardless of when, where, whoever—just do what you do and they both are great examples of that. (3:42 – 4:18)\n\nI don’t know. I mean, we have a special thing going here, right? I mean, kids know that. They see that. I think I have a pretty good idea of what we’re doing and what we’re not doing. I think in this era and the NIL era and all the different motivations to go to different programs, our kids know that they’re coming here because they want to be the best wrestlers they can possibly be. And so I think when we look back, we’ll see that this era has been good to us because we do our best to follow the rules and we’re going to get the kids that are coming here for the right reasons, right? Because the kids know, recruits know, parents know. So, although it seems like it’s an advantage, I think it’ll be an advantage to us just because kids are coming here with very high character, wanting to be the best wrestlers in the world. (4:34 – 5:35)\n\nYeah, we kind of just threw him in there right away as soon as that decision was made. And Braeden [Davis]is a competitor. He’s fine. He’ll just keep rolling with things and just improve. I thought he wrestled really well on Sunday, bouncing back from a tough loss. I mean, one takedown, there’s such a fine line between winning and losing. So, those are good lessons to learn. And just finishing a shot like you were saying before, getting a stalling call or getting a minute of riding time as opposed to 59 seconds. I mean, that’s just what makes sports fun is just the inches and centimeters that make a difference. He’ll keep competing and just keep getting better as we move forward. (5:44 – 6:36)\n\nI don’t know if there’s anything we didn’t know. He grew up in Pennsylvania, so you watch him—just again, I keep saying our guys are great competitors—but yeah, just a great competitor, very composed. Just wrestled tough and did an awesome job. And it’s just, alright, on to the next one. Obviously, you can’t win the nationals in January, so we’re preparing for the end of the season. And then when we get to the end of the season, it’s the same mindset—we’re just trying to compete to the best of our ability and really preparing for the next tournament because it just gets bigger. Everything gets bigger and things are quickly forgotten and you move on to the next thing. So, it’s just about progress. He’s just a kid that wants to be the best he can possibly be. He’s coachable and he listens, and he follows game plans. Just a tough kid and obviously very talented physically and mentally. (6:46 – 7:45)\n\nI think the chemistry is really incredible right now in the program. Just like I said before, just a lot of good kids that are here for the right reasons. Kids that could have named their price and gone to other schools are here because of what the program represents and stands for. Those are the kids that are going to care about one another and care about the team. When you do that, obviously, you’re going to get your best self and your best individual results. But yeah, these guys, they want to obviously win as individuals, but they’re team guys. The more time they spend together, the better things get. Very good, very close group. Recruits ask how close the guys are, and I think they’re close, but this is a really close group. A lot of really good kids coming from great families, a lot of team mentality, and they want to see each other do well. If it wasn’t like that, it just wouldn’t be fun. It’s got to be bigger than yourself or you’re just going to be miserable all the time. (8:06 – 9:26)\n\nYeah, I don’t think there’s been any surprises with Cole [Mirasola]. He’s just a really tough wrestler. Moves really well. And he’s learning how to wrestle heavyweight. I mean, he bumped up last year at heavyweight, and this would be his third year at heavyweight because his junior year [of high school] he was, but he’s just figuring things out. I don’t think anybody’s surprised. I think the big thing for us as coaches is just him having some nice signature wins for his own confidence. We obviously believe in him and know he can do really, really well and as well as he decides to do. So, yeah, great win for him. As a coaching staff, it’s more about him just knowing and believing that he can do that. So, we’re happy for him, too. (9:46 – 10:34)\n\nGreg [Kerkvliet] is not here anymore—he trains at Lehigh RTC now—but last year I’m sure they wrestled a lot. Greg [Kerkvliet] is a big, strong, athletic, tough guy. If he decides he’s going to win the Olympics, he’s going to win the Olympics. But even just being in the same room as him helped. And then we have a lot of good heavyweights in here and guys in the Nittany Lion Wrestling Club that do a great job. Even with Lucas Cochran, those two had to battle and prepare one another and they’re good friends. I think that was a huge blessing for Cole [Mirasola] to have a big hurdle even just to be the starter this year, which makes everybody stronger. Having a guy like Lucas [Cochran] to wrestle every day—he’s definitely one of the best heavyweights in the country. And everyone knows Coach [Casey] Cunningham is the “heavyweight tamer.” When he comes in, the heavyweights start hiding in the corners trying to get out of there. So, a lot of good training and he’s taken advantage of it all. (10:42 – 12:13)\n\nI’m not really sure what he said, but yeah, Cole [Mirasola] is a nice guy. But just like anything, there was a cartoon my dad had in his office growing up—he was a high school PE teacher and wrestling coach—and it was like a “nice guys finish last” kind of cartoon. It’s not being dirty or cheap—you work within the rules 100%—but then you got to compete. You have to be tough and you have to fight. That goes for all of our guys. There’s never been a great athlete that hasn’t had to fight for things a little bit. Technique is just a small piece. As guys figure that out, it’s kind of fun to see. (12:24 – 13:10)\n\nIt was a pretty crazy environment. It’s like something you dream about your whole life, just Iowa has a good reputation for fans and putting on a good show. So, it was pretty cool to be a part of that. (0:00 – 0:17)\n\nYeah, definitely. I think it’s just amazing kind of what we’re doing and stuff and it’s just incredible to be a part of it. (0:18 – 0:37)\n\nNot really. I kind of just treat every match the same. I try to at least, and I’m sure Marcus [Blaze] is the same. We both have pretty similar mindsets. So, no matter kind of where it is, whether it’s in practice or an actual match or wherever, just try to be the same person as always. And that kind of just helps you stay grounded and don’t let the fans get into the match. But we’ve just been doing it our whole lives, so it’s kind of just regular for us now. (0:38 – 1:19)\n\nYeah, I would have definitely been pretty surprised. I’m grateful to be where I am now and I put in a lot of work in the past, so I think I hold myself to a pretty high standard. I would definitely be proud of myself but I would be like, yeah, I do deserve to be there. (1:21 – 1:50)\n\nYeah, it’s—I mean, just to be at such a great program and to have such good teammates. It’s something that’s unescripable and just it’s kind of special how close our team is. I would say a lot of teams aren’t like that where everyone’s successful and everyone wants each other to get better. Most of the time when people are successful it doesn’t break you down, but not here it’s way different. Everyone wants you to get better and to do better. (1:51 – 2:28)\n\nYeah, it’s pretty special what KD is doing and his pipeline here is definitely amazing because he knows it’s the best place in the world for wrestling. He’s always going to believe that and he wants his guys to be the best in the world. So, he’s obviously going to love them to come here and there’s no better place to be. I’m super excited for those guys, too. They’re going to be really successful when they come here and I’m looking forward to having some fun with them for sure. (2:31 – 3:10)\n\nI would say I was kind of chasing him a little bit. He was more defensive and I would say most of the Iowateam got more defensive the whole time. I kind of just had to be patient and I knew an opening would eventually come and once it did I took advantage of it, took him down and that was pretty much the match. I just again had to be patient and there’s going to be an opportunity every match to score and I just had to take advantage of it. (3:12 – 3:49)\n\nI obviously like scoring a lot of points. That’s the goal is to obviously try and tech or pin everybody I wrestle, but obviously not every match can be perfect. It’s hard to do bonus points every match when guys don’t want to really wrestle too much. Some matches are just going to go a little slower and you got to be patient, but I love to score points, so I’m always going to try and do that. (3:50 – 4:20)\n\nI tried to treat every match similar. So, obviously warming up and stuff, you’re in Carver-Hawkeye Arena, so it’s pretty special. As I was walking out, I was kind of like looking around like, “Wow, this is really happening.” I was talking with Marcus [Blaze] actually before the duel, and I was like, “Yeah, this is crazy. Like we’re literally on Penn State‘s team about to wrestle Iowa.” I think sometimes I do wrestle better under pressure. Having all those fans probably does add a little bit extra pressure, but I try not to let it affect me for the most part, and I’m pretty good about that. (4:21 – 5:07)\n\nHonestly, I didn’t really hear too much to be honest, but we didn’t really give them too much to really chirp at, so they I don’t think they were saying too much. (5:08 – 5:21)\n\nI did hear KD. I can always hear KD. It’s actually kind of crazy. Even with however many fans, I heard KD‘s voice. He’s got a pretty loud voice. (5:22 – 5:32)\n\nIt’s definitely pretty incredible. Just being with this group of guys and being dominant and getting better every day is just so much fun. I think all of us try not to really look at the accolades and the scores and the matches and stuff and we just kind of look at how we can get better. It does mean a lot. Obviously we’re grateful that we did the job good, but we’re just kind of ready to get better and move forward. (5:33 – 6:15)\n\nI don’t know. I don’t think there’s any secret sauce or anything. It’s just keep doing the same things and focusing on the bigger picture of things in terms of getting ready for the next match or preparing for things later in life, not just wrestling. Instilling values into your day-to-day that mean something to you and that mean something to God and that make a difference. Everybody knows them. They’re not some crazy fable or message that you’ve never heard. It’s just making the—what’s the quote? It’s something like extraordinary is just ordinary over and over. (0:18 – 1:10)\n\nI just think it’s nice to be able to look down the line both ways and you got guys that are ready to go. They’re not only ready to go in the wrestling, but they’re enjoying it and they’re having fun. Maybe it’s competing against each other as well—not physically wrestling each other, but whether it’s “I want to get more takedowns than this guy” or whatever. It’s good. I think camaraderie is a big thing, making people feel like they matter and that they belong on a team. (1:27 – 2:03)\n\nHonestly, it’s whoever they send out. Set it up. (2:07 – 2:10)\n\nYou definitely learn a lot about a person and their coaching staff, like what they want to choose to try to throw out and employ against you the next time you wrestle and then the next time. You get to see their thoughts, but then you also get to see who they are when they do step out. Like what was it Mike Tyson said? “Everybody’s got a plan until you get punched in the face.” There is a part of that, but then there’s also a part of preparing. It’s been almost a year since we’ve wrestled, so you get to see things that they’ve tried to implement or they’ve done since then. I think you definitely get better. It’s easier to win once or beat someone one time than it is to continually do it and be successful. Cael [Sanderson] talks about that—it’s harder to win again and again and again. It definitely makes you level up for sure. (2:16 – 3:24)\n\nMaking it a game is definitely fun, like making it enjoyable. It’s just like playing games. You learn a guy—it’s funny, we’ve never spoken, but it’s like we know a lot about each other about little tendencies and little things. I think that’s fun. At the end of the day, you try to make people out to be hero and enemy, but if things got serious and the world turned upside down, you’d want those guys on your team. You’d want to be able to go to battle with any wrestler that you wrestle or compete against. Keeping that in mind, too—no one’s really an enemy. (3:46 – 4:30)\n\nI know what you’re meaning. I just don’t think—I think pride is a very slippery slope and ego and things like that. Like I said earlier, paying attention to the things that matter. If you’re paying attention to things like that, it becomes a thing where you’re not treating everything the same. Then when you’re in NCAA finals and that’s the biggest thing ever, you can’t breathe and your stomach hurts and you’re going out there nervous. At the end of the day, it’s like making this an eternal thing and just like this is more than just a wrestling match. So more so to your point, it’s put who you are, not what you are, out there.

    "description": "Nashville SC played the Chicago Fire in its first preseason match of 2026, losing 4-1 in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.",
    "fullText": "Nashville SC played soccer for the first time in more than two months. And though the result doesn't line up with the club's high expectations for 2026, it's a secondary concern for coach B.J. Callaghan.\n\nNashville lost 4-1 to the Chicago Fire on Jan. 20 in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida in its first preseason game ahead of what might be its most anticipated MLS season ever. Although the match was 90 minutes, starters played for only about half an hour, with backups and players from Huntsville City FC getting the rest of the action.\n\n\"For us, it's more about setting clear objectives of what we worked on this week,\" Callaghan said. \"Being clear with how we're going to evaluate in the game, which would be on certain objectives, a couple phases of play that we were focused on.\"\n\nHere are additional takeaways from the game against the Fire, as well as Nashville's first week of the preseason.\n\nNashville SC arrived in Florida on Jan. 12 and will play four of its six preseason matches there, with the next against the Colorado Rapids on Jan. 23. The team will practice in Nashville for a week ahead of an exhibition at USL club Birmingham Legion on Jan. 31, go back to Florida for two more games and finally face Lexington SC in Nashville on Feb. 14, two days before its CONCACAF Champions Cup opening match at Atletico Ottawa.\n\nNashville dealt with several injuries in its past two preseason training camps, but Callaghan said the team is almost fully healthy, with only one player, Huntsville forward Alioune Ka, sitting out against the Fire.\n\nThat doesn't mean Nashville would be ready to play a competitive game tomorrow.\n\n\"The fitness component is getting there,\" Callaghan said. \"It's growing in the right direction, but we're not where we need to be. We're not 90-minute fit for sure. But it's intentional, and we're gonna build through this preseason.\"\n\nNashville's first MLS game is Feb. 21 against the New England Revolution at Geodis Park (7:30 p.m. CT).\n\nMORE: Nashville SC signals MLS championship aspirations with Cristian Espinoza\n\nNashville's starting lineup looked like a full-strength group. Brian Schwake started at goalkeeper, while new signing Maxwell Woledzi paired with Jeisson Palacios at center back. Dan Lovitz and Andy Najar started at left and right back, respectively.\n\nEdvard Tagseth and Patrick Yazbek held down central midfield, with Alex Muyl and Cristian Espinoza playing on the wings and Hany Mukhtar and Sam Surridge up front in attack.\n\nCallaghan said Nashville started out in the 4-2-2-2 formation, which was its primary setup in 2025. While that remained the base throughout the 90 minutes, Nashville tweaked that shape at different moments.\n\nEspinoza, the club's newest designated player, worked for the first time with the other two DPs, Mukhtar and Surridge. The trio didn't produce any goals, but created a few opportunities, according to Callaghan.\n\n\"They bring different dynamics, whether it's playing between the lines, running behind, being able to get service,\" Callaghan said. \"It's about creating that connection, that chemistry between those three. But at the same time, it's also making sure that we're well dialed-in on the defensive side.\"\n\nMidfielder Charles-Emile Brunet scored Nashville's lone goal on a long shot during the third and final shift, which consisted largely of trialists and draft picks. Brunet was Nashville's third-round pick in December's MLS SuperDraft out of SMU.\n\nJacob Shames can be reached by email at jshames@gannett.com and on X/Twitter @Jacob_Shames.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nashville Tennessean: Nashville SC MLS preseason takeaways, what we learned",

    "description": "Joe Lunardi dropped UNC to a No. 7 seed as defensive issues and recent losses cloud the Tar Heels’ NCAA tournament outlook.",
    "fullText": "With March looming, fans are already scouring bracket projections to see where their teams might land.\n\nThat’s especially true in Chapel Hill, where North Carolina’s uneven ACC play has raised questions about Hubert Davis and the direction of the program. The Tar Heels are 14-4 overall but just 2-3 in league games and have dropped three of their last four.\n\nESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi has taken notice. In his latest update, he slots North Carolina as a No. 7 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament, a slide from last week when the Tar Heels were listed as a No. 5 seed in the East.\n\nNo. 1 Michigan vs. No. 16 ColgateNo. 8 UCF vs. No. 9 AuburnNo. 5 Kansas vs. No. 12 Murray StateNo. 4 Florida vs. No. 13 TroyNo. 6 Villanova vs. No. 11 George MasonNo. 3 Illinois vs. No. 14 UNC WilmingtonNo. 7 North Carolina vs. No. 10 USC/New MexicoNo. 2 Houston vs. No. 15 North Dakota State\n\nThe path out of the Midwest is anything but straightforward.\n\nIn Joe Lunardi’s latest projections, North Carolina opens against the survivor of the First Four game between New Mexico and Southern California.\n\nNew Mexico sits near the top tier of mid-major programs and may be stronger than most of the opponents Carolina has seen to this point. The Lobos are No. 40 in the NET rankings, a better mark than many of the teams on UNC’s schedule. USC, meanwhile, is a capable Big Ten squad whose guard play could expose one of North Carolina’s biggest weaknesses — defending the perimeter.\n\nShould the Tar Heels get through that first test, they would likely draw Houston in the next round, a matchup that could easily spell the end of their tournament run.\n\nWell, the Tar Heels can’t play defense at the moment despite being one of the most efficient teams scoring wise in the conference.\n\nThe Tar Heels rank 16th in field-goal percentage allowed (49.7%) and 17th in points allowed (85.4 per game) and defensive efficiency (120.5).\n\nThe perimeter numbers are especially glaring.\n\nNorth Carolina’s defensive problems start on the perimeter.\n\nThe Tar Heels rank last in the league in 3-point field-goal percentage defense (44.9%) and in effective field-goal percentage, a metric that weighs 3-pointers more heavily. Opponents have shot at least 40% from beyond the arc against UNC in four straight games. Since the start of ACC play, teams have made 72 3-pointers against the Tar Heels — an average of 14.4 per game, the worst rate in the conference.\n\nThe issues don’t stop on the inside. North Carolina is 14th in 2-point field-goal percentage defense and provides little resistance at the rim, sitting 12th in block percentage and 14th in blocks per game. Still, most of the damage is being done from long range.\n\nAnother problem that has flown under the radar is UNC’s inability to force turnovers. The Tar Heels have struggled to create miscues all season and rank second to last in the ACC and 341st nationally in turnover rate across all games. In conference play, they are 16th in turnover percentage and 18th in non-steal turnover percentage — the category that includes forced passes out of bounds, drawn charges and similar plays.\n\nGiven those numbers and a schedule that only gets tougher, North Carolina needs to start stacking quality wins and limiting bad losses to improve its NCAA tournament positioning.\n\nFollow us@TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of North CarolinaTar Heels news, notes and opinions\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC Basketball: Tar Heels sliding in latest Bracketology",

    "fullText": "For the past seven years, the Raiders have fielded the same kicker and punter. And for the last three years they've had the same kick squad trio of kicker Daniel Carlson, punter AJ Cole, and long snapper Jacob Bobenmoyer. But it looks like that trio could be breaking up this offseason.\n\nCole was given a long term extension prior to this past season. Meanwhile Carlson and Bobenmoyer are both set to become free agents this March. The team had every opportunity to re-sign either or both of them. just as they did Cole, but opted not to do that.\n\nIf the team were to sign Carlson back, you'd have to figure they would sign Bobenmoyer as well, just to keep the band together for continuity purposes.\n\nTuesday, the team signed long snapper Alex Ward on a reserve/futures contract, signaling they are prepared to let Bobenmoyer go, which, in turn, would suggest they are preparing to let Carlson go as well.\n\nWard spent the past three seasons with the LA Rams. He was waived last November, which is why he's signing with the Raiders instead of preparing to play in the NFC Championship game right now.\n\nThe three-year veteran went undrafted out of Central Florida where he was the long snapper for three years.\n\nThere is no guarantee he will be the team's long snapper going forward, but the mere fact they have added him suggests a change at the position is coming.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Raiders Wire: Raiders latest signing could signal end for longtime kick squad",

Hockenson has had a solid run as a member of the Minnesota Vikings, but his days in Minnesota may be numbered.\n\nThe Vikings could be looking to free up some salary cap space over the offseason, and cutting the veteran tight end could be an avenue to that end.\n\nIn a recent article, ESPN’s Aaron Schatz predicts that the Vikings will indeed cut Hockenson to free up $9 million or \n\n“With little cap space, the Vikings will say goodbye to tight end T.J. Hockenson, who has had injury issues and is coming off two straight years with fewer than 500 receiving yards. He ranked 35th among tight ends in ESPN's receiver scores this season. Cutting Hockenson would save the Vikings nearly $9 million in cap space before June 1 and $16 million if designated after June 1.”\n\nHockenson is a solid player who has made two Pro Bowls in his career. But, the Viking could probably get comparable production at the position for a cheaper price, and with other needs to address, it makes sense that the Vikings would look to shed cap space where they can.\n\nMinnesota will have an opportunity to identify a replacement for Hockenson in the upcoming 2026 NFL Draft. They could also look to fill the position with a cheaper option via free agency.\n\nMeanwhile, Hockenson is still just 28 years old and should still have some productive play in front of him.

It also helps that Stockton had a relationship with Nunley, as the new Michigan assistant coach was recruiting him when he was on staff at Boise State.\n\n247Sports’ Blair Angulo had good things to say about Nunley’s skills: “A talented cover corner with really good fluidity, the 6-foot, 180-pound Nunley has been a steady riser the last couple years and has seen his stock shift in an upward trajectory. He has shown a knack for man coverage and the ability to impact plays at the catch-point. Nunley had a strong senior season at Western where he was rarely tested on the perimeter, and he was one of the more consistent performers in the off-season showcase circuit.”\n\nThe stats from that “strong” senior year — 57 total tackles, 20 pass deflections, five interceptions and two forced fumbles. He also recorded 26 tackles, two interceptions and 10 total passes defended his junior season.\n\nWith former Michigan signee, four-star cornerback Andre Clarke Jr., being released from his letter of intent earlier this month, it’s good that Kyle Whittingham and company were able to seal the deal here and bring in another cornerback. He joins four-star safety Jordan Deck as the only members of the secondary for the Wolverines in the 2026 recruiting class.\n\nNunley is ranked No. 101 in the state of California, No. 108 at the cornerback position and No. 1,277 overall in the 2026 class on the 247Sports composite. Check out some of his senior year film down below.",

Now, they need to get back at them, and luckily, there’s a perfect player to do it with.\n\nAccording to Fansided’s Zachary Rotman, the Phillies could be a top suitor for former MVP and All-Star Cody Bellinger. Bellinger would address their outfield problems, and would take Bellinger from the Mets, who are also seen as another top suitor.\n\nMORE: Proposed blockbuster Giants trade sees San Francisco gut punch Dodgers by dealing for $152 million two-time All-Star ace, create 1-2 punch with Logan Webb\n\n“The Phillies need to improve their offense. They admitted such by pursuing Bichette. Bellinger might not be the hitter Bichette is, but he's a really good one nonetheless, and he's a much better defender and base runner. Plus, I'd argue the outfield is much more of a weakness than the infield, so signing Bellinger, an outfielder, could prove to be even more helpful,” Rotman wrote.\n\nThis past season, Bellinger slashed .272/.334/.480/.813 with 25 doubles, 29 home runs, and 98 RBI in 152 games played. He would definitely give the Phillies a facelift in the outfield, and replace Max Kepler as he serves his suspension for P.E.D. use.\n\nMORE: Mets predicted to steal another superstar from crosstown rivals, sign $182 million MVP to create super outfield with Juan Soto\n\nBellinger is projected to receive a six-year, $182 million deal, and that might be too much for the Phillies. However, they were going to offer Bichette seven years, so what’s stopping Philly from doing the same for Bellinger?\n\nHopefully, the Phillies cement their position and get in touch with Bellinger’s camp ASAP.

    "description": "Baker Mayfield still steamed about how it ended in Cleveland, is looking forward to seeing Kevin Stefanski in Atlanta.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns have experienced little to no success since their return to the NFL in 1999.\n\nBut there was one brief period where it appeared the franchise had finally turned the corner.\n\nThat was in 2020, when first-year head coach Kevin Stefanski and third-year quarterback Baker Mayfield helped lead the Browns to the playoffs for the first time in 18 years.\n\nOnce there, they handed the Pittsburgh Steelers the third playoff loss in what is now a seven-game postseason losing streak, and then pushed the Kansas City Chiefs to the brink before falling in the Divisional Round of the playoffs.\n\nAt the time, it seemed as if the Browns had finally cracked the code with a young head coach and a brash quarterback joining together to take on the NFL.\n\nThis is Cleveland, of course, where everything ends badly when it involves the Browns, so the joy did not last long.\n\nIn 2021, an injured shoulder left Mayfield ineffective, and the Browns lost four of their last six games to miss the playoffs. That offseason, ownership made the ill-fated decision to trade for quarterback Deshaun Watson, shipped Mayfield to the Carolina Panthers for peanuts (a conditional fifth-round selection), and things were never the same.\n\nMayfield bounced from the Panthers to the Los Angeles Rams before landing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2023, where he has thrown for 12,237 yards and 95 touchdowns in three seasons, while leading the Buccaneers to the playoffs twice.\n\nMeanwhile, in Cleveland, the Browns cycled through quarterbacks as Watson was suspended in 2022, and then injured in 2023 and 2024, limiting him to just 19 games.\n\nA surprise playoff appearance in 2023 helped to ease some of the hurt, but a combined record of 8-26 the past two seasons finally brought an end to Stefanski’s tenure in Cleveland. (When you can’t fire the owner, someone has to take the fall.)\n\nAs fate would have it, Stefanski was recently hired by the Atlanta Falcons, who share the NFC South Division with the Buccaneers and Mayfield, setting up an annual home-and-home meeting between the head coach and his former quarterback.\n\n#Falcons’ Kevin Stefanski had a dumpster fire at quarterback in Cleveland — Baker Mayfield and Deshaun Watson failed, which started a chain reaction to 11 other starters. QB Shedeur Sanders closed out last season with seven starts. https://t.co/nnuXs2ZCbd\n\n— D. Orlando Ledbetter (@DOrlandoAJC) January 20, 2026\n\nThat is an angle that D. Orland Ledbetter at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution explored on Tuesday in a (paywalled) column that described Stefanski’s time in Cleveland as a “dumpster fire” at the quarterback position.\n\nFailed is quite the reach pal. Still waiting on a text/call from him after I got shipped off like a piece of garbage. Can’t wait to see you twice a year, Coach. https://t.co/jUUsYkvlOC\n\n— Baker Mayfield (@bakermayfield) January 20, 2026\n\nMayfield, as he has been wont to do during his career, decided to throw some additional fuel on the fire by calling out both Ledbetter and the way his former coach handled the end of their time together in Cleveland:\n\nFailed is quite the reach pal. Still waiting on a text/call from him after I got shipped off like a piece of garbage. Can’t wait to see you twice a year, Coach.\n\nThe NFC South has always been a strange division, where rivalries, like the one between the Falcons and New Orleans Saints, are rarely noticed on a national level. But with Mayfield and Stefanski now in the same division, the Falcons and Buccaneers games this fall are going to be must-see TV.\n\nAnd in a fun scheduling twist, the Browns play both the Falcons and Buccaneers next season, with Atlanta and Stefanski coming to Cleveland, but, sadly, the Browns are facing the Buccaneers in Tampa.",

    "description": "If all goes well this Saturday at UFC 324, Rose Namajunas could be on the cusp of two-division glory.",
    "fullText": "Nearly four years have passed since Rose Namajunas reigned supreme as the UFC strawweight champion. And if all goes well this Saturday at UFC 324, she could be on the cusp of two-division glory.\n\nNamajunas, 33, has fought five times since moving up to the flyweight division in 2023, defeating Tracy Cortez, Amanda Ribas and most recently Miranda Maverick in June. To start her 2026 campaign, Namajunas faces off this weekend against the division's No. 2-ranked contender, Natalia Silva. Appearing Tuesday on \"The Ariel Helwani Show,\" Namajunas revealed UFC officials told her a win will earn her a title shot, which means a fight against her good friend, flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko.\n\n“It would be weird, but I mean, we’re martial artists,\" Namajunas told Uncrowned. \"I would love to have a conversation about it and talk with her first and everything like that. She’s somebody that inspired me and that I’ve looked up to. It would definitely be conflicting emotions, but at the same time, I’m down to do it. I also understand if there'd be second thoughts or if it would be kind of weird.\"\n\nThe thought of a Shevchenko fight has floated around in Namajunas' mind since she first gained steam at 125 pounds. For a brief spell, she didn't have to worry about the two meeting in the Octagon, thanks to Alexa Grasso's momentary title run. But Shevchenko ultimately won the belt back from Grasso in 2024, and now the prospective collision between friends appears closer than it's ever been before.\n\n\"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it, but honestly, just as a fan of hers, she’s literally my favorite female fighter, for real,\" Namajunas said of the 37-year-old Shevchenko. \"So it would be so weird because, obviously, I would never want to see her lose, but then I would have to go into a fight and try to beat her. Then, at the same time, as a martial artist, it would just be the ultimate culmination of being able to test myself, because she and Amanda Nunes are the greatest female fighters in MMA [history].\n\n\"It would just be a dream come true, but at the same time, it would definitely be like, 'Ahh!' That's kind of what fighting is — it's weird. I don't hate anybody I fight. I fought people like Tecia Torres — we trained together, then we fought, then we trained together, then we fought [again]. I've done it before. I don't have to hate anybody to compete.\n\n\"It doesn't mean I'm going to be like, 'We're going to have sleepovers and be best friends after,' or anything,\" Namajunas added. \"I love all my opponents, even the ones that maybe I was rivals with. Afterward it's water under the bridge, it's nothing.\"\n\nNamajunas was initially slated to meet Grasso at UFC 324 before the Mexican contender withdrew due to injury, allowing Silva to step in as a late-replacement. A fight against either women wouldn't have been easy for Namajunas though, and the odds reflected that — \"Thug Rose\" was slotted as a betting underdog in both pairings. Grasso opened as a heavy -400 favorite to beat Namajunas on BetMGM lines; against Silva, Namajunas' margin has only widened, with Silva currently listed as a -450 favorite.\n\nRegarding the difficulty of the matchups, Namajunas agrees with the moneyline view, however that's also why she's happier with Saturday's current matchup than with her previous one.\n\n“Stylistically, I think Natalia is just a trickier style to deal with than somebody like Alexa,\" Namajunas said. \"The toughness that Alexa would have brought, just her mental fortitude and how she seems like she doesn't change, no matter what's happening in the fight, that would have posed a different challenge than Natalia.\n\n\"So I’m definitely happier with the change-up, because I feel like I get closer to my goal faster with Natalia, as opposed to Alexa. Even with a dominant performance against Alexa, I don’t know where that would leave me in the mix [for a title shot]. ... Natalia definitely brings more challenges than Alexa did.”\n\nStill young despite her 13-year professional MMA run, Namajunas has accomplished nearly everything she's needed to at this point. Her two UFC title reigns at strawweight etched her into the history books, and while a third at 115 pounds would've been impressive, she's been happy to stay up at flyweight.\n\nEven with her friend manning the throne, the hardware Shevchenko holds is all the motivation Namajunas needs to keep going.\n\n\"I'm not at a stage where I can just not do anything for the rest of my life,\" Namajunas said. \"So finances are still a factor, but it's not the main motivating factor. If anything, I'm good with where I've wanted to be financially, as far as what I've wanted to get out of fighting. I've sort of accomplished most of what I wanted to do.\n\n\"But basically, it's the two-division [champion status] — to just have that as an accomplishment would be a dream come true. It's on the list of when I had goals to achieve in MMA, that was one of the goals that I had.\"",

    "description": "The former outfielders will join Jeff Kent in this year’s induction class",
    "fullText": "Former outfielders Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones have been elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame as part of the 2026 class, as both players reached the 75% threshold for induction as voted on by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America (BBWAA).\n\nThe duo will join second baseman Jeff Kent in the 2026 class, as Kent was selected by the Contemporary Baseball Era Committee back in December.\n\nBoth Beltrán and Jones finished just shy of making the Hall a year ago, as Beltrán received 70.3% of the vote and Jones hit 66.2%. Beltrán, now in his fourth year on the ballot, received 84.2% of the 425 ballots cast, while Jones, in his ninth year on the ballot, reached 78.4%.\n\nBeltrán, 48, seemed like a first-ballot lock near the end of his career, but after he reportedly took a key role in the 2017 Astros’ sign-stealing scandal, he lost his managerial job with the Mets before coaching a game, and his reputation was tarnished.\n\nStill, Beltrán finished his career with 70.0 bWAR, batting .279/.350/.486 with 435 homers, 2,725 hits, 1,587 RBIs, 1,582 runs, and 312 steals over 2,586 games during his 20-year career. He was also named AL Rookie of the Year with the Royals in 1999, and he was selected as an All-Star nine times, won a pair of Silver Sluggers, and three Gold Gloves.\n\nJones, also 48, had a slightly shorter career than Beltrán, playing 17 seasons from 1996 to 2012, though he still accumulated 62.7 bWAR. One of the greatest outfield gloves in baseball history, Jones won 10 Gold Gloves, a Silver Slugger, and was named an All-Star five times. For his career, he hit .254/.337/.486 with 434 homers, 2,196 hits, 1,289 RBIs, 1,204 runs, and 152 steals over 2,196 games.\n\nBeltrán will likely enter the Hall as either a Kansas City Royal or a New York Met. He spent seven years with both clubs, starting his career in Kansas City and accumulating 24.8 bWAR there before spending 2005-2011 in New York, totaling 31.1 bWAR with the Mets. Jones will almost certainly go in as an Atlanta Brave, having spent 12 of his 17 MLB seasons in Atlanta and totaling 61.0 of his 62.7 bWAR with the Braves.\n\nBeyond Beltrán and Jones, the only other player to break the 50% threshold was former second baseman Chase Utley, who garnered 251 votes, good for 59.1%. Andy Pettitte and Félix Hernández both fell just shy of 50%, as Pettitte received 48.5% of the vote on his eighth ballot and Hernández got 46.1% of the vote in his second year on the ballot.\n\nOf the 12 first-year candidates, Cole Hamels is the only name to remain on the ballot entering next year, as the left-handed starter received 23.8% of the vote. Ryan Braun led the group of players who won’t return to the ballot, as he picked up 15 votes (3.5%). Former Brewer Gio González received no votes, while former closer Francisco Rodríguez received 50 votes (11.8%) and will remain on the ballot for a fifth year next time around.\n\nCongratulations to Beltrán and Jones on joining Kent and the other 354 elected members (281 players) in the Hall this summer! The full voting results of this year’s ballot are below.\n\nBBWAA elects Carlos Beltran, Andruw Jones to Hall of Fame. pic.twitter.com/NpBXWv9Q2S\n\n— BBWAA (@officialBBWAA) January 20, 2026",

    "description": "Loan Huynh, an immigration attorney in Minneapolis, shared her advice for employers and employees as ICE continues heavy enforcement in the area.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Loan Huynh, an attorney who serves as the chair of the immigration department at Frederickson & Byron, a law firm based in Minneapolis. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThere's a huge concentration of ICE enforcement right now in Minnesota, specifically here in the Twin Cities. My law firm works with both employers and their employees.\n\nEmployees are very scared — they may be specifically being targeted by ICE, or they have family members or loved ones who are being targeted by ICE and they want to protect them, or they're just scared to be out in public.\n\nThe ICE action isn't just against individuals who are foreign nationals in Minnesota; it's against anyone who appears to be a foreign national, or anyone who's questioned and believed to be not cooperating with ICE — and there could be potential consequences, as we've seen.\n\nIt's a really difficult time for employers now, too. They're facing situations where they may have employees who can no longer work for them or who don't want to come to work, so they have to look at providing them with work-from-home options or other arrangements.\n\nICE is coming to their parking lots or places of business; we're getting questions from employers about how to ensure ICE doesn't have access to their spaces.\n\nWe know that this administration is taking a much broader interpretation of what rights they have in order to enforce immigration laws, and employers must be prepared for this.\n\nAs any law-abiding citizen or entity, you want to cooperate with law enforcement, but it doesn't mean that you don't have rights.\n\nThese are private properties that the businesses own, and businesses can restrict access.\n\nUnless there is some type of judicial order, warrant, or subpoena, there is no obligation for an employer to undertake enforcement activities or to perform the work of ICE activities here.\n\nIf you're communicating that they cannot enter your place of business — such as with a sign that says it's private property and there is no access to ICE — they don't have the right to do that.\n\nWe recommend that employers establish a protocol ahead of time about what they're going to do if ICE comes to their place of employment or contacts them about a specific employee.\n\nWe know now that it can happen; we're seeing it in Minnesota in ways we've never seen before.\n\nHere are questions that I think all employers in the US need to really need to address before that happens:\n\nEmployers should prepare early, before ICE comes to your neighborhood, to your place of employment, or to your city.\n\nIf ICE produces a judicial warrant asking for information or a subpoena about a certain individual, the employer should seek counsel to see what they must do in order to comply with it, whether it's right away or to inform ICE that they need additional time.\n\nIf ICE comes and says, \"I want to talk to this individual,\" and there's no warrant to allow that, an employer can respond, \"Thank you for the request. We will need to seek counsel in order to determine the next steps. We'll be happy to convey this information to the individual when we are able to.\"\n\nI was just on the phone with an employer about potential scenarios that they may face. I asked them, \"What do you plan to do if ICE comes to your parking lot and just parks there? How will you respond to that? Or if you get a call from one of your employees who says, 'I'm too scared to walk out of my car here. I see that there are ICE agents in the parking lot.'\"\n\nIt's so important for employers to prepare for any possible scenario, role-play, and determine, with their counsel, how they will respond to a request from a government agent or ICE.\n\nWe're seeing situations where an individual will say, \"I don't want to speak with you,\" or, \"I have counsel. Please contact my counsel,\" and the ICE agents continue to pressure them. They get very scared, and that's understandable, but please remember that you do have the constitutional right to be silent and not to speak to any investigator without counsel.\n\nWe have Know Your Rights information on our website. Everyone should know they have the right to choose whether to speak to a government agent. They have constitutional rights that, just because they are being threatened by an individual, don't mean that they have to succumb to those threats or requests.\n\nAre you a business owner or employee who's had an experience with ICE?

    "description": "The US reaching a diplomatic agreement with Denmark that could expand the US's presence in Greenland looks like the most likely outcome, JPMorgan said.",
    "fullText": "That is, Trump Always Chickens Out, or the idea that the president's aggressive policy tactics are mostly bluster aimed at getting a party to the negotiating table.\n\nThat's the question investors are mulling this week as the market swoons amid Trump's fiery comments about the future of Greenland, which he has said the US needs to control for national security.\n\nThe White House has told investors not to count on Trump backing down before, but his latest attempt to put pressure on Denmark has Wall Street talking about the president's notorious negotiation style again.\n\nTrump's most recent maneuver has been to threaten eight European nations with 10% tariffs starting in February, ramping up to 25% in June if no deal on Greenland is reached.\n\nTo some forecasters, the Greenland situation is clear: It's another opportunity for investors to position for the TACO trade.\n\n\"I think we need to read this from an 'Art of the Deal' perspective,\" analysts at JPMorgan's international markets intelligence desk wrote in a note on Tuesday. \"Trump creates noise and throws in a maximal stance designed to trigger negotiation and create leverage/urgency.\"\n\n\"The market wants to see if today is TACO Tuesday,\" the bank's market intelligence team added.\n\n\"How much uncertainty investors can stomach is a good question, but the resolve in the FOMO and TACO trade (the belief that President Trump is bluffing on Greenland and is only working to secure a 'deal') has proven time and again to be very difficult to break,\" David Rosenberg, a top economist and the president of Rosenberg Research, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\nAmid talk of a TACO trade revival, analysts say they see a handful of outcomes from Trump's tough talk on Greenland. Here are three ways forecasters see the situation playing out.\n\nThe US reaching an agreement with Denmark that could expand US presence in Greenland — such as by getting access to the territory's natural resources — looks like the most likely outcome, JPMorgan said, pegging the scenario with a 55% probability.\n\n\"We know Trump opens with a maximal stance, designed to trigger negotiation and create leverage. This is no different,\" the bank said, noting that the timing of the tariff threats looked \"not coincidental,\" given that the World Economic Forum is in full swing this week.\n\nAnalysts added that a sale of Greenland looks \"less likely\" due to the need to get Denmark's approval, and the US using military force to take Greenland looks \"highly unlikely,\" since it would draw pushback from Republican lawmakers and voters. The US attacking another NATO member could also open the door to further aggression from the bloc's rivals, JPMorgan added.\n\nThere's a 40% chance Trump's new tariffs won't be implemented at all, possibly by Trump's \"own retreat,\" according to Matt Gertken, the chief geopolitical and US political strategist at BCA Research.\n\nGertken added that he believed there was a 70% chance the situation in Greenland would have a \"non-military\" solution, and a 30% chance that solution would involve a short-term trade war with Europe.\n\n\"Global stocks would fall, while US treasuries and the dollar would fall, but the administration would then change course, as it did after Liberation Day,\" he wrote in a client note on Monday.\n\nChristopher Granville, a managing director at TS Lombard, added that he believed the most likely outcome was a \"truce\" between the US and Europe, with the US likely suspending tariffs as negotiations over Greenland stretch on.\n\nThat was what happened when Trump first introduced tariffs on Mexico and Canada last year, Granville added, later pointing to political pressures from the coming midterm elections, which could incentivize Trump to lower tariffs.\n\n\"Some commentators may slap the TACO label on any such truce that could be agreed at this week's in-person meetings in Davos between Trump and various European leaders,\" Granville said, though he noted that the situation wouldn't be a \"TACO for real\" scenario, since the US wasn't backing down on Greenland entirely.\n\nThe expected Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariffs could also come into play.\n\nBCA estimated there was around a 50% chance the Supreme Court could strike down Trump's tariffs, up from a 30% chance the firm had predicted earlier.\n\n\"Normally the court would defer to the president on international issues. But now the president threatens to entangle the court in lawless behavior that threatens the court's credibility and the constitutional balance of powers,\" Gertken said, pointing to Trump's threats against the NATO alliance. \"So we have less confidence that the court will defend the president's stance.\"\n\nJPMorgan's international market intelligence team said the latest tariff threats were \"riddled with challenges.\"\n\n\"First, the proposed tariffs are based on IEEPEA, which the Supreme Court could imminently rule to be illegal in their application. Second, I would think it practically impossible to tariff 6x EU countries at a different rate to other members, given the freedom of movement of goods which structurally exists within the EU,\" the bank's Matthew See wrote.",

    "fullText": "Montana's Glacier National Park typically sees over 2 million visitors between May and August each year.\n\nAlthough I love taking in the park's beauty in the warmer seasons, this spike in visitation can often lead to long lines to enter the park.\n\nHowever, after living near the park for 35 years, I've discovered the best time to visit is during the less-chaotic winter months.\n\nAlthough many of the park's services are technically closed from early October through late May, I love the peace and solitude the park offers during this time.\n\nVisiting Glacier National Park in the winter requires a bit more planning, but in my opinion, it's worth it. Here are my tips for visiting during the offseason.\n\nDuring the winter months, a pass is still required to visit the park, even if no one is manning the entrance. Luckily, though, the rates are typically cheaper than they would be in the winter months.\n\nEntrance passes can be purchased online via the National Parks Service website.\n\nMany of the park's roads are closed in the winter, making for great opportunities for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.\n\nSince our boys were young, we've loved strapping on cross-country skis or snowshoes to travel along Going-to-the-Sun Road for a couple of miles until we reach the bridge that crosses McDonald Creek.\n\nIn this section of the park, we pass through an area of dense, old-growth western hemlock and western red cedar that feels like the forests of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nJust keep in mind that if you decide to travel to higher elevations, you need to be prepared for changing winter conditions, and be familiar with avalanche safety.\n\nIf you want to explore the area with a knowledgeable guide, head to the Apgar Visitor Center for one of the ranger-led snowshoe outings held weekends from the end of December to the middle of March.\n\nIf you don't have your own snowshoes, you can rent a pair for $2.\n\nThis is a fantastic opportunity to learn about the park in the winter and look for signs of wildlife in the snow.\n\nOne of my most important pieces of advice is to not take the winter lightly when visiting Glacier. There is little or no cell service throughout most of the park, and the weather can quickly switch from idyllic to a blizzard.\n\nLeave your cotton clothing at home, and instead opt for wool, alpaca, or synthetic fabrics that wick away sweat. Wear multiple layers, including a wind-breaking outer layer, a hat, and gloves.\n\nAlso, remember to fill your gas tank or charge your electric vehicle before entering the park, as you will not have the opportunity to do so once you get inside.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 23, 2024, and most recently updated on January 20, 2026.",

    "description": "The Dow tumbled 870 points on Tuesday as investors assessed the impact of Trump's intensifying push to take control of Greenland.",
    "fullText": "US stocks plunged, and bonds sold off on Tuesday on Donald Trump's feud with Europe over Greenland.\n\nAfter spending much of 2025 doubting the president over everything from tariffs to threats to fire Fed boss Jerome Powell, stocks had their worst day since October amid Donald Trump's fight with European nations about who should control the Danish territory.\n\nThe sell America trade was in the spotlight again on Tuesday amid the latest turmoil.\n\nUS stocks plunged as investors took in the latest tariff threats targeting eight European Union countries if Denmark doesn't put Greenland up for sale by the start of February. EU leaders have discussed hitting back with tariffs of their own.\n\nMajor indexes fell sharply, with losses accelerating in afternoon trading. The Dow dropped almost 900 points, and traders sought shelter in defensive assets like gold and silver. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined more than 2%.\n\nLong-dated US Treasury yields spiked, while the US dollar declined against a basket of other currencies. Highlighting tensions in the bond market, a Danish pension said it was exiting the market for US government debt, with plans to dump $100 million in Treasurys due to \"poor\" US government finances.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood around 4 p.m. ET closing bell on Tuesday:\n\nHere were other big moves across markets:\n\nUntil now, investors had mostly brushed off Trump's talk of taking over Greenland.\n\nThat seems to have changed now that tariffs are back in the picture.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said eight NATO countries, including Denmark, would face a 10% tariff on goods exported to the US in February, with the rate increasing to 25% in June if Denmark doesn't agree to \"the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\"\n\n\"The United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years,\" the president wrote on his social media platform over the weekend, pointing to new defense initiatives that make acquiring Greenland \"especially important\" for the US.\n\n\"The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them, including maximum protection, over so many decades,\" he continued.\n\nThe sell-off has largely been driven by investors trimming their exposure to US equities now that tariffs, a major concern for markets all throughout last year, appear to be on the table, David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors also seem worried that the Supreme Court ruling on Trump's reciprocal tariffs could add further volatility in markets, he added.\n\n\"The US President upped his aggressive rhetoric overnight,\" Morrison said of the selling pressure. \"While some on Wall Street argue any tariff-driven sell-off could be a buying opportunity as the earnings season picks up steam, the scale and breadth of Trump's rhetoric have unsettled risk appetite.\"\n\nThe latest tariff threats are also driving a flight to safe-haven or defensive assets, like metals. Gold rose another 3% while silver jumped 8%.\n\n\"Global investors are clearly adding to the risk premium embedded in US assets, and diversification flows are picking up,\" Karl Schamotta, the chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions, wrote in a note.\n\nA major move in Japan's bond market also contributed to some of the volatility in the US. The yield on Japan's 40-year government bond hit a record 4.21% on Tuesday as investors weighed a new tax cut proposal that has raised concerns about the nation's growing deficit.\n\nThe nation's 10-year government bond yield also increased by more than 10 basis points to trade around 2.38%, a level that hasn't been seen in 27 years.\n\nRising yields in Japan have sparked fresh concern about the amount of foreign capital flowing into US markets. Specifically, investors are worried about the unwinding of the yen carry trade, a popular strategy in which traders borrow money at low rates in Japan to deploy in markets that offer higher returns, such as the US.\n\n\"As a sliding yen triggers intervention chatter, the fate of the massive 'yen-carry trade' hangs in the balance,\" Ed Yardeni, the President of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note to clients over the weekend.",

    "title": "Suicides Were Frequent at the Golden Gate Bridge. Not Anymore",
    "description": "For decades, there had been an average of 30 each year. With a new deterrent in place, there were none in the second half of 2025.",
    "fullText": "The Golden Gate Bridge, the iconic span that hangs between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, has been the site of more than 2,000 confirmed suicide leaps since its completion in 1937. The true death toll is certainly higher, since not all jumps are witnessed and not all bodies are recovered.\n\nIn 2006, at least 34 people jumped to their deaths by crossing the four-foot rail and plunging more than 200 feet into the strait below. It was also the year that Paul Muller and two others with family members who had jumped from the bridge decided to do something.\n\nThat something slowly evolved into a complicated, miles-long series of stainless-steel nets — a “suicide deterrent system” — now strung on both sides of the bridge. It is out of sight to the millions of people who cross the bridge every year, but plainly visible to anyone standing at the rail, looking down.\n\nFor decades, there had been an average of 30 suicides at the bridge each year. In 2024, as the final pieces of the net were installed and tweaks were made, there were eight.\n\nIn 2025, the first full year with the nets in place, there were four, and none between June and December.\n\nThat annual total is surely among the fewest ever recorded at the bridge, and seven months might be the longest stretch without a suicide at the bridge, though early records are sparse.\n\n“The last seven months there were zero, so the results couldn’t be better,” Mr. Muller said.\n\nMr. Muller was disheartened to learn that there has been one suicide early in 2026. But the goal all along was to save lives, and to eventually undo the dark magnetism of the bridge as a place to die.\n\nDenis Mulligan oversees the bridge operations as general manager of the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District. His office at the south end of the bridge overlooks the steady flow of cars, pedestrians and bikes that cross between San Francisco and Marin County.\n\nIn late 2023, as the installation of the nets was nearing completion, Mr. Mulligan said it would take a year or two of data collection to assess the impact of the nets on the death toll outside his window.\n\nEarly in 2026, Mr. Mulligan considered the results.\n\n“The assessment is that the net is working as intended,” Mr. Mulligan said. “We’re trying to reduce the number of deaths. That’s what government should do, is protect the public. We were candid up front that nothing’s 100 percent, but that we think this is a worthwhile endeavor and good for the community. And we think a lot of people are alive today because of the project.”\n\nMr. Mulligan also oversees a vast electronic surveillance system and a team of on-bridge officers whose responsibilities include identifying and stopping those who are considering a leap. Last year, there were 94 successful interventions, about half as many as the average before the nets.\n\n“Nets” is a misnomer; they are taut, marine-grade stainless steel cables about 20 feet below the public walkways on both sides of the bridge. The idea is that anyone who jumps into the net will be injured enough, or at least shaken enough, to keep them from crawling out and intentionally falling the rest of the way to the water.\n\nMr. Mulligan, wary of attracting copycat attempts, declined to explain how those who have died by suicide the past two years have circumvented the nets. He also declined to say how many people have jumped into them and been rescued.\n\nBut the immeasurable number might be those who came to the bridge, spotted the nets and decided that suicide there was no longer possible.\n\nIn 1937, 10 weeks after the bridge opened, a 47-year-old World War I veteran reportedly said, “This is as far as I go,” and jumped.\n\nHis was the first known suicide. Others followed. In 1939, the California Highway Patrol recommended that the four-foot rails be raised. For decades, decision makers ducked behind aesthetic concerns, costs and effectiveness. The death toll, loosely tracked, reached 500, then 1,000, and kept growing every week or two, on average.\n\nFrustrated by the inertia, Mr. Muller, Dave Hull and Patrick Hines founded the nonprofit Bridge Rail Foundation in 2006, with the hope of raising, finally, the height of the rails.\n\n“The overriding concept to the Golden Gate Bridge story is restricting easy access to lethal means,” Muller said. “It’s a way to reduce suicides that John and Jane Q. Public can do. You don’t need a lot of complex psychiatric training to, say, simply lock up the guns.”\n\nOr to make leaping into the ocean more difficult.\n\nSupport grew slowly. Growing numbers of grieving families, mental health professionals, even coroners pleaded for something to be done. Eventually, the idea that took hold was borrowed from a solution used in Bern, Switzerland: nets.\n\nDebates raged, approvals came, construction bids opened and costs rose. There were legal squabbles with contractors. Construction began in 2018, meaning it took longer to install the nets than the four-plus years it took to build the bridge itself. What was once estimated to cost $76 million ended up costing $224 million.\n\nCritics have long wondered if steering the suicidal away from the Golden Gate Bridge merely sends them elsewhere to take their own life. Net proponents do not think so.\n\nA 1978 study by Richard Seiden, at the University of California, Berkeley, tracked 515 people who, between 1937 and 1971, went to the Golden Gate Bridge intending to jump but had been persuaded not to. It found that 94 percent were still alive or had died of natural causes.\n\n“Suicidal behavior is crisis-oriented and acute in nature,” Mr. Seiden concluded.\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has long been a unique draw for the suicidal, some even coming from other states and countries. At the edge of the ocean, on one of the world’s most famous structures, it was a way to die somewhere both beautiful and notable. Death was almost certain. (Most jumpers are killed on impact, but those who survive usually drown.)\n\nAnd access was simple, with parking lots on both ends and public sidewalks along a short rail.\n\n“The bridge has exerted a siren’s call for so long for some suicidal people that it might be hard for them to believe that it’s no longer the case,” said John Bateson, a longtime director of a suicide prevention center in the Bay Area and author of “The Final Leap: Suicide on the Golden Gate Bridge.” He writes a monthly newsletter for the Bridge Rail Foundation.\n\nThat might all explain why, while the number of suicides in 2025 were about one-seventh the pre-net average, interventions only dropped in half. People are still showing up.\n\n“The more people who know that the barrier is in place will be discouraged for even thinking about the Golden Gate Bridge as a suicide destination,” Mr. Bateson said.\n\nThe Bridge Rail Foundation remains active, despite the successful completion of its original goal. It fields calls from officials around the world looking to reduce suicides from other bridges or high places.\n\nThat might be the incalculable legacy of the work, beyond the raw number of lives saved at the Golden Gate Bridge. If one of the world’s most famous and deadliest bridges can prevent all but a few suicides, other places can probably do the same.\n\n“That’s certainly the hope,” Mr. Bateson said. “From the outset, all of us have recognized that whatever happens on the Golden Gate Bridge is going to serve as a model for others.”\n\nIf you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.",

Elon Musk agrees.\n\nMusk isn't a fan of X's algorithm, and he's documenting the company's efforts to improve the technology that decides what you see in the platform's \"For You\" feed.\n\nMusk said he is overhauling the recommendation system that decides which user-generated posts and advertisements are shown when you open the app. He also pledged to make that system transparent in the process, with the underlying code getting published on GitHub every four weeks. Musk said any changes to the code will be explained with every post.\n\n\"We know the algorithm is dumb and needs massive improvements, but at least you can see us struggle to make it better in real-time and with transparency,\" Musk wrote on X. \"No other social media companies do this.\"\n\nX's engineering team has also said the new recommendation system is built on the same architecture as Grok, the chatbot developed by Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI.\n\nWhile X has not said the two systems share training data or model weights, the comparison signals a shift toward more AI-driven content ranking, moving beyond the rules-based and engagement-heavy systems the app has historically relied on.\n\nKey questions remain about how the system operates in practice. X did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for more specifics on the algorithm.\n\nThe social media app, formerly known as Twitter, hasn't always relied on algorithms to serve its users.\n\nFrom its launch in 2006 through 2015, it presented posts in reverse chronological order, showing users the most recent tweets from accounts they followed.\n\nBut, in 2016, after several updates, a \"Show me the best tweets first\" option became the default for all users.\n\nOver time, the system grew more complex, incorporating engagement signals such as likes, replies, shares, and blocks to predict what content users were most likely to interact with or remove.\n\nMusk has long voiced frustrations with that algorithm.\n\nBefore acquiring Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, he repeatedly described the platform's algorithm as a \"black box,\" arguing that it introduced political bias and failed to reflect users' true preferences — particularly for politically conservative users.\n\nHis complaints continued after the purchase. In a 2024 post, he said the rules-based algorithms had become too divisive.\n\n\"One of the strongest signals is if you forward X posts to friends, it assumes you like that content a lot, because it takes effort to forward,\" Musk wrote. \"Unfortunately, if the actual reason you forwarded the content to friends was because you were outraged by it, we are currently not smart enough to realize that.\"\n\nHe recommended that users send videos of puppies to friends to combat the issue.",

That means if you follow thousands of people, but maybe only a few hundred of those people follow you back, that'll show up as your \"friends\" count.\n\nFor those of you who care about those precious follower-to-following ratios, get ready for a potentially even more telling public ratio: How many of those Instagram followers are friends?\n\nInstagram is quietly running this as a \"small global test,\" a Meta spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider, adding that the platform is trying to understand how users respond to seeing more content from friends in the app.\n\n\"Friends are central to the Instagram experience, so we're exploring ways to make these connections more visible and meaningful,\" a Meta spokesperson said. \"We're running a small test to highlight Friends throughout Instagram.\"\n\nAs part of the test, Meta is also labeling some content in the feed as \"friends\" instead of \"posts\" or \"following.\"\n\nAs influencers, brands, and now AI slop have invaded Instagram's feed, it's felt less and less like a space to share content with your friends.\n\nThat's part of the reason Instagram has doubled down on its \"Close Friends\" features over the years, focused on direct messaging (where friends and family often share content), and added more friend-focused features.\n\nFor instance, Instagram rolled out a feature called \"Blend,\" which lets you and a friend share a mutual feed of reels.\n\nLast year, Instagram also introduced features like a social mapping experience similar to Snapchat's map, as well as a \"Friends\" feed in the reels tab, where you can see content your friends (by Instagram's definition) are engaging with.\n\nInstagram's top executive, Adam Mosseri, said in an August post that he wants Instagram to be somewhere where users can \"actually engage with and connect with the people that you care about.\"",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces fired nearly $100 million worth of air defense missiles battling Russia's latest bombardment, Kyiv revealed on Tuesday, offering insight into the war's growing financial toll.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that the Russian attack, which began Monday night and continued into Tuesday, forced Kyiv to launch around €80 million (roughly $94 million) worth of interceptor missiles.\n\n\"Imagine that — the cost of these missiles,\" Zelenskyy said over WhatsApp in response to a question about interceptor stockpiles.\n\nThe staggering figure covers only the interceptor missiles and does not appear to account for any other munitions expended to defend against the Russian attack, which also included hundreds of drones.\n\nRussia launched 18 ballistic missiles, 15 cruise missiles, and one anti-ship missile overnight, according to data from Ukraine's air force. It said in a statement that 27 were shot down, while five hit their targets.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia has \"significantly increased\" its use of ballistic missiles and has been able to obtain critical technology for the munitions from third-party countries and from industry.\n\n\"Nevertheless, their ability to produce these missiles must be reduced — and that is not happening yet,\" he said in response to another question.\n\nAlthough Ukraine has received some additional air defense systems from Western countries, Zelenskyy said more are still needed, along with additional interceptor missiles to keep pace with Russia's attacks.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged that it has been difficult for Ukraine to obtain the necessary interceptor missiles. He specifically singled out the PAC-3, which has a $3.7 million price tag and is fired from US-made Patriot batteries, as the best chance Kyiv has to defeat Russian ballistic missiles.\n\n\"War is an extremely expensive Russian luxury, and for us it results in severe losses,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussian missiles are not the only worry for Ukraine. Moscow's overnight attack involved 339 drones. Kyiv said its Air Force shot down 315 of them. Two dozen hit their targets.\n\nTo preserve its costly air defense missiles, Ukraine has been increasingly relying on locally made interceptor drones that cost as little as a few thousand dollars to hunt down and destroy Russian drones.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine is producing around 1,000 interceptor drones each day, a goal he set last summer. The challenge now, he said, is that the number of drones has outpaced the number of operators who can control them.\n\n\"Therefore, now we must catch up in terms of the number of interceptor groups — the corresponding mobile groups,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he has tasked senior Ukrainian military leadership with bridging the gap.",

    "fullText": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk are at it again, with each of the tech titans taking aim at the other in a series of heated posts on X.\n\nMusk appeared to start the latest escalation early on Tuesday morning, when he posted \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT\" in response to a post that said that use of OpenAI's chatbot had been linked to the deaths of nine children and adults since it was released in 2022.\n\nAltman fired back, first in defense of ChatGPT and OpenAI's desire to protect its users, and then blasting Tesla's Autopilot technology, calling it unsafe.\n\n\"It is genuinely hard; we need to protect vulnerable users, while also making sure our guardrails still allow all of our users to benefit from our tools,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman continued, calling out Autopilot.\n\n\"I only ever rode in a car using it once, some time ago, but my first thought was that it was far from a safe thing for Tesla to have released,\" he wrote. \"I won't even start on some of the Grok decisions.\"\n\nAltman added: \"You take 'every accusation is a confession' so far.\"\n\nThere have been at least eight wrongful-death lawsuits filed against OpenAI that allege use of ChatGPT has contributed to worsening mental health conditions, leading to instances of suicide and murder, including among children and young adults.\n\nSafety concerns around Tesla's self-driving technology have also been central to multiple wrongful-death lawsuits, including one surrounding a 2019 crash in Florida that left a 22-year-old woman dead. A jury determined Tesla was 33% liable for the crash and awarded the plaintiffs $329 million in total damages, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and Altman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe social media feud comes as the pair is stuck in the middle of a long-running legal battle over OpenAI's status as a nonprofit company. Musk sued Altman, and other leaders of OpenAI, alleging that they misled him when they decided to pursue a for-profit structure, moving the company away from its original nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was originally founded as a nonprofit.",

    "description": "Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance announced that they are expecting their fourth child, a boy due in July.",
    "fullText": "When Fox News asked Usha Vance in June 2024 how she felt about her husband, JD Vance, being considered as Donald Trump's running mate, she told host Lawrence Jones that she was \"not raring to change anything about our lives right now.\"\n\nBut it appeared she came around — she spoke at the Republican National Convention as her husband was officially nominated to join the ticket and appeared alongside him at Trump campaign's victory party on election night.\n\nJD Vance, the former junior senator from Ohio and bestselling author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" and Usha Vance, a litigator whose résumé includes a Supreme Court clerkship, met as students at Yale Law School and wed in 2014.\n\nSince becoming vice president and second lady, the Vances have taken several international trips together, including a visit to the US military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland in March 2025.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Vances announced that they are expecting their fourth child, making Usha Vance the first second lady in US history to be pregnant while in office.\n\nHere's a look inside the relationship of the newest GOP power couple who serve as vice president and second lady.\n\nJD Vance served as a public affairs Marine in Iraq, liaising between service members and members of the press. After his military service, he majored in political science and philosophy at Ohio State University.\n\nUsha Vance grew up in a suburb of San Diego. Her parents are Indian immigrants.\n\nUsha Vance told Fox News in June that her parents' Hindu faith was \"one of the things that made them such good parents, that make them very good people.\"\n\nShe was a registered Democrat until 2014.\n\nIn law school, Usha Vance served as executive development editor of the Yale Law Journal and managing editor of the Yale Journal of Law and Technology, according to a bio on the website of her former employer, Munger, Tolles & Olson, that has since been removed.\n\nShe also worked pro bono with the Supreme Court Advocacy Clinic, the Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic, and the Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nUsha Vance told NBC News in 2017 that she and JD Vance took all of their classes together and were friends before they started dating. When they were assigned to work on a brief together, Usha Vance said she was impressed by his diligence.\n\n\"I've never seen anybody so starstruck,\" their law school professor, Amy Chua, said of JD Vance in an interview with NBC News. \"It was love at first sight.\"\n\nVance converted to Catholicism in 2019, The American Conservative reported. Usha Vance was raised Hindu.\n\nWhen asked about their interfaith marriage in a June 2025 interview with Fox News, Usha Vance said: \"There are a lot of things that we just agree on, I think, especially when it comes to family life, how to raise our kids. So I think the answer really is that we just talk a lot.\"\n\nWhile speaking at a Turning Point USA event in October 2025, JD Vance said that he hoped his wife would someday convert to Christianity.\n\n\"Do I hope that eventually she is somehow moved by what I was moved by in church? Yeah, honestly, I do wish that, because I believe in the Christian Gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,\" he said. \"But if she doesn't, then God says everybody has free will, and so that doesn't cause a problem for me.\"\n\nJD Vance's memoir details his working-class upbringing and the lives of poor, white Americans. He also wrote about how Chua, his professor, encouraged him to focus on his relationship with Usha Vance as a Yale law student.\n\nWhen JD Vance asked Chua to recommend him for a federal clerkship, she warned him that it's \"the type of thing that destroys relationships.\"\n\n\"Amy's advice stopped me from making a life-altering decision. It prevented me from moving a thousand miles away from the person I eventually married,\" Vance wrote.\n\n\"Most important, it allowed me to accept my place at this unfamiliar institution — it was okay to chart my own path and okay to put a girl above some shortsighted ambition,\" he continued. \"My professor gave me permission to be me.\"\n\nVance worked at Mithril Capital, a VC firm backed by Peter Thiel, in 2016. One former coworker previously told Business Insider that Vance was often away from the job promoting his book, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"\n\nThiel ended up being instrumental in Vance's rise to power in politics, donating $15 million to his Senate campaign and encouraging Trump to choose Vance as his running mate, The New York Times reported.\n\nVance went on to work at Revolution, a VC firm in Washington, DC, before founding his own firm, Narya Capital, in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, Usha Vance worked as a litigator at Munger, Tolles & Olson before leaving to clerk for Judge Brett Kavanaugh in the US Court of Appeals and Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts. Following her clerkships, she returned to Munger, Tolles & Olson, according to a bio on the firm's website that has since been removed.\n\nTheir first child, Ewan, was born a month before Usha Vance began her clerkship with Chief Justice Roberts, NBC News reported. They also have another son, Vivek, and a daughter, Mirabel.\n\nIn January 2026, the Vances announced that they are expecting their fourth child, a boy, in July.\n\n\"I'm not raring to change anything about our lives right now, but I really believe in JD and I love him, so we'll see what happens with our lives,\" she told Fox News in June 2024.\n\nOn the first day of the Republican National Convention, when Trump announced JD Vance as his vice presidential pick, a spokesperson for Munger, Tolles & Olsen told ABC News that Usha Vance had left the firm.\n\n\"Usha has been an excellent lawyer and colleague, and we thank her for her years of work and wish her the best in her future career,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nUsha Vance said that when they first met, JD Vance approached their differences \"with curiosity and enthusiasm.\"\n\n\"Although he's a meat and potatoes kind of guy, he adapted to my vegetarian diet and learned to cook food from my mother, Indian food,\" Usha Vance said in her speech. \"Before I knew it, he'd become an integral part of my family, a person I could not imagine living without.\"\n\nAfter white nationalist Nick Fuentes questioned JD Vance's ability to \"support white identity\" with an Indian wife, he voiced support for his spouse.\n\n\"Look, I love my wife so much. I love her because she's who she is,\" JD Vance said in an interview with Megyn Kelly in July. \"Obviously, she's not a white person, and we've been attacked by some white supremacists over that. But I just, I love Usha.\"\n\nHe also hit back against the attacks on ABC News' \"This Week,\" telling host Jonathan Karl in August, \"Look, my attitude to these people attacking my wife is, she's beautiful, she's smart. What kind of man marries Usha? A very smart man and a very lucky man, importantly.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Don't attack my wife. She's out of your league.\"\n\nUsha Vance appeared alongside her husband and members of the Trump family at the campaign's election night event in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n\"THANK YOU!\" Vance wrote on X after the election results came in. \"To my beautiful wife for making it possible to do this. To President Donald J. Trump, for giving me such an opportunity to serve our country at this level. And to the American people, for their trust. I will never stop fighting for ALL of you.\"\n\nJD Vance was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Usha Vance's former boss when she clerked for him in the US Court of Appeals.\n\nThe vice president attended the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris and the Munich Security Conference. He and Usha Vance also visited the Dachau concentration camp in Germany.\n\nThey brought their three children along on Air Force Two.\n\nSince winning a second non-consecutive term in the White House, Trump has doubled down on his intention to acquire Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory where the US has a military base. The governments of Greenland and Denmark have maintained that it is not for sale, but Trump has said he would not rule out using force.\n\nIn March 2025, the White House announced that Usha Vance would embark on a solo trip to Greenland to \"visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland's national dogsled race.\" The government of Greenland said that they had not invited any delegations to visit, and Greenland's Prime Minister Múte Bourup Egede called the trip \"very aggressive.\" Trump said that Greenland had asked the US to visit.\n\nUsha Vance's trip was subsequently scaled back to visiting Pituffik Space Base, the US military's northernmost installation in Greenland. In a video, JD Vance announced he would travel with her.\n\n\"There was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her,\" he said.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, JD Vance's press secretary, told Business Insider that the Vances were \"proud\" to visit Greenland.\n\n\"The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island,\" Van Kirk said.\n\nDuring a public appearance at military bases in North Carolina, observers noticed that Usha Vance wasn't wearing her wedding ring.\n\nIn a statement to People magazine, the second lady's spokesperson described Usha Vance as \"a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths, and forgets her ring sometimes.\"\n\nJD Vance also addressed the marriage rumors, telling NBC News that \"we kind of get a kick out of it\" and that their marriage was \"as strong as it's ever been.\"",

    "description": "The link to claim your credit is actually a phishing scheme.",
    "fullText": "Verizon had a massive outage last week, leaving roughly two million customers unable to use their phones off of wifi or SOS mode for nearly a day. As an apology for the inconvenience, the company promised to refund those affected a meager $20 to their accounts—so naturally, scammers quickly got a phishing scheme up and running targeting people eligible for the credit. As reported by Android Authority, the Jones County Sheriff's Office in Georgia has issued an alert about fake Verizon \"credit\" messages floating around.\n\nAccording to the sheriff's office, scammers may contact you via text or email—claiming to be from Verizon—with information about the outage credit. These messages contain phishing links, which may be set up to collect personal information or account credentials or deliver malware to your device. Clicking through will likely compromise your data in some way, especially if you enter any details on a malicious website.\n\nIf you are a Verizon customer who was affected by the outage, you will receive a text letting you know that your $20 credit is available to claim in the myVerizon app, which is why you may not be immediately suspicious of the scam. Plus, since you do need to claim the funds, you may be swayed by a message that sounds urgent. Don't fall for it.\n\nIn general, you shouldn't click links in unsolicited communication, and you should be suspicious of any messages that prompt you to click said links, even if they appear to be from a legitimate company about a legitimate matter. As evidenced by this phishing campaign and those like it, scammers can and will impersonate trusted brands and use real events to seem more believable.\n\nInstead, always navigate directly to the app or official website—type in the URL and check it carefully or go through your password manager—and log in using your account credentials. Once logged in, you can see any legitimate communication and take action securely. Know that scammers can easily spoof websites, so if you click a phishing link, you may not realize that you're on a fake page.",

    "title": "ChatGPT Is Getting on the AI Age Verification Bandwagon",
    "description": "The app will guess your age and set limits for users it thinks are under 18.",
    "fullText": "When OpenAI first announced GPT-5.2 last month, it quietly disclosed a new safety feature it called \"age prediction.\" Considering ChatGPT proper isn't exactly an \"all ages\" kind of tool, it makes sense that users under the age of 18 should have protections in place to shield them from harmful content. The company says that users who indicate they're under 18 already receive an altered experience to \"reduce exposure to sensitive or potentially harmful content,\" but if the user doesn't voluntarily share how old they are with OpenAI, how does the company enforce these protections? Here's where age prediction comes in.\n\nOn Tuesday, OpenAI officially announced its new age prediction policy, which, like other age verification systems being used by the likes of Roblox, uses AI to guess how old a user is. If the system decides that a particular user is under the age of 18, OpenAI will adjust the experience accordingly, with the goal of keeping all interactions age-appropriate.\n\nHere's how it works: The new age prediction model looks at both the user's behaviors within the app, as well as the general account data. That includes things like how old the account is, what times of day the user is accessing ChatGPT, usage patterns, as well as, of course, the age the user says they are. Looking at all this data, the model determines how old the user likely is. If the model thinks they're over 18, they'll get the full experience; if the model thinks they're under 18, they'll get the \"safer experience.\" If the model isn't confident, it defaults to that safer experience.\n\nThat limited experience means that someone the model thinks is under 18 will try to reduce the following content types:\n\nViral challenges that might inspire \"risky or harmful behaviors\"\n\nRole play that is sexual, romantic, or violent in nature\n\nContent promoting \"extreme\" beauty standards, unhealthy dieting, or body shaming\n\nThe company says that its approach is informed by \"expert input\" as well as literature discussing child development science. (It's not clear whether how much of that input is from direct interviews and coordination with experts, and how much, if any, is from independent research.) The company also acknowledges \"known teen differences in risk perception, impulse control, peer influence, and emotional regulation\" when compared to adults.\n\nThe biggest risk with any of these age prediction models is that they'll sometimes get it wrong—hallucination is an unfortunate habit AI models all share. That goes both ways: You don't want someone too young accessing inappropriate content in ChatGPT, but you also don't want someone older than 18 getting stuck with a limited account for no reason. If you experience the latter situation, OpenAI has a solution for you: direct age verification through Persona. This is the same third-party Roblox uses for its age verification, which hasn't gone very well thus far.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily spell doom for OpenAI. Roblox tried overhauling their age verification system for a massive user base all used to a certain type of multiplayer experience, which led to users not being able to chat with other users in newly-assigned age categories, which were often incorrect. Meanwhile, ChatGPT's age prediction is only controlling the experience of one user at a time. To that end, OpenAI will let you upload a selfie as an added verification step if the prediction model alone isn't enough. Interestingly, OpenAI doesn't say anything about the option to upload an ID for verification, which other companies, like Google, have provided.\n\nI'm not necessarily a fan of age prediction models, as I think they often sacrifice user privacy in the name of creating age-appropriate experiences. But there's little doubt that OpenAI has to do something to limit the full ChatGPT experience for younger users. Many of ChatGPT's users are under 18, and much of the content they experience is wildly inappropriate, whether it be instructions on getting high, or advice on writing suicide notes. In some tragic cases, minors have taken their own lives after discussions with ChatGPT, leading to lawsuits against OpenAI.\n\nI don't have any great answers here. We'll just have to see how this new age prediction model affects the user experience for minors and adults alike, and whether it actually manages to create a safer experience for younger, more impressionable users.",

He has been an unused substitute in four of those matches.\n\nLast season, Nwaneri played mostly on the right wing and scored nine goals in 37 appearances in all competitions to mark himself out as one of England's most talented young players.\n\nBut with Madueke the first choice as back up to Bukayo Saka and Eze the number 10 to challenge captain Martin Odegaard, the two positions Nwaneri would fit into have become harder to get.",

    "fullText": "Arne Slot has suggested Mohamed Salah will return to the Liverpool starting line-up against Marseille in Wednesday's Champions League tie, insisting his relationship with the forward is \"as normal as it's always been\".\n\nSalah last started for Liverpool in the 4-1 home defeat by PSV Eindhoven in November, but scored four goals at the Africa Cup of Nations where his Egypt side finished fourth.\n\nThe 33-year-old gave an exposive interview shortly before departing for Afcon, in which he claimed \"someone doesn't want me in the club\" and he no longer had any relationship with Slot after being dropped.\n\nAsked if he had a chance to reflect on the situation with Salah after the events in December, Slot said: \"There's been a moment in the season where I decided not to play Mo.\n\n\"And one moment where I decided not to take him to the game [against Inter Milan]. For all the other games, he's been in the squad and he was the first substitution against Brighton so, at that moment of time, there's never been an issue for me.\n\n\"The first time he's able to be in the squad again, he is because he trained today and is in the squad for tomorrow. Let's see the line-up tomorrow if you still think there's an issue.\"\n\nSlot's side have been unbeaten during Salah's time in Morocco, but the Dutchman admitted he was \"happy\" to have Liverpool's record Champions League goalscorer available again.\n\n\"I am really happy and pleased he is back,\" added Slot. \"In his absence I think we have done quite OK in terms of hardly conceding any chances and starting to create more and more.\n\n\"If you create more and more, then it is really helpful to have Mohamed Salah. There has only been one who scored more for this club [who is alive] but I don't think I can play Ian Rush still! Then it is really helpful to have him back.\"\n\nAsked about his relationship with Salah, he said: \"It's as normal as it's always been, with one exception and that was Inter Milan.\n\n\"I spoke to him today and I'm happy to have him back because this season I've only had two wingers who've played more than 100 minutes in the Premier League and that's Mo and Cody [Gakpo].\n\n\"Jeremie Frimpong and Florian Wirtz can also play in these positions, but if I asked Florian what was his favourite position he wouldn't say left or right wing. Jeremie would be the same, but he's shown what he can do off the right side.\n\n\"I saw today that Mo has 45 goals for Liverpool in the Champions League and the next highest is Virgil van Dijk with five. So it is nice to have him back, especially if he is able to reach those levels that brought him 45 goals again.\"\n\nLiverpool have taken a 20-man squad to Marseille, with Ibrahima Konate not in the touring party due to a family matter.\n\nThe game against Robert de Zerbi's side will influence their hopes of finishing in the top eight and avoiding two extra ties in the knockout phase play-offs next month. The Reds host Qarabag in their final game in the group phase on Wednesday, 28 January.",

    "fullText": "Former Australia captain Steve Waugh is among the franchise investors in a men's European T20 tournament set to be played by city-based teams in Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands later this year.\n\nThe six-team European T20 Premier League (ETPL) was meant to launch in 2025, but the event was postponed because the sales of the participating franchises were not completed in time.\n\nHowever, deals have now been agreed for three of the franchises with two separate groups of investors from Australia and one from New Zealand.\n\nOne of those is led by Waugh, who is heading up the Amsterdam Flames, which is backed by a consortium that includes former Australian field hockey player Jamie Dwyer and Australian businessman Tim Thomas.\n\nThe Flames have already signed high-profile Australia internationals Steve Smith and Mitch Marsh as two of their overseas players.\n\nWaugh, 60, said he was \"fascinated\" by the opportunity to \"take the global game of cricket to continental Europe\".\n\n\"I'm not signing up to a Mickey Mouse T20 competition. This is the real deal,\" Waugh told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I wouldn't be lending my name to it, or bringing my knowledge, if it wasn't. The players we've spoken to are very keen to play in this league.\"\n\nBollywood actor and film producer Abhishek Bachchan is a part-owner of the ETPL in conjunction with Rules Sport Tech, a private Indian company.\n\nBBC Sport understands the franchises were sold for £11.1m ($15m) over a 10-year period.\n\nTeams will have a total salary budget in the region of £1.1m ($1.5m) per season, with the inaugural tournament set to start on 26 August.\n\nThe league is being run in collaboration with the cricket boards of Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands.\n\nIt has been sanctioned by the International Cricket Council, who see it as a useful base for the broader development of cricket in Europe.\n\nBachchan said that, with \"the quality of players signing on,\" everything about the tournament \"will be world class\".\n\n\"We are all primed and ready to go but the true hard work starts now,\" Bachchan added.\n\n\"We are very confident of the stakeholders we have on board and expect the ETPL will establish itself in the global ecosystem of franchise tournaments.\"",

    "title": "Sandbox Your AI Dev Tools: A Practical Guide for VMs and Lima",
    "description": "AI coding assistants and other devtools can steal your credentials and data. Here's how to run them safely in isolated VMs using Lima on macOS/Linux.",
    "fullText": "AI coding assistants, npm, pip, and other development tools can run arbitrary code and scripts on your machine, potentially stealing SSH keys, API tokens, wallet keys, sensitive credentials and other private data without you noticing.\n\nThis guide shows you how to sandbox these tools in isolated VMs using Lima, so you can experiment and develop freely without putting your sensitive data at risk.\nJump straight to the guide, or read on for a bit of personal context.\n\nI’ve been having quite a bit of fun with AI assisted coding recently.\n\nI use LLMs for a wide range of things, including discussing architecture, design choices, learning about new tools and libraries I wasn’t previously aware of, to reviewing PRs and quickly cranking out dirty prototypes.\n\nEspecially for hobby projects that are not meant to ever go into production, I enjoy playing with AI tools fast and loose, producing results quickly and not getting slowed down by annoying things such as reading code before running it 🤣.\n\nAnd yeah… that’s obviously unsafe, unless it’s all contained in a sandbox!\n\nYou should never run potentially dangerous, experimental code on your main machine, since it could steal your passwords, API keys, environment variables, private keys, access to your communication tools, install services, and do all sorts of other nefarious things.\n\nNowadays I isolate all my devtools in VMs, and thought it might be useful to others if I put together a guide to shows how to do it. Well, here it is, and I hope it’ll be useful to you, too!\n\nYou’ll want to run the entire development environment, including the AI tool itself, inside a sandbox. This way it’s safe to install dependencies and to execute code, and unlocks other fun features like snapshots before running sketchy code, and reverting if something goes wrong.\n\nAnd it’s not just AI-generated code. Node.js/npm/yarn and Python/pip are particularly troublesome because they allow any package to run arbitrary scripts on your system during installation, and install tons of additional dependencies that can do the same. This attack vector is called “supply chain attack” and it happens all the time.\n\nVirtual Machines (VMs) and Containers (i.e. Docker, Podman, containerd) are the two most practical methods for isolating development tools from your host operating system. VMs provide much stronger protection and more flexibility overall, and are better suited for co-developing with AIs.\n\nContainer runtimes share the host operating system’s kernel, which means they’re fundamentally running on the same system as your main machine, just with isolated namespaces and resource limits. This creates several security concerns:\n\nIn contrast, a VM runs its own complete operating system with its own kernel. The hypervisor (like QEMU/KVM) creates a much stronger isolation boundary. Even if malicious code completely compromises the VM, it would need to exploit the hypervisor itself to reach your host, a significantly harder target.\n\nFurthermore, a VM enables better concurrency. It can run Docker containers, databases, web servers, multiple build processes, and background services all at once, and the AI tool can interact with everything naturally just like on a normal development machine.\n\nIn this guide, we use Lima VM to sandbox AI and devtools. Lima is a delightful, lightweight virtual machine manager for Linux and macOS which provides easy and quick ways to create and manage VMs.\n\nYou interact with Lima through the limactl command:\n\nVMs are based on templates, which can include (build on) other templates:\n\nThe Lima VM docs have platform-specific installation guides.\n\nHomebrew is recommended on macOS:\n\nOn Linux install the binary like this:\n\nNow ensure your Lima version is up-to-date:\n\nWe only want to share very specific host directories with the VM.\n\nLet’s create ~/VM-Shared on the host, which we later mount into the VM at ~/Shared (with write access):\n\nYou can use that directory to easily copy files between the host and the VM, and to share project directories from the host with the VM.\n\nDefaults for all VMs can be defined in ~/.lima/_config/default.yaml.\n\nLet’s create the default YAML file:\n\nLima conveniently creates default SSH configuration files for all VM instances, which makes it easy to log in with SSH (including using VS Code for a Remote-SSH session).\n\nI recommend using a ~/.ssh/config.d/ directory on the host and have SSH include all configs there by default. That allows us to simply link the Lima-created config files there to use them.\n\nAdd this as first line in your ~/.ssh/config file, to make SSH include all configs from there:\n\nGreat! After creating a new VM, we can now simply create a symlink to the Lima-generated SSH configs and use it to SSH into the instance.\n\nLet’s start an Ubuntu 25.10 VM instance, named dev.\nWe use the internal _images/ubuntu-25.10.yaml template because it doesn’t include the automatic home directory sharing:\n\nYou can share additional project-specific directories between host and VM in several ways:\n\nCreate a symlink for the SSH config file and SSH into the VM:\n\nLet’s update the services on the instance, and configure git:\n\nLet’s confirm that port forwarding works. We do this using a one-liner Python HTTP server (on port 7777) inside the VM, and accessing it from the host:\n\nThis section guides you through installing several other languages and development tools, including Golang, Node.js, Python, Rust, Docker.\n\nWe can accomplish that either by installing each tool according to it’s documentation, or by using a version manager such as mise (“mise-en-place”, 22k stars on Github) which can install hundreds of tools via a simple command-line interface.\n\nFirst, we install mise (“mise-en-place”, 22k stars on Github) and make bash support it:\n\nYou use mise latest <tool> to see the latest versions it knows about:\n\nNow you can install all the tools you want in a single command:\n\nTo manually install (or update) Golang in the VM, download the latest release and extract into /usr/local/go:\n\nThe Golang path needs to be in the PATH environment variable, which we have already added before.\n\nA good way to install a current version of Node.js in Ubuntu is by using nvm, a modern node version manager (90k stars on GitHub):\n\nNow it’s all installed and ready to use! Check the versions like this:\n\nPerhaps you don’t even need Docker, since Lima includes containerd and nerdctl by default. This is a Docker-compatible runtime and command-line interface that can also run images from Docker Hub:\n\nIf you do want to install Docker, the quickest way to install it by using their official get-docker.sh script:\n\nFor the group changes to take effect, exit the shell and re-login (may need a VM restart).\n\nVerify that user is in the ‘docker’ group:\n\nGitHub CLI provides a useful gh cli command that let’s you easily interact with GitHub and private repositories.\n\nYou can install it in the VM following the Linux installation instructions:\n\nWarning: Authorizing GitHub CLI to access private repositories will leave an API key in the VM which could potentially be stolen by unauthorized scripts (which is what we wanted to avoid in first place by running everything in a VM).\n\nOnly authorize it with gh auth login for private repo access if you accept the risks! I personally avoid having any sensitive credentials in the VM, in particular those that allow access to private GitHub repositories.\n\nIf you prefer an IDE like VS Code, you can use Remote-SSH to start a session inside the instance.\n\nPlease note that this is potentially unsafe, as explained in the Remote-SSH README:\n\nSecurity Note\nUsing Remote-SSH opens a connection between your local machine and the remote. Only use Remote-SSH to connect to secure remote machines that you trust and that are owned by a party whom you trust. A compromised remote could use the VS Code Remote connection to execute code on your local machine.\n\nSee also this discussion on GitHub for more context and information.\n\nNow a new VS Code window opens, and sets up VS Code Server:\n\nThen you can click “Open” and choose a folder, like Shared:\n\nBefore setting up the tools, let’s create a “Hello World” directory in the Shared folder as our playground:\n\nLet’s start with installing Claude Code in the VM, following the instructions in the documentation:\n\nOn first start, Claude asks you to authorize it.\n\nThe docs mention support for an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable (i.e. set in .bashrc), but that did not work when I tried it; claude CLI didn’t let me skip the login process. Only after the login was done it notified me about the existing environment variable, and whether I’d prefer to use that one.\n\nAfter the login, Claude Code CLI is ready to be ued in the VM! 🎉\n\nSince Claude is running in a VM, it might be permissible to run it in “dangerously skip permissions mode”, which makes it bypass all permission checks:\n\nYou could also create an alias for it and add it to your .bashrc:\n\nAnthropic provides documentation for using Claude in VS Code, and also offer a VS Code Claude extension.\n\nYou can install the Claude extension in the VM through the Remote-SSH session window:\n\nIn contrast to the CLI tool, the authentication flow did not work through the user interface, and I had to set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable:\n\nReload the VS Code window (open command palette with Shift + CMD + P and choose “Developer: Reload Window”):\n\nNow the VS Code Claude extension should work:\n\nIf you want to enable “dangerously skip permissions mode” in the VS Code extension, you can enable it via your user settings. Open the settings (CMD + ,), search for “claude” and enable “Claude Code: Allow Dangerously Skip Permissions”:\n\nLet’s install Gemini CLI from Google next.\n\nThe documentation recommends installing it with npm, the Node.js package manager. You’ll need to install Node and npm first, see also the Node.js setup instructions.\n\nIt will ask you to authenticate:\n\nI chose “Login with Google”. Note that the authentication flow may require a retry if the first attempt times fails.\n\nAfter authorization is done, Gemini CLI works!\n\nYou can run Gemini in YOLO mode:\n\nAutomatically accept all actions (aka YOLO mode, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0 \n\nThe alias you could define in .bashrc:\n\nCodex CLI is the AI dev tool from OpenAI/ChatGPT.\n\nIt will ask you to sign in, either via ChatGPT or by providing an API key:\n\nAfter that is done, Codex CLI is ready to work for you!\n\nYou can also run Codex in dangerous mode:\n\nSkip all confirmation prompts and execute commands without sandboxing. EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Intended solely for running in environments that are externally sandboxed\n\nThere are several other great tools worth a mention:\n\nDrop your favorite tools in the comments below!\n\nVM clones and snapshots allow you even more flexibility and isolation. You can use them to quickly and cheaply run new VMs for experiments and specific projects based on already provisioned instances. Use them frequently!\n\nLima offers several ways to take VM snapshots and/or clone VMs.\n\nYou can make a copy of an existing VM instance with limactl clone. The existing instance needs to be stopped first.\n\nAfter all the initial VM setup is done, clone it and use it both as backup as well as a base for future instances:\n\nRemember that after starting a new instance, you probably want to symlink the VM SSH configuration to your ~/.ssh/config.d/ directory, so ssh knows about it (See also “SSH into the VM”):\n\nFor maximum security and flexibility, consider using multiple VMs for different purposes and trust levels. This approach provides better isolation and lets you tailor each environment to specific needs.\n\nHere are some suggested VM configurations:\n\nYou can quickly clone your base VM setup to create new instances for different projects using limactl clone, as described in the VM cloning section above.\n\nFor sensitive or production projects, consider dedicating a separate VM to each project. This prevents potential cross-contamination between projects and allows you to mount only the specific project directories you need.\n\nWhen creating project-specific VMs, you can customize the mounted directories by editing the instance configuration. Either adjust the mounts section before starting the VM (by not using the -y flag), or edit ~/.lima/<vm_name>/lima.yaml after creation and restart the instance.\n\nThis approach also makes it easier to share VM configurations with team members. Instead of sharing entire disk images, you can distribute just the Lima template YAML file, which team members can use to spin up identical environments on their machines.\n\nFor automated setup, Lima supports provisioning scripts that run during VM creation. For more complex setups, consider using idempotent provisioning tools like Ansible to ensure consistent environments across your team.\n\nIf you find yourself repeatedly creating VMs with similar configurations, consider creating custom Lima templates. Templates are YAML files that define VM settings, and they can include other templates.\n\nCustom templates are useful for:\n\nYou can create a custom template by copying and modifying an existing one from Lima’s template directory. Save your custom templates in ~/.lima/_templates/ and reference them when creating new VMs:\n\nSee the Lima templates documentation \n\nHere are some important security best practices to follow when using VMs for development:\n\nRemember: The whole point of using VMs is isolation. When in doubt, create a new VM for risky experiments and delete it afterwards.\n\nI hope this guide helps you get started quickly and right-footed!\nAs always, please leave feedback, questions and ideas in the comments below.\n\nSpecial thanks to Ilya Lukyanov and Overflo for reviewing drafts of this post and making great suggestions. 🙏",

    "fullText": "I’m an old Mac-head at heart, and I’ve been using Macs since the mid 1990s (the first Mac I used was an LC II with System 7.1 installed on it). I don’t tend to genuinely think that the computing experience was better in the olden days — sure, there’s a thing to be said about the simplicity of older software, but most of my fondness for those days is nostalgia.\n\nFor example, I have wonderful memories of finally getting a copy of ClarisWorks and being able to do pixel-based image editing, which sparked a wonderful childhood “career” of tinkering with icons and various other bits and bobs with that and ResEdit. The things you could do before code signing!\n\nHowever, I’m not going to sit here and say with a straight face that ClarisWorks on System 7 in the 1990s was better than using the myriad of tools we have available to us today. It’s nostalgia for a simpler time — both in computing, and in my life.\n\nAn exception to that, however, is Apple’s Aperture. I’m still grumpy that Apple discontinued it back in 2015, and I’m not alone. Start spending time in the online photography sphere and you’ll start to notice a small but undeniable undercurrent of lament of its loss to this day. Find an article about Adobe hiking their subscription prices because they added AI for some reason, and amongst the complaining in the comments you’ll invariably find it: “I miss Aperture.”\n\nA couple of things have happened recently that spurred me to actually write all of this down rather than grumble occasionally on social media:\n\nApple released macOS Tahoe, which has been pretty constantly raked over the coals for poor design and broken interactions from the day it was released (and even before, if we’re honest).\n\nApple very recently announced their Creator Studio subscription service, and I saw this post on Mastodon by @BasicAppleGuy:\n\nWhen I took this screenshot, the first reply to the post was “I miss Aperture. <long digital sigh>”.\n\nSo, I dug out the ‘ol Trashcan Mac Pro I lovingly reviewed here on this very blog over eleven years ago and fired up Aperture to document — at least partially — just why it was so special.\n\nThe Mac Studio is a perfectly cromulent computer, but it just doesn’t have the verve of the classics, you know?\n\nIf you’re not familiar with Aperture, it’s an app for organising, managing, editing, and exporting images. If you’re familiar with Apple’s Photos app, it’s that. But for professionals! Aperture is a complex app — its PDF user manual is over 900 pages long — so to keep this manageable I’ll focus on one particular aspect of it via two short excerpts from said manual.\n\nTwo excerpts that hide an astonishing amount of engineering effort.\n\nLet’s look at our first excerpt:\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nThis little sentence extremely succinctly describes how Aperture is different to most other software of its nature — it comes to you. Most software has you go to it.\n\nTo understand what I mean, let’s look at the Photos app. My brain works pretty spatially — I remember where I took a photo more than when. So, I pan around the map in Photos to find the cool photo of my car in the Alps that I want to edit and send to my friend. Here it is:\n\nI click the picture, and the map is gone, replaced with a list of the images at the location I clicked.\n\nI double-click the photo to bring it up bigger.\n\nI click “Edit” in the top right of the window to switch into Photos’ editing mode (as a shortcut, I could’ve pressed the Return key in the image list to open it straight in the editing mode).\n\nI perform my edits, then click “Done” to get back to the fullscreen viewer. Then I click “Back” to get back to the list of images. Then “Back” again, and I’m finally back at my map. Hooray! Oh wait, I forgot to export it…\n\nThis sort of design is common in apps like Photos, and especially in “shoebox” apps1. Every feature is in its own place, and if you want to use that feature you need to pick up your thing (in this case, a photo) and take it over to where the feature is. In this example, the journey from the map to the editor is through a separate list of images, the fullscreen viewer, then finally to the editor.\n\nIn contrast, Aperture comes to you. As a reminder:\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nWhen Aperture says this, it really means it. If you can select an image, you can edit it right where you are with that HUD.\n\nAperture’s map (which by some miracle still works eleven years after it was discontinued) doesn’t show the images on the map, but rather underneath it. It’s less pretty, but combines the first two steps of the journey in the Photos example — the map on top, and the images in the visible map area underneath. Clicking a pin refines the selection of images.\n\nAlight, let’s find another photo of my car in the Alps:\n\nA Volvo stuck in the snow is less awesome than the previous photo, but oh well. I need to edit it, so I press H on my keyboard to bring up the adjustments HUD. I’m still exactly where I was, but now I have editing controls. There’s no step three!\n\nThat was incredibly easy, and I didn’t even leave the map! I need to export it now… and, of course, I can do that from right here on the map too.\n\nI’m still exactly where I was, and I can carry on with the next task.\n\n“But Daniel,” I hear you cry, “Who edits photos on a map?”\n\nFine, it’s a contrived example, but one I was able to directly make between Photos and Aperture. Let’s look at something more real-world: Aperture’s book editor. I love making photo books as the years go by, but putting them together can be a long and tedious process.\n\nLet’s imagine it’s 2005, and I have a page in my book full of pictures of my new car for this year’s book. Unfortunately, auto white balance and changing lighting conditions means the car is a different shade of grey in every photo! Disaster!\n\nIt’d be nice to have them consistent with each other on the page, but matching them all together when they might be from all over the photo library is a big pain. Can you imagine doing that in Photos? Click, click, click, click, into the editor. Tweak white balance. Click, click, click, click, back to the book. Nope, still not right. Click, click, click, click…\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nOh, right! H, drag slider, done. Right on the book page.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate quite how revolutionary and smooth this flow is until you had it for multiple years before having it taken away. Nothing on the market — even over a decade later — is this good at meeting you where you are and not interrupting your flow.\n\nEspecially that book example. My Lord. When Aperture was discontinued (well, when it stopped working properly after an OS update or two) I moved over to Adobe Lightroom (now Lightroom Classic) which had separate modules for file management, editing, and books — switching modules was such a slow and clunky processes, I swear nearly threw my computer out the window trying to colour match photos on a book page.\n\nIt’s OK, Daniel, you got rid of Lightroom years ago. It can’t hurt you any more!\n\nTechnically speaking, the edit-anywhere model is an incredibly impressive feature. Managing a lot of images is already difficult2 (especially on the hardware of the time), and for a map, or a book editor… of course you’d have an optimised set of static thumbnails.\n\nOr, y’know, a full RAW image editing context ready-to-go for anything you might want to click on.\n\nAperture has a tool called the “loupe”. In real life, a loupe is a little cup with a magnifying glass on the top. It’s what’s on the Preview app’s icon, and you use it to zoom in to physical things on a physical surface (I know, how quaint).\n\nIf you want to quickly check specific compositional details of an image, you can use the Loupe. Aperture provides a software Loupe that lets you magnify portions of an image. The Loupe is particularly useful when you are quickly navigating through images in the Browser and you need to verify that the image is in focus or other details without having to switch to the Viewer or Full Screen view.\n\nIn Aperture, the loupe is a little round zoomy thing you can either drag around to view a zoomed-in portion of the image it’s on top of, or attach to the mouse so you can just point at stuff to zoom in.\n\nNote: I’ve dimmed the main Aperture window slightly in the following screenshots to make the loupe clearer.\n\nFun fact: Even when attached to the mouse, the loupe is a separate window just like the other HUDs — which means you can take a screenshot of it independently. Neat!\n\nIt’d be easy to think this is just a screen zoom, or at least a window into a big thumbnail that’s being downsampled a bit for the main viewer. But, since the loupe is attached to the mouse, we can just start pointing at stuff to see what happens.\n\nThere’s no way you’d keep a full-resolution image in memory for every thumbnail on screen, so this is another extremely impressive technical feat. Remember, this is over a decade ago, and Aperture’s system requirements were a Mac with 2GB of RAM. Keeping a whole 20 megapixel image in memory will consume somewhere in the region of 90-120MB3 once you’re starting to display it.\n\nHmm… now that I think about it, the manual doesn’t say where the loupe works and doesn’t, and since we’re not limited to selecting images like with the other HUD…\n\nOnce again, it’s hard to overstate how bonkers this is on a technical level. That’s a list of thumbnails of book pages, there so you can identify which page you want to edit. That thumbnail-within-a-thumbanail — on a Retina display! — is 68x47 pixels. 0.003 megapixels.\n\nFrom a software development perspective, it would be insane to have those pages be anything but static thumbnail images. But hey, would you want to be the person that made the manual say that the loupe works everywhere except in the book editor’s page list?\n\nThese days, technological marvels in computing — if you’ll forgive a gross generalisation — tend to be very flashy. Liquid Glass is a great example of that — it’s very impressive what can be done with the engineering talent and computing power we have available to us today, and the effect is cool. However, my browser’s UI refracting the webpage I’m reading as it scrolls by doesn’t really do anything except look cool… when it isn’t making things less readable.\n\nNotice how the Liquid Glass refraction effect makes it look — at first glance, at least — like we’ll be making a sharp right after we turn left? Thanks, Liquid Glass!\n\nGenerative AI is another technology that falls into this “flashy” camp, but kinda at the other end of the scale. BEHOLD THE AI, FOR IT IS PRODUCING CONTENT. Very useful, very impressive, and is transforming a lot of industries. Just… ignore the wider societal and environmental concerns AS THE AI IS PRODUCING A FUNNY POEM.\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss criticisms of these kinds of technologies as the ramblings of an old man, since on average — as I mentioned at the top of this post — the computing experience is orders of magnitude better than it was back then.\n\nHowever, when it gets to the point where we as humans need to use our computers as tools to get stuff done, I think we have stagnated over the past few years. When preparing for this post I was excited to fire up Aperture and experience it again, but after less than ten minutes of using it I was getting grumpy — here I am, sitting at a thirteen-year old computer, and I’m flying through my photos faster than I ever do on modern machines. Why is this not possible now?\n\nAperture’s technical brilliance is remarkable in how quiet it is. There’s no BEHOLD RAINBOW SPARKLE ANIMATIONS WHILE THE AI MAKES AUNT JANICE LOOK LIKE AN ANTHROPOMORPHISED CARROT, just an understated dedication to making the tool you’re using work for you in exactly the way you want to work.\n\nIt’s the kind of monumental engineering effort that the user is unlikely to ever notice, simply because of how obvious it is to use — if I want to zoom in to this photo, I point at it with the zoom thing. Duh. Sure, it’s a tiny thumbnail inside a small thumbnail of a page in a book… but how else would it work?\n\nAnd that is why Aperture was so special. It was powered by some of the most impressive technology around at the time, but you’d never even know it because you were too busy getting shit done.\n\nAnd then, it was taken away — with a final, cruel twist of the knife from Apple: “You can use the Photos app as a replacement!” — and everyone was grumpy forever.\n\nAperture’s discontinuation happened at the tail end of my time working at Spotify here in Sweden. As with any corporate job, it had good days and bad days… and after the particularly bad days, I’d rage-fill part of a job application elsewhere. I’d always loved Aperture — as a Mac developer, it was the pinnacle of what was possible on the Mac, and in a field I was passionate about — so this particular application was to work on Aperture at Apple.\n\nI ended up having a couple of interviews with the Aperture team, but as I remember (this was well over a decade ago) the process just… kinda petered out.\n\nA few months later, the official discontinuation announcement happened. I have no idea if I was just not up to the task or if something happened internally during my interview process, but it’s an interesting “What if…” to think about.\n\nAperture: Senior QA (2004-2005) by Chris Hynes \n\nWhile the result was amazing, the development process was… perhaps less so. This is an interesting read about Aperture’s development.\n\nIt’s hard to justify Tahoe icons by Nikita Prokopov \n\nA great look on why (amongst many other reasons) macOS Tahoe is being raked through the coals at the moment.\n\n“Shoebox” apps are apps that contain the content you use with them, as opposed to document-based apps which work with content you manage as a user. It’s an extremely common design nowadays, but less so back then — early pioneers of the shoebox app were iPhoto, iMovie, etc. ↩\n\nI maintain that one of the most technically impressive app on an iPhone is the Photos app’s thumbnail grid – being able to scroll that many images that smoothly is very hard. ↩\n\nMaths: 20 million pixels at 12-16 bits per channel. Doesn’t include overheads of getting from the encoded RAW to a GPU-ready pixel buffer. ↩",

    "fullText": "A series of graphics reveals how the Trump administration has sought historic cuts to science and the research workforce.\n\nGrant termination data analysis and visualization by Kim Albrecht\n\nMMore than 7,800 research grants terminated or frozen. Some 25,000 scientists and personnel gone from agencies that oversee research. Proposed budget cuts of 35% — amounting to US$32 billion.\n\nThese are just a few of the ways in which Donald Trump has downsized and disrupted US science since returning to the White House last January. As his administration seeks to reshape US research and development, it has substantially scaled back and restricted what science the country pursues and the workforce that runs the federal scientific enterprise.\n\nA year into Trump’s second presidential term, Nature presents a series of graphics that reveal the impact of his administration on science.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, officials began terminating already-funded grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in February, and later at the National Science Foundation (NSF), two of the largest public supporters of scientific research in the United States. A total of 5,844 NIH grants and 1,996 NSF grants were cancelled or suspended.\n\nThe Trump administration disproportionally cancelled or froze projects on topics it disfavours, such as misinformation, vaccine hesitancy, infectious diseases and research on people from under-represented ethnic and gender groups, which it has called discriminatory and unscientific.\n\nOver the course of 2025, more than 7,800 grants were cancelled or suspended. In this tree map, each block represents one grant or grant supplement, and the size of the block corresponds to the total budget of the original grant.\n\nThe inclusion of supplements means that some grants — less than 0.5% of the total — appear two or three times.\n\nThe blocks are grouped by state. New York (orange) had the most cancelled or frozen grants, totalling nearly 1,500. The majority were at Columbia University.\n\nSome of the largest grants (orange) are for clinical trials, cancer centres and infrastructure, and they can run over many years.\n\nThe NIH terminated or froze 5,843 research grants (yellow). The total for the NSF was 1,996 (blue).\n\nOf the grants that were terminated or frozen, more than 800 were related to infectious diseases (orange).\n\nCourts have ordered that thousands of grants be reinstated, and some universities have settled with the government to unfreeze funding (both reinstated and unfrozen grants are shown in blue). But it is unclear how many scientists have received those funds.\n\nRoughly 2,600 grants have not been reinstated or unfrozen (black), amounting to $1.4 billion of unspent funding.\n\nThe Trump administration has substantially reduced the number of new grants issued by the NSF and the NIH, which means that fewer researchers are getting support.\n\nIn 2025, the total number of new grants funded by the NSF dropped by 25% relative to the average of the previous ten years. In part, this resulted from uncertainty about future funding, and the agency’s decision to provide multi-year funding — in which a project’s budget is awarded all at once, rather than year by year.\n\nA similar story played out at the NIH, which issued 24% fewer grants in 2025, compared with the average of the previous ten years. After delays early in the year and with reduced staff levels, the agency raced to award grants by the end of the fiscal year. It achieved this in part by providing multi-year funding to a smaller number of new grant applications than usual — sharply reducing the number of scientists that received support.\n\nDuring the 2025–26 academic year, new international-student enrolment at US universities fell markedly. The Institute of International Education (IIE), a non-profit organization in New York City, released preliminary data, based on a subset of universities, showing a 17% decline from 2024 to 2025. This would result in the smallest number of new international enrolments in a decade, except for in 2020–21, during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThese trends are not uniform. An IIE survey found that about 60% of colleges and universities saw decreases, whereas 40% reported stable or increasing numbers. Of those experiencing declines, 96% cited visa-application concerns as a contributing factor. These concerns have intensified under the second Trump administration.\n\nIn total, federal science agencies lost about 20% of their staff in 2025 relative to the previous year, after modest increases over the past few years.\n\nAmong the hardest hit are the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA, both of which have been targets of the Trump administration’s attacks on climate science. The Food and Drug Administration also lost more than 20% of its staff.\n\nSome employees were fired during mass layoffs in early 2025, but most left voluntarily through a programme that offered incentives for federal workers to resign. Across the science agencies, there was an exodus of more than 25,000 people, many of whom were at early career stages.\n\nRemaining staff members at agencies such as the NIH and the NSF say they struggle to keep up with the workload, which includes approving research grants.\n\nIn its proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year, the Trump administration requested historic cuts of 35% to the budget for research and development not related to defence. The final funding levels will be determined through spending bills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate in an ongoing process.\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation, the president’s proposed decrease in funding for non-defence research would be unprecedented over the past half century and would reduce spending to 1991 levels.\n\nBut in enacted spending bills, lawmakers in both the Senate and the House of Representatives have so far rejected the most drastic budget cuts for many of the core science agencies. Policy experts hope that Congress will continue its long-standing support for science agencies when it finalizes the 2026 budget in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Trump administration shocked the science community when it proposed slashing more than $18 billion, or around 40% of the total, from the budget of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is the largest funder of biomedical research in the world.\n\nThe Trump administration also sought steep cuts at the National Science Foundation (57%) and NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (47%). In final budget agreements that are likely to be adopted by the House and the Senate, lawmakers agreed on much smaller cuts of 3.4% for the NSF and 1.1% for NASA’s science directorate.\n\nThe House and the Senate must finish negotiating final budgets for the remaining agencies, such as the NIH, and the actual funding levels will probably be somewhere in the middle. That would mostly protect the country’s total budget for research and development from the Trump administration’s drastic cuts for the current fiscal year.\n\nThis article is also available as a pdf version.",

    "fullText": "Mourning for Renee Nicole Good, the singer decried the Trump administration and the threat to freedom posed by “heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city.”\n\nBruce Springsteen took a side against the Trump administration’s authoritarian abuses last May, when he launched his European tour with an impassioned denunciation of the president’s assault on basic civil liberties, and decried an ugly moment in which the United States “is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration.” Now Springsteen has brought the complaint home, with a clarity that is all the more immediate and necessary.\n\nBefore launching into a fiery rendition of his 1978 classic “The Promised Land” during a Saturday night show in his home state of New Jersey, Springsteen turned the crowd’s attention to Minnesota, where, on January 7, an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a mother of three who loved to sing, wrote poetry, and evidenced a concern for her neighbors that embodied the spirit of Springsteen’s epic paean to community and solidarity, “We Take Care of Our Own.”\n\n“I wrote [‘The Promised Land’] as an ode to American possibility—both to the beautiful but flawed country that we are, and to the country that we could be,” Springsteen told the crowd. “Right now, we are living through incredibly critical times. The United States, the ideals and the values for which it stood for the past 250 years, is being tested as it has never been in modern times. Those values and those ideals have never been as endangered as they are right now.”\n\nThe crowd roared with approval as Springsteen continued:\n\n“So, as we gather tonight in this beautiful display of love and care and thoughtfulness and community, if you believe in democracy and liberty, if you believe that truth still matters, it is worth speaking out. It is worth fighting for. If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president—as the mayor of that city has said—ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”\n\nAbove what had become thunderous applause, Springsteen announced, “This song is for you and the memory of a mother of three and American citizen, Renee Good.”\n\nWith that, Springsteen and his band broke into “The Promised Land,” a song that speaks of a storm that will “blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted” and “blow everything down that ain’t got the faith to stand its ground”—and about how, against the tempest and through it all, “I believe in a promised land.”\n\nYears ago, Springsteen summed up his mission as an artist when he said, “I have spent my life judging the distance between American reality and the American dream.” The honesty with which Springsteen has conducted this decades-long examination has earned the songwriter the greatest honors the entertainment industry and the nation can grant. In addition to 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, and a Special Tony Award for his critically acclaimed Springsteen on Broadway shows, he is an inducted member of both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He has also been given the Kennedy Center Honor and, in 2016, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama, who hailed him for “carrying the rest of us on his journey: asking us all what is the work for us to do in our short time here.”\n\nIt was an appropriate honor for a singer who, like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger before him, refused to surrender the dream of a promised land to the crude machinations of billionaire investors and the crooked politicians who serve them. “There is a real patriotism underneath the best of my music,” Springsteen once said, “but it is a critical, questioning and often angry patriotism.”\n\nThere are plenty of artists who soften as they age.\n\nWith his denunciation of ICE violence in Minneapolis, he has once again proven himself to be as critical, questioning, angry, and, yes, patriotic as the times require.",
