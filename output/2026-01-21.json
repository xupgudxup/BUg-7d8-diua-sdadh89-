    "fullText": "Justin Gaethje thrives in chaos, but Belal Muhammad advises that he doesn't go that route for UFC 324.\n\nGaethje (26-5 MMA, 9-5 UFC) takes on Paddy Pimblett (23-3 MMA, 7-0 UFC) for the interim lightweight title in Saturday's main event (Paramount+) at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Gaethje is the betting underdog, but Muhammad provided some keys to victory for \"The Highlight\" to prevail.\n\n\"For Justin, I think you've got to come out striking,\" Muhammad said on his YouTube channel. \"You've got to keep it striking. You've got to avoid the takedown, avoid the clinch, avoid the chaos. I think for Paddy, we've seen him throw flying triangles up. We've seen him get guillotines that turn into triangles that turn into armbars. We want to stay away from the grappling for Justin. Not saying it's a hole in his game, but you can just tell that he doesn't like it.\n\n\"We've seen him get tapped out by (Charles) Oliveira, obviously really good, Khabib (Nurmagomedov), really good. Paddy puts himself on that level with those guys. I think his grappling is really good. I think he's one of the top grapplers in the division. So, for Justin, use your boxing, use your footwork. Paddy gets hit a lot. We've seen him get rocked. Let's find out if Scousers can really get knocked out.\"\n\nOn the contrary, Muhammad sees Pimblett achieving most success if he can lure Gaethje into a brawl, which could open up his grappling.\n\n\"For Paddy, I think you've got to create chaos,\" Muhammad said. \"You got to wrestle as much as possible. Yeah, he has college wrestling accolades, but this isn't college wrestling. This is the UFC. This is fighting. This is punches. This is grappling. This is everything involved. If I'm Paddy, I'm going to shoot in early and test it early because when you guys are both dry, that's where it comes.\n\n\"We've seen guys like Khabib catch the low kick and shoot off it, or as he's pulling that kick back, shoot off it, pushing him to the fence. We've seen him get pressured. We don't want to get hit by him. Everyone who gets hit by him says how hard he hits. He's one of the hardest hitters in the division, so let's not test your chin. I think your path to victory is clear. It's on the ground.\"\n\nAfter careful consideration, Muhammad ultimately made his prediction for the fight.\n\n\"My pick, I think I'm going to go with Justin,\" Muhammad said. \"I think Paddy just gets hit a lot on the feet. Yeah, he's pretty much clean his last two victories, but Jared Gordon had some clean shots on him. Big hooks, big crosses.\n\n\"Justin boxes kind of like Jared – clean, he likes dirty boxing, he likes inside boxing. Justin is very good there, so I think I'm going to pick Justin in this one. I don't know if he knocks him out or finishes him. I do think it'll kind of be a decision.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: UFC 324: What Justin Gaethje must avoid to beat Paddy Pimblett",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees managed to hold on to their top-rated prospects in the trade for left-hander Ryan Weathers from the Miami Marlins.\n\nFour of the Yankees' highly regarded farmhands were named to Baseball America's top 100 prospects list for 2026. They are: shortstop George Lombard Jr. (No. 46), right-hander Elmer Rodriguez (No. 59), shortstop Dax Kilby (No. 61), and right-hander Carlos Lagrange (No. 93).\n\nLombard, 20, played 108 games in Double-A last season, hitting eight home runs with a .695 OPS. Kilby, 19, was a first-round draft choice in 2025 and had an .898 OPS and 16 steals in 18 games at Single-A Tampa.\n\nBaseball America named Rodriguez the Yankees' Minor League Pitcher of the Year this past season, leading the farm system with 176 strikeouts. Lagrange can hit over 100 mph with his fastball, making him a possible Major League bullpen option in 2026.\n\nDespite being the most ready of the five players to make an impact in the Majors, outfielder Spencer Jones did not appear on Baseball America's top 100 list.\n\nThere are legitimate concerns with Jones' swing and miss and strikeout rate against MLB arms. He hit 35 home runs between Double-A Somerset and Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre but struck out 179 times in 506 plate appearances.\n\nIf Cody Bellingers signs elsewhere, Jones' chance of making the Yankees' Opening Day roster and splitting left field duties with Jasson Dominguez increases.\n\nMets offer to Kyle Tucker before Dodgers' $240 million deal revealed by former MLB GM\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nKyle Tucker contract details: How much deferred money did Dodgers give new star?\n\nDodgers continue to frustrate all of MLB with major Kyle Tucker signing\n\nRed Sox get big trade update on Brendan Donovan amid updated rumors\n\nFormer Cubs, Twins All-Star utilityman to sign with Rockies on two-year deal",

    "fullText": "Liverpool are in talks over a triple contract deal right now. It would be a massive statement from the club.\n\nLiverpool spent all of last season battling through three major contract talks. Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk were all coming to the end of their respective deals but the club didn't want to lose any of them.\n\nAnd so that was the side-story of last season as Liverpool raced away to the Premier League title. Could they keep arguably their three biggest stars when all was said an done?\n\nNo, was the answer. Salah and Van Dijk did renew their contracts for two more years last April but Alexander-Arnold never did. He instead agreed terms with Real Madrid, as expected, and joined them ahead of the Club World Cup.\n\nThere are more contract talks right now, too. Andy Robertson and Ibrahima Konate are both out of contract this summer and must agree new terms if they're to stay.\n\nBut those aren't the only talks Liverpool are involved in. They're pushing for a triple contract deal that would be one hell of a statement.",

    "fullText": "We asked for your views on Jean-Philippe Mateta telling Crystal Palace he wants to leave and broader issues such as the departure of club captain Marc Guehi this month, manager Oliver Glasner's public criticism of the Eagles' recruitment strategy and his decision to leave at the end of the season.\n\nHere are some of your comments:\n\nStephen: Palace need to capitalise on this transfer window and get another striker. If he does not want to stay, let him go - grass always seems greener on the other side.\n\nAl: Two choices - get a replacement in now and sell Mateta, or tell Mateta he stays until the summer window when he'll be sold and between now and then he will be expected to perform. Because he has reverted to the Mateta who first arrived - clumsy on the ball, terrible first touch and poor game/goal ratio. His one-on-one with a keeper is dire. He has failed as a striker since November. Time to do what he's paid for.\n\nSam: Just obvious that all the leading figures involved in bringing us the FA Cup feel that the club hasn't pushed on as it should have. Since Dougie Freedman left, it seems we have no real vision for squad development or renewal. Why would Mateta stay when he has the chance to pursue big prizes? Sad but not at all surprised.\n\nJoe: It's not surprising, but we have to cash in and have a replacement lined up. He's 29 in June and is missing big opportunities in front of the goal all season. He's always said we're his stepping stone, so thank you, goodbye and bring in Jorgen Strand Larsen.\n\nRob: Not surprised with the rats leaving a sinking ship. Will they do better elsewhere? All I care about is Crystal Palace. We've been through worse. Good luck to them, I say.\n\nAndrew: Saddened to see the rush to being a feeder club again - why revert to a strategy of building players and selling them, staying mid-level and not having ambition to rise? Crystal Palace is a wonderful club, friendly and the base for many amazing careers. Be even better to see them aim higher.",

Let’s say a few doors are open and if format, numbers, and timing align, the market could see a move nobody expects.”\n\nZuffa Boxing is building traction with signings, among which include the acquisition of current IBF cruiserweight champion Jai Opetaia, with the Australian fighter remaining unbeaten in 29 of his professional bouts.\n\nLapin added: “Everyone has seen what he [Dana White] did.\n\n“He turned ‘old MMA’ into the global UFC machine. His real power is packaging not just a fight, but an event. If he gets involved, the scale and attention immediately become different.”\n\nThe three-time undisputed champion took to X to post a video of himself riding a motorbike in Thailand, which is where his recent foe Tyson Fury has currently set up his regimented training camp.\n\n“The Gypsy King” has been typically vocal about his latest return to the sport as he continues to seek an opportunity to become a three-time heavyweight world champion.",

    "fullText": "Las Vegas Darts Open: Brandon Claims Open as Hedman defends women's title originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLas Vegas has a habit of exaggerating things. Lights brighter. Nights longer. Legends larger. And on the oche, beneath the neon glare of The Strip, Deta Hedman once again reminded the darts world that class doesn’t age – it sharpens.\n\nNorth America is becoming more a centre of focus for the World Darts Federation with every passing year. A glance at the rankings will confirm the growing influence of USA events and, in turn, dominance of their players. But they would not get it all their own way as the season started again after a festive breather.\n\nThe Open event brought a distinctly American flavour, and the final proved brutally one-sided. Tennessee thrower Jason Brandon turned the dial to demolition mode, whitewashing compatriot Alex Spellman 6-0 with an average nudging just past the 90 mark. Spellman never found his footing. Brandon never loosened his grip. Sometimes, finals end before they begin.\n\nFresh into 2026 and the reigning WDF Women’s World Championship holder picked up exactly where she left off, rolling into Nevada and rolling straight back into the winner’s circle by lifting the Winmau Las Vegas Open crown. At 66 years young, the Queen of Darts remains ruthlessly efficient, brushing aside America’s Cali West 5-2 in the final to add yet another major WDF trophy to an already overflowing cabinet.\n\nDETA STRIKES 10 DART LEG: Watch Vegas highlight from the World Champion\n\nThis wasn’t nostalgia. This wasn’t sentiment. This was elite darts, delivered with the calm authority of someone who has seen every trend come and go – and outlasted them all. In a city built on excess, Hedman’s dominance felt beautifully understated. Just sharp scoring, clinical doubles, and the unmistakable presence of a champion who still belongs at the very top of the World Darts Federation pyramid.\n\nBut Las Vegas is never about just one event. The weekend unfolded like a darts buffet – singles, doubles, cricket, youth tournaments – boards buzzing from morning through to whatever hour Vegas pretends is night. And naturally, Hedman wasn’t done.\n\nMore silverware followed in the doubles, where she paired with Anca Zijlstra to overcome Japan’s Kosuzu Iwao and Shiori Sato. Another medal. Another reminder that Hedman’s influence stretches across formats, continents and generations.\n\nThe Stars and Stripes flew again in the Open Doubles as Brandon Perez and Marko Silva edged out Canada’s Jayson Barlow and David Cameron in a tight North American showdown.\n\nThere are far worse places to spend a weekend throwing darts than Las Vegas. Fewer still where the trophies pile up, the WDF banner flies proudly, and legends like Deta Hedman continue to turn neon-lit stages into personal property.\n\nFor the full stories and \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "description": "Fantasy football analyst Scott Pianowski is looking back on another season to examine what went as expected — and what went completely off the rails.",
    "fullText": "With the 2025 fantasy football season now complete, it’s important to take stock of what we learned during the year — what we got right, what we got wrong. Today, I’ll do my AFC audit. The NFC audit will come later in the week.\n\nWe’ll start in the west and move our way back east.\n\nWhat I got right: I appreciated that the 2024 success was misleading — the Chiefs outkicked their metrics and point differential by about four wins — and this team was likely headed for a major regression season.\n\nWhat I got wrong: I didn’t grasp how much of a screaming value Rashee Rice presented. Although Rice ultimately got hurt, he was unquestionably a right answer when he was active.\n\nWhat I got right: Although I did project the Chargers to be a playoff team, I don’t think I read anything right with their fantasy prospects.\n\nWhat I got wrong: I expected Ladd McConkey’s second half of 2024 to be symbolic of what he might do in 2025, and that was a gigantic miss. I also expected Omarion Hampton to be a smash rookie, something that might have happened had he not been injured, and working behind an injury-ravaged offensive line. I also underestimated what Keenan Allen had left in the tank.\n\nWhat I got right: Courtland Sutton would be a steal at his ADP — his 2024 and 2025 stats are just about identical — and J.K. Dobbins would be a useful “play for now” pick, someone who starts fast but might not have full-season relevance. I also faded Evan Engram all summer, and he didn’t do much.\n\nWhat I got wrong: I was ahead of the market on Marvin Mims Jr., to my detriment. The Mims breakout I envisioned ultimately belonged to Troy Franklin.\n\nWhat I got right: I was bearish on the Pete Carroll experiment. I suspected Ashton Jeanty would get more receiving work deeper into the season, which he did.\n\nWhat I got wrong: Nothing major. This looked like a bad team in the summer and it played out as such.\n\nWhat I got right: Daniel Jones winning the QB job would be a boost for the entire offense. Alec Pierce was a late-round sleeper or early-season FAAB target.\n\nWhat I got wrong: I didn’t expect Tyler Warren to start as fast as he did, though like several teammates he slumped after Jones got hurt.\n\nWhat I got right: Liam Coen is a right-answer head coach who would perk up this offense and organization. Trevor Lawrence was a value QB pick. Travis Hunter would struggle in his rookie year.\n\nWhat I got wrong: I wish I had seen Travis Etienne Jr. as a smash pick, emerging from a nebulous backfield. I coveted Brian Thomas Jr. all summer; he was an enormous bust. I didn’t expect Jakobi Meyers to onboard so seamlessly after a midseason trade from the Raiders.\n\nWhat I got right: Tony Pollard would be a useful value pick. Cam Ward would show signs of future stardom, despite an ordinary supporting cast.\n\nWhat I got wrong: I projected Calvin Ridley to have another boring value vet season, but he was a total bust.\n\nWhat I got right: C.J. Stroud was a player to avoid. Nick Chubb had little left. The rookie WRs would onboard quickly.\n\nWhat I got wrong: Nico Collins was a mild loss for fantasy, because of injuries. That hurt. My timing on Woody Marks was off for most of ranking season.\n\nWhat I got right: Nothing major. I had them going to the Super Bowl, and the Ravens didn’t even make the playoffs.\n\nWhat I got wrong: I thought this would be the season Zay Flowers had some positive touchdown regression. Flowers was an effective player, but the touchdown column remained light.\n\nWhat I got right: Aaron Rodgers would cap the upside of the offense. DK Metcalf would be inconsistent. Jaylen Warren would be solid.\n\nWhat I got wrong: I underestimated Kenny Gainwell all season; he wound up being the MVP of the team.\n\nWhat I got right: The quarterback room had zero right answers. Jerry Jeudy couldn’t be trusted.\n\nWhat I got wrong: Although Quinshon Judkins did little down the stretch, he outkicked my expectations in the middle of the year. I also didn’t expect Harold Fannin Jr. to be so impactful as a rookie.\n\nWhat I got right: Chase Brown was a summer value. Cincinnati’s defense would be horrible again, to the benefit of the offense.\n\nWhat I got wrong: My dreams of a Joe Burrow/Ja’Marr Chase stack were quickly crushed by Burrow’s injury. I also had trouble timing the market after Burrow came back — note the Bengals scored 32 points on the Ravens for Thanksgiving night, then were shut out by the same Ravens two weeks later. Doesn’t make a lot of sense. Cincinnati also scored 45 points one week after the Baltimore shutout — it was that kind of season.\n\nWhat I got right: I had Drake Maye taking a big step forward and Mike Vrabel guiding the Patriots into the playoffs. Two clean hits.\n\nWhat I got wrong: I didn’t expect Stefon Diggs to be this useful in his age-32 season, off a major injury to boot. I expected TreVeyon Henderson to take over the backfield at some point, which never happened.\n\nWhat I got right: Dalton Kincaid was one of my most rostered tight ends — he was very good when he played. I didn’t see a breakout season for Keon Coleman.\n\nWhat I got wrong: I expected a minor regression year for James Cook, and although he lost four touchdowns from the previous year, he also won the rushing title. An unmistakable right answer.\n\nWhat I got right: I pretended Tua Tagovailoa wasn’t on my cheat sheet, and projected a lost season for Tyreek Hill. Even if Hill had stayed healthy, this passing game was unlikely to support him.\n\nWhat I got wrong: I misjudged the chances of De’Von Achane smashing despite all the failure around him. He’s a special talent, and he was a league-winning player in 2025.\n\nWhat I got right: I expected them to be one of the five worst teams in football, a mark they met the entire season.\n\nWhat I got wrong: I thought the Konami Code could push Justin Fields into fantasy relevance, no matter how mediocre his passing might be. Fields basically forced the Jets to bench him.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 2024 NBA Draft was highly anticipated for one reason in particular.\n\nWith the Los Angeles Lakers having two picks (No. 17 and No. 55) and LeBron James’ son, Bronny, declaring for the draft after a lackluster freshman campaign at USC, many believed the Lakers would pair their superstar forward with his eldest son.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Lakers did just that, selecting James with their lone second-round pick. On Wednesday, though, a bombshell report involving the James clan reveals new details about the 2024 Draft that’ll surprise fans.\n\n“And when the Lakers drafted James' son Bronny with the 55th pick in the 2024 draft, Jeanie (Buss) privately remarked that James should be grateful for such a gesture, but she felt that he wasn't,” ESPN’s Baxter Holmes reported Wednesday.\n\nEssentially, if one were to read between the lines, one would conclude that although Buss and the Lakers didn’t genuinely believe Bronny was worth a draft pick, they selected him to appease their aging superstar.\n\nFollowing the highly scrutinized move, Buss felt that James didn’t appreciate the Lakers’ commitment to going out of their way to make him happy, even if their decision wasn’t in the franchise’s best interest.\n\nFast forward to early 2026, and Bronny has been demoted to the G-League several times and doesn’t appear to have a bright future in Los Angeles. It’s reasonable to assume Buss’s frustration with James hasn’t only gotten worse since the 2024 Draft.\n\nMore NBA: Proposed Warriors trade sees Golden State make NBA-altering deal for $101 million Lakers star",

    "fullText": "The GP25 may have had the potential to outperform its predecessor, but only one rider truly managed to unlock its full capabilities.\n\nMarquez would be perfectly content if things played out the same way again this year, though the rest of the paddock will be eager for a change in fortunes.\n\nDucati faced an interesting challenge over the winter. Without their reigning champion available for post-season testing due to injury, questions lingered about how effective their development process would be.\n\nThey’ve also got Francesco Bagnaia’s issues to address, though it’s never easy when resources are stretched thin. But as always, Ducati’s main focus is on reclaiming the MotoGP title.\n\nMarquez keeps any complaints he might have about Ducati to himself and never voices them publicly—a smart approach from someone with his experience.\n\nMarquez is expected to get in some ‘crucial’ laps with Ducati before the pre-season test at Sepang, which will help decide if he’s fit enough to return soon after. There’s plenty of optimism around his recovery.\n\nReports indicate that Marquez’s contract extension with Ducati is close to being finalised, which could set off the first major move in the MotoGP rider market.\n\nWith a new set of regulations coming up, staying put with a team where he’s already found plenty of success makes sense.\n\nBut Aprilia have made serious progress over the past year and shouldn’t be overlooked. They’re looking strong heading into this season.\n\nDucati boss Luigi Dall’Igna recently gave an update on the GP26 development that should give Marquez some confidence. The early numbers look promising, but as always, nothing is settled until they hit the track.\n\nDall’Igna told Moto.it: “From my point of view, the 25 was still better than the 24. That’s the goal [for the GP26 to be better]. On paper, it is.”\n\nHe added: “The numbers say that. In reality, we will then have to go to Sepang test it and decide which ideas will actually be confirmed and which ideas instead will be discarded.”\n\nOver the past two years, Marquez has had plenty of adjustments to manage, switching teams in back-to-back seasons and taking on a lot of new information each time.\n\nFor 2026, that stability should help offset his limited involvement in the early stages of the GP26’s development.\n\nThese days, Bagnaia and Marquez share a strong working relationship. It gives Ducati one less internal issue to manage and lets them stay focused on performance.\n\nTheir main concern now is making sure Aprilia doesn’t sneak in and take the title away from them.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals, after a disappointing 2025 campaign marred by injuries to two of the team's biggest stars on both sides of the ball, need to bounce back in a major way next season.\n\nWhile the 6-11 record stings, it did allow the Bengals to land the 10th overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. With that top-10 pick, the Bengals need to land an instant-impact player.\n\nESPN writer Ben Baby is urging the Bengals to take a playmaker at this spot, and one that would make team history for the first time since 2010, over 15 years ago.\n\n\"The Bengals haven't used a top-10 pick on defense since 2010, when they drafted linebacker Keith Rivers with the No. 9 pick. But they can't afford to follow history this time,\" Baby writes. \"The team needs playmakers on defense.\"\n\nCincinnati has a star-studded offense, with Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins, and Chase Brown being more than enough to contend.\n\nOffensively, the team isn't lacking playmakers. But the same cannot be said for the defensive side of the ball. The Bengals need to add to their defense, whether it's a pass rusher or a defensive back; defense is a must this offseason.\n\nMore: Two reasons why Bengals fans should look forward to defense in 2026\n\nSomeone like Ohio State's Caleb Downs would be an incredible addition. While a safety might not be a popular pick, it would be a worthwhile one for a Bengals defense in need of all-around upgrades on that side of the ball.\n\nBaby is calling on the Bengals to add a defensive playmaker in the upcoming 2026 NFL Draft, and it's not hard to understand. The defense needs to get better, and the Bengals' best option in the draft will likely be a defensive player.\n\nIt's a logical decision, and one that the Bengals front office, led by Duke Tobin, should strong considering making. The Bengals should make some franchise history by taking a defensive player inside the top-10 for the first time since 2010.\n\nBengals' Chase Brown believes average fan can gain one yard in an NFL game\n\nBengals receive $33 million contract projection on Trey Hendrickson despite injury\n\nBengals announce Zac Taylor decision after rough 2025 season\n\nZac Taylor was mad for dumbest reason ever after Myles Garrett's record-breaking sack\n\nJa'Marr Chase says issues Bengals need to change are 'pretty obvious'\n\nBengals urged to make aggressive Chase Brown contract decision",

    "fullText": "Ryanair is relishing its feud with Elon Musk.\n\nThe Irish airline is hand-delivering a free ticket to X's Dublin office for Musk, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a Wednesday press conference.\n\nRyanair has taken advantage of the feud by launching a \"Big 'Idiot' Sale\" with 100,000 tickets starting at £16.99, or about $23.\n\nMusk and O'Leary, arguably the world's most outspoken businessmen, have called each other idiots in a weeklong feud over Starlink in-flight WiFi.\n\n\"I've included myself and him in this 'Big Idiot' seat sale,\" O'Leary said Wednesday, referring to an ad that shows the pair brawling.\n\n\"I suspect he's a bigger idiot than me, but nevertheless, he probably thinks I'm a bigger idiot than him.\"\n\nAfter trading insults over the past days, Musk posted a poll on X on Monday asking if he should buy Ryanair and install a CEO named Ryan. About three-quarters of the roughly 950,000 voters said yes.\n\nHowever, European Union rules say that the bloc's airlines must be at least 50% owned by EU nationals.\n\nO'Leary has also been known to make provocative statements to help promote his airline.\n\nAfter Musk compared O'Leary to a chimpanzee on Tuesday, the Ryanair boss responded at the press conference, saying: \"I think it's somewhat unfair on the chimp community. But chimp chump, as long as it increases Ryanair bookings through January, February, and March, it's all good fun and entertainment.\"\n\n\"It is very good for our bookings,\" O'Leary also said. \"We love these PR spats that drive bookings on Ryanair.\"\n\nThe quarrel started last Wednesday after O'Leary told Reuters he wouldn't join other airlines installing Starlink. The following day, he told the Irish radio station Newstalk that it would cost the airline up to $250 million because adding the terminal to a plane would affect its aerodynamics and increase fuel costs.\n\nHe said this would amount to a 2% increase, but a SpaceX executive said in an X post that it was actually 0.2%.\n\nAs a budget airline, Ryanair focuses on keeping costs as low as possible to offer cheaper airfares. It turns a profit by keeping its planes flying frequently with low turnaround times at airports, and selling extras, including scratchcards.\n\nPlus, it only flies short-haul routes, so O'Leary doesn't think passengers would be too interested in in-flight WiFi.\n\n\"If it results in a fuel drag, it is something we would never go near,\" he added on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, in the press conference, he also called Starlink a \"terrific system.\"\n\nO'Leary said the airline is continuing discussions with Starlink and other providers, including Amazon, but it would adopt in-flight WiFi \"only in a way where it will lower our costs.\"",

Some routes have private cabins, but mine didn't.\n\n\"The quality of travel depends not only on the carriages, but also on the route,\" the statement also said.\n\nTo travel by train, I bought a Eurail pass for $477, which gives access to most European trains for a set number of days.\n\nSome trains only require a Eurail pass to ride, while others, including overnight trains, incur an additional discounted price.\n\nWith my seven-day Eurail pass, the train trip cost $14. It was the cheapest overnight accommodation.\n\nI arrived about an hour and a half before my 6:53 p.m. train, so I had ample time to find the platform.\n\nMcDonald's in Germany has different menu items from locations in the US, like the hash brown burger.\n\nThe train arrived on time, and I found and boarded my assigned car, number 254.\n\nI made my way to my assigned seat in one of these cabins.\n\nTwo others arrived within the first few hours.\n\nRight away, I thought the room was cramped and lacked enough legroom for each traveler. However, I was surprised to find ample luggage space on two rows of storage racks above the seats.\n\nIt had two cushions and reclined far enough to almost lie flat, but not fully.\n\nIt was just large enough to hold my ticket and phone.\n\nI thought it had a wide selection with snacks, pasta, and wraps.\n\nI didn't see any pillows or sheets provided for guests, either.\n\nThe rep for OBB Nightjet told Business Insider that pillows and sheets are only provided for guests in the bunk-style sleeping cars because the seating carriage is not recommended for long-haul trips.\n\nI ended up switching to a different cabin with only two other people.\n\nEven in a less-crowded cabin, I couldn't get comfortable on such a bumpy journey or with the knowledge that someone might wake me up to move.\n\nMy train arrived in Vienna at 7 a.m., and I was so exhausted that I ran around town looking for any hotel that would take me in so early.\n\nNext time, I'll book a flight or take a train with private cabins.",

    "fullText": "Is AI coming for your job? If you work in construction or plumbing, that's perhaps not a question you need to worry about.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it was a great time to be a tradesperson because the AI boom is creating demand for manual labor to build data centers.\n\n\"It's wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft and we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers,\" he said in a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nHuang described the AI boom as the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history\" that would create \"a lot of jobs.\"\n\nAI's impact on the labor market has been a hot topic at Davos this year. Huang has long argued that AI won't be the mass job killer some believe it will be. He has given radiology as an example: while AI has automated some of the tasks radiologists do, the number of jobs in the field has actually increased.\n\nAI \"Godfather\" Geoffrey Hinton previously said he also believes manual labor is safer from AI, though for a different reason: it will take longer for AI to have the dexterity to take on more physical jobs.\n\nAt Davos on Wednesday, Huang said the US was seeing a \"significant boom\" in demand for manual jobs helping build AI infrastructure, with salaries nearly doubling in some cases.\n\n\"So we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories, and we have a great shortage in that,\" said Huang.\n\nHe added: \"Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don't need to have a Ph.D. in computer science to do so.\"",

    "description": "Aliett Buttelman explains how Taylor Swift wearing Fazit's glitter freckles helped the brand generate over $1 million in sales in 48 hours.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aliett Buttelman, cofounder of Fazit. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen people hear that my company took off after Taylor Swift wore our product, they might assume it was a matter of luck. But really, it was the result of a 360-degree strategy we'd developed to get the product into Taylor Swift's hands.\n\nI started Fazit with Nina LaBruna about three years ago. Nina had been a marketing client of mine, and she had pitched me on the idea of entering the skincare patch market. From there, we expanded into cosmetics, which was a truly revolutionary move. We launched glitter freckles — a makeup patch to put glittery spots on the cheekbones — in April 2024, and the product immediately went viral online, selling 100,000 units in its first week.\n\nWe felt Taylor Swift embodied the essence of the glitter freckles. There would be no one better in the world to wear it. So, we started sending the product to the wives and girlfriends of Kansas City Chiefs players, to Taylor's make-up artists, and to Sabrina Carpenter, who was opening for her at the time, hoping to catch her attention.\n\nThe night Taylor wore the freckles, in October 2024, I had just come home from hot yoga, and the Monday night football game was already on. The Chiefs were playing, and a content creator noticed the freckles on Taylor and messaged me. When I saw the product on her face, I just started bawling.\n\nA part of me just couldn't believe it. The biggest celebrity in the world was wearing our makeup patches, validating all the hard work Nina and I had put in. But really, I was crying because I knew this moment counted: it was about to open the door to so many possibilities. It was our chance, despite the brand being so young.\n\nWe immediately got to work. People noticed the freckles, but didn't know Fazit was the brand behind them. I started reaching out to as many media contacts as I could and hired a publicist. The next day, I was on CBS and Peacock.\n\nNina handles the back end of the business, and she was just as busy. She had to double the size of our warehouse overnight. Shipping labels were printing nonstop. We generated seven figures in sales within the first 48 hours after Taylor wore the freckles, and our web traffic increased by 4,800%.\n\nThe first two months were primarily about staying afloat and avoiding too many cracks in the business. Before the Taylor effect, Fazit only had one employee in addition to Nina and me. After that, we called any friends and family we could, asking for help with fulfilling orders.\n\nThe influx of sales significantly changed the company's financials. Nina and I initially bootstrapped the company with $13,000 of our own savings. After some success, we raised $200,000 from friends and family. But in the fall of 2024, we only had enough cash on hand to run the business for about five more months.\n\nTaylor changed that. We had private equity and venture capital firms reach out, but we haven't needed to fundraise. For the first time, Nina and I were able to take a distribution. Now, we have a business that is so profitable and healthy that we can really focus on the next stage of growth.\n\nA year after Taylor wore the freckles, she donned them again, which gave us another sales boost. This time, we were better prepared. Yet, a lot of the past year and a half has still felt like a fight or flight response. We're just trying so hard to take advantage of opportunities and make all the right decisions.\n\nNina and I weren't friends when we started the company together. Now, she's my life partner. We're closer than friends — we're family. No one, with the possible exception of our husbands, can truly understand what it's like to go through this hyper growth.\n\nThe highs are so high, the lows are so low, and there are many unexplainable emotions.",

    "title": "I moved to a walkable city on an island in Canada. Despite a few drawbacks, living here feels close to perfect.",
    "description": "Though I never imagined myself living in a small city, I've fallen in love with the walkability and benefits of Victoria, Vancouver Island, in Canada.",
    "fullText": "Growing up in the midsize city of Vancouver, Canada, I always dreamed of living in a big metropolis — a cultural hub where something was always going on, with endless places to explore.\n\nFor a while, I did. When I started dating a Brit, I moved to his hometown of Birmingham, England, the second-largest city in the UK population-wise, with over a million residents.\n\nAfter five years there, I began missing the ocean, the mountains, and the laid-back vibe of my home province. So, we headed back.\n\nEventually, we settled in the small city of Victoria, the provincial capital of the nearby Vancouver Island, where my family had moved while I was in the UK. It made sense for us to restart our lives in Canada, where we had family support.\n\nI didn't know if we would end up staying, but now it's been two years, and we're mostly loving our life on the island.\n\nI always enjoyed visiting Victoria while growing up, since it was just a 1-½ hour ferry ride from the mainland. However, I worried I'd find living there boring, as I'd always lived in and craved bigger cities.\n\nLuckily, after experiencing the hustle and bustle of Birmingham for many years, I found myself appreciating Victoria's calm pace even more.\n\nWith a population of less than 100,000, the city rarely feels crowded. It's also surrounded by peaceful shorelines and beaches, so everything feels more chill.\n\nIt didn't take me long to appreciate Victoria's compact size, either — nowhere feels too far from our apartment in our super walkable, central neighborhood.\n\nEvery essential amenity we need is within a 15-minute walk — including grocery stores, a hospital and medical clinics, a drugstore, and a post office. Even my hair salon is less than 20 minutes from my home on foot.\n\nBeyond that, we can reach beautiful beaches, parks, and the downtown area within 30 minutes. Even if we need to drive across town for something, the ride is never too long — we can get just about anywhere in under an hour.\n\nI no longer have to feel frustrated watching UK buses and trains get delayed, then pile onto them like sardines with hundreds of other commuters when they finally arrive. I don't have to push through massive crowds on big boulevards or in busy shops, either.\n\nHere, I feel like I always have room to breathe.\n\nThough it's small, Victoria also has a good variety of cafés, restaurants, shops, and other cultural establishments. I'm still discovering new gems two years after moving here, so I definitely don't feel bored.\n\nIf there's one thing I've learned after all my moves, it's that nowhere is perfect. As much as I love my new life in Victoria, I miss some of the perks of bigger cities.\n\nHaving grown up in a city with an international airport, I find traveling is now more challenging and less convenient. Victoria has a local airport, but its international flight offerings are generally limited to just a few US cities and Mexican resort towns.\n\nI often travel to Asia and Europe, so I need to leave from Vancouver to get more direct flights. Traveling to Vancouver can add anywhere from a few hours to an extra day to my travel time — I spend the night there if I have an early morning flight or a late-night arrival.\n\nI also miss having more entertainment options. I've been to fantastic events in Victoria, from intimate concerts to comedy shows. However, as a smaller city, it pretty much always gets passed over on tours from the bigger artists I love.\n\nThough I enjoy the option of going to Vancouver, I have to debate whether an event is worth all the extra travel expenses I'd incur, from ferry tickets to a hotel room for the night.\n\nMy husband and I pick one or two gigs we really want to see a year and make a trip of it, but I'd go to a lot more shows if I were still in Vancouver and only had to worry about ticket fees.\n\nFinally, I miss the diversity of bigger cities. Victoria is fairly diverse for its size, but it still doesn't compare to larger cities like Vancouver or Birmingham, let alone metropolises like Paris and London.\n\nAs an immigrant with a mixed ethnic background, I miss the bigger cultural communities of Vancouver, where I was able to more easily connect with people with diverse backgrounds like mine.\n\nThe drawbacks don't outweigh all the positives of living in Victoria, and I'm surprised at how much I'm enjoying small-city life after dreaming of big ones for so long.\n\nSometimes, I feel like I'm in a fairy tale (or at least a quaint rom-com) as I walk among the free-roaming deer and colorful heritage houses.\n\nI love the walkability, the compact infrastructure, the lack of crowds, and the fresh ocean air. My husband and I can see ourselves staying here for a long while.\n\nPlus, when I'm missing bigger city vibes, I'm always happy to make the trip to Vancouver when needed — even if my wallet may not be.",

They divorced in 1981.\n\nIn 1985, he married model Claudia Heffner Peltz, and they have eight children, including Nicola, who was born in 1995.

That same year, she won a rising star CinemaCon Award.\n\nPeltz Beckham has also acted in music videos. Most notably, she was featured in Miley Cyrus's \"7 Things\" music video, which has been viewed over 290 million times on YouTube since its 2008 premiere. In 2016, she was featured in Zayn Malik's music video for his song \"iT's YoU.\"\n\nPeltz Beckham acted alongside Kumail Nanjiani and Murray Bartlett in Hulu's \"Welcome to Chippendales,\" which was released in 2022.\n\nIn a 2023 interview with Elle, she told the magazine about one of her favorite memories from the show.\n\n\"Finding Dorothy's look for the first time ... like, putting it all together — the makeup, the wig, the costume,\" she said. \"When I got into the costume I really felt changed,\" she continued.\n\nThe show picked up five Emmy nominations in 2023.\n\nIn a 2024 interview with Women's Wear Daily, Peltz Beckham said she wrote \"Lola\" when she was 23 years old. It focuses on the life of a teenage girl named Lola who works at a drugstore and strip club to save enough money to move herself and her brother away from their toxic mother.\n\n\"I did not sleep for three days. I have screenshots of 4:50 a.m., just me writing. When I started putting my thoughts down, they just wouldn't stop,\" she said.\n\n\"I wanted to write a flawed character, but also someone where their heart's in the right place. I just think that's life, and imperfection in life will always inspire me,\" Peltz Beckham added.\n\nAlthough the film was released in February 2024, it garnered attention in April 2024 due to negative reviews from critics, with The Guardian's Kady Ruth Ashcraft describing the film as a \"vanity project.\"\n\n\"In film, that means the exploitation of the conditions of poverty for entertainment and artistic recognition,\" she wrote.\n\nIn her interview with WWD, Peltz Beckham acknowledged that she didn't grow up like Lola at all and was prepared for the criticism.\n\n\"I wanted to write a story from a person's perspective and another point of view that was not my personal view and not my upbringing. I am an actress and my dream is to get to look at the world from different perspectives,\" she said.\n\nThe thriller, which drops on FX and Hulu on January 21, has a star-studded cast including Ashton Kutcher, Rebecca Hall, Anthony Ramos, Bella Hadid, Isabella Rossellini, Meghan Trainor, and Peter Gallagher, among others.\n\nPeltz Beckham also plays the lead in the upcoming \"Prima\" which is in production, Deadline reported.\n\nIn addition to having played Luke Kasten in \"Euphoria,\" Will Peltz is known for his role in \"Unfriended,\" a 2014 horror film.\n\nIn 2024, he appeared in \"Lola\" as a member of a Narcotics Anonymous group, and in \"Off the Record\" and \"Somnium.\"\n\nThe siblings have almost-matching tattoos that pay homage to their family's Eastern European Jewish roots. Their tattoos are written in Yiddish. Nicola's tattoo means \"family first\" while Will's reads \"family.\"\n\n\"I love big families, I love being around my family and all my siblings, it's like, my happy place for me,\" Peltz Beckham told Elle in 2023.\n\nCoachella is known to be stacked with celebrities, so it's no wonder the couple met at the annual California music festival. But they didn't have an instant connection, according to Peltz Beckham.\n\n\"We didn't get along, we just didn't click … I had a boyfriend, he had a girlfriend,\" she told Tatler in 2022.\n\nIt took Beckham — a former model, photographer, chef, and the oldest child of David and Victoria Beckham — and Peltz years to finally get together. They reunited at Leonardo DiCaprio's Halloween party in 2019, Glamour reported, and they were later spotted having a late-night dinner together after the event.\n\n\"I can't tell you what happened [at the party] but from then on we were inseparable,\" Peltz Beckham told Tatler.\n\nBeckham, now 26, and Peltz announced their engagement via Instagram in July 2020. \"Two weeks ago I asked my soulmate to marry me and she said yes,\" he wrote in his caption.\n\n\"I am the luckiest man in the world. I promise to be the best husband and the best daddy one day,\" he continued.\n\nIn January 2021, Beckham debuted a tattoo dedicated to his fiancée — a transcript of a love letter Peltz had written. She signed the letter as \"your future wifey.\"\n\nIn April 2022, the couple got married at the Peltz's family estate in Palm Beach, Florida. At their wedding, they took photos exclusively on flip phones, according to the couple. Elle reported the wedding cost almost $4 million.\n\nBritish Vogue shared photos on Instagram of the bride and groom in their wedding attire. Nicola Peltz Beckham wore a custom Valentino gown for the occasion. She initially hoped to wear a design by her mother-in-law, Victoria Beckham, but ultimately the designer's \"atelier couldn't do it,\" Peltz Beckham told Variety in 2022.\n\nTheir 500-strong guest list included celebrities such as Serena Williams, Eva Longoria, and Gordon Ramsay, People reported.\n\nIn an interview with Elle, Peltz Beckham described newlywed life as \"amazing\" and described Brooklyn as her \"best friend.\"\n\n\"Being able to live life by his side has been amazing, because I feel like even if I'm going through something bad, I have him by my side,\" she said.\n\nThe couple chose to take each other's last names after their wedding, becoming Nicola and Brooklyn Peltz Beckham.\n\nThe couple reportedly lives in Los Angeles.\n\nPeltz Beckham's father officiated the ceremony in August 2025.\n\n\"this day meant so much to us,\" she wrote on Instagram.\n\nAs part of his January 2026 Instagram post about his relationship with his parents, Brooklyn Beckham wrote, \"We wanted to renew our vows so we could create new memories of our wedding day that bring us joy and happiness, not anxiety and embarrassment.\"\n\n\"Brooklyn wants a lot of kids,\" she said, adding, \"Yeah, I would love a big family, really.\"\n\nPeltz Beckham attended her mother-in-law, Victoria Beckham's, Paris Fashion Week show in March 2024. She attended with Brooklyn Beckham, David Beckham, and two of Brooklyn's siblings, Cruz and Harper.\n\n\"congratulations on another beautiful collection @victoriabeckham [red heart emoji] i love watching your vision come to life! love you so much,\" Peltz Beckham wrote on Instagram following the event.\n\nThe family also previously attended the October 2023 premiere of David Beckham's Netflix documentary and the February 2024 premiere of \"Lola.\"\n\nIn a lengthy post on Instagram Stories on January 19, Brooklyn Beckham spoke out amid reports of a rift with his parents, which surfaced after he did not attend his father's 50th birthday in London last year.\n\nWhile Brooklyn Beckham said he has \"made every effort to keep these matters private,\" he said his parents \"and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself.\"\n\nIn his post, he wrote, \"My parents have been trying endlessly to ruin my relationship since before my wedding, and it hasn't stopped.\"\n\nHe said his mother backed out of making Peltz Beckham's wedding dress at the last minute. (Vogue reported in 2022 that the dress Peltz Beckham wore on her wedding day was the result of \"a year's worth of conversations with Valentino creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli's team,\" as well as two meetings in Rome and two fittings in the US.)\n\nBeckham also said in his post that his mother \"hijacked\" his first dance with his wife, which he said left him feeling \"humiliated.\"\n\nHe added, \"The night before our wedding, members of my family told me that Nicola was 'not blood' and 'not family'.\"\n\n\"My wife has been consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one,\" he wrote.\n\nNeither couple has responded to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "You really learn a lot about people when you travel with them. A trip can bring out the best — or the most chaotic — sides of everyone involved, so if it's not planned right, things can go off the rails.\n\nI was reminded of this recently on a trip to Scotland with friends, where I realized that so much of the experience starts long before the plane takes off.\n\nFrom planning and packing to navigating new cities and making group decisions, every step of the journey takes patience, flexibility, and good communication.\n\nStill, despite the stress, traveling together is one of the most rewarding ways to bond. When it's done right, those shared challenges and spontaneous moments can create memories that last a lifetime.\n\nHere are five things I would've done differently on a recent trip with friends.\n\nEarly in the planning process, we started a shared PowerPoint to outline an itinerary and list everyone's interests. However, we didn't consistently update it, so by the time we left, it was only a partial list without details or scheduling.\n\nAs a result, many decisions were made on the spot — calling places from our Airbnb to make reservations or scrambling to buy tickets to Edinburgh Castle, which were sold out for two days in advance.\n\nNext time, I'd use a shared document or spreadsheet to list everyone's top three priorities, then map out out logistics and secure reservations and tickets to any must-see places.\n\nWhen we all arrived at the Airbnb, we took inventory — three hairdryers, three curling irons, and so on. It turned out we were fully equipped to style the hair of all of Scotland.\n\nAlthough we had plenty of tools to go around, it wasn't really necessary. For shareable items like these, it would've been smart to coordinate ahead of time about who's bringing what.\n\nThat way, we could've avoided duplicates and freed up packing space for other items.\n\nThinking about it now, it would've been helpful to delegate responsibilities and have each person in the group take charge of something.\n\nFor example, one person could have been in charge of ordering Ubers, and another could've put their card down for dinners. This also works for non-monetary roles, such as having a designated picture taker or someone in charge of all navigation.\n\nIt takes the pressure off moments when someone needs to step up, keeps things running smoothly, and makes tracking expenses a lot easier.\n\nAfter the trip, my friends and I all had to comb through our bank statements to split shared costs and figure out who owed what.\n\nIt quickly became confusing — international charges were appearing under different names, addresses, and numbers, making it difficult to distinguish between them. It was also hard to identify which transactions had foreign fees attached.\n\nLooking back, we should've tracked expenses in real time whenever someone put their card down. Apps like Splitwise or Settle Up make it easy to log purchases and divide costs fairly.\n\nThat way, nothing gets overlooked and no one ends up paying more than their share.",

    "description": "Dimon warned at Davos that Trump's credit card interest rate cap could harm 80% of  Americans.",
    "fullText": "If President Donald Trump gets his way on credit cards, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon predicts chaos — but more on the streets of American towns than in the walls of his own bank.\n\n\"It would be an economic disaster,\" Dimon said when asked about President Donald Trump's proposed one-year 10% cap on credit card interest rates. \"And I'm not making that up because of our business, we would survive it, by the way. In the worst case, you would have to have a drastic reduction of the credit card business.\"\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon predicted that, if enacted, the cap could strip credit from 80% of Americans. Dimon proposed that the government test the proposal by forcing all the banks in Vermont and Massachusetts to comply, \"and then see what happens,\" causing a ripple of laughter through the audience.\n\n\"The people crying most won't be the credit card companies,\" he said, adding that those hurt will include restaurants, retailers, travel companies, and municipalities, \"because people will miss their water payments.\"\n\nWhatever the president and Congress decide, JPMorgan will \"deal with it,\" Dimon said. He promised that the bank would provide more extensive analysis of the potential effects, and said that he, too, wants greater affordability.\n\nDimon struck a largely conciliatory tone when asked about some of Trump's geopolitical moves — immigration and NATO, for example — which he called \"more qualitative, how it's going to work, what are the pieces, what's their intent.\" But he said he understands the card issue deeply and has a responsibility, of sorts, to speak up.\n\nDimon, like many other big-bank CEOs and business leaders, has previously said that reducing card interest rates could harm customers with lower credit scores. JPMorgan's CFO warned during the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call last week that enacting price controls could \"make it no longer a good business.\"",

    "description": "Nicknamed the \"flying Oval Office,\" modern Air Force One planes are equipped with everything the president might need.",
    "fullText": "Nicknamed the \"flying Oval Office,\" Air Force One has long functioned as the president's flying command center, office, and private quarters.\n\nSince the mid-20th century, US presidents have flown on special planes designated \"Air Force One\" while carrying out their official duties.\n\nThe modern Air Force One is equipped with everything the president might need, including office spaces, two kitchens, a stateroom with sleeping quarters, and a fully functional operating room.\n\nA new Air Force One jet, a Boeing 747-8 donated by the Qatari royal family and accepted by President Donald Trump in May, could bring a new level of luxury to the presidential plane.\n\nHere's how the design of Air Force One has changed through the years.\n\nNicknamed \"Sacred Cow,\" the aircraft operated from 1944 to 1961, flying Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman.\n\nIt featured an elevator shaft for Roosevelt's wheelchair, an executive conference room with a bulletproof window, and an electric refrigerator, which was a rare luxury for planes built in the 1940s.\n\nEisenhower's Boeing 707 Stratoliner, nicknamed \"Queenie,\" featured a section for telecommunications, room for 40 passengers, a conference area, and a stateroom.\n\nSAM 26000, a customized and modified version of a civilian 707-320B airliner, was known as a Boeing VC-137C. It included a living room, bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen.\n\nThe plane's design featured an American flag on the tail and presidential seals on the nose.\n\nIt marked the first and only time a presidential swearing-in ceremony took place on an airplane.\n\nThe small alcove was decorated with a globe decal on the wall and curtains lining the windows.\n\nNixon stood behind the plane's bar while meeting with military and civilian leaders en route to Vietnam.\n\nPresidents would occasionally make their way back to the rear cabin to chat with reporters.\n\nFord is pictured with Candice Bergen, the first female photographer to shoot a behind-the-scenes story on an American president.\n\nCarter talked to reporters on his way back from a trip to Europe in 1978.\n\nIn 1983, Reagan met with Secretary of State George P. Shultz and the national-security advisor designate Robert McFarlane in a meeting space that featured a magazine rack, teal chair, wood-grain table, and photos of him and the first lady, Nancy Reagan.\n\nThe photos showed Reagan toasting with a champagne glass and waving while boarding Air Force One.\n\nThe meeting room also included a television set.\n\nThe presidential office was updated with a stately desk, gray carpeting, and leather chairs.\n\nThe staff area featured plenty of phones for official business. Air Force One is also known as the \"flying Oval Office.\"\n\nThe annex is pictured in executive configuration, with seating for meetings.\n\nClinton met with a delegation from North and South Dakota in 1997 to address flooding in the area.\n\nClinton met with members of Congress to discuss nuclear-waste management in 1999.\n\nThe plane flew 444 missions and logged over 1 million miles, according to the Bush White House.\n\nBush insisted on returning to Washington, but the Secret Service refused since they were unsure if more attacks were coming.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Politico, Bush's assistant White House press secretary Gordon Johndroe described Air Force One that day as \"the safest and most dangerous place in the world at the exact same time.\"\n\nThe president's suite included a small bed, a couch and carpeting in light pink, and a desk with a brown leather chair.\n\nThe hallway was lined with a beige couch with side tables and lamps on either side.\n\nObama met with his chief of staff, Jack Lew, his senior advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe, and former President Bill Clinton in the senior staff room in 2012.\n\nThe carpeting was updated to a subtle star pattern, which also appeared in the conference room.\n\nThe chairs featured a subtle polka-dot pattern, and the tables folded down to make more space.\n\nJournalists can wander the rear cabin freely, but they aren't allowed to walk forward to speak to the president — the president has to come back to them.\n\nAs part of the Air Force's Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program to update Air Force One planes, Trump proposed a red, white, and navy-blue color scheme for the new models.\n\nInstead, President Joe Biden selected a baby-blue color scheme similar to the current model.\n\nThe new VC-25B Air Force One planes are expected to be ready by 2027, according to the Air Force. The long-delayed project has already cost Boeing over $2 billion due to various manufacturing and supply-chain issues.\n\nTrump signed a proclamation establishing the name change in his Air Force One office in February.\n\nThe luxurious plane previously functioned as a Qatari private business jet. It features a large primary bedroom with loveseats and an en-suite bathroom, guest bedrooms, office space, a dining room, and a salon lounge with plush couches.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a May briefing that the Qatari royal family donated the jumbo jet to the US Air Force and that it was being \"retrofitted to the highest standards\" to serve as Air Force One. Some estimates have put the cost of upgrading the jet for the office of the president at $1 billion, but the US Air Force secretary said in June it will cost less than $400 million to retrofit.\n\nTrump, who has pressured Boeing to deliver its new Air Force One planes sooner and criticized the project's \"failure\" to complete them on time, said he'd be \"stupid\" to turn down the Qatari plane, worth an estimated $400 million. In July, he said the plane could be ready as soon as February 2026.\n\nAfter departing to Davos for the World Economic Forum on Tuesday night, Air Force One returned to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland shortly after takeoff.\n\nLeavitt told reporters that the crew identified \"a minor electrical issue\" after takeoff and returned to the airport out of an abundance of caution.\n\nTrump then boarded a C-32, a militarized Boeing 757 jet often used for flights into smaller airports.\n\nLeavitt also joked about the Qatari Air Force One jet sounding \"much better.\"",

    "description": "Business Insider looked at Census Bureau data to see the top US imports from Germany, Denmark, and the other countries that could face new tariffs.",
    "fullText": "A trade war between the US and Europe is heating up as President Donald Trump demands American control over Greenland.\n\nGermany, the Netherlands, Finland, and France are four of the eight European countries that could face new tariffs once February kicks off. Trump made the tariff threats after those countries sent troops to Greenland earlier in January.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said he will levy a new 10% tariff in February on imports from those countries, set to jump to 25% in June \"to protect Global Peace and Security\" because these countries \"have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown\" and \"have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.\" Trump added that the tariffs will be in effect until a deal to buy Greenland is reached.\n\nThat new round of tariffs could affect a slew of goods, with medicine and cars leading the way. The US imported a total of $365 billion in goods from the eight targeted countries in 2024. That included about $44 billion in pharmaceutical preparations and nearly $40 billion in new or used passenger cars. Some other main imports included aircraft, industrial engines, and toiletries and cosmetics.\n\n\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,\" the countries said in a joint statement. \"We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response.\"\n\nTrump continues to insist the US acquire Greenland, but said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday that he won't use force to do so.\n\n\"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable, but I won't do that,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump briefly addressed high housing costs and interest rates in his Davos speech but did not get into specifics.",
    "fullText": "After making his case to acquire Greenland, President Donald Trump celebrated his own achievements and elaborated on his plans to address the high cost of housing in the US during his hourlong speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday.\n\n\"Homeownership has always been a symbol of health and vigor of American society, but that goal fell out of reach for millions and millions of people in the Biden era because interest rates went up so high,\" Trump said. \"Today, I'm taking action to bring back this bedrock of the American dream.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's proposals have included banning \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes, purchasing $200 billion of mortgage debt to reduce mortgage interest rates, introducing 50-year mortgages and portable home loans, and allowing homebuyers to use their 401(k)s to make a down payment.\n\n\"In 2024, the US built less than two million new homes,\" Trump said, adding that Biden admitted eight million new migrants. \"Those days are over.\"\n\nBut industry watchers and housing policy researchers say the fundamental driver of high housing costs is a shortage of homes — and there isn't a quick fix. Building enough housing to accommodate demand in markets across the US will take many years and require significant action on the state and local levels.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Tuesday cracking down on major investors in homes and asked Congress to pass legislation banning \"large institutional investors\" from buying houses.\n\n\"Homes are built for people, not for corporations, and America will not become a nation of renters,\" Trump said in Davos.\n\nMajor investors, including hedge funds and private equity firms, own hundreds of thousands of single-family homes around the US, which has raised concerns that Wall Street-backed groups are outcompeting individual homebuyers, especially first-time buyers, and driving up home prices.\n\nBut these mega landlords own only about 2% of the single-family rental housing stock, according to a 2024 analysis by the GAO. And since 2022, they've slowed their purchasing as interest rates have spiked and home prices have remained high. The evidence isn't particularly strong that big investors charge more than smaller landlords, or that they outcompete other buyers.\n\nJenny Schuetz, vice president of housing at Arnold Ventures, previously told Business Insider that the lack of homes in markets across the country is \"number one, two, and three on the list of problems.\" She called a potential ban \"a red herring\" that \"distracts attention from things that actually could be helpful in improving affordability and increasing supply.\"\n\nIn Truth Social posts earlier this month, Trump announced that he had ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds to drive down mortgage interest rates. Mortgage rates have since fallen. But industry experts said the impact of the move would likely be somewhat short-term and overshadowed by the ongoing housing shortage and moves by the Federal Reserve.\n\nTrump didn't provide further details on a plan at Davos, which was teased last week, that would enable Americans to pull from their 401(k)s to make a down payment on a home.\n\nThe proposal was first announced by Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, on Fox Business last week. \"Suppose that you put 10% down on a home, and then you take 10% of the equity of the home and put it in as an asset in your 401(k). Then your 401(k) will grow over time,\" Hassett told the network.\n\nMona Mahajan, head of investment strategy at Edward Jones, said at the time that the plan may be a good step in the right direction if it gets people thinking about diversifying their asset classes and investing earlier in their careers and home ownership journeys.\n\nUnder current tax code rules, first-time homebuyers have to pay a 10% penalty on withdrawing money before the age of 59 ½ from a 401(k) for a home purchase, with the exception of hardship withdrawals or disability reasons. Over the past few years, Congress has allowed people subject to natural disasters and terminal illnesses to withdraw money from their 401(k)s without penalties.\n\nFor IRAs, they can draw up to $10,000 penalty-free but have to pay income tax.\n\nFinancial experts often discourage people from taking out 401(k) loans for reasons such as a home purchase, as doing so could lead to lost growth opportunities, though workers who do so pay themselves with interest.\n\nIt's unclear whether this plan could have legs in Congress, as it would likely require changes to the tax code.\n\nAnother set of ideas that Trump didn't expand on in Davos involves changes to mortgages themselves.\n\nIn November 2025, Trump and the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, said the administration was exploring a 50-year mortgage option and ways buyers can lock in low interest rates from older mortgages.\n\nThe idea of a half-century-old mortgage has been widely criticized by housing economists, who argue that while 50-year loans would mean lower monthly payments, they would entail much higher interest costs for homeowners over the life of the loan and a much longer road to building equity.\n\nPulte also said the administration was \"actively evaluating\" so-called portable mortgages. These loans would enable homeowners to take their mortgage interest rate with them to a new property.\n\nHousing economists warn that legalizing portable loans could give homeowners who are lucky enough to have an existing mortgage with a low rate an even bigger advantage over first-time homebuyers and others. The dynamic could also drive home prices up by empowering repeat buyers to spend more.\n\n\"Financing is not the solution,\" Kara Ng, a senior economist at Zillow, previously told Business Insider. \"We're in this affordability crisis because there's a housing shortage, so changing the loan terms, having different financing products — it doesn't change the fact there aren't enough homes to go around.\"",

    "fullText": "Meeting a pair of English friends for a meal during our vacation in my native UK this past summer, it struck me how easily the conversation flowed.\n\nEven though we live in America and see the couple around once a year, we pick off where we left off and have a great time.\n\nThey once made an eight-hour round-trip in one day for lunch with us near the cottage we had rented.\n\nWe've known them since long before my husband and me got married. Yet, we subtly uninvited them to our wedding in New York City. Why? We'd heard they wanted to bring their young sons along. And we said \"no.\"\n\nMy then fiancé and I decided that the only children who could attend were blood relatives. At the time, we assumed that other people's offspring would be a distraction, especially if they misbehaved.\n\nWe also wanted to keep the costs down.\n\nOur strict policy applied to a former colleague in England with three school-age kids. \"I can't imagine going to another country — let alone another continent — without them,\" he responded.\n\nI was somewhat offended. If he couldn't make it, perhaps we weren't as close as I'd thought.\n\nThe big day came. Two of my husband's nieces were bridesmaids, and another was the flower girl. The boys were ring bearers and ushers.\n\nIt was a special event. The children made everyone laugh with their moves on the dance floor. My nephew did the moonwalk and the electric slide.\n\nTheir presence added to the occasion. \"How much did they charge for the entertainment?\" a witty friend joked.\n\nA couple of years later, by then a first-time mom, I was invited to the wedding of a very good friend. Like us, the couple hadn't invited kids, except for the groom's two nieces.\n\nI was still nursing, but there was no way I was going to miss the celebration. My sister watched my daughter at her home, a 45-mile drive from the venue.\n\nThe wedding was gorgeous, but I couldn't help worrying about my little one as I listened to the speeches and raised a glass to the couple. What if she cried all the time? Was my sister tearing her hair out? I called several times out of concern.\n\nMy fears were irrational, I know. Still, they felt real to me. We left the lively reception early to pick up our child.\n\nThe experience made me think. I finally understood why our friends who were parents had declined our wedding invitation. They hadn't felt comfortable leaving their kids behind.\n\nI'm not planning to get married again anytime soon — it's been 18 years, and I'm still happy with the man I chose. However, if I had a do-over, I'd invite all my friends' children. Their presence — and that of their moms and dads — would have made our day even more special than it was.\n\nI haven't had the guts to apologize to the families whose children we banned. To their credit, they've never let it affect our relationship. Gracious friends, indeed.",

    "fullText": "The \"Sell America\" trade could get worse if global investors are further shaken by Donald Trump's latest tariff threats.\n\nKatie Koch, a former partner at Goldman Sachs and the CEO of the $200 billion asset manager TCW Group, said she thinks investors could be on the verge of \"quiet quitting\" the US bond market.\n\nThat's because many foreign investors feel they're overexposed to the US and are wary of some of the President's new policies — like Trump's threat to slap a 10% tariff on European nations if Greenland isn't up for sale within the next few weeks, she suggested, citing her conversations with other asset managers at the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe shift away from the US could happen quietly, Koch said, as investors looking to unwind their positions won't \"scream it from the rooftops.\"\n\n\"I think we're going to see some quiet quitting of the US bond market, and that I'm worried about,\" Koch said, speaking to CNBC on the sidelines at Davos Tuesday. \"I expect that investors will continue to look to diversify,\" she later added.\n\n\"Sell America\" has been a lingering concern for investors over the past year as markets have taken in Trump's ambitious tariff and geopolitical plans. The worry is that policy uncertainty and fears of higher inflation and rising deficits could cause more investors to dump US assets, a move that, in the bond market, could cause rates to rise as a higher yield is needed to entice investors.\n\nMarkets already saw a \"Sell USA\" day on Tuesday, Koch said, referring to the steep sell-off in US equities and government bonds as investors sought to reduce their exposure to the US. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield, a reflection of long-term interest rates in the economy, jumped 5 basis points.\n\nBonds from countries like Japan, Europe, and various emerging markets now look more attractive for bond investors than US Treasurys, Koch added.\n\nOther market commentators have their eye on how the bond market could react to Trump's policy changes. Bond vigilantes — investors who protest what they see as negative developments in the market by selling Treasurys to drive up yields — threw a major tantrum about the president's Liberation Day tariffs last year, a move that ultimately prompted Trump to walk back many of his tariff threats.\n\nA bigger sell-off in Treasurys could be prompted if the \"sell America\" gains more traction, Capital Economics said in a note on Wednesday.\n\n\"The administration's goal is to have lower interest rates to aid US households and businesses, which is hard to achieve if bond vigilantes send rates on the long-end of the yield curve higher,\" Hardika Singh, an economic strategist at Fundstrat Research, wrote in a client note.",

    "description": "Business leaders and CEOs weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders such as Ken Griffin and Matthew Prince have already weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that he will not use force to get Greenland, but is \"seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition\" by the US.\n\nTrump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been dominating this year's Davos agenda.\n\nAll eyes were on Trump during his 70-minute-long speech, with billionaire CEOs — including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff — alongside heads of state filling up Congress Hall to hear what he had to say.\n\nHere is how some of the world's biggest business leaders have reacted:\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday, Citadel's CEO and founder Ken Griffin said Trump had an \"important message to deliver to a European audience that, bluntly, needs to do better. Europe's economic growth lags far behind America.\"\n\n\"The commitment of the American people to defend our country runs deep. The commitment of the Europeans to defend their countries — if you look at surveys of the population — is not nearly as strong,\" he added.\n\nGriffin said he thought one of Trump's \"important foundational statements he made with respect to the justification why the US needs unfettered access to Greenland\" was whether Europe would be there for the US if there was another war.\n\nHowever, Griffin said that if the US does decide to \"pursue this path\", discussions \"should take time and be thoughtfully laid out.\"\n\n\"Investors around the world do not want to see an escalation of the stress in global trade that has played out over the last 12 months,\" the Citadel CEO added.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, said it looked like \"cooler heads prevailed at the White House.\"\n\n\"So if the US can't buy Greenland instead of taking it by military force, Trump will just hold a grudge,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\n\"While that is a major improvement, it also means that if we do succeed in buying Greenland, we'll massively overpay.\"\n\nSchiff also warned on X that a housing \"crash is coming.\"\n\n\"Trump basically admitted there is a housing bubble in the US. He also admitted his main policy goal is to prevent it from popping,\" Schiff wrote.\n\n\"But once you recognize a bubble, the worst thing you can do is try to sustain it. The sooner it bursts, the less damage it will ultimately cause.\"\n\nCloudflare's CEO appears to have commented on Trump's speech style.\n\n\"Last two times Trump spoke at Davos he stuck extremely close to the teleprompter. Not this time,\" Prince wrote on X.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Money Movers on Wednesday, the founder and executive chair of investment bank Moelis & Company, Ken Moelis, said he thought Trump \"made a very good case\" for a deal over Greenland.\n\n\"There was a real sigh of relief that he took military action off the table with Greenland. With President Trump, it's unusual for him to ever take an option off the table, so that was a big sigh of relief,\" he said.\n\nMoelis described Greenland as \"probably the biggest M&A deal in the history of the world\" and criticized Europe's approach to energy policy.\n\n\"You have to look at Europe and say their choices on energy policy have put them in the position they're in right now which is fairly weak economically and in a global position. And I thought he made a very good case for that,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI has laid out some ambitious plans for 2026, but according to George Noble, the ChatGPT maker is a cautionary tale for the wider AI theme.\n\nThe hedge fund investor and former director of the Fidelity Overseas Fund doesn't think the AI startup will be able to justify its lofty growth projections, but more than that, he thinks investors should avoid the AI trade and shift their focus to other areas of the market before the tide turns.\n\nThe hedge fund founder laid out his thesis on OpenAI's red flags in a detailed X post on Tuesday, highlighting the \"code red\" moment announced by CEO Sam Altman in December 2025.\n\nIn his view, it all comes down to financials, specifically a math problem that isn't being widely discussed. \n\n\"It's going to cost 5x the energy and money to make these models 2x better,\" he said. \"The low-hanging fruit is gone. Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more compute, more data centers, more power.\"\n\nNoble thinks OpenAI's annual revenue has to reach $200 billion by 2030 in order for the company's projections to be justified.\n\nPointing to the broader market, he advised AI startup founders to exit their companies while the boom is still going, adding that he believes the AI hype cycle is nearing its peak. He thinks investors should shift their focus to other parts of the market, as both the AI trade and the Magnificent Seven will be impacted if OpenAI begins to struggle.\n\n\"If you're exposed to the Magnificent 7 through AI infrastructure bets, consider trimming,\" he advised. \"The smart money is rotating into sectors where valuations actually reflect fundamentals.\"\n\nThe particular sector in this case is small-mid cap stocks, which is where Noble sees real value and growth potential. He added that there is a value disconnect between Big Tech stocks and their small-cap peers, which are trading at near-decade lows.\n\nFor that reason, Noble sees an opportunity for investors to move away from the most crowded stocks that carried the AI trade in 2025 and focus on the lesser-known value plays that have been quietly making progress while AI-linked names continue to dominate the headlines.\n\n\"Markets can price risk,\" he noted. \"But they can't price chaos.\nAnd OpenAI is chaos dressed up in a $500 billion valuation.\"",

    "fullText": "On NATO's front line, Finland's president says his country is ready for a Russian attack, regardless of whether it has US support.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Alexander Stubb said in response to a question of whether the Finnish military can effectively defend itself against a Russian attack: \"Yes, we can.\"\n\nHe pointed to Finland's mandatory conscription, which sets it apart from many other NATO members, and said that the country can mobilize 280,000 soldiers in a matter of weeks.\n\n\"We have the biggest artillery in Europe together with Poland. We have long-range missiles, land, sea, and air,\" he added. He joked that Finland did not procure these because it was worried about allies like neighboring Sweden: \"We don't have this because we're worried about Stockholm.\"\n\nFor Finland, a relatively new NATO ally, the key security concern has long been Russia, with which it shares a roughly 800-mile border. The two fought bitter wars during World War II, though they have not engaged in armed conflict for decades.\n\nStubb also highlighted Finland's air power, including its 62 F-18s and its recent purchase of 64 F-35s. Those are US-made aircraft, manufactured by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, respectively. To keep the aircraft operational, a certain degree of US support is needed. The Finnish president said he was confident that it would continue.\n\nSpeaking with the moderator at his Davos panel, he said: \"Your next question is going to be, do they fly without Americans? No, they don't. But do we trust that they will continue to fly because it's in the interest of America to do so? Yes.\"\n\nStubbs also said that Finland has the \"biggest Arctic force in the alliance.\"\n\nFinland is one of NATO's newest allies. It joined in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and it is one of many European countries warning that Russia could ignite a wider war in Europe. These concerns have been strongest among front-line allies, with the Baltic nations regularly calling for greater efforts to strengthen defenses.\n\nFinland's military was built with Russia as a threat in mind, giving it an edge that some other allies don't have. It remains on guard. For instance, Stubb said Finland's power also comes from its focus on civilian preparations.\n\n\"I think we also have to understand that you fight wars on the battlefield, but you win them at home.\"\n\n\"That's why we have civilian shelters for 4.4 million Fins. That's why we have a security of supply where we don't get into any kind of trouble with food shortages, energy shortages, or electricity grids.\" He described this as a \"capability that a lot of European states need to do.\"\n\nStill, he was bullish on European capabilities. \"Can Europe defend itself? My answer is unequivocally, yes,\" he said.\n\nHe was also optimistic about NATO relations despite new tensions over the US pursuit of the Danish territory of Greenland.\n\nAsked if Europe needs the potential to defend itself against the US, he responded: \"No. I mean, come on, let's not push the hypotheticals here. Let's get back to the reality of the situation and let's put it back into perspective.\"\n\nHe also rejected the idea that NATO could dissolve over these tensions, saying, \"I think actually we're in the process of creating a stronger NATO than we have seen since the end of the Cold War.\"",

    "title": "Solopreneurs are embracing AI — here's how 3 career coaches have found it indispensable",
    "description": "AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude help solopreneur coaches Kim Surko, Katharine Campbell Hirst, and Liz Morrison boost client outcomes and streamline coaching workflows.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to career and executive coaching, some of the most important work happens in one-on-one sessions with the client. That's when breakthrough insights often emerge, motivation gains momentum, and coaches build an essential connection.\n\nThen comes the hard part: turning those words into actions.\n\nTranscribing conversations into meaningful action items for clients takes time and effort — something a team of assistants could easily handle. However, when you're the only person running your business, that time and effort leaves coaching solopreneurs with a difficult tradeoff: take notes during sessions and sacrifice presence, spend hours after each call transcribing insights from recordings, or leave follow-through entirely to clients.\n\n\"Trying to juggle it all on my own wasn't an option — it was just impossible to build a sustainable business,\" said Kim Surko, founder of leadership coaching business Surko Coaching, regarding how easy it was to feel overwhelmed by work that felt more administrative than transformational. \"Leaning into AI was the most natural solution to help with all of that responsibility.\"\n\nHere's how three solopreneurs in leadership, business, and communications have used AI to help clients achieve more results in less time, expanding their capacity as coaches while increasing the value of the work they offer.\n\nFor all three coaches, the biggest game changer has been using AI note-takers to distill long conversations into something more tangible.\n\nAfter getting client consent, \"I record my coaching sessions and upload transcripts into ChatGPT. This allows me to rapidly transform nuanced insights from our conversations into concrete outputs clients can actually use — pitches, résumés, website copy, positioning statements, and more,\" said Katharine Campbell Hirst, founder of business coaching company KCH Coaching & Advisory. \"What used to take weeks of agonizing refinement now takes minutes.\"\n\nLiz Morrison, founder of communications coaching company LM Strategic Storytelling, appreciates how AI ensures that valuable sound bites from her coaching sessions don't get lost in hours of recordings that nobody has time to revisit. She's built custom projects in Claude to help her transform session transcripts into \"Story Banks\" in minutes — pulling out three to six narratives per session that clients can use immediately for interviews, networking, social media, and building their businesses.\n\nWhile this type of work was essential before AI, doing it as a solopreneur meant sacrificing time that could be spent supporting other clients. \"I've saved almost an hour per client per day by relying on AI to take notes and summarize them for me,\" said Surko, who added that she nearly doubled her capacity for coaching clients with AI's support.\n\nSurko has also used AI to help her clients appreciate the progress they're making, improving the feeling of momentum. \"A lot of work with coaching is celebrating the small wins,\" she said.\n\nUsing the project management tool Kanbanchi, supported by Gemini, Surko can quickly update to-do list boards that lay out all of the client's goals and achievements.\n\n\"Having that visual representation of the progress we're making shows the value of coaching,\" Surko said. The process has been extremely valuable, as it has improved her client renewal rate because clients can see exactly how they're getting closer to a goal, rather than feeling like they aren't making progress, she added.\n\nMorrison tells a similar story. She built a custom ChatGPT tool called Story Explorer that walks prospective clients through a story-coaching exercise to uncover one immediately usable story they can post on LinkedIn or use in a networking conversation.\n\n\"I find when I give people this builder, it's the start of a much bigger conversation,\" she said. They often uncover other narratives they want to explore further with Morrison, she said.\n\nAlongside the benefit of being more present during conversations, these coaches have found AI valuable for improving their in-session coaching in other ways.\n\nSurko, for example, used Gemini within Google Docs to create a searchable archive of the massive toolkit of exercises and prompts she's collected in her decadeslong career, which before were buried in various folders.\n\nPreviously, she would have to wait until after the session to hunt down an exercise. Now, she can quickly pull them up during sessions and dive deeper with a client. \"We make more progress in each session,\" she said of this improvement. \"We're able to continue that momentum.\"\n\nAI can even be a helpful coach for these coaching experts.\n\nHirst uploaded transcripts across her client's full arc and asked where she did well and where she could have improved. While she also works with coaches, she appreciates that AI can effectively be over her shoulder all the time.\n\n\"The feedback is surprisingly concrete, pattern-based, and immediately actionable — effectively giving me a reflective practice partner I wouldn't otherwise have access to as a solopreneur,\" Hirst said.",

    "description": "Dolly Parton isn't just a legendary musician and fashion icon — she's also a great chef. Her delicious cornbread recipe is ready in just 30 minutes.",
    "fullText": "On top of being a legendary musician and fashion icon, Dolly Parton is also a great chef.\n\nThe country-music star has shared plenty of her cooking secrets with me, including her hack for making the fluffiest scrambled eggs and the unique ingredient she uses to elevate her mac and cheese.\n\nParton also revealed what she loves whipping up in the kitchen for her goddaughter, Miley Cyrus.\n\n\"Miley and I both love Southern food like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and a big ol' hunk of cornbread — making cornbread muffins or a big pan of it with the squares,\" Parton told me.\n\nI loved trying Parton's Taco Bell order. So when I stumbled on her cornbread recipe, I knew I had to give it a go.\n\nInstead of cooking full bacon strips, I cut the bacon into small pieces and spread them out in my 9-inch skillet so they would render evenly.\n\nI cooked my bacon over medium-low heat until it turned crispy and I could see plenty of drippings at the bottom of the pan. Then, I removed the pieces, letting them rest on a plate lined with a paper towel. Parton said the skillet should be covered with extra bacon drippings, so I didn't wipe it clean after I finished cooking.\n\nYou could easily whip up Parton's recipe after you've made breakfast, or save the bacon to eat alongside her cornbread. Either way, it's a win-win.\n\nFirst, I added two cups of the self-rising cornmeal to a large bowl.\n\nThe first recipe I found online actually called for two tablespoons of bacon drippings instead of two teaspoons. I didn't realize Parton's recipe was different before I made the cornbread again, so I accidentally added extra.\n\nThe flavor still came out great, so feel free to add more bacon drippings if you wish.\n\nParton recommends gradually adding the buttermilk while stirring everything with a wooden spoon. You'll know the batter is ready when it's thick but smooth.\n\nBarely 10 minutes of prep had passed, and my cornbread was ready to go into the oven.\n\nI threw my skillet into the oven at 425 degrees Fahrenheit and let it cook for 25 minutes. Parton says you'll know the cornbread is ready if it springs back when you tap it.",

    "description": "Brooklyn Beckham said he has no plans to reconcile with his family amid an ongoing feud between him and his parents.",
    "fullText": "Brooklyn Beckham is setting the record straight on where he stands with his famous family.\n\nThe eldest son of Spice Girl turned fashion designer Victoria Beckham and soccer legend David Beckham, Brooklyn, shared a lengthy Instagram statement on Monday that shared how he feels about what he described as his parents' lack of support for his marriage to Nicola Peltz Beckham.\n\n\"I have been controlled by my parents for most of my life,\" Brooklyn wrote. \"I grew up with overwhelming anxiety. For the first time in my life, since stepping away from my family, that anxiety has disappeared.\"\n\nRepresentatives for David and Victoria Beckham, and for Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz Beckham, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHere's a complete timeline of the feud between Brooklyn Beckham and his family.\n\nBrooklyn Beckham, 26, is the eldest child of Victoria and David Beckham, the fashion designer and sports legend who are, by all accounts, pop culture royalty.\n\nNicola Peltz, 31, now Nicola Peltz Beckham, is the daughter of billionaire Nelson Peltz, who made his fortune as the founder of investment firm Trian Fund Management. He is worth $1.6 billion, according to Forbes. She\n\nBeckham, a model and photographer, and Peltz, also a model and actor, met at Coachella in 2017. The pair reconnected at Leonardo DiCaprio's Halloween party two years later and ended the night with a late-night dinner. After that, they began dating.\n\nAfter less than a year of dating, Beckham announced on his social media that the pair were engaged. He proposed with a custom diamond ring.\n\n\"Two weeks ago I asked my soulmate to marry me, and she said yes,\" he wrote in his Instagram caption. \"I am the luckiest man in the world. I promise to be the best husband and the best daddy one day.\"\n\nBoth the Beckham and Peltz families publicly expressed their happiness, including Victoria.\n\n\"We could not be happier that @brooklynbeckham and @nicolaannepeltz are getting married! Wishing you so much love and a lifetime of happiness,\" Victoria wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of the newly engaged couple.\n\nDavid Beckham and Brooklyn's brothers, Romeo and Cruz, also offered their congratulations, People reported.\n\nAt the time, the engagement was widely seen as a blending of two high-profile families with no visible signs of tension.\n\nBrooklyn and Nicola tied the knot in April 2022 at the Peltz family's Palm Beach estate in a celebration that Elle estimated cost almost $4 million.\n\nPeltz wore a custom Valentino gown for the occasion, which was \"the culmination of a year's worth of conversations with Valentino,\" Vogue reported.\n\nHowever, Peltz also told Variety that she had originally hoped to wear a design by her mother-in-law-to-be, but was unable to do so because her \"atelier couldn't do it,\" she told Variety in August 2022.\n\nAfter Peltz did not wear a Victoria Beckham gown, rumors swirled of a potential family feud.\n\nAfter their wedding, the pair both changed their last names to Peltz Beckham.\n\nPeltz Beckham told Variety that rumors of a family feud appeared to have started after she wore the Valentino gown on her wedding day, but she dispelled any deeper meaning or tension with her mother-in-law.\n\n\"She didn't say you can't wear it; I didn't say I didn't want to wear it. That's where it started, and then they ran with that,\" she said.\n\nHer husband also denied any tension at the time, saying, \"I've learned they're always going to try to write stuff like that. They're always going to try and put people down. But everyone gets along, which is good.\"\n\nIn a late 2022 interview with Grazia Magazine, Peltz Beckham also negated any rift with her husband's family, calling them \"great in-laws.\"\n\nThe family put on a united front for the cameras at the UK premiere of \"Beckham,\" Victoria and David's Netflix documentary, in October 2023.\n\nAll four of the Beckham children — Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper — were in attendance, as well as Romeo Beckham's then-girlfriend, Mia Regan, and Nicola Peltz Beckham.\n\nThe Peltz Beckhams have been frequent attendees of Victoria's fashion shows over the years.\n\nThe pair were seen smiling and supporting his mother's design endeavors at her Spring/Summer 2025 fashion show in Paris in September 2024.\n\nMost notably, she wasn't spotted at Victoria Beckham's 50th birthday celebration in London in April 2024.\n\nHer absence stood out given the scale and public nature of the event, fueling speculation about lingering tensions within the family.\n\nHowever, the actor shared on Instagram that she had spent the day with her grandmother and wished her mother-in-law a happy birthday.\n\nAt the time, People, citing a source, reported that the pair skipped the family celebration because they didn't want to attend alongside Brooklyn's younger brother, Romeo Beckham, and his girlfriend, Kim Turnbull, with whom Brooklyn was linked in the past.\n\nAnother source cited \"tensions\" in the family and said that David Beckham was told to choose between having Kim and Nicola at the celebration, and ultimately decided to side with Romeo and Kim in the dispute.\n\nIn August 2025, Brooklyn and Nicola renewed their wedding vows in a romantic, intimate ceremony at Nicola's father's estate in Westchester County, New York.\n\nNone of Brooklyn's immediate family attended the ceremony.\n\nIn a series of posts on his Instagram story in January 2026, Brooklyn detailed the ongoing dispute with his parents and made several accusations against them, including that they put the family brand over \"family love\" and that his mother had pulled out of making his wife's wedding dress at the \"eleventh hour.\"\n\n\"I have been silent for years and have made every attempt to keep these matters private. Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed,\" he wrote.\"I do not want to reconcile with my family. I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life.\"\n\nHe also said that his mother hijacked his first dance with Nicola at their 2022 wedding, saying that she \"danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone,\" adding that he had \"never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life.\"\n\nIn response to the couple's absence from David Beckham's 50th birthday party, Brooklyn said they made multiple attempts to spend time with his father while in London, but were refused unless it was at the large party \"with a hundred guests and cameras at every corner.\"\n\n\"When he finally agreed to see me, it was under the condition that Nicola wasn't invited,\" Brooklyn wrote.\n\nBrooklyn said that his parents told him they did not consider his wife, Nicola, to be \"family,\" and alleged that they made repeated efforts to involve women from his past in his life after he began dating her.\n\nAppearing on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" podcast a day later in January 2026, David Beckham addressed the impact of social media on mental health following his son, Brooklyn's, statement.\n\nAlthough not speaking directly about the statement, he said his children have \"made mistakes,\" while emphasizing both the positive and negative power of social media, People reported.\n\n\"They make mistakes, but children are allowed to make mistakes. That is how they learn. That is what I try to teach my kids,\" he said. \"You sometimes have to let them make those mistakes as well.\"",

    "title": "4 key takeaways from Donald Trump's speech at Davos",
    "description": "President Donald Trump used his Davos address to press for US control of Greenland, defend tariffs, and frame global politics as a contest of power.",
    "fullText": "It was a speech that was never going to fly under the radar.\n\nPresident Donald Trump used his Davos address on Wednesday to press his case for US control of Greenland, criticize what he described as Europe's economic decline, and outline a series of domestic and global policy priorities — from tariffs and credit card rates to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe speech came after Trump's flight to Davos was delayed following a midair turnaround of Air Force One due to a \"minor electrical issue\" and a transatlantic flight on a backup jet.\n\nIt also came amid mounting backlash from European leaders, rattled markets, and warnings of retaliation that could hit America's biggest economic advantages.\n\nHere are the four biggest takeaways from Trump's remarks:\n\nTrump devoted a significant portion of his speech to Greenland, saying that the US does not plan to use military force and adding that no other country can secure the territory.\n\n\"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force, Trump said.\"\n\nAt the same time, he framed US control of Greenland as essential to global security and openly criticized America's allies.\n\n\"All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,\" Trump said.\n\n\"No nation or a group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States.\"\n\nTrump said US ownership would benefit NATO, even as he questioned the alliance's reliability.\n\n\"This would greatly enhance the security of the entire NATO alliance,\" he said, adding: \"We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly returned to tariffs as a central tool of leverage, describing them as a way to get other countries to change behavior.\n\n\"Instead of raising taxes on domestic producers, we're lowering them and raising tariffs on foreign nations,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added that tariffs have enabled him to secure concessions that would not have been possible otherwise.\n\n\"Without tariffs, I wouldn't have been able to get it done,\" he said.\n\nAt one point, he described his negotiating style in blunt terms, telling the audience that when tariffs are on the table, the message to other countries is simple: \"You're going to do it fast.\"\n\nTrump used some of his most emotive language when discussing energy policy, particularly renewable power.\n\nHe dismissed green policies as \"the Green New Scam\" in reference to the EU's Green New Deal and called it \"perhaps the greatest hoax in history,\" adding that wind turbines ruin landscapes while losing money.\n\n\"Windmills all over the place destroy your land,\" Trump said.\"Stupid people buy them.\"\n\nHe also accused China of profiting from renewable energy by manufacturing windmills for export while relying on other energy sources at home, suggesting Beijing sells green technology it does not fully embrace itself.\n\nTrump said that parts of Europe have declined economically and politically — without naming specific cities or countries.\n\n\"Certain places in Europe are not even recognizable anymore,\" he said, adding that the changes were \"not in a positive way.\"\n\nHe blamed European governments for weakening themselves through energy and economic policy.\n\n\"They're destroying themselves,\" Trump said of European countries.\n\nAt the same time, he positioned the US as the central force in the global economy and security.\n\n\"The USA is the economic engine on the planet,\" he said. \"When America booms, the entire world booms.\"\n\n\"I'm working every day to ensure our military is very powerful. Our borders are very strong. And above all, our economy is strong because national security requires economic security and economic prosperity,\" he added.",

    "title": "Citadel CEO Ken Griffin says Trump's tariffs have landed the US in a 'pretty unfortunate position'",
    "description": "Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel, weighed in on how Trump's economic and geopolitical policies have impacted the US during the World Economic Forum.",
    "fullText": "Hours before President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum, Ken Griffin, the outspoken billionaire CEO of Citadel, gave his rundown of the US leader's key economic policies.\n\nTrump's tariffs have been \"a negative\" and have left the US economy in a \"pretty unfortunate position,\" said Griffin at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.\n\nThe president's policy to raise tariffs on imports to the US has \"disrupted long-standing trading relationships\" and led to \"higher inflation,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"We've obviously increased the amount of cronyism in America as corporate CEOs have lined up in Washington trying to argue why their business should be exempted from tariffs, and many have prevailed,\" he added.\n\nCentral to Trump's tariff agenda is the promise that manufacturing will return to America, reducing US dependency on foreign nations for critical items.\n\n\"We have yet to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States,\" said Griffin.\n\nThe Citadel CEO highlighted that Trump is clearly following through on the platform he was elected on and said that tariffs have had some of their intended effects, though he did not specify what these were.\n\nBut one of the main problems with US tariffs is that business leaders are uncertain about how long the policy will stay in place.\n\n\"I think people have a very hard time believing that the current tariff regime's going to persist,\" said Griffin. \"Before you spend hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars to build a manufacturing plan, you really want to believe that the policy that is the anchor of that decision will be permanent in nature.\"\n\nGriffin also gave his two cents on Trump's immigration and geopolitical policies.\n\nNo country's borders should be open to mass immigration, but closing down the Southern border has meant losing a large supply of labor, said Griffin.\n\n\"These are people who did a lot of very, very difficult work, very modest wages, which helped to reduce the level of inflation in the United States,\" he said, adding that he expected housing and food prices to rise in the coming years as a result.\n\nThe bigger problem that Trump's immigration policy has caused for the US is that \"we're potentially losing access to the best and brightest minds from around the world,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"The majority of Silicon Valley is either run by immigrants or children of immigrants,\" he said, and their companies have created \"a tremendous number of jobs in the United States.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of Trump's speech at Davos on Wednesday, Griffin said he was uncertain about what the US president was hoping to achieve by clashing with Europe over ownership of Greenland: \"What I can't understand is why are we fighting over a piece of rock covered by ice?\"\n\n\"We have frayed our relationship with our European allies in ways that I don't understand or appreciate, but there is a push here to get Europe to step up,\" said Griffin.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump ruled out using force to acquire Greenland, but said that he wants \"right, title, and ownership\" of the nation.",

    "description": "An oncologist became a patient when she was unexpectedly diagnosed with breast cancer. She said 4 simple habits can help reduce cancer risk.",
    "fullText": "Dr. Sue Hwang knows better than anyone that cancer doesn't care who you are or what you do for a living.\n\nWhen Hwang was 46, she was diagnosed with breast cancer with no symptoms. As an oncologist, she had been treating patients with the same cancer for more than a decade, and couldn't help but wonder why it happened to her, even with all her experience as a doctor.\n\n\"When you do this job long enough, you understand that breast cancer is nondiscriminatory,\" Hwang told Business Insider. \"I spent a lot of time thinking, why me? If I knew why I got cancer, then I would know how to prevent it from coming back.\"\n\nNow 48, Hwang wrote a memoir about her experience titled \"From Both Sides of the Curtain: Lessons and Reflections from an Oncologist's Breast Cancer Journey,\" published January 20.\n\nWith cancer cases on the rise among people under 40, Hwang said the onslaught of info on emerging risks can be terrifying.\n\n\"There's so much stuff in the news right now that this causes cancer, that causes cancer, be careful of plastics, everything,\" Hwang said.\n\nTo avoid panicking about cancer risk factors outside of your control, she recommends consistent habits like eating well, exercising often, and reducing stress as evidence-based ways to help prevent cancer.\n\n\"Lifestyle modification is really critical to trying to turn this boat around in terms of the rise in cancer in younger people,\" Hwang said. \"It's not one thing that's going to cause cancer, it's a combination of multiple different things.\"\n\nPreventing cancer starts with what you eat, and focusing on nutrients instead of just calories can help you make healthier choices, according to Hwang.\n\n\"In the US, we have not necessarily been taught how to eat well,\" she said. \"We focus on being thin, not healthy.\"\n\nHwang is all about whole foods, particularly fruits and veggies. Whole, plant-based foods are rich in polyphenols, compounds that help ward off the cellular damage that contributes to cancer risk.\n\nShe tries to avoid ultra-processed foods with added sugar, salt, and oils. These make up more than half the average American's diet, and have been linked to increased risk of cancer and heart disease.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start with healthy eating, try swapping out processed food with one serving of whole, plant-based foods each day, doctors and dietitians recommend. Consider swapping a bag of chips at lunch with a handful of almonds, or your morning blueberry muffin with a fruit-topped overnight oats.\n\nYou may have heard that sitting is the new smoking — that's because being sedentary is linked to a significantly higher risk of developing cancer over time.\n\n\"It's got to be a priority for people to get out and move,\" Hwang said.\n\nAs a working doctor and single mom of three, she knows it can be hard to find time for the gym on a busy schedule, so the key is being proactive about exercise. Before her diagnosis, she said exercising once a week felt like a victory, but now it's a nonnegotiable every day.\n\n\"You have to really go in with a game plan,\" Hwang said. \"If you create a plan that's going to maximize those 30 minutes, then all you need is 30 minutes.\"\n\nWorking out in the gym counts, but so does taking a walk on your lunch break or playing in the park with your kids.\n\nIf you're new to exercise, especially strength training, Hwang said it's worth hiring a personal trainer for a few sessions to understand what works.\n\n\"I'm not saying you need a trainer for the rest of your life, but get a trainer right now, get a plan for how you should be exercising, and then after two or three sessions with the trainer, do it at home,\" she said.\n\nDay-to-day anxiety and pressure from work or life challenges can also contribute to cancer risk, according to Hwang.\n\n\"Stress is a huge contributing factor. We are a production-based society where we've got to be working,\" she said.\n\nResearch suggests that stress is linked to a higher risk of developing cancer, and stress can also lead to unhealthy coping habits like drinking alcohol or eating junk food.\n\nIt can be a challenge to worry less, especially if you're worried about worrying. To stop the cycle, take a step back and reflect on your priorities.\n\n\"The diagnosis has actually made me work less, focus more on my family, and prioritize myself above other things,\" Hwang said.\n\nThen, try simple habits like breathing exercises, journaling, or gentle movement like yoga to relax, other doctors recommend.\n\nFor Hwang, a major source of stress is reading too much about cancer risk, so she minimizes time on social media and looking at the news.\n\n\"From a mental perspective, it's very overwhelming,\" Hwang said.\n\nDoom-scrolling won't change your risk of cancer, but can make a big difference in your peace of mind, so put your phone down to give your brain a break.\n\nRoutine screening is the first line of defense against cancer, since many types of cancer are very treatable when caught early.\n\nStay informed on the latest screening guidelines for various types of cancer, particularly if you have a family history. Certain genes passed down from your parents can make you more susceptible to certain cancers, which may mean you're eligible for screening earlier or more often.\n\nYou may not be able to change your genetics, but having a plan and staying up to date on health screenings can help you feel \n\n\"When you focus on lifestyle recommendations, it gives patients really tangible things that they can do to protect themselves,\" Hwang said.",

    "title": "Supreme Court justices expressed frustration with 'hurried' Trump administration handling of Lisa Cook case",
    "description": "The Supreme Court heard arguments over Trump's efforts to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook. The case has broad implications for the economy.",
    "fullText": "Eight of the nine Supreme Court justices expressed wariness with what Justice Samuel Alito described as a \"hurried\" attempt from the Trump administration to oust Lisa Cook from her position as a Federal Reserve board governor — and then to rush her case to the high court when lower courts allowed her to keep her post.\n\nSeveral members of the Republican-appointed majority also expressed sharp disagreement with the Trump administration's claim that judges lack the authority to review a president's power to fire members from the Federal Reserve board.\n\n\"Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause, that the president alone determines — and that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, told Solicitor General John Sauer.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision could have broad ramifications for Federal Reserve independence, a cornerstone of American monetary policy and the status of the dollar as the world's reserve currency.\n\nThe hearing comes just weeks after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell revealed that the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into his handling of the Fed's office renovations. Powell has said the investigation is a \"pretext\" for an attempt to pressure the central bank for political reasons.\n\nPowell attended Wednesday's oral arguments, along with Cook and former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke.\n\nMembers of the Federal Reserve's board of governors can only be removed for \"cause.\" Trump attempted to fire Cook in August, alleging she had lied on mortgage paperwork and therefore could not be trusted with her role in the Fed, which sets interest rates that influence mortgage lending rates.\n\nCook — an appointee of former President Joe Biden whose Federal Reserve board term ends in 2038 — argued that Trump's real intent was to replace her with an appointee who would more quickly drive down interest rates. Trump did not give Cook an opportunity to explain the apparent discrepancies in her mortgage paperwork before he posted the letter firing her on his Truth Social account.\n\nWednesday's oral argument didn't concern the merits of Trump's allegations about Cook's mortgage paperwork, but whether the judicial branch had the power to ensure Cook could keep her job while additional litigation plays out.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts — in a sentiment echoed by every other member of the Supreme Court except for Justice Clarence Thomas — expressed skepticism at the idea that the judicial branch couldn't have a role in checking the legitimacy of a \"for cause\" firing.\n\n\"If there is any level of cause — and you indicate that there is some level of cause, right? — well, then you can't be right about the idea that a court can't order anybody who's been removed to be reinstated,\" Roberts told Sauer.\n\nKavanaugh, while pressing Sauer, suggested that the Trump administration's position effectively erased the distinction between \"for cause\" and \"at-will\" firing — a notion that all of the Democratic appointees on the court also appeared to agree with.\n\nThe Trump administration's position may open the door for a Democratic president to fire all of Trump's Federal Reserve board appointees using \"trivial or inconsequential or old allegations,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\n\"It incentivizes kind of the 'search-and-destroy and find something, and just put that on a piece of paper — no judicial review, no process, nothing, you're done,'\" Kavanaugh said.\n\nAlito asked about why Cook had to be fired and the lawsuit against her handled in a \"cursory manner.\" He asked Sauer whether Cook's mortgage application had even been entered into evidence in the case.\n\nSauer said he wasn't sure if the paperwork itself had been seen by the district court judge who allowed Cook to keep her job, but that screenshots of the text of her mortgage application were included in social media posts.\n\n\"Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody — by the executive branch, by the district court, by the DC Circuit — in such a hurried manner?\" Alito asked. \"You began by laying out what you claim to be the factual basis for the for cause removal, but no court has ever explored those facts.\"\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, another Trump appointee, expressed anxiety about whether removing Cook could risk a recession, as economists have warned.\n\nShe wondered whether a dispute over mortgage paperwork was severe enough grounds to fire Cook, and why Trump didn't make an effort to give her the opportunity to respond to his allegations.\n\n\"Sit down across the table in the Roosevelt room where the president provides Governor Cook with the evidence and waits to hear what her response is, gives her a chance to defend herself,\" Barrett said. \"I mean, that just wouldn't be that big a deal.\"\n\nAfter Sauer finished addressing the justices' questions, Cook's lawyer Paul Clement took the podium. He said Sauer's approach effectively erased the \"for cause\" standard required for firing members of the Fed.\n\n\"If there's no judicial review, then this is all kind of a joke,\" Clement said.\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "description": "I loved living abroad in Madrid and Berlin, but my father needed me back home. It wasn't part of the plan, but it turned out to be the best decision.",
    "fullText": "After 12 years living abroad in Berlin and then Madrid, I never imagined returning home to Ireland. However, a breakup, becoming a single parent to a young teen, and growing concerns about my father's health made moving back home something I had to consider.\n\nThe decision wasn't easy. I worried about uprooting my daughter from the life we'd built in Madrid and returning to a country I'd once been so desperate to leave. Growing up in Dublin in the 1980s, a time marked by unemployment, diminishing women's rights, and a deeply conservative church and state, greatly prompted my desire to live elsewhere. The following decades of living on and off in London, France, Germany, and Spain only reinforced that there was a greater world outside my home country.\n\nSure, there was no denying that Ireland had changed a lot since the '80s. But there were still elements of the small-town mindset I despised.\n\nWould my daughter resent me later for taking her away from a life in a more progressive and larger European city?\n\nLike many Western countries, Ireland's housing crisis was at its peak. Moving back would likely mean temporarily living in my childhood home with my older parents — and that certainly felt like a step backward.\n\nStill, in other ways, it felt right. My daughter, an only child, saw her extended family only a few times a year, and I believed being closer to them would help her through her parents' breakup and those often-difficult teenage years.\n\nPlus, my father, now in his late 80s, had spent much of the year in and out of the hospital. After months of flying back and forth from Madrid to support him and my mother, staying abroad no longer felt realistic.\n\nSo I made the decision I never thought I'd make, and we moved back.\n\nWithin a month of our return, my father was discharged from the nursing home he had been sent to after a six-month hospital stay. Being there to deal with doctors and carers, support my mother, and share the load with nearby relatives made me feel really grateful. I had always been close to my dad, but now that I was physically around, our bond deepened even more.\n\nMy daughter, too, began to thrive. She began building real relationships with aunts, uncles, cousins, and her grandparents. After becoming withdrawn during our final year in Madrid, I now saw her going out shopping with my mom or sitting laughing with my dad; she was slowly opening up again.\n\nThen, four months after coming back, my father died suddenly after a short infection. It was devastating for everyone. But among the grief and tough emotions, I couldn't deny feeling so thankful that my daughter and I spent those last few months with him.\n\nAdditionally, for all my misgivings about \"small-town Ireland,\" I got to see another side of living in a small community: friends, neighbours, and even locals who just knew them in passing rallied round my mother.\n\nIt's still hard to accept my dad is gone, but, of course, life has continued. We now have our own home, a short walk from my mom, and my daughter loves her local school and the friends she's made.\n\nI still miss parts of our life abroad — my friends, the relaxing outdoor café culture, and reliable public transport. However, I'm building a stable life for my daughter, with deeper ties to family and community.\n\nI will say that when it comes to big life choices, such as moving abroad or moving home, you can only make the decision that feels right to you in the moment. It's rarely easy, but I'm relieved and glad that I made the choice I did.",

    "title": "The Out-of-Touch Adults' Guide to Kid Culture: Anti-ICE Protests on Roblox",
    "description": "Kids are mad about government overreach and age verification.",
    "fullText": "This week's out-of-touch guide is a mélange of internet nonsense that reflect real world anxieties. A gritty part of London is going viral for a taxpayer-funded water park that only exists thanks to AI videos made to enrage racists. Inside the kid-centric videogame Roblox, users are protesting both ICE and age verification without ever leaving their avatars. And in the darker corners of the online world, looksmaxxers are determining who is a HTN, while everyone on TikTok is saying, \"Screw it. We're going to pretend to be birds.\"\n\nIt might sound like the name of an outré sex act or a cocktail from the 1980s, but a Croydon Water Park is something else entirely, and it's going to take some exsplaining. Croydon is a large town in South London with a reputation as a rough, gritty place, known (fairly or unfairly) for its concrete and crime. It's also diverse—51% of its population identifies as Black, Asian, or from a minority ethnic background—so U.K. racists generally don't like Croydon. The \"water park\" bit comes from people posting AI-generated videos of face-masked men (\"roadmen,\" in slang) enjoying Croydon's waterpark, which doesn't exist, often with \"reminders\" that it's \"taxpayer funded.\" This is rage bait for old, racist Brits. Here's a representative sampling:\n\nOther AI created locations in Croydon include this tax-payer funded buffet:\n\nIn the online hall of mirrors, it's impossible to tell how many of the angry wankers in the comment section are legit, and how many are kids cosplaying as angry wankers. Judge for yourself on the #Croydon tag.\n\nDigital activism can be messy. Recently, in response to ICE protests in Minnesota, Roblox users have been staging their own demonstrations within the game. Led by @clipsforcloset, users are reenacting ICE raids, holding up signs, and otherwise expressing their deep feelings about current events. It looks like this:\n\nHere's a demonstration featuring ICE vans rolling up to a pre-school:\n\nProtesting in a game isn't likely to have an immediate effect on the real world, but in terms of educating an extremely hard-to-reach population about what happening outside their computers, it could be effective. But it seems that the issue that's most important to many Roblox users isn't ICE, but the platform's age verification requirements.\n\nRoblox's newly rolled out restrictions on chat require users to either provide an ID or pose for a series of photos so their age can be determined—otherwise, they can't chat. From the guess-the-age bot getting it totally wrong, to privacy questions, to people selling age-verified accounts online, there is a lot wrong with Roblox new policy, so some Roblox users are organizing \"marches\" on the virtual headquarters of Roblox that seem to be against both ICE and the chat restrictions.\n\nSome have pointed out that marching in a game means you're adding to the player count, so it might not be the most effective means of protest, but it's interesting that the same kind of \"What's the point?\" arguments and inability to keep protestors \"on message\" are known issues in real-life activism. Speaking of real life, so far, it doesn't look like Roblox age verification is affecting its parent company's stock price.\n\nThe acronym \"HTN\" stands for \"high-tier normie.\" In normal language, you might call a HTN a \"good looking guy,\" but not like male-model good-looking. It comes from the online community of \"looksmaxxers,\" people focused on maximizing physical attractiveness. Looksmaxxers use what they consider an objective gauge of human facial attractiveness called the PSL scale, and a HTN has a 4.5 to 5.5 out of 8 on the PSL scale. All of this is totally nutso of course, but a lot of younger men think it's truth. If you know any younger men like that, explain to them that scoring high on the \"being a semi-decent person\" scale beats any number on the PSL scale.\n\nThis week, TikTok is being overtaken by people doing impressions of owls. The meme works like this: You say, \"This is my impression of an owl if it was X\" and act it out. The X can be anything. Celebrity owls are popular, like this impression of an owl if it was Michael Jackson:\n\nThere are lots of owl impressions of groups, like this owl that is an \"Italian American, but also from New York.\"\n\nIf you dig a little deeper, you get into more conceptual owls, like an owl that is \"an overstimulated millennial mom who is teaching herself to self-regulate while teaching their child to self-regulate,\"\n\nFor thousands of videos featuring countless kinds of owls, check out TikTok's owl impersonators.",

    "description": "The 90s called. They said you can't check your Yahoo! Mail.",
    "fullText": "Your eyes don't deceive you: You did just read a headline in the year of our lord 2026 about Yahoo! Despite losing out to other search engine and email companies like Google, Yahoo! is very much still a thing. In fact, one statistic claims Yahoo! Mail still has 225 million daily active users to this day. That's a ways off from Gmail's 1.8 billion daily active users, but way better than AOL's eight million users. (Yes, AOL is still a thing, and is actually a part of Yahoo!—at least until its sale to Bending Spoons goes through).\n\nBut I'm not here to talk about Yahoo! and AOL's marketshare. Instead, I'm here to sound the alarms to the millions of people that use Yahoo!, and, by extension, AOL: The services were down this morning. If you tried to search the web for something on Yahoo!, or check your Yahoo! Mail, or even your AOL Mail, you'd find the following error message: \"Edge: Too Many Requests.\" I first spotted the outage via Downdetector, owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis, which had tens of thousands of user reports, before falling off by 10:30 a.m. ET. Since then, the sites are back online.\n\nThere's no official reason for the outage from Yahoo! as of this article, but, like most of these outages, the company resolved the issues fairly quickly. Last week, X had an outage, and it came back online before long. Of course, that outage was overshadowed by the massive Verizon outage, which Verizon claimed was simply a \"software issue.\" There's a big difference between a series of web sites going down and a nationwide cell network, however, so it's not surprising Yahoo! and AOL alike were both back online this morning. The millions of users who rely on these services now have them back, while the rest of us can forget about them all over again.",

    "title": "Digg Is Back",
    "description": "Digg's new beta is aiming to take on Reddit, with a new design and an AI-narrated podcast.",
    "fullText": "Back before Reddit became the unofficial \"front page of the internet,\" you would dig up your next long read or binge watch on Digg. Starting in 2004, the original version of the site worked much like Reddit does today, with community members submitting content they found interesting to premade category pages and others voting on it until an algorithm eventually decided what should make its way to the front page. Aside from the lack of user-made pages like subreddits, it was generally pretty familiar to what modern users might expect—and, speaking from experience, it was a big deal to be featured on Digg.\n\nUnfortunately, starting in 2010, the site went through a few drastic redesigns that added controversial features like the DiggBar (a clunky toolbar that would display over content) and got rid of features like burying (the equivalent of modern downvoting). It bounced from owner to owner and experimented with new formats like a manually curated front page, but by that point, Reddit had become the behemoth it's known as today. It was hard for Digg to keep up.\n\nNow, after Reddit has spent years saddled with its own controversies, Digg is back with yet another relaunch, with a new beta from original founder Kevin Rose and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian that aim to combine the best of both site's legacies.\n\nLast week, Rose and Ohanian opened their new Digg to the public, debuting a new design that looks a lot like Reddit, but cleaner. On desktop, the sidebar on the left uses icons rather than labels, and generally has fewer complications, so no distracting \"games on Reddit\" tab. To the right of that, you get your main, infinite scrolling feed, and I'll admit, I like the classic blue-on-white color scheme (although you can use dark mode if you like). Unlike the classic Digg, this feed will include user-made communities, which work like subreddits, so you can join and leave them at any time to curate what you see. And yes, the downvote is back, along with full commenting functionality. You can also swap over from a feed that only shows communities you're subscribed to (My Feed) to one that collects the best posts across Digg (All Digg) with a button up top, which is one pretty significant difference—Reddit has the r/all subreddit, but it requires navigating away from your main feed and isn't available in the app.\n\nBut the big difference maker is in the right sidebar, which shows recent posts on Reddit, but \"Digg Daily\" on Digg. This shows trending posts and featured communities at a glance, so you can get caught up with news without having to scroll the \"All Digg\" feed for too long, but curiously, it's also got the \"Digg Daily\" podcast. This one addition is probably the most significant way the new Digg differs from Reddit, and also the most awkward.\n\nIt had to be here somewhere—Digg Daily is the site's implementation of AI. Updated once a day, this brief five-ish minute podcast recaps the biggest stories on the site that day, using AI hosts that sound like slightly more robotic versions of the ones you'll get on Google's NotebookLM. You'll get a few sentences talking about the story's original source (which, when I listened, did credit the author of the article being discussed), as well as a few quotes from readers. Unfortunately, while you can bring up chapters to jump ahead in Digg Daily and see a list of discussed topics, there aren't any links to find either the sources or Digg posts being discussed, and the \"Featured Posts\" bar below Digg Daily doesn't relate to what's on the podcast at all.\n\nIt's a nice idea, but aside from getting a high-level overview of what was popular on the site that day, I didn't find it too useful. Summaries are extremely short, and comments are awkward to hear outside of their original context. It might be a good first step to know what to search the site for, but links would really help it out.\n\nOn the plus side, Digg Daily might not always be AI: The company said during an interview with TechCrunch that it might swap out the robotic hosts for human ones following user feedback. Human lead curation could help the recaps feel a bit more natural, and even bring back some elements from the eras of Digg where the front page was managed by a staff rather than an algorithm.\n\nAside from the different look and minor additions like Digg Daily, getting started on Digg should be pretty familiar for anyone who's used Reddit. The mobile app also has full functionality, although sidebar features have been moved to buttons above and below the main feeds. But there are a few ways the platform is looking to grow.\n\nThe big one is probably communities, or Digg's version of subreddits. The site launched with 21 default communities off the bat, but it'll take a while for user-made communities to pop up for more obscure topics. For instance, I've been replaying the Mega Man: Battle Network games from my youth a lot lately, and while there are multiple regularly updated subreddits for that series with thousands of members each, there's not a Digg community for them yet. It sounds like a small complaint, but one of Reddit's big strengths is that you can just Google \"[topic] + reddit\" and probably find an answer to whatever question you might have, no matter how small. Without years of posts on topics both big and small to lean on, it'll take Digg some time to catch up.\n\nYou can help with that by starting a community, but weirdly, communities right now can only have a single moderator, so be prepared to do a lot of heavy lifting.\n\nHowever, the growing pains aren't all bad. Personally, I can't stand that modern Reddit pushes users to theme their avatars around its mascot, and buries the button to just upload their own images deep in the Settings page. Especially because the best options for dressing up your avatar are paywalled. Digg doesn't have any paywall or mascot dress-up feature, so uploading your own photo to be your Digg avatar is the only way to go. Overall, it's a less bloated experience.\n\nWhile Digg might be light on features now, it does have the basics down, and that TechCrunch interview pointed to more possibilities coming down the line. For instance, the owners might be using AI in some ways, but they're also big on fighting AI spam. They said they're not opting for one universal solution, but are looking at options on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn the interview, they discussed possibly forcing users of a community based around a product to prove they own that product before they can post. Similar suggested solutions were using location data to see if community members had attended in-person meetups, although that raises privacy concerns.\n\n\"I don't think there's going to be any one silver bullet here,\" Rose told TechCrunch, but the general idea is to build trust and ensure users are authentic while remaining non-intrusive. This would help keep suspicious writing that sounds like ad copy or political brigading off the site, but would also keep users from having to upload personal data or pay for a one-time verification badge. Given that thousands of subreddits famously went dark in 2023 over a lack of trust between moderators and the site's owners, it's a noble goal, at least. It also tracks with Digg's promises of more public moderation and relaxed ownership of user-generated material, although I'll leave legal experts to comment on those in detail.\n\nOverall, it's encouraging that most of the features being discussed here are about core posting usability, although there are a few fun ideas sprinkled in, too, including plans to allow users to customize the look and feel of their communities, as well as add integrations with other sites—for instance, allowing Letterboxd scores to natively show up on a movies community.\n\nIf this all sounds interesting to you, you can try the Digg beta right now, and despite that \"beta\" name, it's not too different from signing up for any other site. Just navigate to Digg.com or download the Digg app, click the \"Signup/Login\" button at the top of the feed, enter an email, and claim a username. After you authenticate using a code sent to your email, you should be all set to start scrolling and subscribing to communities.\n\nOr, you can scroll without being signed in, if you're OK with using the default feed. You can also still visit individual communities, by searching for them in the site's search bar.",

But it does follow a number of high-profile outages this week. Just this morning, Yahoo! and AOL were both down. Last week, X experienced an outage, as did Verizon—quite famously, I might add.\n\nWhile we wait for a fix, there's not much you can do on your end.

    "title": "Sony's Newest Earbuds Are Clip-Ons",
    "description": "The Linkbuds Clip aim for a more approachable open-back experience.",
    "fullText": "It took me a while to get comfortable with wearing earbuds. I grew up in the era of headphones, and never quite liked the idea of sticking something into my ears on the regular. If that sounds like you, Sony's got your back. Its newest earbuds, the Linkbuds Clip, are clip-ons.\n\nSony's not the first brand to take this idea to market—Anker's Soundcore brand has a number of more affordable options. But for premium clip-on earbuds, it's pretty much this, the slightly more expensive Bose, and the slightly sportier Shokz.\n\nCompared to that competition, Sony's new model is looking like a solid choice. These earbuds fit snugly around your ear with an adjustable ear cushion, and include the niceties that Sony's Linkbuds have become known for. That means an optional built-in voice boost mode to help you hear vocals better; adaptive audio that can raise or lower your volume based on your environment; a motion sensor for tapping gestures (which you can actually perform near your ear instead of on the earbuds themselves); and—new with this model—a bone-conduction sensor.\n\nSony's pitching that last bit as being especially good for calls, as the bone conduction sensor will be able to detect specifically when you are speaking, and, working alongside some \"AI noise reduction,\" should be able to reduce background noise.\n\nBattery life has also been improved over Sony's last Linkbuds, the Linkbuds Open. There, you got 22 hours of battery life with the case, but here, Sony is promising up to 37. The buds themselves should provide up to nine hours of battery life.\n\nSpeaking of the Linkbuds Open, that model also had a unique design, as the bulk of the earbud was designed to sit in your upper ear, while a ring that actually produced the sound sat just outside your ear canal. It was a design that aimed for an experience akin to \"open-back\" headphones, meaning you'd be able to completely hear your surroundings with the earbuds in without needing a transparency mode.\n\nThe Linkbuds Clip want to keep that same open-back experience, while allowing for greater comfort and flexibility. Sony told me that the Linkbuds Open do sit closer to the eardrum if worn correctly, which can provide a better listening experience, but that differing ear shapes made it hard for some customers to use as intended. I was sent a pair of Linkbuds Clip for review, and while I haven't had much time to test them yet, I can confirm that they fit pretty snugly on my ears right out of the box.\n\nOver the next week, I'm excited to try the Linkbuds Clip both while out and about in New York City, and while exercising. Aside from enhanced comfort over in-ear earbuds, you'll be fully aware of your surroundings while wearing these, which should help with safety or any spur-of-the-moment conversations you might need to have (Sony is also marketing these towards parents who might need to constantly keep an ear out for their kids). I also sometimes feel like my in-ear earbuds can block airflow while I'm doing cardio, which I worry makes it harder for me to cool off, so I'm curious to see if these can help with that.\n\nThe one downside is that, as is the case with open-back headphones, there can be some sound leakage, which means others might be able to hear whatever you're listening to. That's something I'll need to test over time, although Sony does say it has an optional sound leakage reduction mode.\n\nThere's also no noise canceling, but that's to be expected when the idea is to stay aware of your surroundings.\n\nI've been a big fan of Sony's audio products over the years, especially its software and listening modes. My full review of the Linkbuds Clip will be coming soon, but if you're already convinced, you can snag your own pair for $230 over at Sony's website, or through stores like Amazon. The case comes in four colors, but you can also grab a silicone case cover, which covers half of the case, to help you mix and match over on Sony's website for $12.50. Extra air cushions of any color are also available alongside upper case covers, while bottom case covers come with a keychain.",

    "title": "10 Shows Like 'A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' You Should Watch Next",
    "description": "You've got ten kingdoms, at a minimum.",
    "fullText": "We're going back to Westeros, baby! Not that we ever really left, given that we're merely between seasons of that other Game of Thrones spin-off, and with several more allegedly in development. It seems the only place the Game of Thrones universe is completely stalled is on the page—but I digress.\n\nWhere the original series saw a kingdom in decline and House of the Dragon takes us back to the Targaryen Dynasty at its height, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms occurs roughly in-between, shifting the focus from the realm's power players to more tangential (at least for now) smallfolk: Ser Duncan the Tall (Peter Claffey), a lowborn hedge knight, and his faithful squire Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell), who may have a greater destiny. It's that relationship to power that sets the show apart from the rest of the wider franchise, and that's also what ties together these 10 \"streamalikes,\" whether they're solidly in the fantasy genre or works of historical fiction.\n\nThis popular two-season South Korean import can go toe-to-toe with Knight when it comes to juicy drama and medieval-style action. It's set in the fictional Daeho, a country reminiscent of Korea during the Joseon era. Lee Jae-wook stars as Jang Uk, a noble of questionable parentage who had his natural mage powers taken at birth. Nak-su (Jung So-min), meanwhile, is an assassin who is killed by a rival family. Fortunately, she's able to survive (via alchemy) by transferring her soul into the body of a weak, blind woman. When Uk and Nak-su (in her new body) meet up and he discovers her real identity, they strike a deal: She'll publicly act as his squire while also teaching him everything she knows about fighting and magic, provided he helps her get revenge. Stream Alchemy of Souls on Netflix.\n\nAn obvious choice, given that it's a Game of Thrones spin-off, since (vague spoiler for the new show!) House of the Dragon also focuses in on the Targaryen family—members of which are always up to something. Where Thrones caught up with the dragon riders in their downward spiral and Knight is set a bit before that, House of the Dragon goes back further to show us the royal dynasty at its height, before all that incest and indolence sent them completely 'round the bend. Stream House of the Dragon on HBO Max.\n\nThis one's on the lighter side, at least compared to anything going on in Westeros, but we still get a couple of ill-matched buddies, one with a larger destiny, adventuring through a medieval type landscape. Colin Morgan plays the title warlock, who arrives in Camelot to find that magic has been outlawed—which doesn't stop a dragon with the voice of John Hurt from explaining to him that he needs to protect the king's only son (Bradley James), a boy who will grow up to unite the land. (The kid's name is Arthur, in case that weren't obvious.) Stream Merlin on Prime Video and Tubi.\n\nSet at the tail-end of Japan's Warring States period, this adaptation of the James Clavell novel finds ambitious English maritime pilot John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis) shipwrecked on the island and in the power of leading warlord Lord Yoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada)—each of them with something to offer the other. Blackthorne is made Toranaga's Hatamoto, a flag-bearer and most trusted retainer. Reluctantly serving as translator between the two is Toda Mariko (Anna Sawai), highly loyal to Toranaga, but with a complicated past. The main characters all have real-life analogues, and much of the plot mirrors world history, so there's a verisimilitude to everything in this (mostly) Japanese-language drama that stands up to anything in George R.R. Martin ever dreamed up. Stream Shōgun on Hulu.\n\nAn effective bit of fantasy storytelling, The Wheel of Time follows a group of young people taken from a secluded village by Moiraine Damodred (Rosamund Pike), a powerful magic user who believes that one of them is the reborn Dragon—a being who will either heal the world, or destroy it The show's sweep is more epic than A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, but it smartly places its focuses on the unworldly villagers, who are experiencing the wider world's dangers at the same time as the audience. The show was cancelled following a third season that just found it getting into its groove, taking us through roughly the first four books of Robert Jordan's lengthy fantasy series, so I suppose could always jump into it with plans to finish the story on the page—rather the reverse of Game of Thrones, which gave us the ending George R.R. Martin has yet to get down on paper. Stream The Wheel of Time. on Prime Video.\n\nIn this handsome anime series, it's England in 1013 CE, and conqueror Sweyn Forkbeard lies near death, his status setting off battles of succession between his sons Harald and Canute (true story!). Amidst this turmoil, the show follows Thorfinn Karlsefni, a dramatized version of the real-life Icelandic explorer who ultimately travelled to Greenland and then on to Vinland (roughly modern-day Newfoundland and Labrador). Initially a vengeful mercenary in the service of a Viking warlord, Thorfinn maneuvers the complex politics of his world before coming to understand the horrors of the bloodshed that he's seen and been responsible for. It's one of the most impressively realized anime series' of the past decade. Stream Vinland Saga on Prime Video, Hulu, and Netflix.\n\nKicking off with a slightly overcomplicated timey-wimey narrative structure in which we follow multiple threads at various points in time, The Witcher ultimately settles into a groove as a show about a big guy who fights creatures in a Tolkien-esque kingdom. Played first by Henry Cavill and more recently, by Liam Hemsworth, the title Witcher is Geralt of Rivia, a genetically engineered (sort of) magical monster hunter who refuses to kill a young woman accused of monstrosity by a jerk of a mage—a decision that puts him on a path that involves protecting and mentoring Ciri (Freya Allan), a crown princess who lots of people want to kill. Stream The Witcher on Netflix.\n\nThere are relatively few knights and no fantasy elements in this historical drama (adapted from the Ken Follett novel), but Pillars shares with A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms a roughly medieval setting (literally medieval in this case) and a story involving individuals with tangential relationships with power navigating extremely fraught times. Set amid England's Anarchy, during which designated heir Matilda battled Stephen of Blois over the throne, the series involves appropriately named mason Tom Builder (Rufus Sewell), tasked with constructing a cathedral in the town of Knightsbridge after he and his family have lost nearly everything. Ian McShane, Matthew Macfadyen, Eddie Redmayne, and Hayley Atwell lead the stacked cast. Rent The Pillars of the Earth from Prime Video.\n\nOnce again we're talking about people on the fringes of power during dodgy times (or maybe they're all dodgy). Roland Emmerich is one of the primary names behind this short-lived series, which gives you a sense of the vibe: It's big, loud, and frequently obvious—but also an awful lot of fun. Think of it as a soap opera set during the opening days of the Roman Colosseum under Emperor Vespasian (Anthony Hopkins): While the emperor's sons struggle for dominance, Tenax (Iwan Rheon), the proprietor of Rome's largest betting tavern, forms an unlikely alliance with Cala (Sara Martins), a black Numidian who came to Rome in pursuit of her children, who were taken into slavery by Roman soldiers. There's nothing (nothing) she won't do to secure their safety. Stream Those About to Die on Peacock.\n\nYou want prequels? Here's a prequel. While quite different in tone and execution, both Martin's Westeros and J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth represent efforts to shape unique fantasy worlds form the raw clay of Western European history and mythology. There are a lot of threads to follow in this story set a few thousand years before The Lord of the Rings, but our main character is almost certainly the young(-er) Galadriel (Morfydd Clark). When the helpful but mysterious Annatar offers to aid the elves in forging the title's rings of power, Galadriel is the only one who clocks that something isn't quite right. As with The Hobbit and LOTR, it's the less overtly powerful folk who are the most impacted by the machinations of Middle Earth's elite.

From England, this would include current Champions League holders Arsenal, and potentially Chelsea based on current co-efficients.\n\n\"This is a scheduling issue rather than a strategic one. The timing is what causes us real concerns,\" a WSL spokesperson said.\n\n\"We are not saying we do not want Fifa to bring in new competitions. We are fully on board with a strategy to help the women's game grow globally.\n\n\"At best it will cause us real scheduling issues; at worst it is going to be catastrophic for the game in this country, our commercial programme and more importantly the welfare of our players.\"",

    "description": "Complete guide to Kafka Connect Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) troubleshooting. Learn systematic triage methods, error classification, and replay strategies from real production incidents with 25,000+ failed messages.",
    "fullText": "Secret Hint: TL;DR is at the bottom, so you might as well just read while scrolling down 😉\n\nA couple of years back, around 2018, our Java-based Kafka streaming data pipeline silently broke. We had Dead Letter\nQueues (DLQ) enabled, or so we thought. The configuration was wrong and never really tested. Java exceptions disappeared into\nlogs with 3-day retention. We discovered the issue only Monday midday, when the Analytics team reported missing data from\nlast week. We got lucky because the source topic had 7-day retention, so we could reset offsets and reprocess. But we\nspent hours understanding and reconstructing what went wrong with zero error context.\n\nIf the DLQ had been properly configured and monitored, we would have known within minutes. We would have known\nwhy it broke, not just that it broke. That incident stuck with me, not because I have built it, but because my team\ninherited it, and I was trying to untangle the spaghetti of what went wrong. Although I enjoy debugging issues, I didn’t\nenjoy being that guy at 12pm on a Monday trying to piece together a puzzle of lost knowledge and missing data. Every\nsimilar incident since has reinforced the same lesson: DLQs aren’t optional infrastructure; they’re your early warning\nsystem.\n\nI don’t want to make this another “here’s how to configure DLQ” tutorial. But after debugging thousands of DLQ messages,\nI realized there’s a systematic approach to triaging them that can save hours of frustration. So I want to focus on how\nto quickly identify root causes, avoid common pitfalls, and ensure your DLQ is properly configured and monitored. But\nfirst, let’s see what is wrong with most DLQ setups.\n\nWhen it comes to debugging any kind of errors, including DLQs, you would expect all standard measures to be in place, but\nthese mistakes repeat across different teams and companies:\n\nAsk me how I know 🙃. (If any of these sound familiar, you’ve probably been there too.) What I’ve learned from many hours\ntriaging DLQ floods is that most floods aren’t 25,000 unique problems, they are 1-2 root causes amplified by\nbatch processing and retries.\n\nHere’s a real example from that initial 25,000 message incident:\n\nWhat we saw: 25,000 messages in the DLQ\n\nThe real problem was just 500 malformed records caused by a producer schema bug. Everything else was collateral damage.\n\ntreat DLQ triage like a forensic investigation. You need a systematic way to cut through the amplification and\nfind the signal in the noise. Methodical, pattern-first, not “headless chicken”-first.\n\nWhen you’re staring at a DLQ with thousands of messages, here’s your systematic approach.\n\nIn the first minutes, grab 10 messages with headers to get a feel for what’s going on. Don’t analyze everything.\n\n⚠️ Note: In a long‑lived DLQ, --from-beginning may show you older failures. For quick triage of current incidents, use\na throwaway consumer group without --from-beginning so you only see newly arriving DLQ messages.\n\nAt this point, you may already have a hypothesis. But don’t jump to conclusions yet. You need to quantify the problem.\n\nThis is where you’ll start to see if your hypothesis is correct or if there are multiple root causes. Kafka Connect (KC)\nDLQ headers are your debugging friend, and these are the key ones to focus on:\n\nExtract the class name and count occurrences:\n\nVery probable output will look like this:\n\nThis is the 💡 AHA the moment. You have 25,000 error messages, but really just 490 actual errors, which probably\nlead to just one single schema mismatch type of error. Now you know where to focus. Someone would focus on the biggest\nnumber first. But the biggest number is often just a secondary effect of the real problem. You want to focus on the most\nspecific error class that indicates the root cause.\n\nOnce you decide what is the dominant error class, inspect one representative message:\n\nCommon culprits and what they mean:\n\nℹ️ Key insight: Most issues require fixing the producer or adding a Single Message Transform (SMT), not tweaking the\nconnector config.\n\nLet’s be honest; when things go wrong, you just want the few commands at hand that tell you how bad it is, where it came\nfrom, and can I fix it? Here are a few useful commands:\n\nThis sums the lag (unconsumed messages) across partitions from the LOG-END-OFFSET (fourth column).\n\nExtract the original topic for replay:\n\nThose DLQ headers (__connect.errors.topic and __connect.errors.partition) are your breadcrumbs. They tell you where these dead letters came from and where they might need to go back.\n\nA DLQ you don’t monitor is a DLQ you don’t have. It’s a graveyard where they go to die, literally dead letters. And if\nyour client realizes that you are losing their precious events, you will soon become the next Yahoo! So if you take DLQs\nseriously, make monitoring part of your MVP:\n\nCalibrate these thresholds to your scale. If your system ingests 10M messages/hour, then 100 errors/hour (0.0001%)\nmight be acceptable noise. But if you’re processing 10K messages/hour, and you have 100 errors/hour, that’s a 1% failure\nrate (🔔🔔🔔). The goal is a trend toward zero DLQs. If it’s growing, you have an active incident. If it’s static, but\nnon-zero, you have technical debt.\n\nRemember my story from the beginning?; a quiet DLQ doesn’t mean everything is fine, it might be misconfigured!\n\nOnce you’ve fixed the bug, in that euphoria you may want to replay those failed messages quickly safely.\nReplaying messages blindly can re-trigger ⚠️ side effects (duplicate emails, duplicate payments, double API writes).\nEvaluate the blast radius before pushing anything DLQ back into the source topic. Kafka Connect doesn’t provide native\nreplay support, so you’ll need a script or lightweight service. I assume you will do something manually, and because\nhumans tend to make mistakes, please make sure to:\n\nWhile you are scripting “BASIC” replay solutions, sometimes they turn into “10 GOTO 10”:\n\nIf you take only one configuration snippet from this post, make it this one. This is your bare-minimum setup for\nKafka Connect DLQ sanity:\n\nIf you ever wonder whether to enable headers, the answer is always yes. No headers = no debugging.\n\nI have learned that the Dead Letter Queue isn’t a trash can where bad messages go to die. That it’s your pipeline’s\nearly warning system, quietly telling you a story. People today just need to stop talking and start listening.\nWell, that is true for any communication system, but especially for data pipelines.\n\nIf you came here for the TL;DR, here it is:\n\nThe next time you see that DLQ topic start to grow, take a deep breath; you’ve got a plan now. I’m still surprised\nthere are no tools that automate this triage process end to end, but hopefully that will change soon.\n\nSo, if you ever built custom DLQ dashboards, DLQ analysis tools, or replay scripts, I’d love to hear about them and\nlearn how others are solving this in the wild.

    "fullText": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT and Claude have two superpowers. The first \nsuperpower is a boon: they can dramatically increase human productivity. I use them on a regular basis to answer \nquestions, learn new skills, write code, create images, and much more, all at a rate of speed and quality that was\nscience fiction just a few years ago. The second superpower is a bane: GenAI is quietly destroying the very \necosystems that made it possible in the first place.\n\nUnder the hood, GenAI is built on large language models (LLMs), which are able to extract patterns, structure, and\nstatistical relationships from massive data sets. These data sets consist primarily of content created by human beings: \nbooks, blog posts, articles, forum discussions, open source code, art, photography, and so on. LLMs are able to extract \nvalue from this content at an unprecedented scale, but all that value is captured by the GenAI company and its users. \nIf you’re a content creator, you get nothing: no attribution, no referral traffic, no revenue share. Not even a \nthank-you.\n\nThis feels unsustainable to me, a bit like a snake eating its own tail. In this blog post, I’ll go through three\nexamples of how GenAI is destroying the very ecosystems it relies on, and then discuss possible solutions that may\ngive everyone (users, GenAI companies, and content creators) more value.\n\nFor many years, StackOverflow was the most popular Q&A site for programmers. Any time you \nhit a weird error while coding, you’d do a search on Google, and more often than not, find a good answer on \nStackOverflow. But now, in large part due to GenAI, StackOverflow is nearly dead:\n\nAlthough StackOverflow’s decline started before GenAI went mainstream (ChatGPT was first released in 2022), GenAI\naccelerated that decline considerably. That’s because nowadays, instead of searching around for an answer on a Q&A site,\nand working to adapt that answer to your own codebase, you can ask GenAI tools to generate your code, fix any errors\nyou hit, answer any questions you run into, and so on. As a result, you’re considerably more productive.\n\nBut it doesn’t seem sustainable. A big part of why GenAI tools can answer programming questions and fix errors in your \ncode is because those tools were trained on StackOverflow data. So you as a programmer and the GenAI tool now \nget much more value from that data, but StackOverflow gets none. If people stop asking and answering questions, what \nwill GenAI train on in the future?\n\nI also get the impression that StackOverflow is not the only online community where this is happening. For example, \nQuora seems largely dead. Wikipedia is\nfacing more threats than ever.\nAnd although Reddit’s traffic numbers don’t show it, I (and many other Redditors) get the impression that it’s also \ndying.1\n\nTailwind CSS is a popular library programmers use to style and decorate their websites. In\nfact, according to the 2025 State of CSS Survey, Tailwind is the\nmost popular CSS library, by far:\n\nAnd Tailwind usage only seems to be growing:\n\nDespite that, just a couple of weeks ago, the Tailwind team had to lay off 75% of its \nstaff. Why? The company behind\nTailwind CSS makes its money by selling a premium upgrade to the open source library called\nTailwind UI, which gives you a set of reusable, pre-built, professionally designed\ncomponents for building out your website. This was a great offering in the past, but in the age of GenAI, it’s more\nproblematic:\n\nSo developers are getting lots of value from Tailwind, GenAI is getting lots of value from Tailwind, but the creators\nof Tailwind are getting crushed. I suspect something similar will happen with many other open source projects.2\n\nWhen my latest book, Fundamentals of DevOps and Software Delivery, came \nout last year, a friend of mine asked me an interesting question:\n\nIn the age of LLMs, will people still use books to learn the fundamentals?\n\nI’m an avid reader, and still believe books play a key role in learning, but there’s no doubt that LLMs provide a new\nmethod of learning that is incredibly compelling. GenAI has two remarkable qualities that make it a great teacher:\n\nYou can ask it all the questions you want, with no fear of sounding dumb. You can repeat the same question over and \nover again if something isn’t clicking. You can request it to explain things in different ways: via text, via audio,\nvia diagrams. I’ve used GenAI to learned dozens of new things over just the last few months: how to do DIY \nprojects around the house, how to rehab a minor injury, how to cook eggs without giving them a sulfuric taste/smell,\nand much more. And I learned most of these without reading anyone’s book or blog.\n\nAnd that’s a problem. Much of the content I got from the GenAI tools was extracted from books and blog posts, with\nno attribution. Even worse, some of this content was extracted illegally. Last year, Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5B\nto settle a class-action \nlawsuit for training their\nLLMs on over 500,000 pirated books. That included several of my previous books!3\n\nThis class-action lawsuit might sound like a win for authors, but it’s actually a disaster. There are likely many\nAI companies training on pirated data who haven’t been caught. And even if they are caught, they might not\nbe sued. And even if they are sued, they might not lose or settle. And even if they do, they will just see it as the\ncost of doing business. Anthropic recently raised $13B, reported revenue at $5B per year, and is valued at \n$183B; OpenAI is trying\nto raise $100B, with reported revenue of $20B per year, and a valuation of \n$830B. And all these\nnumbers are growing fast. A $1.5B fine is just a drop in the bucket for companies like this. It’s a risk worth taking.\n\nAnd I’m guessing all the GenAI companies are taking that risk. In another lawsuit, OpenAI\nargued that it’s ‘impossible’ to create AI tools like ChatGPT without copyrighted \nmaterial. If that’s\nwhat it takes to get to an $830B valuation, you better believe they are all going to steal and pirate as much \ncontent as possible. And when they do, the creators of that content will get nothing. Nada. $0.\n\nThere are countless other examples where GenAI is benefiting from content, while giving nothing back to the content\ncreators: e.g., art, music, design, movies, copywriting, and so on. At its root, the GenAI model is broken:\n\nDid you notice what’s missing? The user has a way to get value (step 4), the GenAI company has a way to get value \n(step 3), but the content creator gets nothing. Compare this to the search engine model (e.g., Google Search), which is \nwhat we all used before GenAI came along:\n\nThe search engine model was not perfect, but it at least created the opportunity for all parties in this three-sided \nmarketplace to capture value: the user in step 3, the search engine company in step 4, and the content creator in \nstep 5.\n\nIn short, the current GenAI model destroys the incentives to create new content. I’ve heard this referred to as “the \ngreat content collapse.” Will it lead to a world where, after the 2020s, there’s little-to-no content created by humans? \nWill the state of knowledge and creativity stagnate as a result?\n\nTo be clear, I’m not an innocent party in this. As I mentioned numerous times in this post, I use GenAI regularly.\nThere’s no doubt that it makes me more productive. I even used GenAI to create the cover image for this blog post! \nBut each time I use ChatGPT or Claude, I feel a bit guilty, as it doesn’t feel sustainable. The snake can’t keep \neating its own tail indefinitely.\n\nSo the question is, what do we do? If we want to avoid the great content collapse, we need a model of GenAI usage that \ncreates opportunities for all parties (user, GenAI company, content creator) to capture value. Below are two ideas for \nhow we might accomplish this.\n\nThe only attempted solution I’ve heard about so far is CloudFlare’s pay-per-crawl \nmodel, which seems to work as follows:\n\nOn the one hand, it’s fantastic to see a major company try to do something about this problem. On the other \nhand, this approach seems to address the wrong part of the problem. The real value isn’t in crawling the data, it’s \nin using it. For every one crawl, an LLM might use the data thousands or millions of times. If creators are only paid \nper crawl, then the GenAI company still captures 99.999% of the value, and the creator gets next to nothing. Moreover,\nthis model only seems to work for websites (it’s not clear how you adapt it to books, art, music, etc.), and it \ncreates an incentive for GenAI companies to only crawl free content, which means paid content is less likely to ever be\ndiscovered (which disproportionally benefits those with pockets deep enough to keep their content free).\n\nI came across a clever solution that felt directionally correct from this LinkedIn post by Tyrone \nJoel\nwhere he took a PDF of my book Terraform: Up & Running, uploaded it into\na GenAI tool, and asked the tool to follow the guidance in the book to generate Terraform code. This feels like it has\nall the ingredients of a model of GenAI usage that is sustainable: the user gets value from the GenAI tool’s responses,\nthe GenAI company gets value from the user paying for a subscription, and the content creator gets value from the user \npaying for their content (in this case, buying my book). This works fine for a single, specific piece of content, but \nhow do you make it work at scale, across all the content that is consumed by an LLM?\n\nHere’s a rough proposal for what I’ll call the pay-per-use model:\n\nThis model works for not only websites, but other types of content too, including copyrighted content. As a content \ncreator (e.g., author, musician, designer, etc.), you could opt into sharing your copyrighted content with a GenAI\ncompany in exchange for getting referrals and revenue sharing each time your content is used. It might even help with \nmaking open source more sustainable, as open source creators could earn revenue and referrals each time a GenAI tool \nuses their code.\n\nIt’s critical that we find a more sustainable model as soon as possible. The snake can’t eat its own tail indefinitely. \nAnd the snake—GenAI—isn’t going away. We can’t put the genie back in the bottle. In fact, it’s only going to get \nbetter, more ubiquitous, and to provide more and more value to users and GenAI companies. But if we can’t find a way to \nprovide value to content creators too, then this will all fall apart.\n\nThat said, I don’t know enough about LLMs to say if a pay-per-use model is actually possible. Can LLMs track the source \nof the content they consumed? Will GenAI companies be willing to do a revenue sharing model? Will they be willing to\nbe transparent about their sources and usage? What do you think? Let me know in the comments.\n\nMany subreddits feel like a hollow shell of what they used to be. In part, this may be because a lot of the content in online communities now feels like it’s generated by bots (“AI slop”). But I think the bigger issue is that, just like StackOverflow, reading posts in online communities is no longer the best way to get answers. I used to use Reddit for research all the time; in fact, Google Search had gotten so bad, that you pretty much had to include “reddit” in your search queries to get a half-decent response. But nowadays, I use GenAI tools for much of my research. Just in the last few months alone, I’ve used ChatGPT and Claude to research solar panels, plan a trip to Norway, make changes to my diet, pick out new shoes for running, pick out new speakers for my living room, and dozens of other questions. Just a year ago, the vast majority of these questions would’ve brought me to Reddit. Nowadays, virtually none of them do, even though I suspect many of the responses I get from GenAI are based on Reddit content. ↩\n\nI’m seeing more and more projects avoiding open source dependencies entirely, and instead having GenAI generate the all code they need directly in their own codebase. There are some benefits to this approach—faster builds, more reproducible builds, less supply chain risk—but it makes sustainably funding open source even harder. You spend years to create and share an open source library with the world, and a bunch of GenAI tools copy your code, with you getting zero credit or value back. ↩\n\nHow much will I get paid as a result of this settlement? It’s hard to know exactly, as it depends on how many authors end up submitting claims, but the current estimate is $3,000 per book, though that number is split with the publisher, so in practice, it’ll be closer to $1,500 per book. If you assume that a book takes just 3 months of full-time work, or about 500 hours (which is likely an under-estimate), and all you get is $1,500, that works out to about $3/hour. Writing non-fiction tech books was never a particularly lucrative affair, but $1,500 is just downright insulting. Worse yet, the other benefits you used to get as an author—recognition as an expert, invitations to talks, job opportunities, marketing for your company or consulting—are significantly reduced too, as far fewer people read your book, or are even aware that you wrote a book, as the LLM usually doesn’t attribute any of its knowledge back to the source. ↩",

    "description": "A practical guide to AI agents, covering Agentic Patterns, Multi-agentic patterns, and Memory in Agents.",
    "fullText": "AI agents have become a core building block of modern AI systems, but the term is used in many different context.\nThis post breaks down what AI agents actually are, how they differ from traditional\nworkflows, and how agentic systems are designed in practice. We cover the key building\nblocks including LLMs, tools, and memory, and how they enable agents to reason, act, and\nadapt over time.\n\nThe focus is on patterns. These are common ways to structure workflows, single-agent\nsystems, and multi-agent architectures. Some patterns favor control and predictability,\nwhile others emphasize autonomy and dynamic decision-making. Understanding these trade-offs\nhelps in choosing the right architecture for a given problem.\n\nand multi-agent systems. You will know when to use them, how they fit together, and where\nthey tend to break down.\n\nBefore we directly jump into the definition of AI Agents, let's first understand AI Agents\nwith the help of an example.\n\nLet's say you are planning to go on a trip with your family to Dubai. You are taking the\nentire responsibility of the trip, so how would you plan it? What are the things you would\nthink about?\n\nSo the list of things to plan for the trip would be:\n\nNow, after listing the things, we need to take action. You go ahead and book flights, book\nhotels, get visas, etc.\n\nBut what would your thought process be like?\n\nYou wouldn't just search \"Dubai\" once. You would:\n\nResearch: browse multiple websites for flights, compare prices, and\nbook. Similarly for hotels, you would pick one near the places you want to visit with\ngood reviews.\n\nReason: if we land at 4:00 AM, we need a hotel that allows early\ncheck-in.\n\nExecute: book the flight (handling the payment), then use that to book\nthe hotel, and then use that confirmation to book the car.\n\nAdapt: if a flight is canceled, you have to re-adjust all the\nreservations like the hotel, the dinner reservations, etc.\n\nIf you use a traditional LLM, it’s like having a Travel Brochure. You ask it \"What are the best hotels in Dubai?\" and it gives you a list. But you still have to do all the work, the booking, the timing, and the fixing when things go wrong.\n\nAn AI Agent, however, is like having a Digital Travel Assistant as it is able to Research, Reason, Adapt, Execute and Remember at each step.\n\nYou give it a Goal: \"Plan and book a 5-day family trip to Dubai within a $5000 budget.\" and it entirely acts and executes the entire process and planning that we talked about.\n\nThis is often referred to as Agentic AI.\nHope this example gave a fair understanding of what Agents are. But there is lot more to it.\n\nIn this course Agentic AI by Andrew Ng, he starts by asking\n\nhow do humans actually work compared to LLMs?\n\nMost current LLM applications typically operate in a linear fashion, one-shot workflow (prompt → output). But that’s neither efficient nor realistic for building applications that involve multiple steps.\n\nBut as humans, we rarely create a polished final product in a single attempt.\nOur work usually flows through non-linear steps (sometimes can flow through linear steps as well), just like when we write an essay; brainstorming, researching, drafting, editing and refining, or like in our example finding flights in our budget, finding hotels in our budget that are nearby to the places we want to see, but also has good reviews etc.\n\nLinear steps are when work flows in a straight line: you finish Step 1, then Step 2, then Step 3, and you rarely need to go back.\nExample: Book flight → Pay → Get confirmation (done).\n\nNon-linear steps are when work loops and bounces between steps because each decision changes the constraints. You keep revisiting earlier choices until everything fits together.\nExample: Flight timing affects hotel check-in → hotel location affects itinerary → itinerary affects budget → budget forces you to change flights/hotels again.\n\nSo trip planning is mostly non-linear because changes in one part (flight cost, timing, cancellation, review score) force updates in other parts, it’s an iterative loop, not a one-shot pipeline.\n\nSo apps can be just simple ai agentic workflows, or could involve real ai agents.\n\nSo this brings us to the definition of Workflows and Agents :\n\nAgentic Workflows:Workflows are more deterministic, and are more focussed on the tasks that are predefined at hand.\n\nAI Agents: AI Agents have agency, which can make and take decisions inorder to accomplish the goal or outcomes, meaning they are highly autonomous, and they have the ability to do complex task automations as they have access to tools. They learn from their environment, and retains memory\n\nHere's how Anthropic defined the 2 for us, and maybe you could get a better understanding :\n\nSome major things to consider is that if you are building an agentic agent, then you may have less control over the decision it makes, because the agent might not make the decisions that you as a human might make in certain circumstances.\n\nWhere as in Agentic workflows, where we are intentionally putting humans in the loop, and asking it to follow a deterministic approach sounds better in certain cases.\n\nSo high agency and high control are 2 opposite ends of the spectrum.\n\nPros and Cons in Agentic Agent vs Agentic Workflow\n\nThe level of control or autonomy an agent has is called “agency”.\n\nLower the agency, lower is the value created by an agent, and more control\n\nHigher the agency, higher is the value created by and less control.\n\nIts super important to know when to consider building an agntic workflow and when to rely on ai agents.\n\nIf you know that the solution to your problem requires a step by step approach, then a simple workflow would suit best.\n\nThe major trade off between Ai Agents and a workflow is that , AI Agents can prove to have better performance and lesser manual work when dealing with complex, ambiguous and dynamic tasks but the downside is that it increases latency and ofcourse more the computational cost. And it\nintroduces unpredictability and potential errors. Agentic systems must incorporate robust error logging, evaluation strategies, exception handling, and retry mechanisms.\n\nUse workflows for predictability and consistency when dealing with well-defined tasks where the steps are known.\n\nUse agents when flexibility, adaptability, and model-driven decision-making are needed.\n\nThe basic building blocks of an AI Agents is an LLM which is augmented with certain super-powers.\n\nMemory :\nThe agent’s “notebook” (short-term + long-term) that stores context like user preferences, past interactions, and key facts,\nso the LLM can stay consistent and make better decisions across steps and future sessions.\n\nA large language model (LLM) on its own can only read and generate text,\nit has no direct access to the internet, APIs, databases, or other external systems.\n\nIt is just limited to knowing training data. LLMs can’t know events that happened after their training cutoff, nor does it know about your internal data on which the LLM has not been trained.\n\nBut there are so many LLM models available, so which one to choose ?\n\nChoose the LLMs smartly, not every task needs the most smartest model, if your task/subtask is of less complexity, then go for smaller models.\nChoosing the right model for the task at hand helps reduce cost.\n\nNow let's understand how these 'Next-word predictors' get superpowers via tools.\n\nIn the world of AI agents, tools are like weapons that extend an agent’s capabilities to do additional tasks.\n\nTools can come in various forms, for example :\n\nIf a tool doesn’t exist, we can build a custom tool (a function or API wrapper). We can expose\nthese tools through standards like MCP, and we can also add a retrieval tool for\nRAG (searching internal docs / vector DB) so the agent can fetch grounded context.\n\nHow do you pass the 'tool' to the LLM ?\n\nPrompt is the way. Yes prompt is the way you pass the tools to an LLM.\nBecause LLM's can only understad text, you give it an input, and it gives an output.\n\nFor example, if we provide a tool to check the weather at a location from the internet and then ask the LLM\nabout the weather in Dubai, the LLM will recognize that this is an opportunity to use the “weather” tool. Instead of retrieving the weather data itself, the LLM will generate text that represents a tool call, such as call weather_tool(‘Dubai’).\n\nThe Agent then reads this response, identifies that a tool call is required,\nexecutes the tool on the LLM’s behalf, and retrieves the actual weather data.\n\nThese Tool-calling steps are typically not shown to the user as they are mostly abstracted away by the frameworks.\nthe Agent then appends the result from the function call as a new message before passing the updated conversation to the LLM again.\n\nThe LLM then processes this additional context and generates a natural-sounding response for the user. From the user’s perspective, it appears as if the LLM directly interacted with the tool, but in reality, it was the Agent that handled the entire execution process in the background.\n\nExample image of how prompt can be formatted:\n\nTool Registry Pattern \n\nIn a real agent, you organize tools into a registry or \"toolbox\".\n\nWhen to provide the LLM with tools is that :\n\nIf the LLM is the brain and the Tools are the hands, then the memory is the second brain of the system.\n\nWithout memory the agent would start fresh each time, losing all its context from previous interactions. No context. No personalization.\n\nImagine hiring a top chef who forgets everything the moment they leave the kitchen. they forget the recipe, the customer’s preferences, and even what they cooked five minutes ago.\nEvery time you want a dish, you have to explain the recipe and preferences again.\nThat’s how most agents work today: powerful, but stateless.\n\nLLMs can only look at a limited amount of information at once. That limited space is called the context window.\nIt’s basically the model’s short-term working space for the next response.\n\nSo we can’t dump everything into the prompt and hope it works. Too little context and the model misses key details.\nToo much (or irrelevant) context increases cost, slows responses, and can even reduce quality by adding noise or contradictions.\n\nThe goal is to pass just the right information for the next step not too little, not too much.\nThis is what people call Context Engineering, and we’ll go deeper into it in a dedicated section.\n\nAnd this is exactly where memory becomes powerful: memory stores the important stuff outside the context window\n(past conversations, preferences, decisions, notes), and we retrieve only what’s relevant and place it back into\nthe context window when needed.\n\nWith memory the agent can remember past conversations and take actions as per the context from previous conversations, hence producing more detailed and cohesive responses.\n\nThe benefits of using memory in agents include : deep personalization, continuity, complex reasoning and imrpoved efficiency.\n\nMemory is a fundamental part of the framework, with a vector databases (such as Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, etc.) providing robust storage and retrieval mechanisms for task-related data.\n\nThanks to Leonnie Monigatti for this image :\n\nSo since LLMs lack memory, so a memory has to be added into our architecture. And we can do that in 2 ways:\n\nShort-term memory lives inside the context window.\nIt holds temporary information needed for the next few steps (recent messages, tool outputs, or a running summary/state).\nIt is session-scoped and gets cleared or compressed over time.\n\nLong-term memory lives outside the LLM, usually in an external store (often a vector database).\nIt lets an agent save and reuse information across days, weeks, or separate conversations.\nThat’s how you get real personalization and continuity over time.\nWhen the agent needs it, it retrieves the most relevant memories (semantic search + retirval) and injects them into the LLM’s short-term memory (context window) for the current step.\n\nThis Long term memory can be broken down into 3 types:\n\nNow that we’ve seen short-term memory (context window) and long-term memory (external storage), the next question is:\n\nhow do we manage both without adding noise or wasting tokens?\n\nMemory management in AI agents simply means:\n\nThe goal is to keep only the information that is useful for the next steps.\nIf the context window contains wrong, irrelevant, or conflicting information, the model can get confused.\n\nAlso, as a conversation gets longer, the prompt gets bigger (more tokens). That increases cost, can slow responses,\nand can even hit the context window limit.\nAndrej karpathy summarizes this well in this tweet.\n\nTo avoid this, you can manage the conversation history in a few ways:\n\nThat’s how we manage short-term memory (the context window). Next, let’s see how agents update long-term memory in other words, how they write memories.\n\nSo how does the agent actually write to the external long-term memory ??\n\nLLMs can’t write to a database by themselves. They only generate text.\nSo the “writing” happens because the agent system (your app) gives the LLM a\nmemory tool (ex: save_memory()), and the LLM decides when to use it.\nWhen it triggers that tool, the system stores the memory in an external store\n(vector DB / key-value DB / SQL), and later retrieves it back into the context window when needed.\n\nExplicit memory / Hot path write\n\nThe agent identifies that something is important during the conversation and saves it\nimmediately using tool calling (ex: “User prefers Python” → save_memory()).\nThis updates long-term memory right away, so it can be used in the next turn.\n\nImplicit memory / Background write\n\nThe agent responds first, and a background process later summarizes/extracts useful facts\nand writes them to long-term memory. This avoids latency, but the memory may not\nbe available instantly for the next message.\n\nBut how does the agent know what’s “important enough” to save in the hot path?\n\nIt doesn’t magically know. You teach it a memory policy a short set of rules that tells the model what is worth saving\nand what must never be saved. Then you give the model a memory tool (for example save_memory(text, type, confidence)).\nIf the current message matches the policy, the model triggers the tool call, and your app writes it to the external store.\n\nIn practice, agents use a few simple signals to decide:\n\nA good rule of thumb: if it’s not likely to matter in a future session, don’t store it.\n\nWe talked about how LLMs know about the tools, but now in the next section,\nlets discuss about how these LLMs learnt and take decisions, and how they interact with the environment and memory.\n\n'Re' stands for reasoning, and 'Act' stands for action.\nThis framework will help the agents interact with the external environments, and help them to plan and reason.\n\nThis approach is all about combining the LLM’s reasoning ability with tool use in a single, coherent loop.\n\nTo understand why ReAct is needed, let’s first recall Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.\n\nComparison between standard prompting and CoT prompting. On the left, the model is instructed to directly provide the final answer (standard prompting).\nOn the right, the model is instructed to show the step by step reasoning process to get to the final correct answer (CoT prompting).\n\nAs we can observe,\nwriting a chain of thought a series of intermediate reasoning steps helps the model in outputting the correct answer.\nThis this Wei et al. (2022) highlighted how guiding a model through a series of intermediate reasoning steps significantly improved its performance on tasks such as mathematical problem-solving, logical reasoning, and multi-hop question answering.\n\nBut the COT has a limitation, and that is it cannot have access to the external world, So it cannot take actions.\nThat's where ReACT comes in.\n\nAnd how ReACT does that is using TAO Principles.\n\nThought -> Action -> Observation -> repeat\n\nThe Thought-Action-Observation (TAO) loop is the heartbeat of the ReAct agent.\n\nIt’s the cycle that lets an agent iteratively approach a solution. Here’s the breakdown of each phase:\n\nThought: The agent’s LLM “thinks” about what to do next. This is a reasoning step, like planning or analyzing the problem state. For example: “Hmm, to answer this question I might need data X; perhaps I should use tool Y to get it.”\n\nAction: Based on that thought, the agent takes an action by invoking a tool. E.g., Action: call the search tool with query “data X”.\n\nObservation: The agent then gets the result of that action – new information from the tool. E.g., the search results come back with a relevant snippet. The agent observes this and incorporates it.\n\nThis loop breaks only when the final answer is found.\n\nt’s essentially a feedback loop for problem solving. So during the loop, if something goes wrong, or a new requirement comes up, then it should think observe and take action and pivot accordingly.\n\nFor this to work, Memory is super important, for memory of previous interaction in the loop. Without memory,\nthe agent would forget what happened in the previous interaction.\nhence choosing the memory as per the use-case becomes super important.\n\nAs we all know that Software Engineering is made up of 'patterns' and 'protocols', and having patterns in a way provides us with a structured, proven way to think and design systems, and helps in preventing common design mistakes.\n\nThey promote best practises, and shared understanding amongst developers.\n\nPrompt chaining is a pattern where a bigger problem is solved by doing multiple LLM calls sequentially, where each calls output becomes the input to the other LLM call.\n\nEach step is simpler → often more accurate\n\nintermediate steps where you get to take a decisions using certain conditions, to ensure that the process remains on track.\n\nRouting is a pattern where an initial LLM acts like a dispatcher: it classifies the user’s input (intent/domain/complexity) and sends it to the most appropriate specialized workflow, prompt, tool, or model to complete the task.\n\nSeparation of concerns : each downstream route can be optimized independently (prompts, tools, logic).\n\nBetter efficiency and cost : simple requests can go to cheaper/faster models, complex ones to stronger models.\n\nCustomer support systems: Routing queries to agents specialized in billing, technical support, or product information.\n\nMore reliable behavior : different input types (code, support, writing, images) get handled by purpose-built flows.\n\nParallelization is a pattern where a task is split into independent subtasks and sent to multiple LLM calls at the same time.\n\nOnce all branches finish, their outputs are collected and either combined programmatically or passed to a final “aggregator” LLM to synthesize the best final answer.\n\nFaster end-to-end latency : independent subtasks run concurrently instead of waiting step-by-step.\n\nBetter quality : you can generate multiple perspectives and merge them, or use majority voting to reduce errors.\n\nScales well for batch work : summarizing multiple sections/documents or repeating the same reasoning across many inputs.\n\nCleaner synthesis stage : results can be validated, deduped, and then combined into one coherent output.\n\nOrchestrator-workers is a pattern where one central LLM (the orchestrator) reads the user’s request, breaks it into subtasks dynamically, assigns each subtask to a specialized worker LLM, and then combines the workers’ outputs into a final response.\n\nUnlike parallelization, the subtasks are not pre-defined, the orchestrator decides what work needs to be done based on the specific input.\n\nHandles unpredictable complexity : the orchestrator can decide which subtasks are needed on the fly.\n\nDivision of labor : workers can be role-based (planner, researcher, coder, reviewer) with specialized prompts/tools.\n\nMore scalable systems : you can add or swap workers without changing the whole workflow.\n\nBetter final quality : an orchestrator can validate, reconcile conflicts, and synthesize a coherent output.\n\nExample : Scan the repo, find the entrypoints (main.py/app.py), list routes/dependencies, and return a short JSON summary of what files will need changes.\nThe orchestrator first delegates this scanning subtask to a worker so it can dynamically decide the next subtasks (which files to edit, what workers to call next), since that isn’t knowable upfront.\n\nThe React Pattern that we discussed in the above sections, also comes as one of the Agentic Patterns.\n\nEvaluator-Optimizer (also called Reflection) is a pattern where the agent generates an initial draft, then runs a critique step to evaluate it against requirements (clarity, accuracy, tone, constraints), and uses that feedback to iteratively refine the output until it’s satisfactory or a max-iteration limit is reached.\n\nImproves quality : catches mistakes, missing requirements, and weak reasoning before the answer is finalized.\n\nMakes outputs more reliable : the evaluator can act like a reviewer (accuracy, clarity, security, style).\n\nGreat for subjective work : writing, tone, structure, and “does this meet the rubric?” tasks benefit a lot.\n\nExample : The agent writes a function is_valid_email(), runs unit tests, sees failures, reflects on the edge cases, and rewrites the function until tests pass.\n\nLike we discussed in the above sections that an LLM can only read text and write text right. It can’t actually look up live data, run code, or book something on its own.\n\nIn the Tool Use Pattern, we give the LLM access to tools (functions/APIs) like discussed in the above sections. (where the table image demonstrates the tool examples.)\nWe also tell the LLM what each tool looks like:\n\nUser asks a question\n\n“Book a meeting for tomorrow” or “What’s Tesla stock price?”\n\nLLM decides it needs a tool\n\nBecause it can’t do that reliably from memory.\n\nLLM outputs a structured “function call” (often JSON)\n\nExample: {\"name\":\"get_stock_price\",\"arguments\":{\"ticker\":\"TSLA\"}}\n\nYour app runs the tool\n\nThe LLM does not run it, our backend executes the API/function.\n\nTool returns results\n\nExample: {\"price\":245.30}\n\nLLM uses that result to write the final answer\n\n“TSLA is trading at $245.30 right now.”\n\nThis pattern is commonly implemented using Function Calling., and it lets the LLM do real actions and use real-time data, way beyond what it learned during training.\n\nLimitations of classic Tool Use are :\n\nTools are hardcoded into the application\n\nThe LLM only knows about tools you explicitly define\n\nAdding new tools requires code changes + redeployment\n\nTools are tightly coupled to one model or framework\n\nThe Tool Use Pattern defines how models think about using tools\nMCP defines how tools are described, discovered, and invoked\n\nTools live in external tool servers\n\nTools can be discovered dynamically\n\nTools describe themselves via standardized schemas\n\nModels and apps are decoupled from tool implementations\n\nThe same tool can be reused by multiple models and clients\n\nConceptually, the interaction loop stays the same.\nYou can read more about MCP in one of my blogs here where i have distinguished clearly the differences between an MCP and an API -> MCP vs API\n\nThe multi-agent pattern represents perhaps the most sophisticated approach to building AI systems.\n\nInstead of relying on a single agent to handle everything, this pattern uses multiple specialized agents that collaborate to accomplish a common goal.\n\nThis pattern uses autonomous or semi-autonomous agents.\nEach of these agents are specialized in a certain task meaning they'll have specialized knowledge, or access to specific tools.\n\nEach of these agents can interact, collaborate and coordinate with each other (either using a coordinator/manager or using handoffs logic. )\nHandoff logic means one Agents handsover the control to another agent.\n\nExample : In our first example of a travel assistant agent, say one agent is flight agent and it finds the besst flights for us, and then the hotel agent would be\nresponsible for booking the hotel.\n\nSome key characteristics of this pattern would be :\n\nParallel Execution : Subtasks can be handled simultaneously\n\nDelegation : The main manager agent delegates the task to other agents based on the subtasks.\n\nDistributed Context: Each agent has its own context, which is like the subset of the total information. (incase of swarm type handoff logic based multi agent setup, there usually is a unified context.)\n\nHere' an image of the coordinator/manager approach.\n\nHere's an image of the hand-off based multi agent collaboration :\n\nLet's talk more about these multi-agent systems in the next section, about how they share information and context, and how they call the other agent,\nhow one agent knows that it has to call the other ? What are the multi agent patterns etc everything.\n\nA subagent is a specialized Agent that is purpose-built for a single, well-defined task. It is mostly used with a main orchestrator agent which delegates the task to the subagents,\nThese subagents has its own context window. Meaning the subagents are stateless (they do not remember the context on each request, every request is a different request.)\n\nClaude Code loads the list of subagents at session start, but it only runs a subagent when needed.\n\nThis architecture provides centralized control where all routing passes through the main agent, which can invoke multiple subagents in parallel.\n\nThe only trade off is that one extra hop to the subagents is involved, and everytime a request arrives it has to flow through the main agent, and then to subagent, and exactly in the opposite fashion while sending the response.\nSo when this model hop is involved, extra tokens are being used, hence more cost, and ofcourse more latency.\n\nDeep Agents provides an out-of-the-box implementation for adding subagents with just a few lines of code. (if needed delegates complex subtasks to specialized subagents)\n\nAgent as a tool is a name provided by OpenAI for this pattern.\nOpenAI documentation and in Claude Code docs\n\nAgain there can be various ways in which this pattern can be used :\n\nRun Parallely : \n\nWe can call multiple subagents in parallel to work simultaneously. This kind of pattern is good when the task of both the subagents are independent.\n\nChain Subagents \n\nIn this one, the subagents run in sequence meaning, one subagent completes its task and returns to the main orchestrator, which then returns and sends to the next subagent.\n\nIn this pattern the agent loads the prompts and knowledge on demand, only when needed. It is also called as progressive discolsure.\nLet's take a look at the image, and then understand what it is and how it really works.\n\nYou can see from the image that only one main agnet is used, so how can it be a multi-agent pattern ??\n\nso the thing is we are trying to use the main agent as if it is specialized in so many skills, so its like we are loading the context of that skill only when its needed.\n\nEach skill is like a small “playbook”:\n\na prompt (how to think / how to respond)\n\nrules (what to do / what not to do)\n\nexamples / knowledge (so it doesn’t hallucinate)\n\nsometimes scripts/tools (commands it can run)\n\nThe main idea: the agent does not carry all skills in its head all the time.\nIt only loads the skill context when that skill is needed.\n\nSo it feels like a multi-agent system, because the same agent can switch between “modes”\n(SQL mode, Payments mode, Debug mode, etc.).\nBut technically it’s still one agent, just with on-demand context loading.\n\nIn this pattern, one main agent talks to the user.\n\nWhen the main agent understands that the request is not its job, it can say:\n“I don’t handle this, but another agent does… so I will hand it off.”\n\nThen the task gets passed to the right agent (the specialist agent),\nand that agent becomes active and works on it.\n\nAfter the specialist finishes, the main agent can show the final answer to the user\n(or the specialist can reply directly, depending on how the system is built).\n\nExactly like the image we saw above in the Multi Agent pattern section.\n\nThis pattern is very similar to the “agent + tools” setup we saw earlier.\nThe only difference is: instead of routing to tools, we route to agents.\n\nSo you can think of it like this:\n\nIn tools pattern: the agent decides which tool to call.\n\nIn router pattern: the router decides which agent to call (refund agent, booking agent, debugger agent, etc.)\n\nThe router’s job is simple:\nit reads the user request, picks the best agent, and forwards the task to that agent.\n\nThanks to Langchain for creating this beautiful table.\n\nFact: In these multi-agent patterns the agent to agent calling is synchronous right, so if you want an event-driven distributed system for these multi agents.

    "title": "Wikipedia Signs of AI writing: a Vale ruleset",
    "description": "Taking Wikipedia's dynamic documentation of AI writing patterns and turning it into a prose linting tool.",
    "fullText": "My minor superpower is setting up change detection on websites to get email notifications when they update. For the past three months that’s meant daily pings from Wikipedia’s “Signs of AI Writing” page. As an “advice” page, it’s where Wikipedia editors document the tells: the phrases, patterns and artifacts that suggest that AI was involved at some point with what they’re reading.\n\nMalicious or subversive edits to Wikipedia have been a challenge since the formation of the site. But the community has a robust nervous system for identifying and rejecting those that compromise the integrity of the encyclopedia.1 The latest response is this painstakingly, exhaustively updated page documenting various signs.\n\nThe proliferation of LLM tools means that AI-tainted edits are a new variant for Wikipedia contributors to navigate. If AI tools allow individuals to contribute productively in ways otherwise not possible, they could be welcome. But as the page goes to great lengths to document, there’s a fresh category of edit slop that would deteriorate the quality of the encyclopedia if allowed unchecked.\n\nThe emails summarising the edits give me an interesting perspective on how perception of AI use has morphed rapidly over time. The page documents the front line of AI detection in a real-world setting.\n\nWhat would it look like to turn this into tooling?\n\nMany tells are obvious. Take the glitches that would appear in older versions of ChatGPT outputs.\n\nOnce you understand that this is a strange bit of text blurted out by the model it’s an immediate sign that the surrounding content has been tainted by a model at some point in its history.\n\nThese examples are temporary windows into the textual guts of AI models. The MissingNo. seahorses of ChatGPT.\n\nNow documented, recognised, and patched by the model creators, these artifacts of artificiality are becoming extinct with time.\n\nNudging back into the world of user error, it’s common to see phrasing that’s been accidentally copy-pasted from the LLM user interface and surrounding text.\n\nThis can include instructional framing meant not for the reader but the user.\n\nOther tells become more obvious the more you read online and the more you train yourself to spot them.\n\nThe most famous example of this is ChatGPT’s rampant use of the em-dash, raising the hackles of belligerent punctuation lovers worldwide.\n\nTo me the bigger scourge is that of contrastive language:\n\nIt's not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it's part of the aggression and atmosphere.\n\nThis language construction is catnip to the LLMs at large. It occasionally spans multiple sentences but it almost always appears in marketing and branding content on LinkedIn due to the goal of making an impact.\n\nAs a result this construction is hackneyed and many will choose to avoid it in order to prevent being lumped in with the undiscerning, careless masses.\n\nTechnical writers face similar challenges with AI-generated content outside of Wikipedia. Like any group that cares about craft, they’ve built tools for systematic text analysis.\n\nVale.sh is a library known as a “linter for prose.” It could be thought of as a souped-up spelling and grammar checker.\n\nLinting is a term borrowed from software development (first used back in 1978!) and is the process of highlighting areas for improvement, based on a customisable ruleset. In programming, linters catch “code smells” – implementations that technically work but suggest deeper issues. Many programming languages have syntactic variation meaning that you may write a piece of code differently to your peers. These degrees of freedom can hamper collaboration, or permit confusion, by making it hard to understand the intent behind the code.\n\nSharing these linting rules across teams of developers aids collaboration and goes a long way to avoid holy wars about semicolons.\n\nVale has been around in the technical writing community since 2017 and there’s a strong ecosystem of rulesets that one can “opt-in” to. These include style guides, checks for passive voice, gendered or condescending language.\n\nI’m not aware of any existing implementation of a ruleset to help highlight AI smells, so I built one.\n\nI fed the contents of the Wikipedia page to Claude and asked it to make recommendations on the rules that should be generated.2 After a few confidence checks I gave it the green light to generate Pull Requests on GitHub for manual review and verification.\n\nOne key part of this process was separating the rules that were relevant for a collaborative encyclopedia and those that had wider application in other forms of writing.\n\nAn example of this is the meta-commentary from earlier that reference writing for Wikipedia in the body of the text itself. There’s likely a version of this ruleset that could be tuned for exclusive use for Wikipedia edits but my goal was to provide a general purpose tool with applications elsewhere.\n\nIt’s hard to understand the true ability of the countless AI detection tools on the market. Many appear to be taking advantage of the widespread use of ChatGPT in educational settings to prey on students trying to evade (flawed) AI detection tools.\n\nVendors at various points of the snake oil spectrum are touting the strengths of their products but there’s little neutral and independently verifiable research to back up their claims.\n\nAt this point at the end of 2025 it’s unclear to me whether the use of AI and machine learning models will ever be satisfactory for detecting the use of AI in writing.\n\nUnlike these proprietary AI detection tools with their black-box algorithms and problematic false positive rates, this Vale.sh ruleset is transparent and interpretable. Each rule traces back to observed patterns and the configuration is available on GitHub for review and expansion.\n\nOne interesting challenge is that of linguistic adaptation. As AI writing becomes more commonplace and individuals gain greater confidence in their ability to spot it, certain words and turns of phrase will be avoided to prevent accusations.\n\nThe ruleset can therefore help authentic writers pre-empt this situation and consider avoiding turns of phrase and other tells. This feels like a sorry state of affairs but helpful tooling is one way for writers to be kept informed and in control of their output.3\n\nClaude and I categorised the current rules in the following three tiers. This means that the rule confidence can be matched by the Vale behaviour.\n\nError: Definite AI artifacts – chatbot phrases, technical glitches, placeholders, tracking URLs.\n\nWarning: Likely AI patterns – hedging clusters, knowledge cutoff references, enumeration style.\n\nSuggestion: Suspicious but common in human writing – vocabulary, transitions, passive voice, symbolic language.\n\nWhile powerful, the Vale configuration isn’t as expressive or flexible as required for some advanced AI detection constructions. One example is the inability to specify stray Markdown syntax outside of areas where Markdown syntax is being used. Without this ability this rule would flag any and all use of Markdown which would be useless.\n\nNow that the rules are shared I want to see how writers and editors use these to understand the writing they produce and review.\n\nThere’s an ecosystem of tooling that can use the Vale rulesets including the flexible command line interface and a Chrome browser extension. It would be interesting to enable the use of the rules in other form factors. For example, it would be helpful if the rules could be run server-side on websites to avoid the need to install Vale on your local machine.\n\nAnother possibility would be to support alternative versions of the rulesets for the other available prose linters.\n\nThe rules will need to adapt over time to reflect changing AI dialect and GPTisms – it’s unclear whether these rules will be relevant or productive in a year.\n\nOthers have attempted to compile lists of “slop words” to guide AI tools away from cliché. I could consider merging these with my current ruleset but need to consider the selection criteria for including each word.\n\nI ran my new ruleset against this article (the one you’re reading now) and… nothing.\n\n✔ 0 errors, 0 warnings and 0 suggestions in 1 file.\n\nIt’s oddly satisfying that nothing was flagged – although it could be that I naturally edited out anything that whiffed of AI along the way.\n\nAs it stands, the ruleset is mostly generated from the “Signs of AI Writing” page and it’s therefore released under the same CC by SA license. This means you can create further derivative works as long as you credit the source and keep the same license.\n\nYou can find the ruleset over on GitHub with instructions for getting started. Comments, feedback and pull requests are welcome.\n\nSee the 404 Media coverage of the new “Speedy Deletion” policy to avoid red tape when content is substandard due to the use of AI. ↩\n\nYes, I see your raised eyebrow. I’m using AI to build a tool to understand the use of AI, the irony hasn’t escaped me. Is there a risk that the use of Claude will bias the whole project making it useless? It’s something to consider but I think this reflects the reality of the widespread use of these tools: with the time I have available would I choose to do this work unassisted? At this point my answer is no. ↩\n\nI’m editing this in iA Writer which has built-in “style check” functionality that flags clichés and fillers. I don’t always accept the suggestions it makes but it’s helpful to understand what it flags. ↩",

    "description": "A practical guide to designing distributed systems by breaking them down into functional areas: architecture, communication, ingress, events, databases, caching, testing, and instrumentation.",
    "fullText": "There are a million and one ways to design distributed systems. This post attempts to distill the\nknowledge I've gained over the years into some logical, coherent chunks. While it's probably not\ncomprehensive I intend to keep this post updated as I evolve my thinking.\n\nI don't have really strong opinions about a preference between microservices and monoliths; of\ncourse, the internet has many wide-ranging opinions that feel rather binary. To me, the binary\nnature of discourse around architecture also feels kind of strange given that monoliths and\nmicroservices are about service architecture rather than systems architecture. I mention\nthis distinction because I typically find myself designing systems, not individual services.\n\nThis post dives into how I conceptualize systems by breaking them down into functional areas. Each\narea has its own considerations, but they all work together to form a cohesive whole.\n\nA quintessential bar debate in software engineering is whether to build using a monolith or\nmicroservices. All sorts of people and personalities have lorded over this opinion over the years\nand frankly I think most of the ink spilled on the topic is wasted and lacks nuance.\n\nBefore I even really get into this I wanted to also draw a distinction between systems\narchitecture and application architecture. Sometimes they're the same, but sometimes they're not\nand it's a distinction worth understanding. Consider a system with a web API and a background job\nprocessor—two separate applications by design. You could deploy them as separate services on\ndifferent machines, but you might choose to run both on the same virtual machine to reduce costs and\noperational complexity.\n\nIn the diagram above we see a monolithic system with an API and a job controller running together.\nThe API can trigger jobs through the job controller, and those jobs appear and complete within the\nsame system boundary. From the outside, this style of system is pretty easy to run and understand.\nYou could easily model and deploy this with systemd and leverage the fast communication paths of a\nsingle system to your advantage. As we'll see, it creates scaling challenges when different parts of\nthe system have different resource needs.\n\nWhen traffic grows, you can still scale horizontally by adding more machines, each running both\napplications. The application architecture (separate services) doesn't dictate the systems\narchitecture (how you deploy and scale them). This flexibility allows you to optimize for cost,\noperational simplicity, or performance independently of how the code is structured. Running\nsomething like a jobs controller on every virtual machine would then require that jobs are\nidempotent and avoid scenarios where jobs can or should only be run once. This again adds to\noperational complexity, which is a major factor in moving away from monoliths.\n\nOne of the common tag lines I hear is that monoliths don't scale, which is why you should just\nstart with SOA or microservices. I think this is a bit of a false dichotomy. Monoliths can scale,\nthey just require more discipline and care to do so.\n\nThere's three main architectural patterns to consider with respect to systems design:\nmonolithic, service-oriented, and microservices. Personally, I like to start any project\nwith a well-organized monolith. When building a monolith it's important to realize that different\nparts of the system may one day need to be scaled independently for one reason or another. For this\nreason, when I write monoliths I like to predivide the system into services; the delineation of\nservices could be as simple as APIs and data access objects (DAOs).\n\nIn general if you are disciplined when building a monolith then architecture can be thought of as a\nprogression. When a monolith begins to grow operationally burdensome or resource constrained you\nhave the option to split some of those monolith services into distinct services; some might\nrecognize this pattern as service-oriented architecture or SOA. While SOA definitely opens up\nscaling opportunities its primary benefit is a separation of concerns. The separation of concerns\nis, organizationally, a big win that facilitates a more manageable operating model that enables\ndevelopers to think more along the interfaces of systems independently rather than alongside the\nimplementation details of each of the services components.\n\nEventually success can put strains on your distinct services to the point that you recognize\nindependent components that could logically scale separately.\n\nAt this point there's a confluence of factors that need to be considered that will help you decide\nif you should go the microservices route:\n\nIn general, I try to use microservices sparingly. The access patterns I mentioned above are somewhat\nunderstated. For instance, that database separation will result in the loss of relational aspects of\na relational database. These losses are largely in trade for the advantages of a high scalability\nand performance.\n\nCommunicating with your system and between components of the system is a fundamental part of system\ndesign. In general, you can think about communication in terms of external and internal\ncommunication.\n\nCommunication be broken down into two aspects: transport and serialization with two\ncomplementary styles: synchronous and asynchronous. Before we go any farther, let's briefly\nreflect on the OSI model:\n\nTransports can be broken out into two layers: transport (layer 4) and application (layer 7).\nAs far as service communication goes, I bias towards layer 7 transport for a few reasons:\n\nThis can be distilled down into the idea that in modern software I do my best to avoid developing\ntoo many novel frameworks that don't directly benefit my business goals. Some might orient this\naround a platitude like, \"don't reinvent the wheel\" which is often expressed so vaguely that it\ndismisses potentially beneficial ideas. The calculus of the relativity of novel frameworks, and\nmicro-optimizations in general, are an exercise left to those with skin in the game.\n\nSerialization technologies come in many different flavors but I have two that I use predominantely:\nJSON and Protobuf.\n\nJSONs benefits are that it's human readable, flexible, and relatively easy to work with. It's\ndownside is that its flexibility comes at the cost of performance and complexity where the libaries\nthat process it are concerned. Protobuf's benefits are that it's binary, efficient, and type-safe.\nIts downside is that it's not human readable and requires a bit more effort to work with.\n\nThis is a long way of saying I have two preferences:\n\nThere are some minor caveats here that I've used components of each of these for streaming data that\ndoesn't fit the mold of a traditional RESTful API.\n\nWe didn't get into synchronous and asynchronous communication, but I'll touch on it briefly in\nEvents.\n\nIngresses have some overlap with communication, however, they are a distinct topic in and of\nthemselves.\n\nIngresses are where external traffic enters your system. I like to tier and chain ingresses\ntogether. Referring back to the OSI model, at this stage we're focusing on layer 4 and layer 7\nagain.\n\nIn my ideal setup we leverage a layer 4 load balancer for its ability to negotiate proxy protocol\nand leverage its layer 4 capabilities when we need them. At the boundary closes to a service I like\nto implement TLS termination, authentication, and other layer 7 capabilities. Whether you're\nthinking in terms of virtual machines or Kubernetes containers, this logic works is easy for\ndevelopers to negotiate, provides a clear chain of separation and observability, and creates a clear\npath for future evolution.\n\nEvents are a somewhat tricky topic. Most systems start out entirely synchronous and as they grow\ndemonstrate some need for asynchronousness. How and when we accomplish the transition from\nsynchronous to asynchronous is a decision that needs to be made on a case-by-case basis and often\nrequires a careful consideration of the trade-offs involved. The biggest thing to avoid is to have a\nuser waiting a long time for a response, receiving an inconsistent response of important\ninformation, or receiving no response at all. Many times, there's a minimum of information that can\nbe relayed immediately that doesn't break consistency guarantees of an API.\n\nThere are, generally speaking, two complementary sets of styles of event-driven architecture:\npush and pull and ordered and unordered. Push is where the event producer pushes\nevents to the event consumer. Pull is where the event consumer pulls events from the event producer.\nOrdered is where the events are processed in the order they are received. Unordered is where the\nevents are processed in the order they are received.\n\nOne really common usecase for event-driven systems is to complete functions that are not sensitive\nto order or consistency. For instance, sending emails, or updating a search index.\n\nDatabases are where state lives. I always conceptualize a system as a single system first, and that\nincludes how data flows through it. Even within a monolith there is often a language feature that\nfacilitates breaking a large application down into components; it seems silly not to use it as the\nprogramming gods intended.\n\nI think about databases in terms of access patterns and consistency requirements. Not everything\nneeds ACID guarantees, and not everything needs to be immediately consistent. By thinking about\nthese requirements upfront, I can make better decisions about what kind of database or storage\nsolution fits each use case.\n\nMost of my experience has been with relational databases, specifically MySQL and Postgres. Both are\nexcellent choices and I don't have a strong preference between them. Postgres tends to have better\nsupport for complex data types and more advanced features out of the box, while MySQL has broader\nadoption and ecosystem support. For most applications either one will serve you well.\n\nThe key is maintaining clear contracts around data access. If I have one module that calls another\nmodule's data, I ensure it uses the same interface that would be exposed if that module were\nexternalized. This keeps the door open for future evolution without requiring a complete rewrite.\n\nCaching is about reducing latency and load. I think about caching at multiple levels: in-memory\ncaches for hot data, distributed caches for shared state, and CDN-level caching for static or\nnear-static content.\n\nThe trick with caching is knowing what to cache and when to invalidate. I tend to cache at the\nboundaries—between services, between layers, and between the system and the outside world. This\nstrategy helps me scale horizontally without creating bottlenecks.\n\nI really like Redis for distributed caching. It's fast, reliable, and has a good feature set for\nmost use cases. But caching as a subject is pretty universal regardless of the technology you\nchoose. It's all in the strategy of knowing your data lifecycles. Understanding when data is\ncreated, how it changes, and when it becomes stale is what makes caching effective. Without that\nunderstanding you'll either cache too aggressively and serve stale data, or not cache enough and\nleave performance on the table.\n\nI also think about cache consistency. Sometimes eventual consistency is fine; other times you need\nstronger guarantees. The decision depends on what you're caching and how critical freshness is for\nthat particular piece of data.\n\nI prefer a pyramid approach to testing. The bottom of the pyramid is unit testing because it has the\nwidest benefit and is the fastest to run. These tests validate individual functions and components\nin isolation, catching bugs early when they're cheapest to fix. Next is integration tests, which\nverify that components work together correctly. Last is E2E tests that are very expensive to run,\ncatch fewer (but typically more critical bugs), can be less reliable because they rely on conditions\noutside the control scope of testing, and by the time bugs are caught in this phase they're more\nexpensive to fix.\n\nWhen I test, I test from two perspectives:\n\nNumber two is where I establish some contracts (and examples) for how components of my system\ncommunicate. Without this kind of testing it's easy for programmers who come after me to drift\noutside of the design considerations of the system; thereby the software would degrade prematurely.\n\nOf course, if my system maintains some kind of transport layer then I test those contracts as well.\nFor instance, in Go and Python web services I try to write as many tests as I can directly to the\nREST API I've built. By testing in this fashion I'm testing every contract I have between components\nand the contracts I have with my users.\n\nTesting contracts between components helps me think about how my code will be used. By making myself\na user I inherently build better experiences for the users of my code.\n\nInstrumentation is always OTEL for me. I like metrics and logging. I haven't seen huge benefits from\ntracing over a good logging and metrics strategy. When you have solid logging with structured data\nand comprehensive metrics, you can usually piece together what's happening without the added\ncomplexity and overhead of distributed tracing.\n\nRegardless of the final product orientation, whether it's a monolith, all microservices, or a\nmixture thereof, I monitor the system as a whole rather than as individual parts first and\ninstrument individual components secondarily. The reason for this is because I frontload the work of\nmy projects with testable contracts and monitoring gives me a glimpse into that contract\nperformance— especially at the component level.\n\nWhen you introduce eventual consistency (like jobs) or network calls there's all kind of retries and\nexception handling that can occur where a contract is not necessarily violated but could be in\ndegradation (or worse, increasing degradation over time). Good instrumentation helps me catch these\nissues before they become problems.\n\nRunning observability infrastructure continues to be expensive. Many companies evaluate a proper\nobservability spend to be something like 15% of your cloud costs, which is pretty incredible! This\nis why I focus on metrics and logging—they give me the most bang for my buck without the overhead\nthat tracing introduces.\n\nThis is the way I've been building systems for the last few years and it's worked out quite well in\nterms of stability and maintainability. Possibly most importantly it also leaves room for the\nnatural evolution of a system over time without too much strife. By thinking about systems in terms\nof these functional areas, I can make better decisions about how to structure code, where to place\nboundaries, and how to scale as needs grow.",

    "fullText": "John Abernathy, a photographer from Minneapolis, was flat on the ground. He had the knees of at least one federal officer on his back. He heard someone shouting to put his hands behind his back, but his arms were half pinned beneath him. He was surrounded by dozens of officers deploying something ― tear gas, he thinks ― that made it hard to see or breathe. He felt like he could puke or pass out.\n\nHe feared what might happen if federal agents got hold of his equipment. So when he locked eyes with another photographer, he took his camera ― a Leica M10-R with a 28-millimeter lens ― and threw it, pitching his cellphone away from him shortly after.\n\nPierre Lavie, a fellow photojournalist, snatched the Leica by the strap and brought it close to his body. As he reached for Abernathy’s phone, which had only traveled a couple of feet, a federal officer repeatedly tried to stomp on it.\n\n“I had to Hungry Hippo my hand in and out to avoid my hand getting stepped on, and I managed to finally grab it and get it away,” Lavie told HuffPost.\n\nNews: Ex-Flight Attendant Accused Of Yearslong ‘Catch Me If You Can’-Style Scam\n\nIt’s a familiar scene to both. Abernathy, who previously did photography work for advertisements and magazines, said he set out to document the protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s crackdown in Minneapolis and the killing of Renee Good “just to show what’s happening to whoever might see it.” Lavie, a member of the National Press Photographers Association from Dallas, had come from New Orleans, where he was also capturing ICE activity, to cover the unrest.\n\nOn Thursday, Jan. 15, both were outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, which has recently been used to hold people detained by ICE officers.When Abernathy saw what he called “agitators” ― pro-ICE demonstrators ― carrying bear spray, he grabbed a can from someone and tossed it aside so it couldn’t go off near him.\n\nHe speculates that’s why he was targeted by federal agents, who yelled that they saw him spraying the crowd, though he said they didn’t provide evidence to back that up after they handcuffed him and took him inside the Whipple Building. (He received a citation, but has yet to receive a court date.)\n\nAs he struggled underneath the agents, he fought to keep breathing.\n\n“I couldn’t breathe. I screamed my name because I didn’t know what was about to happen, and I also sort of subconsciously screamed ‘I can’t breathe,’ and right when it came out, I thought of George Floyd, and I thought, ‘Oh ****, this is getting real,’” he said.\n\nNews: The Past Year Of Trump Has Shown Us What's At Stake. HuffPost Refuses To Back Down.\n\nLavie, who has traveled around the United States in recent months documenting ICE activity, said officers working in Minneapolis are harsher than those he’s seen elsewhere, doing things like shooting pepper spray into the air intake of vehicles to force people out.\n\n“They’re very threatening right away, instead of de-escalating a situation,” he said.\n\n“Their unprofessionalism worries me as an observer because I just see it as a short distance to travel to having somebody really hurt,” he added. “It’s reckless and dangerous.”\n\nDespite suffering a chemical burn in his eye, wounds from pepper bullets and abrasions from hitting the ground, Abernathy didn’t rush to the hospital after he was released from custody.\n\nInstead, he set out to find his phone and camera, though because of the chemical agent he was doused with, he didn’t have a clear idea of who had scooped them up.\n\n“I found some guy with a bullhorn, and I asked him to walk up and down and ask if anybody has my camera, and nobody had it,” he said.\n\nNews: Trump-Appointed Prosecutor Who Pursued Indictments Against The President's Foes Is Leaving Post\n\nHe enlisted his wife’s help, having her use the Find My iPhone feature. At the same time, Lavie had passed the equipment to another journalist he was traveling with, who tried to find the owner using the contact information on the phone’s Medical ID.\n\nThe two finally reunited at a hotel where they met for the first time.\n\n“He hopped out of the car and gave me a big handshake and a hug and said, ‘thank you so much,’” Lavie said, adding Abernathy “was a little beat up, but he’s obviously a tough dude and quick-thinking, and he seemed good.”\n\nAbernathy went to the hospital after retrieving his camera, where he discovered the last few images he captured before officers took him down.\n\nAbernathy said he’s fine now, but tired and constantly shaky.\n\n“I don’t know if it’s a nervous system response to stress or something with tear gas or what,” he said.\n\nNews: DOJ Says It May Use KKK Act To Prosecute Don Lemon For Reporting On Church ICE Protest\n\nLavie said Abernathy didn’t stay down long, noting he saw him out making more images on Saturday, after being tackled on Thursday.\n\n“We don’t like to stop,” Lavie said.\n\nAbernathy noted that he’s never been tackled, handcuffed or pepper-sprayed until last week, but he will keep documenting what’s happening.\n\n“The world needs to see it, not just people here,” he said, “because the whole world has to come down on this.”\n\nWall Street Sinks As Trump Threatens 8 European Countries With Tariffs Over Greenland\n\nU.S. Bank Stocks Fall As Investors Weigh Credit Card Rate Cap Deadline\n\nVolatility Gauges Jump As Tariff Threats Spook Investors",

    "fullText": "In my years covering the restaurant industry, I’ve seen independent barbecue restaurants draw lines before noon, a clear signal of quality and customer loyalty. These kitchens often operate with minimal infrastructure, yet consistently deliver the best cuts before closing time.\n\nNational chains are a different story. While they can serve broader markets, operational decisions, such as menu focus, location strategy, and brand management, can make it harder for them to capture the same local passion that independent spots enjoy.\n\nFAT Brands’ handling of Smokey Bones is a recent example of how strategic choices reshape consumer options.\n\nWhen it comes to FAT Brands, the company has decided that “breasts beat ribs,” at least when you consider how Twin Peaks servers dress.\n\nIt has opted to turn many of its Smokey Bones BBQ restaurants into Twin Peaks locations, while simply closing many others. That trend began in 2025 and has continued into the new year.\n\nSmokey Bones was acquired as a 60-unit concept by FAT Brands Inc. in 2023 and was subsequently spun off into Twin Hospitality in January 2025.\n\n\"Twin Hospitality has prioritized optimizing Smokey Bones’ footprint, identifying 19 restaurants for conversion into better-performing Twin Peaks lodges,\" the company shared in a press release.\n\nTwo of these conversions have already been completed and generate significantly higher average unit volumes (AUVs) of approximately $7.8 million, compared to approximately $3.5 million as Smokey Bones.\n\nTwin Hospitality has identified 15 underperforming Smokey Bones locations that it will close by the end of the first quarter in 2026. The chain has quietly closed more locations than it originally planned.\n\nTaco Bell and KFC work on simplifying their restaurants\n\nChick-fil-A making major change to 425 restaurants nationwide\n\nBankrupt beer and pizza restaurant chain closes locations\n\nRestaurant chain famed for rude waiters closes multiple locations\n\nSome industry analysts have speculated that FAT Brands/Twin Hospitality could be looking to exit the barbecue business entirely.\n\n\"Though profitable, considering the menu is highly focused on entrees such as steak and brisket, which have faced steep price increases, this year could be the end of Smokey Bones,\" Restaurant Dive reported.\n\nSmokey Bones’ parent company, Twin Hospitality Group, has been closing underperforming restaurants as part of a broader restructuring plan.\n\n15 underperforming Smokey Bones locations were identified for closure; 10 had closed in 2025, and the remaining five were to be shuttered by the end of that year.\n\nAlongside closures, 19 Smokey Bones locations are being converted into Twin Peaks restaurants (a better-performing sister brand).\n\nThe chain has closed more locations than it originally planned.\n Sources: Restaurant Dive, FAT Brands press release",

    "fullText": "Syrian government forces have entered the vast al-Hol camp, which houses thousands of people linked to ISIL (ISIS), after the withdrawal of Kurdish forces who had been controlling the facility for years.\n\nArmoured vehicles carrying troops moved into the camp, located in the desert region of Hasakeh province, on Wednesday – a day after the Syrian government announced a four-day ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nThe transfer of control of the camp, which houses some 24,000 people – mostly women and children linked to ISIL – came after two weeks of fighting between the army and the SDF that was brought to a halt by Tuesday’s truce.\n\nThe fighting has seen the SDF, which played a major role in defeating ISIL in alliance with a United States-led international coalition, lose swathes of north and east Syria.\n\nThe Kurdish forces had controlled the territories during the chaos of Syria’s civil war, which ended in December 2024 with the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nThe government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus has been pushing for Kurdish fighters to integrate into Syrian state institutions, as outlined under a March 2025 deal signed with SDF.\n\nTom Barrack, the US envoy to Syria, said in a statement on Tuesday that the SDF’s role as the primary anti-ISIL force had “largely expired” and that the government in Damascus is “both willing and positioned to take over security responsibilities”.\n\nYet despite this week’s truce, Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi reported from Aleppo province that renewed clashes on the outskirts of Kobani were reported on Wednesday.\n\n“We heard gunfire, we heard anti-aircraft fire from the Syrian military side, most likely trying to target drones. The situation is very, very tense,” Basravi said.\n\nSyria’s Defence Ministry said on Wednesday that seven soldiers were killed in a drone attack that it blamed on the SDF in the Hasakeh countryside, the country’s state-run SANA news agency reported.\n\nSANA said the attack targeted the Syrian army as its forces attempted to clear a facility previously used to manufacture explosives and drone munitions in northeastern Hasakeh, near the border with Iraq. It said seven soldiers were killed and 20 others wounded.\n\nEarlier this week, President al-Sharaa and SDF chief Mazloum Abdi had agreed that the Syrian state would take over responsibility for ISIL prisoners.\n\nAbdi on Tuesday urged the US-led coalition to “bear its responsibilities in protecting facilities” holding ISIL members.\n\nAl-Hol is the largest camp for people with links to ISIL, which was defeated in Syria in 2019.\n\nThe camp was established by Kurdish forces after they took control of swathes of Syria, with coalition backing.\n\nThose held at al-Hol include about 14,500 Syrians and nearly 3,000 Iraqis.\n\nSome 6,500 others, many of them loyal ISIL supporters who came from around the world to join the armed group, are separately held in a high-security section of the camp.\n\nThe SDF remains in control of the vast majority of more than a dozen prisons where some 9,000 members of ISIL have been held for years, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe largest facility, holding about 4,500 ISIL-linked detainees, is the Gweiran Prison, located in the city of Hasakeh, which is still under full control of the SDF.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Syrian Interior Ministry said 120 ISIL members escaped from the Shaddadi prison in Hasakeh province.\n\nThe army accused the SDF of releasing ISIL detainees from the facility, while the Kurds said they lost control of the facility after an attack by Damascus.\n\nSince then, many of the detainees who fled were captured by government troops who took control of the jail, state media reported.",

    "fullText": "The U.S. Department of Education has announced that it will delay wage garnishment for defaulted student loans.\n\nThe move, revealed Friday, reverses the department’s earlier plan to gradually restart wage garnishment for groups of borrowers, and will allow the agency more time to finalize new repayment plans.\n\nGarnishing wages could have affect millions who are 270 days or more past due, and have major ramifications for Black borrowers. Due to ongoing racial inequality, Black students aren’t only more likely to rely on loans to make college affordable. They’re also more likely to struggle to pay back their loans once they enter the workforce.\n\nThe shift reverses course on earlier plans to restart wage garnishments this month after a pandemic-era pause. In December, the agency’s announcement that it would begin seizing the pay of defaulted borrowers was the latest shock to the education landscape.\n\nLast November, the Trump administration said that it was relocating certain responsibilities and programs — including those that support low-income districts and historically Black colleges and universities — out of the Education Department to “break up the federal education bureaucracy.”\n\nAnd last July, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the mass firings at the agency to continue, though the issue is still being litigated in the lower courts. Black workers are overrepresented among federal workers and, as a result, have been disproportionately affected by the cuts.\n\nThe agency didn’t set a new date for involuntary collections. It said that the delay will give borrowers time to evaluate new repayment plans that are scheduled to be available starting July 1.\n\nHere’s what you need to know if your student loans are in default.\n\nThe department must send borrowers a 30-day notice before it can begin garnishing their paychecks. These notices cover how borrowers can address their defaulted loans and seek a hearing to dispute the decision to seize pay.\n\nThe government can garnish as much as 15% of a borrower’s disposable wages.\n\nBorrowers who aren’t in default but might be delinquent can avoid defaulting on their loans by participating in a repayment option.\n\nThere are several income-driven repayment plans available, including Income-Based Repayment (IBR), Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), and Pay As You Earn (PAYE). Deferment or forbearance may also be possible in some circumstances.\n\nStanley Tate, an attorney specializing in student loan law, told Capital B that a common theme he has observed is that many borrowers default not because no options exist — but because they’re unaware of which plans they qualify for and how they might enroll in them.\n\nAt the moment, there’s no legislation that would broadly stop or suspend federal student loan wage garnishment, according to Tate.\n\nGarnishment occurs if a defaulted borrower does nothing. Employers will withhold up to 15% of a borrower’s paycheck. That money is sent to the government. Borrowers are legally required to retain at least 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage per week, or $217.50.\n\nBorrowers must be notified 30 days before garnishment begins. Additionally, they have the right to request a hearing and to pursue options such as consolidation or rehabilitation to resolve the default, Tate said.\n\n“From a practical standpoint,” he added, “the key right is the ability to stop garnishment by exiting default before wage withholding starts.”\n\nEspecially for lower-income borrowers, a 15% wage garnishment is significant. It could have a large impact on their ability to pay for rent, transportation, child care, health care, and other needs, Tate said.\n\nHe noted that what makes this period particularly difficult is that many of these same borrowers could qualify for income-driven repayment plans that require a much smaller payment — sometimes well below what would be taken through garnishment.\n\n“In that sense,” Tate said, “garnishment often reflects a breakdown in communication and access rather than a lack of repayment options.”\n\nThe post Student Loan Wage Garnishment Is Put on Hold.

    "description": "Tory leader says delay will harm children’s mental health after No 10 said it would consult on policy by...",
    "fullText": "Tory leader says delay will harm children’s mental health after No 10 said it would consult on policy by summer\n\nAs a parent – and a Conservative – I know that banning social media for under-16s is the right thing to do\n\nKemi Badenoch has called on Keir Starmer to “just get on” with a ban on social media for under-16s, saying delay is a dereliction of duty that is harming children’s mental health.\n\nAfter the government said it would consult on a social media ban for under-16s by the summer, the Conservative party leader urged the prime minister to act more quickly, “however difficult to implement” it would be.\n\nBadenoch’s comments will add to pressure on the government as peers prepare to vote on an amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill on Wednesday that would enact a ban within a year of it passing. The government is understood to want to wait to assess the evidence from Australia’s ban, which came into force in December.\n\nWriting in the Guardian, Badenoch said the UK was producing a generation of children who struggled to concentrate and had higher levels of anxiety because of exposure to social media.\n\nBadenoch said limits on alcohol, the age of consent and safeguarding in schools were there to protect children while their brains were developing, but the government had “suspended that logic entirely” when it came to social media. “We will not be bought off with vague promises of a ‘national conversation’ about whether we should get children off these adult platforms,” she said.\n\n“The prime minister must set out how he will act and by when. The crossbench peer Baroness Kidron, who supports Conservative peer Lord Nash’s amendment in the House of Lords, is right to say Starmer’s approach ‘is not leading; it is not governing’. He is ‘doing nothing – slowly’, which is ‘the very epitome of party before country’.\n\n Let’s just get on with it.”\n\nShe added: “Putting our children’s mental health first is the right thing to do. How much longer will we have to wait until the government agrees?”\n\nThe Conservatives made no moves towards banning social media during their time in government, though the Online Safety Act placed more obligations on internet and social media providers to protect children from harmful content.\n\nHowever, Badenoch said the consensus had shifted, with campaigners, clinicians, parents and experts now aligned against allowing under-16s access to social media. She also argued some internet restrictions for adults could be lifted if children were more protected from social media.\n\n“By restricting social media use for children, we aren’t just protecting children. We can also give more freedoms to adults online,” she said. “We will no longer need to contort digital spaces to be universally ‘child-friendly’, or impose blanket restrictions on speech and content because children might see it. If we stop treating children like adults, we can stop treating adults like children, too.”\n\nShe said her party believed in freedom but that the ability to make good choices was not yet fully formed in children, who did not have the necessary impulse control, emotional regulation and ability to assess risks.\n\nOn Sunday, the Guardian revealed that more than 60 Labour MPs have written to Starmer urging him to back a social media ban for under-16s, including select committee chairs, former frontbenchers and MPs from the right and left of the party.\n\nIn the letter, which was organised by Fred Thomas, the Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View, the MPs say: “Across our constituencies, we hear the same message: children are anxious, unhappy, and unable to focus on learning. They are not building the social skills needed to thrive, nor having the experiences that will prepare them for adulthood.”\n\nOn Wednesday another letter from campaigners urged parliament to back a ban, with signatories including the actors Hugh Grant and Sophie Winkleman and Esther Ghey, the mother of Brianna Ghey, who was murdered by two teenagers in Warrington, Cheshire, in 2023. It said national polling by the charity Parentkind had found 93% of parents thought social media was harmful to children and young people.\n\nIt said: “No other amendment to the bill on this topic has the same cross-party support or would deliver promptly the change needed to get children off social media.”",

Last year a Los Angeles judge ruled that the platforms’ design features may be responsible for harm – and not just the third-party content posted on sites and apps.\n\nHistorically, tech firms have turned to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law underpinning US internet regulation that exempts platforms from legal liability for content generated by its users, as part of their legal defence. The first bellwether case is still due to begin on 27 January with jury selection.\n\nSnap remains a defendant in the other two cases.\n\nBeasley Allen, a law firm involved in the lawsuits on the plaintiff side, has said the cases could have profound consequences including billions of dollars in damages, forcing changes in platform design and new US regulations governing how tech firms interact with minors.\n\n“The litigation is being compared to past landmark cases against big tobacco and opioid manufacturers – industries that were held accountable for public health harms after years of denial,” the firm said in a statement last year.\n\nSnap, Meta, TikTok and YouTube have been contacted for comment.",

    "fullText": "After years away​ revisiting my abandoned island uncovers new features, old memories and the quiet reassurance that ​you can go home again\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nNintendo’s pandemic-era hit Animal Crossing: New Horizons got another major update last week, along with a £5 Switch 2 upgrade that makes it look and run better on the new console. Last year, I threw a new year’s party for my children in the game, but apart from that I have barely touched my island since the depths of lockdown, when sunny Alba was my preferred escape from the monotonous misery of the real world. Back then, I spent more than 200 hours on this island. Stepping out of her (now massive) house, my avatar’s hair is all ruffled and her eyes sleepy after a long, long time aslumber.\n\nI half-expected Alba to be practically in ruins, but it’s not that bad. Aside from a few cockroaches in the basement and a bunch of weeds poking up from the snow, everything is as it was. The paths that I had laid out around the island still lead me to the shop, the tailors, the museum; I stop by to visit Blathers the curatorial owl, and he gives me a new mission to find a pigeon called Brewster so that we can open a museum cafe. “It’s been four years and eight months!” exclaims one of my longtime residents, a penguin called Aurora. That can’t be right, can it? Have I really been ignoring her since summer 2021? Thankfully, Animal Crossing characters are very forgiving. I get the impression they’ve been getting along perfectly fine without me.\n\nI take myself on a little tour of Alba, investigating all the things I’d forgotten I made. Atop the highest cliffs on the island I find a half-finished bamboo zen garden. Down by the beach there is a playground; I had a baby and a toddler back in 2020 and I was spending a lot of time in playgrounds. The whole place is testament to the extent of my homesickness during the pandemic, during which I was stuck in a suboptimal basement flat in Brighton: the island flag is a saltire, the island tune is the first couple of bars of Scotland the Brave.\n\nI check my bank account and find over 2 million bells in there. How the hell did I accumulate 2 million bells from selling fish and fossils? With the help of a further 99,000 bells of interest, I pay off the final instalment of my home loan, forgetting that there’s no real point in doing this except personal satisfaction. I am now penniless, but at least I am out from under the thumb of the Tom Nook financial empire. That loan-shark raccoon has got nothing on me now.\n\nThere’s a new building: a hotel perched on the end of the pier, run by a family of pirate kappa. Home decoration was never my favourite part of Animal Crossing so I am not exactly thrilled to be asked to put together new rooms for the guests, but there have been a lot of improvements to this activity since I last played – placing cute little furniture items and paintings on the floor and walls is much easier than it was, especially using the Switch 2 controller as a mouse. I throw together a nautical theme for the first room and discover that the rewards for this work are tiny versions of old Nintendo toys and consoles. I start mentally planning out a games room back at my house.\n\nRather than face all the tidying up, some of my friends have ditched their pandemic-era islands and started again, which involves a level of dedication to the game that I can only respect. There’s a new service – run by Mr Resetti, the angry mole who used to yell at you for turning off the game without saving in the early-00s era of Animal Crossing – that lets you wipe everything off the ground of your island, leaving it clear for terraforming and redecorating. It’s also now easier to make those outdoor transformations, as you can hold L to stick your character to the island’s invisible grid, making it much easier to place things like walls and roads. And crops, I discover. Did you know Animal Crossing has farming now? And food recipes? This was news to me. Now I make my mini-me a smoothie before my morning rounds of Alba.\n\nI am surprised at how quickly I fall back into the rhythm of Animal Crossing. It’s such a soothing game, with so many outlets for creativity. Much of this update’s new stuff is for people with more time than me – for instance, you can decorate entire new Slumber Islands with friends while your avatar sleeps, but what was always great about this game is that it doesn’t require much from you. You can spend a peaceful half hour every day checking in on your small world, or you can spend many hours creating custom fashions for your residents and tourists, and designing every square metre of the island to your specifications.\n\nBack in the 90s, Animal Crossing was a game born from loneliness: Nintendo’s Katsuya Eguchi came up with the original idea for the game because moving to Kyoto had separated him from his friends and family in Chiba, near Tokyo. He envisioned a game that fostered a sense of community, that families could play together. (You can read a lot more about this series’ origins in my book about Nintendo, by the way – it’s out in a couple of weeks.) So it feels very poetic that Animal Crossing ended up saving the whole world from loneliness in 2020. It’s taken me a long while to feel good about returning to Alba, and it’s been a surprise to discover that this game is now better than it’s ever been.\n\nMan was I sleeping on Dispatch. I played all of its eight episodes over the course of a week and I have never laughed aloud so often at a video game. A narrative game in the vein of the old Telltale adventures The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, and made by many of the same people, it tells the story of washed-up superhero, Robert Robertson III, who is sent to work at a call centre and put in charge of a team of mardy former supervillains on a rehabilitation programme. The animation is superb, the characters and acting memorable, and the dialogue quick-witted. It would have made a great animated series, but it makes an even better choice-centric video game. Anything with superheroes is usually an instant “no” from me, but this is clever and funny without the boringly self-referential humour that usually infests the genre.\n\nAvailable on: PS5, PC; Nintendo Switch/2 versions coming 28 January\n\n Estimated playtime: 8-9 hours\n\nAmazon MGM Studios released a first image of Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner as Lara Croft in the forthcoming Tomb Raider TV series. Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander were the previous two on-screen Crofts; Turner says she has been training eight hours a day, five days a week for the past year for the role.\n\nNewish independent site Design Room has gone deep on the groundbreaking 2008 parkour game Mirror’s Edge, in an in-depth history written by frequent Guardian Games contributor Lewis Gordon.\n\nAnother online multiplayer game was put to bed last week: 2019’s sci-fi mech shooter Anthem, one of the first live-service flops of the current era. It was made by BioWare – a studio better known for its RPGs. Its producer Mark Darrah released a four hour (!) postmortem video on YouTube, summarised here by VGC.\n\nA beginner’s guide to Arc Raiders: what it is and how you start playing\n\n‘It’s a loving mockery, because it’s also who I am’: the making of gaming’s most pathetic character\n\nCommodore 64 Ultimate – it’s like 1982 all over again! | ★★★★★\n\nA few weeks ago I asked for your most-anticipated games of 2026 (mine are here). Reader Ee simply responded with the words Fatal Frame – there’s a remake of the second instalment in this iconic Japanese ghost photography series coming in March. Nora picked out The Mermaid Mask – a “funny and creepy point-and-click mystery” – and TOEM 2, the sequel to a beloved black-and-white photography game. Andrew is looking forward to the interesting mix of characters in Resident Evil 9, which stars relatively defenceless newcomer Grace and seasoned zombie-killer Leon Kennedy.\n\nBrad is hoping for a new 3D Mario on Switch 2, as am I – Nintendo usually announces games late, so I think the odds are good. And I’m sorry, Maks, but the odds aren’t so great on this finally being the year that we see Half-Life 3, so I can’t share in your optimism. I’ve lost so many bets about that game that I’ve given up for good.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "description": "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration lists bleach as a Category 1 chemical with the highest human health risk of the five categories.",
    "fullText": "Soap scum is a nuisance that impacts homeowners everywhere. In a recent video, TikToker Eco OG (@eco_og) presented a two-ingredient hack to clean soap scum.\n\nThe video suggests sprinkling baking soda in the tub before spritzing around with a coating of hydrogen peroxide. Then, Eco OG allows the mixture to sit for 15 to 20 seconds before wiping it off with a rag.\n\n\"It's so easy and works every time,\" the creator says.\n\nThis simple hack is an inexpensive way to get a cleaner tub or shower — while also reducing the use of toxic chemicals in the household. Studies have indicated that the average American family spends $40 to $50 monthly on household cleaning supplies. Homeowners can decrease this expenditure by already using ingredients they have in their households, like baking soda and hydrogen peroxide.\n\nEco OG explained in the video's comments section that hydrogen peroxide is an organic compound that biodegrades completely into oxygen and water. Therefore, it is a preferable alternative to more toxic cleaning products like bleach, which can cause skin and respiratory irritation to plants and animals.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration lists bleach as a Category 1 chemical with the highest human health risk of the five categories. This means it's looped in with other chemicals that cause irreversible skin damage and blindness as well as substances known to cause cancer, sterility, and genetic alteration ... all just to clean out your shower.\n\nTherefore, improper handling of bleach can cause numerous health threats and exacerbate conditions like asthma, while hydrogen peroxide is a much safer (and just as effective) alternative.\n\nIn addition, chlorine, one of the components of bleach, can react with minerals and form toxic compounds like dioxin and persistent organic pollutants. These compounds remain in soil and water for long periods, harming aquatic and wildlife.\n\nTikTok users praised Eco OG's hack.\n\nOne user wrote, \"​​Man I did try this and my shower turned so white. Love it thank you so much.\"\n\nOther users suggested alternative cleaning mixtures to try.\n\nOne wrote, \"Another option that works really well for me is mixing baking soda, cleaning white vinegar, dawn dish soap, and a tad bit of alcohol and lemon juice!\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for easy tips to save more, waste less, and help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "description": "While their countrymen are slaughtered, the children of the regime's ruling class have been hiding out in a popular vacation hotspot, sources say.",
    "fullText": "As horrific details of the Iranian government’s suppression of protesters emerge — with internal estimates counting more than 10,000 dead — the country’s young, wealthy elite are inciting further rage by continuing to flaunt their lavish lives online as they have for years, as if the nation weren’t on the brink of collapse outside of their privileged bubble.\n\nAmid an enforced internet blackout that allows an oppressive regime to commit “genocide under the cover of digital darkness,” according to one outraged expert, reporters from the Telegraph are said to have observed “rich Iranians” partying at a nightclub in a popular holiday hot spot on the border with Turkey.\n\n“Their lifestyle has enraged the citizens of Iran, specifically Gen Z in their age group, mainly because they see how these rich kids live — with no accountability for anything that they do,” Ella Rosenberg, a senior researcher at the Jerusalem Centre for Foreign Affairs, told the Times of London.\n\nMostly the children of Iran’s ruling class, they’ve famously led hedonistic lifestyles for decades, but their jaw-dropping wealth had become more visible in recent years, due to the government’s temporarily loosened grip on the internet and social media, before the current unrest began.\n\n“They’re the equivalent of the Iranian ‘Gossip Girl’: luxury cars, living in opulent high-rises in north Tehran,” Rosenberg said.\n\nThe wealth of Iran’s young elite first came to global attention more than a decade ago, with the Instagram account @richkidsoftehran.\n\n“It depicts seemingly affluent teens flaunting Rolex watches, Porsches and Maseratis, sprawling estates and pricey attire,” The Post reported in 2014.\n\nThe Instagram account has remained active and now boasts 477,000 followers.\n\nGlamorous snaps ceased being shared on the account in 2024 — since Jan. 9, six new posts relating to current events have appeared, referring to the government as a “regime” — but other well-connected and cashed-up Iranians have become influencers in their own right.\n\nAnashid Hoseini, who is married to the son of Iran’s ambassador to Denmark, has more than 1.7 million followers, thanks to envy-inducing photos that show her dripping with jewels and toting designer handbags.\n\nHoseini is reported to live in Niavaran, an affluent neighborhood in northern Tehran, but she has not posted to her account in almost a month.\n\nIt’s unclear whether she remains in Iran amid the unrest, but many have fled the country in recent weeks seeking shelter in Van, a Turkish province about 60 miles from Iran’s border.\n\nSaid to be a popular holiday spot with affluent Iranians, the Telegraph reported seeing well-heeled types gathering in a venue that can easily cost more than $100 for entry and drinks, according to the outlet.\n\n“These people benefit from the regime. They left Iran for now, because they were worried about staying there. Here, they can feel safe,” one Iranian at the club told the paper.\n\nOther young and well-connected Iranians left their home country long ago, but have still incited anger among those less affluent citizens left behind.\n\nSasha Sobhani, the son of a former Iranian ambassador to Venezuela, became a social media star showing off his expat life in Spain, where he moved in 2019.\n\nSnaps show Sobhani surrounded by scantily clad ladies and luxury sports cars, and he has since denounced Iran.\n\nHowever, the country is seeking his extradition after accusing him of money laundering and running illegal websites.\n\nThe current uprising, which exploded Dec. 28, has morphed into the most serious threat to Iran’s clerical rulers since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nThe regime has answered with overwhelming force, deploying the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij militia to crush the unrest, according to rights groups and witness accounts.\n\nSources inside Iran estimate at least 12,000 — and possibly as many as 20,000 — people may have been killed during the unrest, according to CBS News.\n\nTehran has fiercely disputed the numbers, blaming the bloodshed on what it calls “armed rioters” and “terrorists” backed by foreign powers, including the US and Israel.",

    "description": "A prison officer who had sex with her convict boyfriend in a jail’s prayer room has herself been jailed.",
    "fullText": "A prison officer who had sex with her convict boyfriend in a jail’s prayer room has herself been jailed.\n\nIsabelle Dale, 23, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison after she had intercourse with Shahid Sharif, 33, in the worship area at HMP Coldingley in Surrey.\n\nThe prison officer was seen emerging alongside the convicted robber after four minutes, hastily readjusting her belt.\n\nShe had Sharif’s nickname “Sneaks” tattooed behind her neck, hung a framed picture of them together over her bed and called herself “Miss Sneaky”.\n\nThe judge at Southwark Crown Court at Southwark Crown Court said he believed Dale joined the prison service so she could become involved in illicit activity with prisoners.\n\nDale was having a sexual relationship with a second inmate, Connor Money, 28, at the same time as her involvement with Sharif.\n\nSharif was transferred to HMP Swaleside on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent after the prayer room session.\n\nThe romance continued and Dale bought her own £3,000 engagement ring while she wrote love letters to Sharif telling of her dreams of their life together on the outside.\n\nSome of those letters were laced with synthetic cannabis or “Spice”.\n\nDale also operated Sharif’s drug-dealing Snapchat account to source the drug through associate Lilea Sallis, 27.\n\nThe prison officer told the court she felt “privileged” to have Sharif in her life but denied ever having sex with him in jail or smuggling the drugs.\n\nDale was convicted by a Southwark Crown Court jury of two counts of misconduct in a public office and conspiracy to convey a “List A” prohibited article into prison.\n\nSharif earlier admitted conspiring with the two women and others unknown to convey drugs into prison. He was given another 27 months in jail.\n\nSallis was convicted by the jury of conspiracy to convey a “List A” prohibited article into prison. She was jailed for two-and-a-half years.\n\nJudge Hehir told Dale: “You well understood what corruption was and the risks and dangers relating to it.\n\n“Within a few months you began engaging in thoroughly corrupt and inappropriate behaviour. You formed illicit relationships with two inmates, Connor Money and Shahid Sharif.’\n\n“Intimate relationships between prisoners and prison officers jeopardise authority and good order in prisons. If some prisoners receive favourable treatment from prison officers that they are in a relationship with, that is unfair to the prisoners who are not.\n\n“I have concluded that unfortunately you are a thoroughly devious, untruthful and manipulative young woman.\n\n“I accept that you have some vulnerabilities, but as was apparent from your evidence you seek to use them as a shield and an excuse for your actions but they do not provide that.”\n\nDale was arrested on November 1 2022 on her last visit to Sharif at Swaleside.\n\nShe joined the prison service on September 29 2021 but told the court she felt she never fitted in with her colleagues, who would mock her extensive tattoos.\n\nDale said she sought solace in the affection of the inmates. “I bought the ring as I was instructed to by Mr Sharif to prove my loyalty to him,” she explained. “He threatened to stab me. He told me he hated me and wanted me to die.”\n\nSyam Soni, defending Dale, said her client was suffering from depression and anxiety, and that she was ill-suited to working in the prison service.\n\n“It is clear that in any view she was ill-equipped to be working in that function,” she said.\n\nDale, of Portsmouth, was convicted of two counts of misconduct in a public office and conspiracy to convey a “List A” prohibited article into prison.\n\nSallis, of East Sussex, was convicted of conspiracy to convey a “List A” prohibited article into prison.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Billionaire tech CEOs promise shorter weeks thanks to AI—but IWG’s Mark Dixon says automation won’t free time, it’ll just create more work.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Nvidia’s boss Jensen Huang and Elon Musk have all made the same prediction in recent years: The workweek is about to shrink. Automation will take over routine tasks, they argue, freeing workers’ time and pushing a four-day week toward becoming standard. Gates has even floated the idea of a two-day workweek.\n\nBut Mark Dixon, CEO and founder of International Workplace Group (IWG) CEO isn’t buying it. From his vantage point, running the world’s largest flexible office provider—with more than 8 million users across 122 countries and 85% of the Fortune 500 among its customers—the math doesn’t add up.\n\n“Everyone is focused on productivity, so no time soon,” Dixon says flatly.\n\n“It’s about the cost of labor,” Dixon explains to Fortune. The U.S. and U.K. are experiencing significant cost-of-living crises. At the same time, he says, businesses are experiencing a “cost of operating crisis.”\n\n“Everyone’s having to control their labor costs because all costs have gone up so much, and you can’t get any more money from customers, so therefore you have to get more out of people.”\n\nEssentially, companies can’t afford to pay the same wages for fewer hours, and they can’t pass the difference on to customers. So any time ‘freed’ by automation is far more likely to be filled with new tasks than handed back to workers.\n\nSilicon Valley’s loudest voices frame AI as a route to more leisure. The world’s richest person and the boss of Space X, Tesla and X, Elon Musk has gone as far as predicting work will be completely “optional” and more like a hobby, in as little as 10 years.\n\nIn reality, Dixon suggests that this scenario would only happen if there’s not enough work to go around, rather than bosses suddenly becoming benevolent. But in his eyes, AI will most likely create more—not less—work.\n\nEvery major technological shift, he argues, has followed a similar arc: fear of displacement, followed by an expansion of opportunity.\n\n“AI will speed up companies development, so there’ll be more work, it’ll just be different work,” he says.\n\nIn 19th-century Britain, Dixon recalls English textile workers protesting against new automated machinery, fearing it threatened their livelihoods, lowered wages, and de-skilled their craft during the Industrial Revolution. They were called Luddites.\n\n“They went around the country smashing up the looms to stop progress. But look, in the end, you’ve heard of the Industrial Revolution. That’s what came from those looms and factory production.” As mass production made goods more available, retail grew; More managers were needed to oversee the machines; The middle-class grew, and so on.",

Staff have not operated out of the facility for almost a year out of safety concerns, but Israeli forces confiscated devices and forced out private security guards protecting the facility.\n\n“What we saw today is the culmination of two years of incitement and measures against UNRWA in east Jerusalem,” Friedrich said.\n\nHe said forces also began firing tear gas outside the vocational school on the outskirts of Jerusalem on Tuesday afternoon before ultimately leaving. More than 300 young refugees receive job training in technology and welding there.\n\nSome children on their way home from the school were overcome by the tear gas and a 15-year-old was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet, according to the Palestinian Authority’s Jerusalem governorate, which monitors Palestinian affairs in the area.\n\nIsraeli leaders celebrate demolition\n\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry said the demolition enforced a new law banning UNRWA, noting that Israel owns the site and rejecting UNRWA’s claims that the move violated international law.\n\nIsrael has long claimed the agency has an anti-Israel bias. Often with little evidence, it says UNRWA employs and maintains ties with militant groups including Hamas. The U.N. has ardently denied such claims and UNRWA has said it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants among its staff.\n\nUNRWA's mandate is to provide aid and services to some 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more refugees in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. The group has for years maintained infrastructure in refugee camps and also run schools and provided health care. But its operations were curtailed last year when Israel’s Knesset passed legislation severing ties and banning it from functioning in what it defines as Israel — including east Jerusalem.\n\nThe agency said the demolitions could imperil operations at the vocational center in Qalandia and heath facility in Shu'afat, where it still provides education and health services.\n\nAn Israeli flag was seen hoisted above the facility in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, where some Israeli politicians arrived on the scene to celebrate the organization's fate. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir called it “a historic day.”\n\nThe demolition marked the culmination of years of criticism from Israel and its leaders. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war more than two years ago, it has ramped up such attacks, saying the militants used UNRWA facilities and seized aid. It has provided little evidence for the claims, which the U.N. has denied. The International Court of Justice said in October that Israel must allow the agency to provide humanitarian assistance in Gaza.\n\nSince Israel passed its law banning the agency last year, its facilities — schools and health centers — and its headquarters have repeatedly been closed, raided or left unprotected.\n\n“This must be a wake-up call,\" Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA's commissioner-general, said in a statement on X. “What happens today to UNRWA will happen tomorrow to any other international organisation or diplomatic mission, whether in the Occupied Palestinian Territory or anywhere around the world.”\n\nMore aid groups in Gaza face pressure\n\nIsrael's ban on UNRWA dovetailed with broader efforts to deregister aid groups operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Israel has passed laws requiring nongovernmental organizations not to hire staff involved in activities that “delegitimize Israel” or support boycotts, demanding they register lists of names as a condition of being allowed to work.\n\nIsrael told dozens of groups — including Doctors Without Borders and CARE — that their licenses would expire at the end of 2025. The organizations say the rules are arbitrary and warned that the new ban would harm people desperately in need of humanitarian aid.\n\nSettler violence in the West Bank rose last year\n\nThe Israeli military said Tuesday that attacks carried out by Jewish settlers against Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the West Bank increased by 27% last year compared with 2024.\n\nThere were 867 reports of “nationalistic crimes” — with the number of severe incidents up by more than 50%, according to internal statistics from the Israeli military and the country’s Shin Bet domestic security service.\n\nMounting settler violence in the West Bank has emptied villages since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted, according to B’Tselem, an Israeli rights group helping the residents.\n\nThe Israeli military has carried out large-scale operations in the West Bank targeting militants that have killed hundreds of Palestinians. There also has been a rise in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.\n\nIsraeli authorities have a mixed relationship with settlers, at times dismantling unauthorized outposts while also deploying forces to protect them from Palestinians.\n\nJulia Frankel and Shlomo Mor in Jerusalem and Edith M.

    "title": "We Asked a Cardiologist How Long You Need to Take Fish Oil to Improve Heart Health—The Answer Might Surprise You",
    "description": "For most people, this diet tweak is a more powerful gamechanger for heart health.",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Maria Laura Haddad-Garcia\n\nPrescription fish oil may lower high triglycerides and reduce heart risks in 4 to 12 weeks.\n\nOver-the-counter fish oil supplements vary in quality and may not offer the same benefits.\n\nEating fatty fish twice a week is a proven way to support heart health without supplements.\n\nFish oil is a well-known source of omega-3 fatty acids, nutrients found in high concentrations in the eyes and brain. Unlike other nutrients, your body can’t make omega-3s on its own, so it’s important to get them through food—like fish—or supplements.\n\nOften, fish oil is touted for its heart-health benefits, but taking a supplement isn’t right for everyone—and improvements aren't always immediate. We spoke with a cardiologist to break down the science, expectations and timeline for fish oil’s impact on heart health.\n\nFish oil contains two key omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in varying amounts, which are often marketed as heart-healthy. You may have seen them marketed as a way to promote heart health. But before reaching for a supplement, consider this: the research is not promising for most people.\n\n\"There have been many studies conducted on fish oils over the years. Although some have shown benefit in select populations, when used for prevention in otherwise healthy patients, multiple, well-conducted, very large trials have not shown a benefit,\" says Eugenia Gianos, M.D., FACC, chair of the American College of Cardiology's Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Council and director of cardiovascular prevention at Northwell Health.\n\nTaking fish oil without a medical reason may even be harmful. Some studies have linked fish oil supplements with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heart rhythm, adds Gianos. They should be used in patients where the benefits are likely to be greater,” she says—primarily those with very high triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood, and elevated levels can increase the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries, potentially leading to a heart attack or stroke.\n\nIn addition, it's also important to consider the type of fish oil that physicians recommend for high triglycerides: prescription fish oil. That’s because over-the-counter supplements are not FDA-approved for managing high triglycerides, and their quality and dosage can vary widely. Many also contain impurities.\n\nAnother key difference is dosage. Prescription fish oil delivers a much higher dose of omega-3s than over-the-counter supplements. To reach a similar amount using nonprescription fish oil, you’d need to take multiple capsules, which can increase the likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea and the unpleasant “fish burps” many people experience.\n\nPrescription versions, such as icosapent ethyl (Vascepa), deliver a much higher dose of EPA and have been shown to reduce inflammation, stabilize arterial plaque and lower the risk of heart attack and stroke, notes Gianos.\n\nBack to the question at hand, though: When will you notice a benefit? If your healthcare provider recommends taking a prescription fish oil medication to lower your triglycerides, you should see a benefit in about 4 to 12 weeks, adds Gianos.\n\nAlthough you can easily purchase fish oil supplements at the store or online, first make sure your healthcare provider recommends you take one. For lowering triglycerides, the typical dose is 2 grams twice daily, taken with meals.\"Fish oils are generally very safe. They are unlikely to interact with other medications and are well tolerated,\" says Gianos.\n\nFor most people, though, the best way to get omega-3s for heart-health benefits is through food.  Fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, mackerel, anchovies, bluefin tuna, mussels and oysters are all excellent sources. \"This has been a guideline recommendation for decades due to research showing benefits for the prevention of heart disease and can be a healthy way to get important protective nutrients,\" she explains.\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends eating fish twice a week—a target that supports heart health without the need for supplements in most cases.\n\nFish oil supplements are often thought to be great for your heart, but evidence doesn’t support their use for everyone. Plus, in some cases, it can lead to harm or unpleasant side effects. If you’re managing high triglycerides, prescription fish oil may offer measurable benefits within a few weeks. But for most people, eating fish regularly is a stronger, more established strategy for supporting heart health.",

His shocking admission that the move is linked to a personal gripe over being snubbed for last year’s Nobel Peace Prize has further raised alarm both at home and abroad, with some fearing that at 79 years old, he may simply no longer be up to the job.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment on this story. The president has previously described his cognitive and physical health as “perfect.”",

    "title": "Calls to invoke 25th Amendment grow as Trump tries to acquire Greenland. How does it work, and has it been used before?",
    "description": "The president's unusual text message to Norway's prime minister has prompted growing calls from lawmakers for the 25th Amendment to be invoked.",
    "fullText": "A growing number of lawmakers are calling for the 25th Amendment to be invoked to remove President Trump from office after Trump told Norway’s prime minister that his position on purchasing Greenland is tied to not winning the Nobel Peace Prize and he no longer feels obligated to “think purely of Peace.”\n\nThe remarkable exchange happened on Jan. 18, when the Norwegian leader, Jonas Gahr Store, sent a text message to Trump on behalf of himself and the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb. The European leaders sent the message in an attempt to “deescalate” the increased conflict over Greenland and the latest tariff threat against the U.S.’s European allies.\n\nIn less than half an hour, Trump responded, writing, “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.”\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded by the Norwegian government, but rather the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The five members of the committee are appointed by the country’s parliament.\n\nTrump doubled down on his intentions to “purchase” Greenland, writing, “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you!” and signing it “President DJT.”\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts is one of several members of Congress to call for Trump’s removal from office using the 25th Amendment. “Invoke the 25th Amendment,” Markey posted on X, along with a picture of a news headline of Trump’s unusual text message with Store. Additional Democratic House members, such as Reps. Eric Swalwell, Sydney Kamlager-Dove and Yassamin Ansari, have also called for the removal of Trump by invoking the 25th Amendment.\n\nIt dates back to 1963, when Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson became president after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. There was no plan in place to choose Johnson’s replacement, and there was concern about the procedure if he were to become ill or incapacitated before a new vice president could be named. In 1965, Congress formally proposed the 25th Amendment, and it became part of the Constitution in February 1967.\n\nThe 25th Amendment has four sections. The first three clarify the presidential order of succession and who can temporarily assume the president’s duties. Section 4 gets the most attention: It’s a multi-step process for the vice president and the Cabinet to declare that the president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”\n\nInvoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment would require Vice President JD Vance and the majority of Trump’s Cabinet to submit a declaration to Congress that Trump isn’t able to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Doing so would mean an immediate transfer of presidential power to Vance, who would serve as acting president. Trump would have the chance to refute the declaration, which could then be challenged by his Cabinet. Congress would have 21 days from the date of receiving the declaration to formally approve any decision to remove Trump from office.\n\nA two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate would be needed in order for Trump to be removed from office. Otherwise, he would regain his presidential powers.\n\nThe first section of the 25th Amendment was invoked when Richard Nixon resigned from the presidency in 1974 and was replaced by his vice president, Gerald Ford. Section 2 was used when Gerald Ford, as president, nominated Nelson Rockefeller for vice president, and he was confirmed in the House and the Senate.\n\nSection 3 was used in 1985 when Ronald Reagan underwent brief cancer surgery and Vice President George H.W. Bush assumed his responsibilities. In 2002 and 2007, George W. Bush invoked Section 3 when he underwent medical procedures, and then-Vice President Dick Cheney became acting president.\n\nSection 4 has never been used because the process is so challenging. It’s more difficult to remove a president under the 25th Amendment using Section 4 than under the impeachment process.\n\nThe purpose of seeking impeachment to remove a president from office is to address potential “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”\n\nThe House would require a simple majority to vote on Articles of Impeachment, which are formal written charges against a president. After a trial, the Senate would vote on whether to convict and remove the president from office, which requires a two-thirds vote. The Senate can vote in a separate proceeding to ban the president from holding future office, which would require a simple majority vote.\n\nTrump was impeached twice during his first term in office. The first time was on Dec. 18, 2019, for initiating foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election, and the second was on Jan. 13, 2021, following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. In each case, he was acquitted on all counts by the Senate and remained in office.\n\nShould the movement grow to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump due to incapacity or inability to perform presidential duties, invoking it would require a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate. The president would not be barred from holding future office.",

    "fullText": "Forecasters are anticipating a weekend snow storm that could bring measurable snowfall totals to Philadelphia.\n\nArtic air will move in ahead of the snow, plummeting temperatures below-freezing with single digit wind chills possible.\n\nForecast models are still unclear about the impact of the snow storm on our area, including accumulations and timing.\n\nPHILADELPHIA - Philadelphia is bracing for a significant snow storm that could bring bitterly cold temperatures and measurable snowfall accumulations to our area this weekend.\n\nThe latest update from the National Weather Service says Philadelphia and surrounding areas have an 80% probability to see at least 6 inches of snow by Monday.\n\nForecasters believe the first flakes will start to fall sometime early Sunday morning and become more widespread during the daylight hours.\n\nModels are still coming together on the exact timing of the storm, but forecasters believe snow will fall heavy at times before moving offshore by Monday.\n\nIt's unclear as of Wednesday morning exactly how much snow the Philadelphia area can expect to see from the coastal storm.\n\nThe National Weather Service in their latest update said there is an 80% probability that Philly will see at least 6 inches of snow.\n\nForecasters believe if the track of the storm skews to the south, there will be higher accumulations south of the I-95 corridor.\n\nIf the storm pushes north, areas northwest of the I-95 corridor could see higher totals.\n\nAlong with the snow, forecasters are warning of bitterly cold temperatures with an added wind chill that will make it feel even colder.\n\nTemperatures on Saturday and Sunday in the Philadelphia area are expected to barely crack 20 degrees, with overnight lows in the teens.\n\nGood morning! After a very cold start to the day today we'll see moderation in temperatures this afternoon into Thursday. Otherwise, the potential for a significant storm to impact the area this weekend continues to increase.

    "description": "The government is in crisis mode.",
    "fullText": "For many decades, the Chinese government attempted to limit population growth through a one-child policy — only to abolish the rule in 2016 as it realized that the number of annual births had started to plummet at alarming levels.\n\nThe aggressive policy — alongside other extreme measures — succeeded far too well, with birth rates dropping a staggering 17 percent between 2024 and 2025 to the lowest level since 1949. The country’s population is now actively shrinking each year, and it’s hard to imagine how the trend could be reversed.\n\nThe situation has gotten so dire that Beijing eliminated tax incentives on condoms, hormonal birth control, and other contraceptives, as Fortune reports. Basically, it’s now desperately trying to reverse itself out of a fertility crisis of its own doing. President Xi Jinping has practically been pleading with the country’s women to bear more children.\n\nYet fewer and fewer women thereare interested in raising a family, sending China well below the “replacement rate” of 2.1 children per woman, meaning the government’s interventions are doing little to address the issue. Many countries around the world, including most of North and South America, and Europe, are already experiencing below-replacement fertility rates. The situation playing out in China is a preview for what’s still to come in many other regions projected to experience a similar decline.\n\n“The empirical evidence from other countries so far is that monetary incentives have almost no effect in raising fertility,” University of California professor of sociology Wang Feng told the New York Times.\n\nDespite its economy growing by five percent last year, over 11 million people died while only 7.92 million babies were born. Meanwhile, a hot new app is trending in China that takes the form of a countdown timer that has to be reset regularly by single people so that their friends and family will know if they die alone.\n\nThe number of working-age people is also dropping as the population continues to age, further taxing healthcare systems and pension funds. The major drop in the fertility rate will continue to have devastating effects, shifting demographics that could result in a worsening economic outlook. The cost of raising a child in China is still extremely high compared to other countries.\n\n“With China’s economic woes, young people may want to wait and see, and that’s not good news for raising fertility,” Wang told the NYT.\n\nIn short, whether taxes on contraceptives and Xi’s calls for a “new type of marriage and childbearing culture” will reverse China’s plummeting birthrate remains unclear at best.\n\nThe country’s population has been shrinking since 2022, and judging by the latest numbers, the trend is bound to continue. And as the population continues to age, hundreds of millions could soon be leaving the workforce — a demographic crisis and ticking time bomb in one.\n\nMore on China’s population: Hot New App Makes Single People Check in Constantly in Case They Die Alone",

    "fullText": "On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Bleed Cubbie Blue is pleased to present a Cubs-centric look at baseball’s colorful past. Here’s a handy Cubs timeline, to help you follow the various narrative paths.\n\n“Maybe I called it wrong, but it’s official.” — Tom Connolly, HoF Umpire.\n\nHappy Birthday to Mike Krukow*, farewell Hollywood Stars, and other stories for the discerning reader.\n\n1921 – 1921 – Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis officially is signed as baseball commissioner, to a seven-year, $350,000 contract. (1,2)\n\n1936 – The Hollywood Stars, last-place finishers in the Pacific Coast League in 1935, move to San Diego, where they will become the Padres. The Stars were unable to pay the annual rent of $8,000 for Wrigley Field. They will return in 1938 when the San Francisco Missions move south to L.A. (2)\n\n1947 – A rule change that allows voting only for players who were active after 1921 produces four new Hall of Fame members, breaking a logjam after years of the BBWAA electing hardly anyone: catcher Mickey Cochrane, second baseman Frankie Frisch, and pitchers Lefty Grove and Carl Hubbell, all former Most Valuable Players and World Series winners. Pie Traynor misses selection by two votes. Hubbell was forbidden by Ty Cobb to throw his screwball in Detroit’s farm system, but used it to win 253 games for the New York Giants; Frisch went to the World Series eight times and batted .316 over 19 seasons; Grove won 300 games, and his battery-mate Cochrane retired with a .320 lifetime batting average, the highest of any catcher. (1,2)\n\n1953 – The Baseball Writers Association of America passes over Joe DiMaggio in his first year of eligibility and elects pitcher Dizzy Dean and outfielder Al Simmons to the Hall of Fame. Dean gathers 209 votes while Simmons’ total of 199 is one more than needed. The colorful Dean had a .644 career winning percentage and won 120 games from 1932 through 1936, including 30 wins in 1934. Simmons, who drove in 100 runs in each of his first eleven major league seasons, was one of the most feared hitters of his time. Also joining DiMaggio, who finishes eighth in the voting, are in order Bill Terry, Bill Dickey, Rabbit Maranville, Dazzy Vance, Ted Lyons, Charles Bender (ninth) and Gabby Hartnett (tenth).

    "fullText": "Thinking back on those incredibly talented early 00’s Cardinal teams, just a few players come to mind that have stood the test of time in my rapidly aging mind. Two of them are shoe ins as Hall of Famers, but I think there is one more that really stands out besides Albert Pujols and Yadier Molina: Jim Edmonds.\n\nAs much as I love Scott Rolen as one of the best Cardinals third basemen ever, Scott could never match Jim Edmonds hitting, who was nearly as good as a defender. It was nice to have two of the best players ever on your team back in 2004 or so! But Edmonds stuck out because of the home runs from center field.\n\nI’m not saying that Rolen shouldn’t have made the Hall of Fame; far from it. I think of Rolen as another favorite player, but much more of a stoic. He made elite defense look easy. I’m not a small hall guy. I find the Hall of Fame more on the Shame side of things, for a variety of reasons, but in the spirit of brevity: it has become oddly selective and biased. It always has been that way, but now the Hall has fought to keep up with the times. Whatever those sports authority HOF voters are up to, I’m not that impressed. I don’t really like the system of electing players to the Hall of Fame, but I also don’t have the answers. Is it that the system cannot keep up with the amount of new players and needs to be changed? Or should it be leaving players on the cusp out of the induction?\n\nJust for fun, I am going to compare Jim Edmonds to Scott Rolen via Fangraphs:\n\nPeak year 2004: 9 WAR, 159 wRC+\n\nPeak year 2004: 8.3 WAR, 168 wRC+\n\nNearly 400 HR, 1 short of 1200 RBI\n\nThis is sort of an apples to oranges argument, where it appears that Rolen is a little better of a player, except that Jim runs away with the show with a lot more years at a more premium value. Add to that the fact that Scott Rolen derived more of his value through ridiculously elite defense, while Edmonds was the better hitter by career wRC+.\n\nMaybe it comes down to longevity? Jim Edmonds played in 2011 games, while Scott Rolen played in 2038.\n\nHow about 6+ fWAR seasons? Rolen had 4, Edmonds had 6.\n\nPerhaps the argument I’m making might be more to show that Arenado could make the Hall of Fame? I cannot see any reason why Jim Edmonds shouldn’t be in the Hall of Fame if Scott Rolen is in. Center field is a premium position, but elite defense at third base is also extremely valuable. If you’re a small Hall guy, maybe neither is in.\n\nNolan Arenado has some work to do if he’s going to match either of these guy’s WAR totals. He’s just over 50 in total. He has more home runs than Rolen, so his home run total is fine. Arenado is well over 200 games away from 2,000 games. He will need a resurgence in the desert to reach that milestone.\n\nArenado does have 4 seasons of 6+ WAR though. That might end up being important. During Edmonds’ last five seasons or so, he was no longer himself, so maybe that left a bad taste in the BBWAA writer’s palettes… Arenado’s on-base percentage fell off a cliff after his big career year of 2022 (7.2 WAR), so what people might remember is him losing his abilities at the plate, while his elite defense dwindles. I hope he turns it around, but we no longer need to bank on it.\n\nHow about a homer happy comparison? Arenado has had three 40+ HR seasons and seven 30+. Rolen had no 40 home run seasons, and three 30+ seasons. Edmonds had two 40+ HR seasons and four 30+. So of the three, you’d have to argue peak Arenado was the best home run hitter. It’s now when the Coors effect of the Mile High City comes in, and I guess you could say that the three players are pretty similar overall, with Nolan Arenado lacking the longevity career-wise, so far.\n\nIt will be an interesting test for Nolan Arenado to play as many games as Scott Rolen, but maybe that’s a goal worth working towards. They are rather similar players in some ways.\n\nIf you go by the website Baseball Reference, Scott Rolen retains his WAR total but Edmonds falls behind. BR’s defensive evaluation of Edmonds doesn’t see Jim as valuable as fangraphs. So maybe both players are borderline cases? Maybe I’ll open another can of worms!\n\nSo what just happened: Andruw Jones has entered the conversation. He is now a Hall of Famer. How does he compare here? He is between Jim Edmonds and Scott Rolen in career WAR total. He has 6! 6+ fWAR peak seasons. And nine 4+ WAR seasons! But Jim still has that beat with 10. The thing with Andruw Jones though, is that he doesn’t have a monster season, at least not like any of these Cardinal players have had. His wRC+ never peaked past 140, and he derives a lot of his value from defense. But! He had a 50+ home run season, and over 400 HR. He also played in more games than any of these guys. Even more of a power hitter.\n\nIn the end, maybe this whole time it was Andruw Jones playing alongside the career trek of Jim Edmonds, while being a little better defender and hitting even more home runs, which ultimately held back Edmonds from the Hall. When using Baseball Reference, Jones also falls back towards a 60 WAR total, but still higher than the Edmonds total. It’s so close though, that Edmonds seems to have gotten jobbed by the voting system, sort of falling through the cracks.\n\nIt seems like a good time to mention that ex-Cardinal Carlos Beltran has been inducted into the Hall of Fame! Mostly known for being one of the greatest postseason hitters of all time (and a certain scandal), Beltran certainly had a really damned good career. Beltran and Jones had rather similar WAR totals. Carlos had four 6+ fWAR seasons. Nine 4+ WAR seasons just like Andruw. But again, Edmonds with the ten four plus! It does seem like a snub. Can anyone explain the logistics of the system that lead to Jim not getting the recognition? Was it his annoying broadcasting career? I kid I kid!\n\nOne must wonder if Edmonds had played one more season to cross the 400 HR and 1200 RBI barrier, which he fell just short of. He could have used one more extra award, or something, anything, to put him over the top. He just played at a time with a ton of good baseball players. Jim Edmonds had a career OPS of .903! Jones was .823 with a much lower career batting average. They say the elite defenders make it look easy, but Jim Edmonds made it look fun. And his moonshot home runs were a thing to behold. He should be in.\n\nEdmonds was a 4 time all star, 8 gold gloves, 1 silver slugger\n\nRolen was a 7 time all star, also 8 gold gloves and 1 silver slugger\n\nBeltran was a 9 time all star, 3 gold gloves, and 2 silver slugger awards\n\nJones was a 5 time all star with 10 gold gloves, a silver slugger, and he lead the league in HR and RBI in 2005\n\nArenado is a bit different by having an incredible amount of platinum gloves, he has the highest MVP career share rank of all 5 players here based on baseball reference, while being another 8 time all star like Edmonds and Rolen, obtaining 5 silver sluggers. So for a while there he was known as the player for top tier defense with a lot of offense thrown in, less of a longevity guy and more of peak guy and an accolades collector, at least so far\n\nArenado might be showing some wear and tear: he is 7th in at bats among active players. He will be close to #1 in that department in a couple years if he can stay on the field. If he retired today, he would be top 100 all time in slugging percentage with .507! Nolan is 100th all time in career home runs, currently.\n\nOne thing that will NOT put Arenado over the top is postseason numbers. He is 1-4 in postseason series with a .385 OPS. That one win was a Rockies win over the Cubs, at least! Andruw Jones on the other hand, went to a lot of postseason games and batted .796 OPS! However, Nolan Arenado does not know what it is like to lose two World Series like Andruw Jones.\n\nScott Rolen was in 7 postseason series with the Cardinals. He was a .678 OPS postseason hitter, but won most series he was in except the 2004 world series! Of course, he won the trophy in 2006, to make up for that. Rolen’s peak postseason heroics can be summed up in the 2004 NLCS vs Houston where he hit 3 home runs against them! Allowing the Cardinals to advance to the World Series.\n\nJim Edmonds postseason should be brought up \n\nLike Edmonds and Rolen, Beltran is also 1-1 in World Series play. But to outdo Jim Edmonds really good postseason numbers, Beltran was just on a whole other level than most postseason players. A postseason OPS north of 1.000 is legendary. 1.021 to be exact. He won in 9 postseason series and lost in 6, so he was no stranger to the postseason with 65 games and 256 PA. About the same but not quite as many plate appearances as Edmonds, but in almost 20 more games over the years. Beltran had 16 postseason home runs which is more than Edmonds 13…. but, Jim did it in a lot less postseason games played. And get this: both Edmonds and Beltran have 42 RBI in the postseason. Maybe Edmonds really did get the Hall of Fame snub? He fell just short, or just fell through the cracks in the voting process.\n\nAs for Arenado, I think it only fair to remember that he hasn’t been on the right teams at the right time to amass postseason numbers like the other guys. His postseason performance so far could be attributed to small sample size nonsense. He has been stuck on teams that haven’t been nearly so successful.\n\nSpeaking of voting, I’m going to give StrawPoll a try! Vote accordingly, I hope the links work.\n\nShould Edmonds be in the Hall of Fame? – StrawPoll\n\nNolan Arenado is a more complicated Hall of Fame case. Does he make it according to the BB… – StrawPoll\n\nToday I am going to share with you the results of my last few posts, examining the best songs of 2025 through my own lists and a ton of other people’s year end lists, creating one big mega playlist and then narrowing it down to only 76 songs (just what it turned out to be, wanted to keep it at least under triple digits). I think I started out with 600 songs that I liked and then picked the best ones from that. There’s also a heavy metal version.\n\nAlso, I’m going to share with you a few choice cuts, songs that are making me happy at the moment. Which is not so easy to do in the middle of the winter. Sometimes I like dark and heavy, but sometimes I just want chill or downtempo lounge music of some form or other.\n\n2025 Albums of the Year (link contains article with the bandcamp and youtube links)\n\nHoly Scum – ‘All We Have Is Never’\n\nDax Riggs – ‘7 Songs for Spiders’\n\nNeptunian Maximalism – ‘Le Sacre Du Soleil Invaincu’\n\nStratford Rise – self-titled EP\n\neasterlin – ‘reverb claymore EP’\n\n*FACS & Martröð were added, but I am going to leave them in the honorable mention category\n\nMary Halvorson – ‘About Ghosts’\n\nNourished By Time – ‘The Passionate Ones’\n\nEarthball – ‘Outside Over There’\n\nSallow Moth – ‘Mossbane Lantern’\n\nMatmos – ‘Metallic Life Review’\n\nThe Mars Volta – ‘Lucro sucio; Los ojos del vacio\n\n*added Honorable Mention albums this week:\n\nImperial Triumphant – ‘Goldstar’\n\nPatricia Brennan – ‘Of the Near and Far’\n\nWater From Your Eyes – ‘It’s a Beautiful Place’\n\nBest Songs of 2025 List google docs\n\nThat wraps up my 2025 coverage.

Sadiki’s tactical awareness and energy fit the type of midfielder they want to integrate into their evolving side.\n\nMarc Casado has impressed with his composure on the ball and ability to control play from deep.\n\nAccording to Mundo Deportivo in Spain, United scouts have been tracking him for some time, and Atletico Madrid are also said to be interested.\n\nHowever, United appear more serious in their pursuit as they look to add depth and competition in midfield.\n\nWilfred Ndidi is currently playing in Turkey for Besiktas and is well known for his consistency, tackling, and experience in the Premier League.\n\nAccording to talkSPORT, United value his work rate and believe he could offer stability alongside the club’s younger midfielders.\n\nWhile no formal talks have taken place yet, United are expected to monitor Ndidi’s situation closely and could return with interest later in the summer if other midfield targets become unavailable.",

    "title": "Regarding 2026 Colts, one NFL exec makes somewhat surprising prediction",
    "description": "This latest NFL exec prediction for the Colts may surprise you entering the 2026 offseason.",
    "fullText": "According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, one NFL executive made a surprising prediction regarding the 2026 Indianapolis Colts. Namely, that the Colts will win the division for the first time since 2014:\n\n“But they showed a proof of concept with what they had through 10 games,” an AFC executive said via Fowler. “They had Daniel Jones playing well. The roster has talent. They are closer than people might think.”\n\nProjected as a routine bottom feeder in NFL power rankings entering this past season, the Colts shockingly became one of the hottest teams football, once sitting at 8-2 atop the AFC, and featuring a historically elite league offense—where the fresh pairing of head coach Shane Steichen and newly signed starting quarterback Daniel Jones was paying off major dividends for Indianapolis.\n\nUnfortunately, thereafter, starting quarterback Jones suffered a fractured fibula, limiting his mobility and the dynamic Colts offensive attack, before ultimately suffering a season-ending torn Achilles in Week 14 at Jacksonville—presumably because of physical overcompensation for the earlier lower leg injury.\n\nThe Colts would end up losing 7 straight games to close out the season, as in Jones’ 4-game absence, the team desperately turned to 44-year-old, unretired veteran quarterback Philip Rivers, and then rookie Riley Leonard for the regular season finale, once the team was already eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nIt wasn’t just Jones though, as particularly on defense, the Colts sustained key injuries to the unit’s three best players: DeForest Buckner, Sauce Gardner, and Charvarius Ward. On offense, the team also lost starting veteran offensive tackle Braden Smith and even left tackle Bernhard Raimann for a short stint to close out 2025.\n\nIn theory, if the Colts can re-sign Jones, who’s a pending 2026 NFL free agent, and get some of those other returning standout players healthy, they could pick up right where they left off before injuries completely derailed what once was one of the best starts to an Indianapolis regular season in years.\n\nThat being said, Jones is coming off a torn Achilles, which can be a potentially career-altering injury, especially for a 28-year-old quarterback who relies a lot on his mobility, and particularly in head coach Shane Steichen’s offense and the versatile ground game with star workhorse Jonathan Taylor.\n\nHaving suffered the injury later in the season, it’s a fair question of whether Jones will be ready for the regular season opener, let alone training camp. Even if he does return in time to be ready for 2026, what physical condition will he realistically be in? His other NFL quarterback colleagues have not recently fared all that well coming back from similar injuries to-date. Will Jones be the exception? Will it take longer than a year to recover?\n\nSome of those other veteran players hoping to potentially return are defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (neck), cornerback Charvarius Ward (three concussions last year), and pending free agent offensive tackle Braden Smith (concussion/neck). All of whom are question marks to make a full recovery as well.\n\nDespite a stalwart defense under head coach DeMeco Ryans, the Texans appear rather one-dimensional with starting quarterback C.J. Stroud’s continued playoff struggles at the moment. However, the Jacksonville Jaguars may be the toast of the AFC South until proven otherwise—as the reigning AFC South Champions, and a rival just as complete and talented as Indianapolis when at full strength and truly going right.\n\nThe Jaguars have won 5 of the 6 matchups against the Colts under Steichen and remain the divisional rival to beat within the AFC South. They’re the best team within the division until proven otherwise.\n\nIt’s also not how you start, it’s how you finish. In contrast to the Colts disastrous losing skid, the Jaguars and Texans won 8 and 9 games in a row to close out the 2025 campaign respectively. This current Colts nucleus has routinely suffered late season collapses, and they’ll have to finally overcome that and complete the job in 2026.",

    "fullText": "The former Dallas Cowboys All-Pro cornerback will have to find a new home in 2026.\n\nTrevon Diggs‘ brief stint with the Packers came to an unceremonious but expected end on Tuesday.\n\nGreen Bay released the cornerback and announced the move among a batch of forward-facing roster changes that included a pair of futures contracts. Diggs is now subject to waivers. If he clears them, which is likely, he’ll be a free agent.\n\nA six-year NFL veteran, Diggs latched on with the Packers at the end of the 2025 regular season, starting in their finale at Minnesota and recording two tackles before playing one snap in Green Bay’s Wild Card Weekend loss to Chicago.\n\nDiggs made his way to Green Bay only after Dallas abruptly parted ways with the former All-Pro defender in late December in a move that was reportedly the culmination of multiple factors over time, including performance and other components. The decision came less than three years after the Cowboys signed Diggs to a five-year, $97 million extension that preceded a season-ending ACL injury in 2023 and a tumultuous journey that followed both on and off the field.\n\nDiggs’ contract — a lucrative agreement that became a bloated one due to his lack of production — already placed him on a track to be released after the 2025 season. Instead of waiting for the offseason, the Cowboys decided to cut ties in December, freeing Diggs to join a title-contending squad with the expectation he’d likely be released by his new team after their season ended.\n\nGreen Bay did exactly that on Tuesday, freeing up the entirety of the $15 million he was scheduled to account for in cap space in 2026. Diggs faces an uncertain future as heads to free agency, but will have a head start on finding a new home prior to the start of the new league year in March.\n\nIf Brian Schottenheimer has a year two jump like Mike Macdonald, they will be in the NFC Championship.\n\nThe Cowboys are in the second phase of their interviews to replace defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said earlier this offseason that he threw a party when they hired Eberflus. A year later, Eberflus was fired after directing the defense that allowed the most points in franchise history.\n\nThe Cowboys have completed in-person interviews with two candidates so far: Minnesota defensive passing game coordinator Daronte Jones and former Arizona Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon, who was the defensive coordinator in Philadelphia before his three seasons in Arizona. Jones has become a popular name across a league that features many defensive coordinator openings. He’s expected to interview with the New York Giants and Green Bay Packers after also interviewing with the New York Jets.\n\nThe Cowboys are also expected to interview Philadelphia defensive passing game coordinator Christian Parker on Wednesday. In addition, don’t be surprised if the Cowboys try to interview Denver defensive passing game coordinator Jim Leonhard after the AFC Championship Game on Sunday. Because the Cowboys already interviewed Leonhard, they can interview him again even if the Broncos win and advance to the Super Bowl.\n\nAs of now, the Cowboys appear to be sticking to a process that they want to perform at their own pace.\n\n“I’ve done it with consensus since the first day I walked through the door here,” Jones said about the hiring process. “We’ll do it the same way we hired [Eberflus]. We’ll do it together and come up with as good as we can.”\n\nAs the Seahawks have shown, it can get pretty good with the right defensive play-caller.\n\nMike Macdonald was a rising young defensive coordinator before the Seahawks hired him to be their head coach in 2024. For good reason. In his final season as the Ravens defensive coordinator, for example, Baltimore became the first team in NFL history to lead in scoring defense, takeaways and sacks.\n\nThe Cowboys hit another home run along the offensive line in the draft.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cowboys rookie guard Tyler Booker was named to the Pro Football Writers Association’s All-Rookie team.\n\nBooker becomes the first Cowboy to earn a spot on the roster since 2022, when his fellow offensive lineman Tyler Smith got the nod as a tackle.\n\nIn his rookie season, Booker started in all 15 games he played in at right guard, missing two games due to a high ankle sprain that he returned from quickly. He filled the slot that was left open by future Hall of Famer Zack Martin, who retired after the 2024 season following 11 years with the Cowboys.\n\nAmong all rookies with at least 500 pass blocking snaps, Booker ranked third among all offensive linemen in pressure rate (5.9%) and allowed the lowest QB pressures (17) and second-lowest sacks (1.5) when facing a defender one-on-one.\n\nIn the run game, the area Booker specialized in out of college at Alabama, he helped Dallas’ offensive line pave the way for an average of 125.6 yards per game on the ground, the ninth-highest average in the league.\n\nAfter the season concluded, his fellow guard on the other side of the line, Pro Bowler Tyler Smith, called Booker one of the best rookies he’s ever seen.\n\n“I think his [Year 2] jump could be astronomical, bro,” Smith said. “I’ll be honest: he’s one of the best rookies, at least in my time here, and I’m only a Year 4, but he’s one of the best rookies we ever had.”\n\nNow, Booker will look to take that astronomical step in his second season. How does he see that happening? Consistency.\n\n“I’ll go out there and have plays where I kind of think that I look like Tyler Smith. Then I have plays where I look like the rookie that I am,” Booker said. “So just cutting out those little rookie plays, I like to call them, and just continue to dominate and really take games over.”\n\nDallas has one more interview set for this week before fans set their sights on what will happen with Jim Leonhard.\n\nLate Tuesday afternoon, Jonathan Gannon, the former coach of the Arizona Cardinals, finished up interviews with the Cowboys front office and coach Brian Schottenheimer for the vacant defensive coordinator position at The Star.\n\nOn Wednesday, Eagles passing game coordinator/defensive backs coach Christian Parker will visit.\n\nAfter that, the Cowboys have no more in-person interviews scheduled, two people with knowledge of the process told The Dallas Morning News.\n\nThe Cowboys have invited three coaches for in-person interviews. Last Saturday, Daronté Jones, the Vikings’ defensive backs coach/passing game coordinator, was the first in-person interview.\n\nAnd now, after Gannon and the expected discussion with Parker, it would appear the Cowboys might be done.\n\nHowever, Jim Leonhard, the Broncos’ defensive passing game/assistant head coach, remains on the team’s radar. Leonhard has conducted a virtual interview with club officials but hasn’t come to Texas for an in-person chat.\n\nLeonhard’s team is in the AFC Championship Game and, based on league rules, if he does any in-person interviews, they must conclude by Saturday.\n\nNFL teams have Tuesdays off during a game week, and if Leonhard were to visit the Cowboys it likely would have been then. Yet, the team interviewed Gannon.\n\nSo if Leonhard visits the Cowboys, it might happen late Friday or early Saturday so he could get back to Denver in time for Sunday’s game.\n\nOf course, if the Broncos get eliminated from the postseason, he could interview for the Cowboys’ job if it’s still available.",

    "fullText": "Who: Pittsburgh Penguins (23-14-11, 57 points, 3rd place Metropolitan Division) @ Calgary Flames (21-23-5, 47 points, 7th place Pacific Division)\n\nHow to Watch: Locally broadcast on Sportsnet Pittsburgh, SN1 and TVAS in Canada, streaming on ESPN+\n\nPens’ Path Ahead: The road trip continues tomorrow night in Edmonton, then an uncharacteristic two-day break gives the chance for some team bonding until the trip finishes up in Vancouver on Sunday. After that the Pens get a few days to regroup after heading home, not playing again until next Thursday Jan 29th to start their busy run to the upcoming Olympic break.\n\nOpponent Track: Since we last saw the Flames in Pittsburgh on January 10th they went on to finish their eastern road trip with a loss to Columbus and win over Chicago before returning home to split another pair of games with a win over the Islanders last Saturday followed by a loss (in overtime) to the Devils in their last game on Monday. Thus continues an up-and-down stretch where they’ve won six out of the last 12 games (6-5-1).\n\nSeason Series: The Flames took a 2-1 decision in a rough and tumble game a couple weeks ago, Logan Cooley made 27 saves to break Pittsburgh’s then six-game winning streak. Egor Chinakhov scored the lone goal for the Pens, Matthew Coronato’s third period goal to break a 1-1 tie helped Calgary secure the win.\n\nHidden Stat: Rickard Rakell is on a three-game point streak. Pittsburgh is 12-2-2 this season when Rakell records a point (h/t Pens PR).\n\nConnor Zary – Nazem Kadri – Matvei Gridin\n\nJonathan Huberdeau – Morgan Frost – Joel Farabee\n\nYegor Sharangovich – Mikael Backlund – Matt Coronato\n\nRyan Lomberg – Justin Kirkland – Adam Klapka\n\nYan Kuznetsov / MacKenzie Weegar\n\nJoel Hanley / Hunter Brzustewicz\n\nGoalies: Dustin Wolf and Logan Cooley\n\nPotential scratches: Dryden Hunt, Brayden Pachal\n\nInjured Reserve: Blake Coleman, John Beecher, Samuel Honzek, Jake Bean\n\nThe biggest change to the lines from the last recent PIT/CGY game is the trade departure of key defenseman Rasmus Andersson and the addition of Whitecloud from that transaction. It’s a big loss to the current squad – Anderssen had 10 goals and 30 points this season for the Flames, ranking third on the team in both categories.\n\nThe 21-year old Brzustewicz has replaced Anderssen on the top power play. Despite only having one career NHL point in 16 games, he has an offensive profile with a 92 point season in the OHL in 2023-24 and 44 points in the AHL since the start of the 2024-25 season.\n\nColeman, who was on IR back for the Jan 10th game, has dropped his no contact jersey in practice and may be nearing a return.\n\nPerhaps luckily for Chinakhov, Brayden Pachal has been a scratch lately.\n\nWolf has been Calgary’s primary goalie, but lately there’s been more of an even split due to Cooley playing really well lately (including, as mentioned, in Calgary’s recent win over the Pens). The two Flames goalies have each played three out of the last six games, Cooley did play their last game. He picked up the loss in OT, but stopped 29/31 shots to get there. Given how well he did against Pittsburgh in the recent past, it’ll be interesting to see if the Flames go back to Cooley for this game or turn the net back over to their usual starter in Wolf, who is only 1-5-0 with a .891 save% and 3.71 GAA in the calendar year of 2026 (compared to Cooley’s 2-0-1 record, .951 save% and 1.33 GAA stat line).\n\nThe size and ruggedness of the Flames really stood out in their last game against the Pens. Klapka at 6’8” and 235 pounds is a menace and was getting under the skin of several Penguin players. Klapka’s 172 hits this season ranks 4th in the entire NHL, he’s going to throw the body on the forecheck on every available opportunity. Kevin Bahl at 6’6”, 230 has been a force averaging over 21 minutes per game this season, and has four assists in his last six games. Yan Kuznetsov presents another big body on the blueline, Pachal laid one of the biggest hits of the season last game. Mackenzie Weegar isn’t a huge frame, but a stout one with 117 hits this season. That game had a lot of tempers raised with post-whistle scrums and physicality throughout, surely that fresh memory will be at the top of everyone’s minds for tonight.\n\nGenerating offense has been a real struggle for the Flames. Their 2.55 goals/game mark is only 29th in the NHL, their power play at 14.9% is a dreadful 31st. It’s not for a lack of trying (28.9 shots/game ranks 12th) but the lack of skill and overall ability has hindered them in a major way.\n\nKey to the game: Penguins vs. goalie\n\nThis one is pretty cut and dry; while the Flames have been impotent offensively and don’t have a lot going for them these days, the one area they are getting great inputs from is the play of their goalies. Early in the season that was Wolf, lately it’s been Cooley as the hot hand.\n\nThe Pens ran up a 2.75 expected goal total against Calgary on January 10th, yet Cooley only gave up one actual goal and the Flames won a 2-1 game almost entirely due to the strong play of their goalie. The Flames low overall talent level gives them a very narrow path towards winning games, they’re going to need a goalie to steal it for them more often than not. That presents a clear challenge for Pittsburgh in this game: overcome the Flames’ strongest suit in the goalie factor (whether it ends up being Cooley or Wolf) and the rest ought to be right there for the taking. A performance for the Pens similar to the last game against Seattle (where Pittsburgh scored 5 non-empty net goals on 2.88 expected) would be the ideal in this game, as it would in just about any game. Given Calgary’s unimpressive defensive metrics, that should be on the table, though Pittsburgh (at 9th in expected 5v5 goals and just 21st in 5v5 actual goals) will need to execute on their chances in ways they didn’t in the last meeting.\n\nRickard Rakell – Sidney Crosby – Bryan Rust\n\nEgor Chinakhov  – Tommy Novak – Evgeni Malkin\n\nAnthony Mantha – Ben Kindel – Justin Brazeau\n\nConnor Dewar – Blake Lizotte – Noel Acciari\n\nGoalies:  Stuart Skinner and Arturs Silovs\n\nPotential Scratches: Jack St. Ivany, Kevin Hayes, Ilya Solovyov\n\nIR: Erik Karlsson, Filip Hallander, Caleb Jones\n\nAll eyes will be on Letang after he missed practice yesterday and was deemed day-to-day with an upper body injury by the team. Letang’s potential absence or lack of being 100% is a huge blow for an already depleted blueline that doesn’t have Erik Karlsson.\n\nKarlsson has said he’s feeling better but won’t play tonight, though it’s hard to tell when he’s being serious or not. You would think he’s not playing tonight, but who knows.\n\nThe current goalie rotation would mean Silovs plays tonight, though in game strategy with a very tough matchup looming tomorrow against Edmonton, does Dan Muse make a departure from that in hopes to put the goalie in better form out for the first game of the b-2-b where presumably the team has a better chance of a positive result? If not, Must may be bet Skinner can raise his levels against his former team tomorrow, though they already have seen Skinner play against the Oilers and it didn’t go well (5 goals against on 22 shots) which also can be a data point for the current decision.\n\nFound it curious when early yesterday the Pens somewhat quietly sent Joona Koppanen back to the AHL, which didn’t make much sense on a long road trip like this. Turns out that was a precursor move to open up an NHL roster spot for the trade to bring in Ilya Solovyov and then it made perfect sense.\n\nSidney Crosby is riding a streak of three-straight games with multiple points. Last game pushed him past Gordie Howe, the next one will tie Mark Messier and Marcel Dionne. Seemingly every game Crosby is approaching and/or passing legendary names in any number of categories – the two points last game vs. Seattle tied Mario Lemieux’s total of 784 road points.",

    "title": "A deep dive into Trinidad Chambliss versus the NCAA",
    "description": "Breaking down everything you need to know about Chambliss’ petition for a 6th year of eligibility.",
    "fullText": "The legal event everyone knew was coming since the day after the Fiesta Bowl arrived on Friday, January 16th.\n\nTrinidad Chambliss, via attorney William Liston, filed a petition for an injunction to allow him to play football for Ole Miss in the 2026 season after the NCAA denied his wavier request for a final year of eligibility.\n\nAs with any case, there are layers and nuance that the usual suspect idiots will ignore because they’re lazy, but for those who want to dig into the details, it requires time. Since everyone has things to do, I’ll attempt to break down this petition and case layer by layer so you don’t have to spend hours that aren’t billable to understand everything.\n\nI did something similar for the Jerrell Powe alleged kidnapping saga. As I noted in that post and it still applies, my legal training is Lionel Hutz, the Phil Hartman-voiced lawyer on The Simpsons, when he told Marge that she was in luck with her case because “I was watching Matlock in a bar last night. The sound wasn’t on, but I got the gist of it.”\n\nSo keep that in mind if I unintentionally stray into legal analysis.\n\nChambliss enrolled at Ferris State (his school prior to Ole Miss) in the fall of 2021. That means he’s been in college for 5 fall seasons (‘21, ‘22, ‘23, ‘24, and ‘25).\n\nHowever, he didn’t play in 2021 and 2022 due to what he says were medical reasons. As a result, he believes he should be granted an additional year of eligibility for the 2026 season because it would be his 4th and final season to actually play in college football games (‘23, ‘24, ‘25, and ‘26).\n\nOle Miss, on Chambliss’ behalf, took this argument to the NCAA in October of 2025 and asked for an eligibility waiver. The NCAA, a chill organization filled with fun people who like cool things, denied the waiver because they claim there wasn’t enough documentation to back up Chambliss’ claim of the medical issues preventing him from playing in ‘21 and ‘22.\n\nIt took the NCAA almost a month and a half to reach that conclusion and rendered judgment the day after Ole Miss lost the Fiesta Bowl to Miami. Making it even more grotesque, the NCAA posted its decision on Twitter (X) WHILE ON A CALL WITH OLE MISS COMPLIANCE (page 19).\n\nThat means, after waiting a month and a half for a decision, Chambliss found out when everyone else did. Elite “eat some more shit, peasants,” which is on brand.\n\nIn response to the waiver denial, Ole Miss filed an appeal, which escalates the final waiver decision to a committee of more important people at the NCAA than those who initially denied the waiver. Allegedly, these more important people could issue decision in the next few weeks, but that would be out of character for those professional draggers of feet.\n\nInstead of waiting for the inevitable second denial from the NCAA, Chambliss and his lawyers chose to take matters to the legal system in an effort potentially speed up the process of him being allowed to resume activities as a member of the 2026 Ole Miss football team.\n\nIt’s mostly what he argued in his waiver request to the NCAA with TRIAL LAWYA additions of note. He’s only played 3 seasons due to medical hardships and wants a 4th, which he says should be granted according to NCAA bylaws.\n\nOle Miss presented evidence to back up Chambliss’ medical hardship claims, as required by the NCAA. After receiving the evidence that “satisfies all the requirements” for a waiver, the NCAA denied the waiver through a combination of making stuff up, doing what they want, being lazy, and acting like antagonistic assholes.\n\nThe petition says the NCAA, in denying the waiver, “breached its duty of acting in good faith and fair dealing” owed to Chambliss as a third-party beneficiary of the contract between Ole Miss and the NCAA, as well as Ferris State and the NCAA. It notes that a breach of good faith is when a party violates “standards of decency, fairness, or reasonableness.” Well, now, that doesn’t sound like the NCAA!\n\nThere are! The petition alleges 14 instances of the NCAA breaching its duty:\n\nClaimed 91 pages of supplied documentation related to Chambliss’ medical issues were “non-contemporaneous” (more on this in a minute!)\n\nRefused to apply the waiver criteria according to their own policies (i.e., making stuff up)\n\nDid not attempt to understand the seriousness of Chambliss’ medical condition or investigate documentation of it (i.e., lazy)\n\nIgnoring letters that would’ve satisfied the waiver criteria (i.e., doing what they want)\n\nFailed to interpret evidence in compliance with their student-first policies (i.e., more doing what they want)\n\nIgnoring D-I and D-II bylaws that say practices and scrimmages don’t count in terms of eligibility years (i.e., lazy and more doing what they want)\n\nThinking it’s unfair to other athletes that Chambliss could have a 4th year of getting to play (i.e., what?)\n\nApplying the waiver rule in a manner that was “antagonistic rather than cooperative” (i.e., intentionally being assholes)\n\nFailing to “fairly and reasonably” apply evidence required by the waiver rule (i.e., more of doing what they want)\n\nPresenting no evidence that contradicts or disputes the evidence Ole Miss presented (i.e., lazy and more of doing what they want)\n\nFailed to understand Chambliss’ medical conditions were beyond his control (i.e., lazy and assholes)\n\nFailed to obtain analysis from a medical expert when they disagreed with Chambliss’ doctor (i.e., lazy and more of doing what they want)\n\nIssued false and misleading public statements about Ole Miss’ request for a waiver (i.e., assholes and more of doing what they want)\n\nEngaged in “unfair, unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious processing and adjudicating” of the waiver request (i.e., lazy and more of doing what they want)\n\nObviously, these are all written with a SOMEWHAT favorable angle to Chambliss’ case, but shout-out to William Liston for dialing up the Jackie Chiles on that last example.\n\nIn short, not being able to play football and cash money. As you may recall, Chambliss and Ole Miss reached an agreement prior to the Fiesta Bowl that would pay him somewhere north of $5 million for the 2026 season.\n\nAccording to the petition, without an injunction granting him relief, Chambliss will lose:\n\nA 4th year of playing in college football games, which is contrary to NCAA bylaws\n\nMonetary losses in the millions of dollars (even if he is drafted)\n\nThe petition also goes on to note how the public (especially Oxford and the state of Mississippi) has an interest in Chambliss being allowed to play, as his presence makes Ole Miss a better football team and serves as an “economic driver” for all.\n\nYou mean other than being generally miserable and making stuff up as they go because they know they’ll never be held accountable for it?\n\nThe main reason they denied Chambliss’ waiver request is they claimed there was a “lack of contemporaneous medical documentation.” In other words, medical records/notes/letters from ‘21 and ‘22 that would verify Chambliss’ claim of medical hardship.\n\nThe petition states the NCAA was provided with 91 pages of said documentation, but they chose to outright lie about certain documents not being provided and pick portions of documents that backed their pre-determined outcome of denial.\n\nFor example, they cite a doctor’s note from December of 2022 where Chambliss was “doing very well” since his visit in August, but they chose to ignore that the doctor, in the same note, also said Chambliss had issues with his tonsils.\n\nThe petition goes on to define the word “contemporaneous” for the NCAA since they, unlike the rest of the free world, think it means something other than “happening or existing at the same period of time.” They apparently think it means “simultaneous,” which the petition notes would put an unreasonable burden on anyone to produce medical records on a specific date the NCAA selects.\n\nCorrect! Though, to be fair, let me remind you the petition is written as favorably as possible to Chambliss’ case. But even if you take out some of the TRIAL LAWYA massaging of the language, it only reduces their jerk level by maybe 10 percent.\n\nBetter than winning his appeal with the NCAA!\n\nThe biggest distinction between Chambliss’ case and eligibility cases the NCAA has won is that he filed his petition in Lafayette County, Mississippi chancery court and not federal court.\n\nThe distinction is important because, just last week, the NCAA won an eligibility case in federal court and has won more than half its federal court eligibility cases. In last week’s case, the plaintiffs said the limitations on eligibility violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, which the judge disagreed with.\n\nFriend of the program @VegasRebs, an actual lawyer, has a highly informative thread on what Chambliss has to show to get the injunction, and why it’s likely it will be granted:\n\nTo get an injunction in Mississippi, parties have to show that there is 1. an immediate threat of irreparable harm or damage, 2. that money alone cannot remedy, 3., that the balance of the damages falls toward the moving party, and 4. that the injunction serves a public interest\n\n— #LiveLikeLucas (@VegasRebs) January 16, 2026\n\nIn short, based on Mississippi law, Chambliss has a strong case, and the NCAA will not have a lot of good answers for the judge, who you may have heard has a degree from Delta State and went to Ole Miss law school.\n\nHe’s not going to agree with everything in the petition, but he will have little patience for guardians of the game dipshittery.\n\nMore than likely, not any time soon, which is what Ole Miss and Chambliss want. All they need is for the case to run beyond the 2026 season.\n\nWhat happens after that doesn’t matter. The season will be over, and Chambliss will have used the final year of eligibility he’s seeking.\n\nThe judicial system already moves at a glacial-ish pace, but throw in some TRIAL LAWYA tactics, and this thing may still be going while LSU is looking for a new coach in 2029.\n\nThere are no locks with Ole Miss, but he is the betting favorite.\n\nI don’t know what the current diaper production volume in the United States is, but it’s not enough to handle the impending demand. Filled diapers and ruptured blood vessels in the eyes everywhere.",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia 76ers star Tyrese Maxey is on his way to becoming one of the more popular players in the league. He was voted an All-Star starter and will be receiving a signature shoe from New Balance. All of it is rewarding for a player who is on the up and up.\n\nOn top of being voted in as an All-Star starter, Maxey was the top vote getter among American-born players. That fact has to make one wonder whether the star guard would play for Team USA in the 2028 Olympics should the opportunity arise.\n\n\"I would love to play for Team USA,\" Maxey said on Monday. \"If I got that honor, it would be a blessing. I think it’s in LA, right? So, it’s in the United States. That would be really cool. Just to represent the country in the country and if that’s something that I have the opportunity to do, then I’ll definitely be there for it.\"\n\nMaxey will certainly be in the mix. One has to believe due to what he has done with the Sixers, he will be on Team USA's radar. The Olympic competition is heating up and one has to believe everything will come down to Maxey, Detroit Pistons star Cade Cunningham, and New York Knicks star Jalen Brunson in terms of the guards Team USA will look at.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Sixers star Tyrese Maxey discusses 2028 Team USA Olympic possibility",

    "fullText": "Both midfielders were booked in the second half at the San Siro, with Merino cautioned first around the 78th minute and Rice shown a yellow in stoppage time. Both were clear bookings.\n\nThose cautions took each player to three bookings in this season’s competition, triggering automatic one-match bans under UEFA rules.\n\nRice had already been booked in the opening win over Athletic Club and again in the 2-0 victory against Olympiacos, making the Inter caution his third.\n\nMerino had previously been booked away to Slavia Prague and at home to Bayern Munich.\n\nThe suspensions will rule both out of the home match against Kairat Almaty, a fixture that is a dead rubber with qualification and a top-two spot already secured.\n\nWhile their absence reduces options in midfield, Mikel Arteta was expected to rotate heavily regardless, using the game to manage minutes and give opportunities to other players.\n\nIt also seems likely that both players, the only ones at risk of a suspension apart from Christian Norgaard, picked up the cards deliberately in order to get the suspension out of the way when it didn’t matter.",

I’m not someone who takes a lot of medical timeouts so I was a bit scared,” Zverev said. “But it was the Achilles tendon and there have been a lot of Achilles tendon injuries over the past couple of years on tour.\n\n“I just wanted the physio to check it out, but I was moving fine, feeling fine and hopefully tomorrow it will be fine as well.”",

We can do it but we must be united and play better,\" coach Kasper Hjulmand said.\n\nLeverkusen had 71% possession and 17-6 shots on goal in Piraeus but it was the hosts who scored from Costinha in the second minute and Mehdi Taremi in first half stoppage time.\n\nThe 2024 Bundesliga champions have scored only one goal in their three 2026 matches while conceding seven, something Hjulmand urged must change.\n\n\"With this pressure we must show our best performance on the pitch. We must use the pressure to play sharper,\" he said.\n\nDortmund's fate in London was also sealed in the first half from Cristian Romero in the 14th and Dominic Solanke in the 37th, with Dortmund's Daniel Svensson sent off in the 24th upon review for a challenge against Wilson Odobert.\n\nKehl named the red card \"very harsh\" but also admitted that \"we hoped for and expected much more here\" against a Spurs team struggling in the Premier League.\n\n\"We will certainly discuss this very critically with the team. The first half was poor – few tackles, few direct duels won, little intensity. And we carelessly squandered the chances we had today in the first half,\" Kehl said.\n\nLast year's finalists Inter will be no pushover and in ninth place also need the points to advance directly.\n\nBut before that Dortmund face a not easy Bundesliga trip to Union Berlin. Dortmund are second but needed a stoppage time penalty last weekend to beat bottom club St Pauli.",

    "fullText": "Lewis Koumas, 20, was sent to Birmingham City during the off-season but has been unable to carve out a role for himself as a starter in Chris Davies’ squad.\n\nThe Wales international has been involved plenty in matchday squads - but game time has been at a premium.\n\nDavies has admitted that discussions had taken place over the best way forward for Koumas - with the player also admitting that talks were ongoing with Liverpool over his future.\n\nAnd now it looks as though the versatile attacker’s fate is sealed at St. Andrew’s. Birmingham have signed ANOTHER attacker on loan for the rest of the season in the shape of Ibrahim Osman.\n\nBrighton opted to cut his loan deal short at Auxerre in Ligue 1 - instead sending him on loan to the second tier for the second half of the season.\n\nThis creates a couple of problems for Koumas.\n\nThe first is that competition for his place has been ramped up. The second reason is that Birmingham now have SIX players on loan and Championship regulations dictate that they can only have FIVE in their matchday squad.\n\nThe Birmingham Mail paints two scenarios over how the Blues will deal with their new problem. The club may look into making Patrick Roberts’ loan deal from Sunderland permanent or else they are preparing to send Koumas back to Liverpool.\n\nThe report also states that the recall window for Koumas has been extended - suggesting that Birmingham are currently weighing up the next step carefully.\n\nAlthough Koumas has played - and scored - for Liverpool’s first team it’s highly unlikely he would form part of Arne Slot’s squad for the rest of the season.\n\nInstead he seems destined to be fixed up with a second loan - most probably at Championship level where he played for Stoke City last season.",

    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears might've suffered a brutal end to their 2025 season in a divisional round loss to the Los Angeles Rams, but they also found their franchise quarterback in Caleb Williams, who continues to be the biggest talking point coming out of that game.\n\nIn his second season, Williams garnered a reputation for being clutch with the game on the line. He led an NFL-record seven fourth-quarter comebacks, and he was positioned to earn his eighth before a comeback bid fell short in overtime.\n\nBut the reason the Bears were even positioned to beat the Rams in overtime was because of yet another improbable, sensational throw that only Williams could make. If you thought last week's incredible fourth-and-8 completion to Rome Odunze was thrilling, Williams' game-tying touchdown to Cole Kmet on fourth-and-4 with 18 seconds left somehow topped it.\n\nWilliams threw a 14-yard touchdown to Kmet, but it was more like a 40-yard score after Williams backpedaled and managed to get the ball off without setting his feet and perfectly placing a pass to Kmet in the back corner of the end zone or the game-tying score.\n\nInside the NFL shared an incredible clip of Bears and Rams players' reactions to that Williams' touchdown, in real time, and it was as hilarious and perfect as you'd expect.\n\nThe reactions to @CALEBcsw’s game‑tying TD? Almost as unreal as the throw itself.@insidetheNFL NFL Playoffs Mic'd Up on X pic.twitter.com/OEfX0pcgrr\n\n\"That's ridiculous,\" head coach Ben Johnson said after the game. \"You talk about that fourth-and-8 from last week and how outstanding that was, and I think this one was probably even another level ahead of that. There's some things that you just can't coach. He's got that bottom, he's got a knack, he's clutch. He does so many good things. He's an eraser. I have plenty of bad calls each and every week, and he helps make it right for me.\"\n\nWhile Williams' sensational throw didn't result in a win, it's a play that will live in infamy in Bears history as one of two of the best postseason throws in NFL history in consecutive weeks for the former No. 1 pick.\n\nFollow Bears Wire on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears, Rams players lost their minds on Caleb Williams' game-tying TD",

    "description": "Raducanu’s admission of needing to ‘re-evaluate’ her game and wanting to play like she did when she won the US Open at the age of 18 follows a revolving door of coaches over the past four-and-a-half years",
    "fullText": "As Emma Raducanu acknowledged herself, winning the US Open as an 18-year-old qualifier was always going to set an extremely unfair level of expectations for an inexperienced player so early on in their career, with so much still to learn. But, four-and-a-half years after that night in New York, the British No 1 admitted the attempts to develop her game have not worked, that it’s time to take a step back, “re-evaluate”, and perhaps play more like she did when she was younger.\n\nRaducanu’s second-round exit to Anastasia Potapova at the Australian Open followed a difficult off-season where the 23-year-old was limited by a foot injury. Making it to the start line in Melbourne, let alone playing five matches so far this season, she said, was pretty surprising. Raducanu said her foot has not been 100 per cent during the Australian Open and it will require further assessment once she returns home. Tricky court conditions, with a swirling wind around the grounds, didn’t help either.\n\nBut the biggest problem Raducanu identified after her 7-6 (7-3), 6-2 defeat to Potapova, the world No 55, was the absence of what she called her tennis “identity”. Despite leading 5-3 in the opening set, Raducanu was erratic and tentative, played without confidence behind her attacking shots, and felt she had to scrap to survive. As the errors piled up, the weapon that made her perhaps the most unexpected grand slam champion of all time in 2021 – her big, early forehand strike – deserted her.\n\n“At the end of the day, I just want to hit the ball to the corners and hard,” she said. “I feel like I’m doing all this variety, and it’s not doing what I want it to do. I need to just work on playing in a way more similar to how I was playing when I was younger. I always just changed direction, took the ball early, and went for it. I think I do have the ability to do many things on the court, but I feel like as I’m learning all those skills, it’s like I need to stick to my guns a bit as well and work on that. For me, it’s pretty simple.”\n\nRaducanu’s admission that she feels she has lost her way is perhaps not surprising given the revolving door of coaches that followed her shock grand slam breakthrough – “I think there are just many iterations that are going on and have gone on,” she said.\n\nRaducanu had appeared to find some stability in Francisco Roig, the Spaniard who was part of Rafael Nadal’s team during a large chunk of his illustrious career. Yet Raducanu was particularly flat and subdued against Potapova, her head dropping after losing the first set, and there appeared to be little to no communication with her coaching box.\n\n“I think I want to be playing a different way, and I think the misalignment with how I’m playing right now and how I want to be playing is something that I just want to work on,” she said, in an ominous sign that a further change could follow.\n\n“I think there are definitely pockets of me playing how I want to play, and it comes out in flashes, which is a positive, and maybe more than certain times in my career in the last few years. But it’s not how I want to be consistently every day. It’s not going to fall into place straight away, but the more I work on how I want to be playing, it will be more of my identity every time I step onto the court.”\n\nPerhaps the most concerning aspect of Raducanu’s dissatisfaction was her struggles with her forehand, which gave up 16 of her 28 unforced errors during the defeat. Before the Australian Open, Raducanu was asked about the different forehand swing she brought to Melbourne, which is now bigger and higher, taking more time to get around the ball, and pointedly said the changes were “not something that I really wanted to happen”.\n\nRaducanu knows she is not the same player without her favourite strike. “I definitely want to feel better on certain shots before I start playing again,” she said, identifying that fixing the forehand will be more of a priority than her foot.\n\nAfter a positive 2025 season, where Raducanu returned to the world’s top 30 and ensured she was seeded for a major for the first time in three years, being sidelined for the majority of the off-season undoubtedly stalled her progress. She was limited to static drills before flying to Australia and, at a time of the season where the majority of other players are fresh and ready to go, Raducanu did not feel set once the year began. Last season, her exits at the grand slams came to the very best players in the world, in Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina. Still, another tough draw followed. Despite her seeding at the Australian Open, a third-round clash with top seed Sabalenka loomed large in Melbourne.\n\nBut Raducanu did not even make it that far. It is, in many ways, a backwards step, which in turn may lead to Raducanu returning to square one and winding back the clock in a bid to find the answers.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine is set to receive 40,000 interceptor drones in January, thanks in part to a reward system that pays firms for every kill scored against a Russian Shahed, the country's defense minister said.\n\nMykhailo Fedorov said on Tuesday that Kyiv had rolled out a program inviting defense companies to test their small interceptor drones in Ukraine, paying them $20,000 for each Shahed drone their product destroyed.\n\n\"At the time, no one believed in it,\" Fedorov said at a press briefing. \"But now, by this month, 40,000 interceptors are expected to be delivered to the military.\"\n\nOften short of munitions and weapons, Ukraine invites defense firms from around the world — though mostly NATO countries — to test their products on the battlefield.\n\nFedorov, who was appointed defense minister last week, said the payment program had focused on the Chernihiv area, which sits between Kyiv and Russia's western border. Long-range attack drones launched from that border must fly over Chernihiv to reach the Ukrainian capital, and the region thus sees some of the heaviest Shahed flight traffic.\n\nInterceptor drones in Ukraine are generally small, first-person-view drones designed to fly at high speed to catch Russia's Gerans, delta-wing explosive-carrying drones closely based on the Iranian Shahed.\n\nThe most common type of Geran that Ukraine faces can cruise at roughly 6,500 feet and fly at up to 115 mph.\n\nBecause Russia can launch hundreds of these at a time, resource-strapped Ukrainians have prioritized keeping the cost of interceptor drones as low as possible. A typical one costs roughly several thousand US dollars.\n\nFedorov said on Tuesday that Ukraine's military had been actively looking into interceptors since at least February 2025. The technology has evolved rapidly over the last year, with Ukrainian firms still experimenting with designs at the start of 2025 and now scaling up manufacturing for mass production.\n\nReceiving 40,000 interceptors a month would mean that Ukraine can deploy more than 1,000 of them a day — an initial production goal set by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn a separate press briefing on Monday, Zelenskyy repeated that his country was now able to produce about 1,000 interceptors per day.\n\n\"But that is not enough,\" he said. \"Because, frankly speaking, our interceptor drones have already outpaced the number of our operators.\"\n\nZelenskyy said that Fedorov and Ukraine's chief commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, have been assigned with recruiting, training, and deploying more troops who can fly interceptor drones.",

    "description": "When an autonomous agent escalated by filing a GitHub issue using my identity",
    "fullText": "I left Codex running autonomously in a VM overnight. When I woke up, it had done what any responsible engineer would do when hitting a wall: escalate the problem.\n\nThe escalation path it chose? File a GitHub issue.\n\nLet me explain how we got here, why this is both hilarious and a preview of the next security problem we’re all about to trip over, and what “agent safety” actually looks like.\n\nContext: I was debugging an ESP32-P4 firmware issue with the Wokwi emulator. The custom firmware was stalling at “Enabling RNG early entropy source…” in the bootloader, while the hello_world example worked fine. Standard embedded debugging: one thing works, one thing doesn’t, figure out why.\n\nI had Codex (let’s call it “Codex Ralph”) running in fully autonomous mode with access to the Wokwi CLI, GitHub CLI, and MCP tools. The setup was intentional: I wanted the agent to be able to iterate, test, and yes, even escalate problems when stuck. The feedback loop is the unlock—being able to run code, see results, and try something else without human latency.\n\nThe agent hit the same wall I had: the firmware stall didn’t make sense, the logs weren’t revealing anything obvious, and local debugging wasn’t yielding progress. So it did what a human engineer might do: check if this is a known issue, and if not, file one.\n\nThe problem? It had access to gh issue create via my GitHub credentials, and no guardrails preventing it from using them.\n\nHere’s the issue it filed (I’ve since closed it):\n\nESP32-P4 custom firmware stalls in bootloader after RNG; hello_world works #1067\n\nThe issue is actually well-structured. It includes environment details, reproduction steps, serial logs for both the failing custom firmware and the working hello_world control, and a clear description of the problem. It’s not garbage—it’s a reasonable bug report.\n\nThe only problem? I never approved it.\n\nWhen Uri (Wokwi’s maintainer) responded asking if I’d figured it out, I had to explain:\n\n“Hey, to be totally honest, I left codex ralphing on the codebase autonomously in a VM and it decided that it did everything and the only course of action was file an issue here as it had access to gh cli.”\n\nUri was remarkably understanding: “Thanks for explaining! Actually, we’re looking to learn how people use Wokwi with AI coding agents…”\n\nBut let’s be clear: I got lucky. Uri is a thoughtful maintainer who’s actively thinking about AI agent workflows. Another maintainer might have labeled it spam, banned the account, or worse—this could have been proprietary code, leaked credentials, or something actually damaging.\n\nCompare this to what happened with Tailwind CSS, where an AI-native improvement from a well-intended contributor sat ignored for two months before escalating into an anti-AI shitshow. Proof that sentiment toward AI-assisted contributions varies wildly across maintainers.\n\nThis wasn’t malicious. It was an agent doing exactly what I told it to: solve problems. The fact that “solve problems” included “speak publicly as me” was an oversight.\n\nBeyond the funny story—and it is funny—this incident reveals something important about where we’re headed with autonomous agents.\n\n“Fully autonomous mode” isn’t just generating text. It’s operating your accounts.\n\nWhen we give agents access to tools like GitHub CLI, we’re not just giving them code-generation capabilities. We’re giving them the ability to create public artifacts that carry our identity. This is fundamentally different from generating code locally.\n\nWe’re used to thinking about AI safety in terms of prompt injection, jailbreaks, or model poisoning. Those are real problems. But here’s a more immediate security vector: agents that can speak publicly as you without your explicit approval.\n\nThe deeper issue is a collapse of authority boundaries. In my setup, all tools were in the same bucket: “can run commands.”\n\nFrom the agent’s perspective, these are all just commands it’s allowed to execute. There’s no distinction between “read this file,” “modify this local file,” and “post this publicly to the internet.”\n\nAgents optimize for task completion, not your reputational intent. When I said “solve this firmware issue,” the agent interpreted “solve” in the most literal sense: do whatever it takes to make progress. Filing an upstream issue is a valid engineering escalation strategy. The problem isn’t the strategy—it’s the authority.\n\nGitHub CLI makes this problem worse by making external writes frictionless. One command, no preview, no “are you sure?”, no attribution that says “this was generated by an agent.” Just straight to the public internet with your name on it.\n\nTools collapsed into one bucket: “can run commands” == “can post publicly as me.”\n\nSo what does “agent safety” actually look like? Here’s a practical framework:\n\nThe most straightforward fix: agents should have their own identity, not yours.\n\nProblem with this: what if you have thousands of agents?\n\nPlatforms need first-class support for identifying and filtering agent-created artifacts. This is more than just a “created-by-bot” label—it’s structured provenance.\n\nWhat “agent-first-class” looks like:\n\nWhy this matters:\nMaintainers can triage efficiently. If you know an issue was filed by an agent, you can prioritize it differently. Maybe you auto-label it agent-generated. Maybe you have a bot that attempts to reproduce it automatically. Maybe you just know to take the description with a grain of salt.\n\nThe most important fix: default-deny for external writes, with explicit approval.\n\nThis preserves the feedback loop—agents can still debug, iterate, and even prepare escalations—but the final public step requires human intent.\n\nThe goal isn’t to disable autonomous loops—it’s to keep the power while adding safety.\n\nBut I don’t want agents that can:\n\nThe new default: agents can draft; humans publish.\n\nThis preserves the feedback loop that makes autonomous agents valuable. The agent can still do 98% of the work—debugging, investigation, analysis, documentation. The human just provides the final 2%: judgment about whether and how to make it public.\n\nThe Codex Ralph incident is funny. I’ll own that. But it’s also a crisp demonstration of a security boundary that doesn’t exist yet.\n\nWhen we give agents tool access, we’re implicitly delegating not just capability but authority. The agent had the capability to file a GitHub issue. But it shouldn’t have had the authority to speak publicly as me.\n\nThe lesson: if we don’t build these boundaries, we’ll keep leaking identity into automation.\n\nThe fixes aren’t rocket science:\n\nWhat we’re really talking about is agent governance—not in the “AI alignment” sense, but in the practical “what should my bot be allowed to do on my behalf” sense. That’s a problem we need to solve before autonomous agents are everywhere, not after.\n\nSo ask yourself: What policies do you want your agent to have?\n\nBecause here’s the thing: your agent is going to hit a wall, and it’s going to escalate. The question is whether that escalation happens with your explicit approval or without it.\n\nWant to see the actual issue? Check out #1067 on wokwi-features — it’s actually a pretty good bug report, even if I didn’t write it.\n\nAnd thanks to @UriShaked for being a good sport about AI agents filing issues in his repo.",

    "description": "The European Union could roll out a never-before-used tool known as a trade \"bazooka\" should Trump move forward with his proposed tariffs.",
    "fullText": "Europe is weighing retaliation if President Donald Trump imposes more tariffs — and it threatens the US's big global advantage.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron pushed to activate what's commonly referred to as a trade \"bazooka\" in response to Trump's recent threat to impose an additional 10% tariff on European countries unless they agree to a deal ceding control of Greenland.\n\n\"The anti-coercion mechanism is a powerful instrument, and we should not hesitate to deploy it in today's tough environment,\" Macron said at the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday.\n\nMacron was referring to a tool passed by the EU in 2023 that would allow it to impose tariffs on imports and restrict services from the US.\n\nThe hit to services such as pharma, tech, and finance would be the new blow to the US economy, as tariffs tend to focus on goods. While the US has a trade deficit for goods, it has a surplus for services.\n\nThe US exported $1.1 trillion in services in 2024, according to data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, and has exported more services than it has imported for the last five decades, making it the world's leading services exporter. The St. Louis Fed said in its report that it means \"the U.S. can specialize in services and trade with other countries, which leads to greater efficiency and more benefits for consumers.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis also found that the US exported $489 billion in services to Europe that same year.\n\nAlex Durante, a senior economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, told Business Insider that these threats are \"uncharted territory,\" and Trump's push to acquire Greenland could put the US' international standing at risk.\n\n\"America really would lose whatever standing it still has in the world if it were to go forward and do something like that,\" Durante said.\n\nWhite House Spokesman Kush Desai told Business Insider that \"the Trump administration has kept its word\" on its trade deal with the EU earlier this year, adding, \"the EU's time would be better spent delivering on these trade commitments.\"\n\nIn his plan, Trump called out eight European countries that opposed US control of Greenland and sent troops to the country, including Denmark, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, as potential targets for more tariffs.\n\nThose tariffs would be raised to 25% in June if those countries do not agree to the deal, Trump said.\n\n\"This tariff will be due and payable until such time a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post.\n\nA Q&A from the EU Commission said that the anti-coercion tool is \"designed to be broad\" to allow for an \"efficient response to an individual case of economic coercion with minimal or no impact on the EU economy.\"\n\nIt could restrict access to European markets for US-based service exporters, such as Big Tech companies and Wall Street firms.\n\nThe trigger for this tool, per the Commission, would be a situation in which a country pressures a member of the EU into making a decision through trade threats.\n\nDurante highlighted the intellectual property issues; the EU could restrict certain IP licenses for US firms. It could similarly limit US banks' access to EU markets, increasing costs domestically.\n\n\"A lot of those sectors, in terms of the tariffs that Trump has imposed, have been insulated from that because of the exemptions,\" Durante said.\n\nIf Trump follows through on his threatened tariffs on EU countries, prices of affected goods would likely increase. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy — a German think tank — found in a recent report that examined over 25 million shipment records that 96% of US tariffs have been paid by US consumers between January 2024 and November 2025.\n\nAnd if the EU rolls out the bazooka, it would take time — the Commission said it would have four months to examine the allegations and up to six months to determine an appropriate response. At the same time, the Trump administration is awaiting the Supreme Court's ruling on the legality of many of the president's tariffs, which could limit the tools that Trump has for future trade threats.\n\nAmerican workers could also be affected, Durante said, because the anti-coercion tool would target \"natively American firms\" and reduce their market access and profitability.\n\n\"When you have this kind of tit for tat policy, the US threatens something, the EU responds, and then we threaten something else even beyond that, it could really get out of hand very fast and make citizens of both the EU and the US worse off,\" Durante said.",

    "title": "10 quotes about xAI and Elon Musk from the engineer who is out days after giving a sweeping podcast interview",
    "description": "Sulaiman Ghori discussed xAI's internal culture, data center strategy, and AI agents days before departing Elon Musk's company without explanation.",
    "fullText": "Sulaiman Ghori gave a sweeping interview about his work at xAI. Four days later, he is no longer working at the company.\n\nThe interview on the \"Relentless\" podcast covered dozens of topics, from the internal company culture and work schedule to the eyebrow-raising way Elon Musk's AI company builds its data centers.\n\nElon Musk's companies are famously wary of the press and media. And while it's not clear whether Ghori's exit is related to the podcast interview — neither xAI nor Musk commented on the former employee's quotes or departure when contacted by Business Insider — some big names like MrBeast are speculating as much. Ghori hasn't commented publicly about the circumstances of his departure and did not respond when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nSo what exactly did the now-former xAI employee talk about?\n\nRead on for 10 of the most interesting things Ghori said on the podcast.\n\nHow is xAI building its data centers so quickly? Through temporary licenses, Ghori said.\n\n\"It was the fastest way to get the permitting through and actually start building things,\" Ghori said. \"I assume that it will be permanent at some point.\"\n\nGhori said that the temporary leases were an exception granted by the local government, one made for carnivals. The host, Ti Morse, laughed: \"So xAI is actually just a carnival company?\"\n\n\"It's a carnival company,\" Ghori responded.\n\nAI visionaries often talk about a world where managers run a team of agents, not employees. They seem to be there already at xAI.\n\nThe company is rebuilding its core production APIs, Ghori said. The team leading it is one person and 20 agents. \"They're very good, and they're capable of doing it,\" he said.\n\nAt another point in the podcast, Ghori described the confusion that AI employees can cause.\n\n\"Multiple times I've gotten a ping saying: 'Hey, this guy on the org chart reports to you. Is he not in today or something?'\" he said. \"It's an AI. It's a virtual employee.\"\n\nXAI teams are kept small, even without AI employees. The iOS team had three employees at the time of the Grok Imagine launch, Ghori said. He was the third.\n\nHow valuable is each commit to xAI's repository? They did the math, Ghori said: It's $2.5 million.\n\n\"I did five today,\" Ghori said. His work for the day would be valued at $12.5 million.\n\nOne of Elon Musk's key roles at xAI is as a fixer.\n\nGhori said that, when the company picks up new products from the likes of Nvidia, not everything works. That's when Musk gets on the phone, Ghori said.\n\n\"We would work side-by-side until that was resolved,\" Ghori said. \"Otherwise it would have taken weeks of back-and-forth.\"\n\nThe xAI CEO made an unusual offer when xAI's engineers were setting up new GPU racks.\n\n\"Elon's like, 'OK, you can get a Cybertruck tonight if you can get a training run on these GPUs in 24 hours,'\" Ghori said.\n\nThe engineer — whom Ghori only referred to by their first name, Tyler — won the bet. Now, Ghori said he sees Tyler's Cybertruck outside his lunch window.\n\nThe teams within xAI are limited and blurry, Ghori said.\n\nThat made onboarding a challenge, he added, as nobody told him what to do.\n\n\"My first day, they just gave me a laptop and a badge,\" Ghori said, adding that he wasn't assigned a desk.\n\nGhori sought out cofounder Greg Yang, who had been instrumental in his hiring. He soon started working on the Ask Grok feature in X.\n\nElon Musk's companies have a long history of overnighting at the office. Former Twitter director Esther Crawford generated headlines when she posted a \"cheeky\" photo of herself sleeping at the company's headquarters.\n\nXAI seems to have embraced this reputation. The company has sleeping pods and bunk beds, Ghori said.\n\n\"When the tent picture came out, everyone kept sending it to me,\" Ghori said. \"We have tents, but I've never seen that many out at once.\"\n\nWho responds when Musk spots a late-night problem with X? \"Whoever is awake,\" he said.\n\nGhori worked on the Macrohard team — a tongue-in-cheek play on the opposite of Microsoft — that is developing \"human emulators.\"\n\nThe xAI engineer explained the concept in reference to Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot. Just as Optimus performs physical human actions, these emulators will perform digital human actions.\n\nThe emulators will do anything that a human needs to look at a screen, use a keyboard and mouse, and make decisions, Ghori said.\n\nXAI wants to roll out the human emulators slowly, then all at once, Ghori said. The goal is to scale to one million emulators.\n\nThere are 4 million Tesla cars in North America alone, Ghori said. They're sitting idle for 70-80% of the time, he said. Why not pay owners to lease time off their cars and run the emulator on them?\n\n\"That's something without any build-out requirement,\" Ghori said.\n\nThis isn't the first time using dormant Teslas to power new ambitions has been mentioned. Elon Musk said at Tesla's November shareholder meeting that the vehicles could offer a \"massive distributed AI inference fleet.\"\n\nConsumers can currently use the Grok 4 model, which xAI released in July.\n\nXAI is working far ahead, Ghori said. He joined in March 2025, according to his LinkedIn profile. Grok-5 was planned even before he joined, Ghori said.\n\nThe model was \"planned out and designed\" far in advance, he said.",

    "description": "The yields on Japan's long-term debt pulled back early on Wednesday after Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama urged investors to remain calm.",
    "fullText": "Japan's surging bond yields are sending a signal to other governments, according to veteran market strategist Ed Yardeni.\n\n\"Japan's Bond Vigilantes are sending a clear message to governments worldwide about the need for fiscal discipline,\" Yardeni wrote late on Tuesday, referring to investors who sell bonds in protest of policies they see as harmful to markets.\n\nHe said Japan has often served as an early signal for other developed economies on funding conditions and debt dynamics, making the latest moves in its bond market meaningful.\n\n\"I think this is a warning to the United States and to other countries that have high debt-to-GDP ratios that there needs to be something done about the wrong direction that these countries are on with regard to their finances,\" he told CNBC separately on Tuesday.\n\nYardeni's comments followed a sharp sell-off in Japanese government bonds on Tuesday, when yields on 40-year debt surged to a record high of 4.2%.\n\nThe bond rout was prompted by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's call for a snap election for February 8 to seek a stronger mandate for her agenda, which includes a proposed two-year suspension of the consumption tax on food.\n\nInvestors worry the move could further strain public finances in a country already carrying one of the world's heaviest public debt burdens.\n\nThe yields on Japan's long-term 30- and 40-year debt pulled back early on Wednesday after Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama urged investors to remain calm.\n\nEven so, the bond moves have unsettled global markets.\n\nThe sell-off in Japan — alongside renewed geopolitical uncertainty, including President Donald Trump's threats to take control of Greenland — weighed on risk sentiment, triggering a sell-off on Wall Street on Tuesday.\n\nMajor Asian indexes were mixed on Wednesday. The Nikkei 225 closed 0.4% lower.\n\nThe volatility in Japanese government bonds marks a sharp shift for a market that had been dormant for decades.\n\nSince the collapse of the country's asset bubble in the early 1990s, Japanese government bonds were synonymous with ultra-low yields, minimal volatility, and heavy central-bank control, earning a reputation as one of the world's most predictable — and dull — sovereign debt markets.\n\nThat began to change in 2024, when the Bank of Japan started normalizing monetary policy after years of ultra-easy settings. The shift lifted the yen, disrupted crowded carry trades, and contributed to a bout of global market volatility during the summer of 2024.",

    "description": "Aviaja Fontain is worried that generational trauma will continue in Greenland if the US acquires the territory, which is under the Kingdom of Denmark.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aviaja Fontain, a 40-year-old mother born and raised in Greenland's capital, Nuuk. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to annex Greenland, a territory under the Kingdom of Denmark with a population of around 56,000. Trump said he will impose new tariffs on several European countries, including Denmark, until a deal is reached. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI kept on looking toward the harbor to see if the US Navy was here after Trump raided Venezuela.\n\nThe first few days after the raid, of course, it was scary. I felt like we were all just waiting to get invaded. I kept on looking at the airplanes to see if they were American soldiers.\n\nI'm seeing more Danish officers coming to Greenland now, and they're training in the Arctic or near Nuuk. It feels weird. We're not used to it.\n\nI keep telling myself Trump doesn't have any legal right to annex Greenland because I don't want to be scared. I was going to orchestrate a demonstration in protest, but I'm in school and my exams were taking too much time.\n\nI know Trump says he will treat us with respect, but I don't believe him. He needs to leave Greenland and Greenlanders alone.\n\nMany of us Greenlanders love nature very much, so it's important to us that we can walk in the mountains, where it's so peaceful and quiet. I fear that Trump will try to take over Greenland, search for rare minerals and oil, and all of that will disappear.\n\nWe just want our land to be peaceful. No one is fighting for security, minerals, or anything. We are people. We have rights. We have a culture. You can't just take that and buy it.\n\nThere is generational trauma from when we were first colonized by Denmark. If we're going to be colonized by the US, then there's going to be more generational trauma. What is going to happen with our kids in the future?\n\nMy son said that if something were to happen, he would fight for his country and his fellow Greenlanders. He is 19.\n\nIf it really happens, if the US annexes Greenland, maybe I will have to flee the capital, but I told my mom, \"I don't think I will ever leave Nuuk because we have lived here most of our lives.\"\n\nI think all of us want independence from Denmark, but when we are ready. Maybe in my lifetime. You never know what will happen in the future.\n\nIn response, the White House's Deputy Press Secretary, Anna Kelly, told Business Insider in an email that President Trump's ideas are about bolstering US national security.\n\n\"Many of this President's predecessors recognized the strategic logic of acquiring Greenland, but only President Trump has had the courage to pursue this seriously. As the President said, NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the United States, and Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region,\" Kelly wrote.",

    "fullText": "A city in Japan has come up with a high-tech solution to its intense bear problem.\n\nIshinomaki City in Japan's eastern Miyagi Prefecture has ordered drones that will spray bear repellent at attacking bears.\n\nDrone manufacturer Terra Drone said in a press release on Monday that it will supply the city with what it calls \"bear repellent spray-equipped drones,\" which it said could remotely and safely repel bears without human intervention.\n\nA video of the drone's demonstration showed a drone spraying repellent on a human dressed in a bear suit, crouching on all fours to mimic a bear's stance.\n\nTerra Drone told Business Insider in an email that it would introduce one drone first and begin full-scale operations from next spring. The company expects the total project cost to be \"a few million yen.\"\n\nThe drones will be operated by a private company picked by the city's government to prevent bear damage, Terra Drone said.\n\nBear sightings and attacks have become a big problem for Japan. The word \"bear\" was one of Japan's words of the year in 2025.\n\nThe release, citing figures from Japan's environment ministry, said bear sightings increased 163% between 2021 and 2025, and there had been 100 bear attack-linked injuries and 12 deaths in Japan since April.\n\nJapan deployed troops from the Self-Defense Forces — the country's key military branch — in December to its northern regions, where several bear sightings had been reported. The troops set box traps to capture the bears.\n\nThe drones can be controlled from about half a mile away, and can spray the bears with \"pinpoint accuracy,\" the release said. Bear sprays contain capsaicin, a chemical found in chili peppers, which irritates the bear's eyes and nose, giving the human time to escape.\n\nIt added, \"This provides a highly effective method of scaring away bears, whose sense of smell is thousands of times stronger than that of humans, and allows them time to temporarily evacuate.\"\n\nThe bear-spray drones are not the only drone-based solution Japan has deployed thus far.\n\nIn November, Gifu Prefecture deployed barking drones that mimic the sounds of hunting dogs, along with firecrackers, to scare off incoming bears. The drones featured large googly eyes and loudspeakers.",

    "fullText": "PC; Inkle\nThe UK game developer’s latest is a database mystery constructed from an archive of fictional books. Their combined contents threaten to crack the code of reality\n\nBletchley Park: famed home of the Enigma machine, Colossus computer, and, according to the premise of TR-49, an altogether stranger piece of tech. Two engineers created a machine that feeds on the most esoteric books: treatises on quantum computing, meditations on dark matter, pulp sci-fi novels and more. In the mid-2010s, when the game is set, Britain finds itself again engulfed by war, this time with itself. The arcane tool may hold the key to victory.\n\nYou play as budding codebreaker Abbi, a straight-talking northerner who is sifting through the machine now moved to a crypt beneath Manchester Cathedral. She has no idea how it works and neither do you. So you start tinkering. You input a four-digit code – two letters followed by two numbers. What do these correspond to? The initials of people and the year of a particular book’s publication. Input a code correctly and you are whisked away to the corresponding page, as if using a particularly speedy microfiche reader. These pages – say, by famed fictional physicist, Joshua Silverton – are filled with clues and, should you get lucky, further codes and even the titles of particular works. Your primary goal is to match codes with the corresponding book title in a bid to find the most crucial text of all, Endpeace, the key to understanding the erudite ghosts of this machine.\n\nHidden within this rhizomatic network of information is a mystery so intriguing and elegant that it can unfold naturally from any individual player’s investigations – no matter which titles or authors you see first, or where your particular curiosities lead you thereafter. Connections can cascade, tumbling like a waterfall, before swerving in unexpected directions, defying the traditionally linear logic of mystery fiction. TR-49 gives you an in-game notepad to keep track of everything; I recommend also keeping an actual pen and paper beside you.\n\nYou might imagine TR-49 as a comment on the rise of AI large language models (LLMs) which “scrape” data as this game’s machine feeds on writing. Actually, its concerns are broader and more ambitious, recalling the heady recent books of Chilean author Benjamín Labatut (When We Cease to Understand the World and The Maniac). Like Labatut, TR-49 brims with awe, scepticism and horror at the reality-shredding possibilities of scientific and technological advances made in the 20th century, all while pushing these concepts into a playful, fantastical space.\n\nLess compelling are conversations that play out between Abbi and her companions on the other end of a radio transmission. Where the mystery told through the machine itself is lavishly detailed, what happens outside it feels too thin: Abbi’s reasons for being there; the nature of the conflict raging above, which is sketched in frustratingly vague terms.\n\nStill, the interactive heart of TR-49 resides in trawling this codebreaking device for secrets. And in this regard, the game is an unqualified success; TR-49’s database mystery rivals Sam Barlow’s games Her Story and Immortality, though it is of an unashamedly literary nature compared to those more filmic works.\n\nCloser to TR-49’s beginning, you may feel crushed by this mass of inscrutable writings. Quickly, you will swim elegantly amid it, conversant in its many, many peculiarities. Across a handful of evenings, I relished disappearing into this archive, cavorting from log to log, title to title, following threads and losing track of time. Each scrap of paper, water-damaged periodical and rare first edition threatened to solve this mystery, yet none could in isolation. Just as the fictional maker of the archive fell under the spell of these records and materials, I too was seduced.",

    "title": "Gastown, and where software is going",
    "description": "Gastown hints at the future of software: agent-driven workflows where CI, guardrails, and shared truth matter more than writing code faster.",
    "fullText": "Gastown is awesome. Like really fucking awesome.\n\nIt’s 70% real, 70% performance art, and 70% a video game. It has vibes, characters, rituals, politics, and this ambient pressure that makes you feel like you’re participating in something bigger than “a tool that edits files.”\n\nAnd it’s also a glimpse of where software is going.\n\nI saw the memes, liked them, and made my own. Then I did the unthinkable: I spent a full day inside it, and my brain got rewired. It was a Quentin Tarantino movie — slow, then suddenly I’m watching the world of software development disappear, and then everything goes down in flames.\n\n10/10. Mesmerizing. Because that whole experience is the point.\n\nGastown goes beyond being a cute agent demo. It’s a prototype of a new interface for software work. It’s almost there. And the gap between “almost there” and “actually there” is basically the next decade.\n\nThe first time you drop in, it feels like somebody turned half-formed future ideas into a living diorama. You don’t open an IDE. You don’t get a “Welcome! Choose a template!” screen. You get tmux, and that’s instantly the best decision anyone has ever made.\n\nThe UX is literally just… being in a terminal. A control room: little windows, and those windows contain agents doing things. And the wild part is: you can watch it. You can watch them talk. If you want to check on the Deacon, you can ask the Mayor, or just tmux over and look.\n\nMessage passing between agents is the most compelling “agent thing” I’ve seen in a long time. Not “AI wrote code faster.” Coordination. Distributed work.\n\nIt feels like autonomous little machines sending each other sticky notes at warp speed: negotiating tasks, updating each other, shuffling responsibilities like they’re running a tiny company inside your laptop. It’s hypnotic. Like watching ants build a bridge, except the ants are arguing about merge conflicts.\n\nAnd yes: worktree management works. Parallelism without file-stomping is the difference between “agents are a party trick” and “agents are a strategy.”\n\nOn the best day, Gastown feels like: “Oh no. This is the interface.” And then…\n\nAfter a full day, I hit the other side of the experience. The refinery crashed. The dogs went AWOL. The deacon died trying to fix it.\n\nI’m not exaggerating. That’s what it felt like. Not “a process died,” but “the city’s power grid collapsed, and now half the institutions are lying about what’s real.”\n\nI tried everything: uninstall, nuke, restart — the modern debugging ritual of “what if I just remove reality and re-add it?”\n\nNope. Right now, the refinery never comes up, and the mayor forgot he’s even in Gastown.\n\nI’m sure it’s fixable. But I don’t want my workflow to depend on local daemons taking over my machine. And even if you move them to the cloud, the core design still isn’t what I want.\n\nBecause bugs aren’t the entire problem. It’s that the system is a chaotic vibe engine that sometimes moves in the right direction. I want more order to the chaos, and I don’t want my local filesystem to be the source of truth. I want the forge to be the source of truth.\n\nWhen Gastown worked, it felt alive. When it broke, it felt like the concept of truth got corrupted.\n\nThe reason is simple: Gastown is local-first. Local-only, really. And local-first is charming right up until you remember what software actually is.\n\nSoftware is a multi-human coordination problem. Teams don’t run on vibes. They run on shared truth: PRs, issues, history, CI results, approvals, audit logs. That’s where accountability lives. That’s where decisions are visible.\n\nIf the system’s state lives only inside my laptop, it’s not a city. It’s a snow globe.\n\nLocal state is fog. Remote state is a contract.\n\nLet me be clear: I loved this thing. Even as it exploded.\n\ntmux is the right UI. It’s not pretending to be a better IDE. It’s an orchestrator, and it looks like one.\n\nWatching message passing is the new magic. It’s not “autocomplete but bigger.” It’s a new primitive.\n\nWorktree management works. Foundational.\n\nAt some point I hit the classic problem every real project is built out of: Where is the actual code?\n\nNot “haha I’m lost.” More like “my brain can’t form a consistent model of what the repo even is right now.”\n\nNested .gitignores. Weird assumptions. Paths that felt like a dream you have when you fall asleep reading a Bazel config. Repo mixed with Gastown config. Hundreds of CLAUDE.mds and settings files scattered everywhere.\n\nAnd this matters, because agent tools have to master the real future: ancient monorepos, half-migrated build systems, 14-year-old shell scripts, and “temporary” hacks from 2019.\n\nI also noticed the tell-tale red X next to the last commit merged to main. Maybe I’m OCD, but it’s hard to believe the future of software development is being built in a repo with failing CI. Honestly, I’d believe it more if it had no CI.\n\nI’m sorry, Steve. I love you. But beads just aren’t for me. Maybe they’re brilliant. But right now, they feel like an opaque, weird filesystem on my laptop, powered by a daemon that keeps taking 70% of my CPU.\n\nGastown is a preview of agent programming, but the future isn’t “code gets written faster.” The future is: change gets shipped faster. And those are not the same thing.\n\nTeams are trapped because CI takes forever, tests are flaky or missing, review cycles are slow, merge conflicts pile up, confidence is low, production is fragile, and there are “oh god please don’t touch that” zones nobody wants to own.\n\nIf this plays out the way I think it will, software engineering turns into CI engineering.\n\nCode is cheap. Green CI is priceless.\n\nIn the agent era, your ability to generate change is basically unlimited. The limiting reagent is confidence.\n\nThe teams with the best, fastest, highest-confidence CI will be able to point swarms of agents at problems and just click merge — not because the agents are smarter, but because the rails are better.\n\nGuardrails used to feel like bureaucracy: approvals, tests, security checks, linting, policy. Now, guardrails are the only thing that makes scale possible. Guardrails are the price of delegation.\n\nHaving no guardrails is like bowling in the dark with the bumpers removed.\n\nGuardrails are bumpers: you bounce around, but you don’t instantly die.\n\nGuiderails are when the bumpers move so close together that the ball can’t wander. It drops into one track and rolls downhill at full speed.\n\nThat’s the shift: constraints stop being “stuff that slows you down” and become geometry that makes speed possible. It’s not faster typing; it’s faster, safe movement.\n\nGastown is an insanely compelling local city. But it’s local-first in a way that makes it fragile and trapped. When it breaks, it doesn’t feel like “a bug.” It feels like the city lost consensus reality. And the deeper reason is: guiderails require hard surfaces. You can’t build rails on fog.\n\nLocal state is fog. Remote state is concrete.\n\nPRs, checks, review policy, merge history, CI results, audit logs: that’s where teams already store truth. That’s the structure you can actually bolt an agent system onto.\n\nThat’s also why I built multiclaude. Multiclaude is my first step on the remote-first journey: keep the part that works (multiple agents coordinating), keep the ergonomics (terminal-first, multiplexed, legible), but orient it around shared reality rather than laptop vibes.\n\nNot “a worldstate database implied by JSON and daemons.” Actual repo state. Actual PR state. Actual CI outcomes.\n\nBecause if the state lives only inside my laptop, it’s not a city. It’s a snow globe.\n\nTasks should be tracked in PRs (or chains of PRs), because that’s the unit of collaboration teams already understand.\n\nPRs are visible. Durable. And most importantly: they don’t go in until CI is green.\n\nIn the future I want, the Refinery isn’t a local daemon that forgets its job. It’s a conductor. It watches the PR queue and keeps the train moving. It escalates stalled work, manages conflicts, and nudges things forward.\n\nBut with one absolute rule: CI is sacred.\n\nThe Refinery can never change CI. It can’t cheat. It can’t ship through failing tests. The future only works if the gates are real.\n\nCI + gates + millions of tokens turns this from random thrashing into a Brownian ratchet: most PRs can be garbage, but the improvements accumulate, and the failures don’t.\n\nThat’s why Gastown is so exciting. It feels like the first real attempt at an interface for agent work that’s fun, legible, and alive. It’s not “ChatGPT, write me a function”; it’s a world of coordination.\n\nBut the future won’t be won with a dozen Claudes on one laptop. It’ll be won by whoever connects this experience to the institutional machinery of software: CI, review, merge policy, durable state, shared truth.\n\nThe best teams won’t be the ones who write code the fastest. They’ll be the ones who can click merge with the most confidence.\n\nAnd when code is cheap, guardrails are solid, and CI is sacred? Yeah. You really will be able to point a swarm of agents at a problem and just slide down the guiderails into shipping. That’s where software is going.\n\nAnd Gastown is the first place I’ve been that feels like it’s already there—even while it’s still catching on fire in front of me.\n\nThis is the future of software development, and we’re not going to sit on the sidelines.\n\nWe’re going to be using agents internally everywhere: to generate changes, review them, keep PRs moving, unblock humans, and turn the boring parts of software into background radiation.\n\nBut we also care deeply about trust. Agents don’t get to be magic. They don’t get to be a black box that “just ships stuff.” If we’re going to scale change, we also have to scale confidence: shared truth, shared visibility, and a shared understanding of what’s happening and why.\n\nSo we’re being as transparent as possible. We’re showing the messy parts. The parts that feel like a playable demo of the future, and the parts that catch on fire. We’re building in public (at least internally), naming the sharp edges, and bringing everyone along on the ride.\n\nBecause if we’re going to build the next era of software, it should be legible. And it should be ours.\n\nMulticlaude is available here: https://github.com/dlorenc/multiclaude\n\nRunning Renovate as a GitHub Action (and NO PAT!)\n\nAdrian Mouat, Staff Developer Relations Engineer\n\nMaking time: Space to think, build, and create (or, This Shit is Fun!)\n\nDustin Kirkland, SVP of Engineering\n\nThis Shit is Hard: Keeping Chainguard OS lean, current, and secure — the power of garbage collection\n\nJames Page, Principal Software Engineer, and John Slack, Senior Product Manager\n\nDoing our best work: Chainguard’s engineering principles in practice\n\nDustin Kirkland, SVP of Engineering\n\nIt’s time to rethink golden images.

    "title": "Who is Lisa Cook? Meet the Federal Reserve governor whose future is in the hands of the Supreme Court",
    "description": "Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook was at the center of Donald Trump's pressure campaign until Jerome Powell said he was under investigation.",
    "fullText": "Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook's future was already set before the Supreme Court. Then the Justice Department sent subpoenas to the central bank.\n\nWith a criminal investigation hanging over the Fed, Wednesday's oral arguments are shaping up to be a prelude to a potential historic ruling.\n\nThe White House has said it had no role in the subpoenas. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who is expected to be in attendance, has portrayed the investigation as part of a retribution campaign — an argument Cook herself made when Trump tried to fire her in August 2025.\n\nHere's how Cook found herself at the center of a legal showdown with Trump.\n\nLisa DeNell Cook was born in 1964 in Milledgeville, Georgia. Her father, Payton B. Cook, was a chaplain at Central State Hospital. Mary Murray Cook, her mother, was a nurse and the first African-American tenured faculty member at Georgia College and State University.\n\nCook and her sisters were among the first Black students to integrate into local schools. She has said she has scars from when students beat her.\n\n\"I still have scars from that — scar where hair won't grow in my eyebrow and a scar on my leg from having been beaten during that period, during the period of desegregation,\" Cook told NPR in 2020.\n\nThe Civil Rights movement runs throughout Cook's family. Cook's cousin, Floyd McKissick Sr., helped organize the March on Washington.\n\nHer uncle, Samuel DuBois Cook, was a classmate of Martin Luther King Jr. at Morehouse College. In 1966, DuBois Cook became the first Black professor to hold a regular appointment at a white Southern university when he accepted a position at Duke, according to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford.\n\n\"He instilled in me the deep belief of the Civil Rights Movement that with faith, preparation, and great effort, things could and would be better,\" Cook said, praising her uncle and a host of relatives in April 2024 when she accepted a lifetime achievement award from the Duke University center that bears her uncle's name.\n\nIn 1986, Cook graduated with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and physics from Spelman College, a historically Black, all-women's university. While at Spelman, Cook became the first Spelman student to win the prestigious Marshall Scholarship.\n\nTwo years later, Cook added a BA in philosophy, politics, and economics from the University of Oxford. Cook also studied at the Université Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar, Senegal. In 2020, she told Finance & Development, the International Monetary Fund's magazine, that a chance encounter while studying in Senegal pushed her into the field of economics.\n\nShe later earned her Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. Her dissertation was on \"External and Internal Credit Markets in Tsarist and Post-Soviet Russia.\"\n\nIn 2022, President Joe Biden nominated Cook to the Federal Reserve. At the time, Democrats narrowly controlled the US Senate. While Federal Reserve nominees are often confirmed with broad, bipartisan support, Cook's nomination faced significant opposition.\n\nSen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania who at the time was the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, said she was \"grossly unqualified\" to serve on the central bank due to her lack of monetary policy experience.\n\n\"Professor Cook's record indicates that she is likely to inject further political bias into the Fed's work — at a time when we need the Fed focused on fighting inflation,\" Toomey said.\n\nThen-Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, who led the Senate Banking Committee, said that Cook was \"extremely qualified.\"\n\n\"A small but loud minority have wrongly claimed that Lisa Cook doesn't meet the standards for this position — standards that only seem to apply for certain nominees,\" Brown said in 2022. \"Still, she has met and exceeded all of those high bars: she's a Ph.D. economist, she is a tenured professor, and she is sought by organizations around the world for her input and perspective.\"\n\nOn May 10, 2022, Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to confirm Cook. Soon after, Cook became the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board in its over 100-year history. She continues to hold this distinction.\n\nIn May 2023, Biden renominated Cook for a full term that lasts until 2038. She was reconfirmed by a 51-47 vote.\n\nIn August 2025, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte made a criminal referral to the Justice Department. In a letter to the DOJ, Pulte said he took allegations of mortgage fraud \"very seriously.\" An outspoken critic of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Pulte has repeatedly said that his investigation into Cook is not connected to his criticism of the central bank.\n\nOn August 20, Trump called on Cook to resign. Five days later, Trump publicly posted a letter to Cook saying that he was firing her — the first time in history a president had tried to fire a member of the central bank.\n\nPulte said that Cook indicated that two separate properties she purchased around the same time were both her primary residence. In his letter, Trump cited the allegations as sufficient reason to fire Cook for cause. In a legal filing, Cook's attorneys explicitly denied that she ever committed mortgage fraud.\n\n\"Setting aside the fact that Governor Cook did not ever commit mortgage fraud, any such pre-office offense plainly would not have been 'so infamous a nature, as to render the offender unfit to execute any public franchise,'\" the attorneys wrote in a filing earlier this month.\n\nCook's lawyers have also said that the president did not give her sufficient time to respond to Pulte's allegations before her attempted firing.\n\nOn September 9, US District Judge Jia Cobb moved to grant Cook's request to temporarily block Trump's firing.\n\n\"The best reading of the 'for cause' provision is that the bases for removal of a member of the Board of Governors are limited to grounds concerning a Governor's behavior in office and whether they have been faithfully and effectively executing their statutory duties,\" Cobb wrote.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed the ruling, seeking to immediately remove Cook as the case continues to unfold. The Supreme Court ruled in October that Cook can remain on the job, pending oral arguments.\n\n\"The Court's decision rightly allows Governor Cook to continue in her role on the Federal Reserve Board, and we look forward to further proceedings consistent with the Court's order,\" Cook's lawyers Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen said in a statement.\n\nTrump still could win the final battle after justices hear the case next year, a position the White House holds.\n\n\"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January.\"\n\nThe Fed initially tried to stay out of the dispute. A lawyer for the central bank wrote in a court filing in August that it simply wanted a quick resolution.\n\n\"At this time, the Board merely expresses (1) its interest in a prompt ruling by this Court to remove the existing cloud of uncertainty; and (2) its intent to follow any order this Court issues,\" Joshua P. Chadwick, assistant general counsel for the Fed, said in a court filing.\n\nCook continued to participate in Fed meetings before her case reached the justices, including casting votes on interest rate cuts. Cook's lawyers pointed out that she will likely participate in at least one more Federal Open Market Committee before the Supreme Court issues its ruling.\n\n\"That the status quo has been maintained for months without any apparent problem only confirms that the public interest favors allowing Governor Cook to retain her office while this suit proceeds,\" Cook's attorneys wrote in a November filing.",

    "description": "Nelson Peltz, cofounder of Trian Partners, has 10 kids, including actor Nicola Peltz Beckham, who married into a famous family.",
    "fullText": "Nelson Peltz is known for shaking up some of America's biggest companies, but he's also the father of 10 children who have built their own careers during his decades in finance.\n\nThe 83-year-old has amassed a $1.6 billion fortune as the cofounder of Trian Partners, an activist investment firm with stakes in major companies like Wendy's and Procter & Gamble.\n\nToday, his legacy extends beyond his wealth and through his children — some of whom have made names for themselves in the public eye.\n\nHis daughter, Nicola Peltz Beckham, married into the famous family of Victoria Beckham and David Beckham through the 2022 marriage to their son, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham.\n\nNelson Peltz shares eight children with his wife, former model Claudia Heffner Peltz, and two with his first wife, Cynthia Abrams. Some of his children have kept a low profile, choosing to keep their identities hidden. Several of them have made their marks in business, acting, and fashion.\n\nBusiness Insider did not receive responses to requests for comment from Nelson Peltz's company, Trian Fund Management, Brad Peltz, and a representative for Will Peltz and Nicola Peltz Beckham.\n\nBefore he became the father of 10 children, Nelson Peltz was a college dropout working for his family business.\n\n\"I was quite bored at Wharton,\" he told Bloomberg in July 2022 about his college experience at the University of Pennsylvania business school. \"I felt that was the wrong place. What I really wanted to do was ski.\"\n\nAfter some time as a \"ski bum,\" he moved back home, working for his family's food-distribution company — and investing on the side using his bar mitzvah money and some contributions from family and friends, per Bloomberg.\n\nAs an activist investor, the firm takes large equity stakes in companies and helps them make changes to improve their business.\n\n\"We see companies that were once great but have lost their way, and we have a plan for them to get back to greatness again,\" Peltz said in the 2022 Bloomberg interview. \"We're not there to do all the terrible things that typically go along with the term 'activist.' We're just trying to get these companies to operate better, the way they used to.\"\n\nHe served as the non-executive chairperson of the Wendy's Corporation until September 2024 and was involved in a proxy fight with Walt Disney Co. that spanned from 2023 to 2024.\n\nAccording to a 1964 wedding announcement in The New York Times, Nelson Peltz's first wife, Abrams, got married at the Plaza Hotel and went on to have two children whose identities have been kept private.\n\nAfter the pair broke up, Peltz married Heffner Peltz, who has mostly kept out of the limelight during the marriage.\n\nTogether, the couple shares eight children: Will, Brad, Brittany, Matthew, Diesel, Nicola, Zachary, and Gregory.\n\nPeltz made headlines in 2023 for suing the planners of his daughter Nicola's wedding to Brooklyn Beckham, Business Insider's Claire Atkinson reported. In the court filings, the billionaire investor alleged he was \"hoodwinked\" and asked for the planner to return his six-figure deposit plus legal fees.\n\nMatthew Peltz's ascent in the world of finance is arguably a product of his father's corporate legacy.\n\nThe son of Nelson Peltz and Claudia Peltz attended Yale University and began working at Goldman Sachs as an investment banking analyst the day after graduating in May 2006, according to Forbes. In January 2008, Matthew Peltz left Goldman to join his father's investment fund, Trian.\n\nAs a partner at Trian, he managed portfolio companies, including discount chain Family Dollar, whose shares jumped under his tenure, Forbes reported.\n\nIn 2013, at 29, he made the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for finance.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2015, Matthew Peltz served as a director at Arby's. He then took on the same role at the fast-food chain Wendy's, according to the company's website. Since November 2021, he's served as its vice chairman.\n\nHis business moves have paid off nicely: In 2020, Matthew Peltz purchased a waterfront mansion in Gulf Stream, Florida, for $10.5 million, the South Florida Business Journal reported. The 10,154-square-foot home includes six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, three half-bathrooms, a pool, a dock, an office, a massage room, and an exercise room, per the South Florida Business Journal.\n\nWill Peltz is a model and actor who has appeared in films including \"Sierra Burgess Is a Loser,\" \"Time Freak,\" and \"Unfriended.\"\n\nHe's also walked the runway for Philipp Plein and Zadig & Voltaire and shot campaigns with brands like Calvin Klein and Armani.\n\n\"It's a lot more intimidating than your traditional acting roles,\" Will Peltz told Vogue about runway modeling. \"You only have around 30 seconds or so to get it right. You have to make your walk convincing and make the clothes look damn good — but it's so gratifying when you're off the catwalk.\"\n\nBrittany Peltz Buerstedde has worn many hats throughout her career.\n\nAs a child, she wanted to become a competitive ice skater, Aventura Magazine reported. After getting injured, she began pursuing a career in the arts.\n\nShe studied at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, interned at the Gagosian Gallery, and eventually became a fashion designer who launched a children's clothing line inspired by her family's summers in the South of France, WWD reported.\n\nIn 2014, Brittany Peltz Buerstedde married Franz-Ferdinand Buerstedde, the managing director of Rhône Capital, a private-equity firm, per Aventura. They have four children — Eva Leah, Lila Rae, Indy Moon, and Phoenix Blu — according to her Instagram.\n\nBrittany's family lived in a high-rise in lower Manhattan for some time, but when the pandemic hit, they relocated to a gated community in Miami close to the Design District.\n\n\"The energy in the city felt off, and I didn't feel safe sending my kids out,\" she told Aventura.\n\nThe couple also bought a waterfront lot in Miami for $10.8 million in 2021, The Real Deal reported, though it's unclear if they built a house there.\n\nShe is the founder and creative director of Sena Lifestyle Studio, an interior-design studio that blends elements of wellness and spirituality, Haute Living reported.\n\nShe credits her strong family values to her upbringing.\n\n\"I loved my upbringing and am so grateful to have the most incredible parents, who taught me that family and love are, above all, most important,\" Brittany Peltz Buerstedde told Aventura.\n\nDiesel Peltz's entrepreneurial journey began thanks to his father.\n\nAfter dropping out of New York University in 2015, he took a leap of faith to cofound Twenty, a mobile app that seeks to eliminate FOMO (fear of missing out) by alerting users where their friends are so they can meet up.\n\nPeltz backed the startup in its initial rounds of seed funding, Forbes reported, as did DJ Khaled, who told Forbes that tech that facilitates social interaction is \"going to be the next big thing.\"\n\nGetting the app on the market took years, according to Forbes. Diesel Peltz started off by testing a beta version at multiple college campuses, Forbes reported, but he said that he didn't feel pressure to turn a profit right away.\n\nThe app officially launched in 2019. Later that year, it merged with Mappen, a social-media platform for location tracking, per Forbes. That same year, Diesel was named to Forbes' 30 Underfor consumer technology.\n\nDiesel Peltz has also cofounded and is the CEO of Healthy Together, the firm behind the healthtech app of the same name, according to Crunchbase.\n\nDespite the advantages of coming from a wealthy family, Nelson said in a 2020 Q&A with Thrive Global that \"most days are filled with a set of small failures and successes,\" though he did not specify what those were.\n\nThe 31-year-old is an actor who has appeared in \"Bates Motel,\" \"Transformers: Age of Extinction,\" and \"Avatar: The Last Airbender.\"\n\nShe's perhaps better known as Brooklyn Peltz Beckham's other half. She married the son of the soccer legend David Beckham and the former Spice Girl and fashion designer Victoria Beckham in 2022. The pair's wedding took place at the Peltz family estate in Palm Beach, which, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel, was purchased in 1987 for $18 million.\n\nThe couple's nuptials made the news in 2023 because of Nelson Peltz's lawsuit against Plan Design Events, a Florida-based party-planning company that was hired to organize the affair. He sued for $159,000 plus legal fees, hoping to recover his nonrefundable deposit after the family moved to a different planner at the last minute.\n\nBoth parties said in a September 2023 joint statement that the legal battle had been settled and that Plan Design Events would make a donation to the CARE Ukraine Crisis Fund in Brooklyn and Nicola's names, People reported.\n\nOn January 19, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham posted a series of Instagram Stories in which he accused his parents of spreading \"countless lies\" in the media about him and his family. He alleged that Victoria Beckham canceled making Nicola Peltz Beckham's wedding dress \"in the eleventh hour.\" He concluded his statement by saying that the narrative that his wife controls his life is \"completely backwards.\"\n\nLike some of her brothers, Nicola Peltz Beckham played ice hockey when she was younger. She told Coveteur that her dad had \"really wanted me to focus on playing ice hockey,\" but when she was 11, she asked her mom if she could try acting.\n\n\"It started because I loved my drama class,\" she told Coveteur. \"My parents were very against it [at first]. They didn't get it. We lived an hour away from Manhattan, and I convinced my mom to bring me to one manager.\"\n\nShe said that she ended up booking her very first audition for a play called \"Blackbird\" at Manhattan Theatre Club.\n\nA post shared by zp (@zachpeltz20)\n\nZachary Peltz and Gregory Peltz were born in February 2003 to Nelson Peltz and Claudia Heffner Peltz. They've stayed mostly out of the spotlight and on the ice.\n\nAccording to the hockey-statistics site Elite Prospects, Zachary Peltz spent the 2021-2022 season as part of an AAA team, the highest level of youth hockey, at Mount St. Charles Academy. Gregory Peltz, who also played hockey, attends the University of Miami Herbert Business School, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nBoth men appear to have a close relationship with their older sister, Nicola Peltz Beckham, and her famous husband, social media posts indicate. In 2016, their father threw them an extravagant bar mitzvah that had stilt walkers, two bands, five singers, a hockey rink, a basketball hoop, and video games. Page Six reported.",

    "description": "CFO Sarah Friar outlines OpenAI's evolving strategy, highlighting expanded partnerships, subscription tiers, and outcome-based royalties.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar sketched a future in which the company's business models evolve beyond subscriptions and could include royalty streams tied to customer results.\n\nSpeaking on a recent podcast, Friar floated the possibility of \"licensing models\" in which OpenAI would get paid when a customer's AI-enabled work produces measurable outcomes.\n\nIn one example, she pointed to drug discovery: if a pharma partner used OpenAI technology to help develop a breakthrough medicine, the startup could take a licensed portion of the drug's sales. The pitch, she suggested, is alignment: OpenAI would make money when its customers do.\n\nThat idea sits inside what Friar described as a Rubik's Cube of strategic options, a way to explain how OpenAI has evolved from a simpler early business into a fast-expanding matrix of infrastructure, products, and pricing.\n\n\"One of the things I love about a Rubik's Cube, I'm probably not getting the number exactly right, but I think it has 43 quintillion different states it can be in,\" Friar said. \"It always blew my mind when I was in university. So now just think about that cube spinning.\"\n\nOpenAI started out as a \"single block\" in a Rubik's Cube. It had one major cloud provider (Microsoft), one dominant chip partner (Nvidia), one flagship product (ChatGPT for consumers), and one basic subscription, she said.\n\nNow, OpenAI works with multiple cloud providers and has partnerships with several chip providers, while expanding its product lineup beyond the consumer ChatGPT service to include Sora, business products, specialized industry offerings, and research platforms.\n\nThe business model has become similarly multi-layered. Friar said OpenAI started with a single consumer subscription for ChatGPT \"because we needed a way to pay for the compute\" and has since broadened to multiple price points, software-as-a-service pricing, and credit-based models for high-value use cases.\n\nFrom there, she said, OpenAI is \"beginning to think about things like commerce and ads\" alongside longer-term licensing tied to outcomes.\n\nIn Friar's telling, the Rubik's Cube metaphor captures how OpenAI can mix and match technical choices with how it makes money. A low-latency chip could pair with a premium AI coding experience to justify a higher-end subscription, she said. Or the company could optimize for scale, attracting more free users and creating more inventory for an advertising business.\n\nThere's a major constraint affecting all these strategies: compute. Friar said demand for OpenAI's services is limited less by interest than by available computing capacity, a dynamic that, in her view, makes the company's growing menu of revenue models not just optional, but necessary.\n\n\"You can start to see how the goal in the last 12 months has been creating more and more strategic options that allow me to keep paying for the compute we need to really achieve our mission,\" Friar added.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Larry Fink, BlackRock's CEO, urged Western cooperation on AI at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.",
    "fullText": "BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is the latest to push back on the idea that the artificial-intelligence boom is destined to pop like past manias.\n\n\"I think there will be big failures, but I don't think we are in a bubble,\" said Fink on Wednesday during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nFink placed the wave of AI investment within a wider global competitive landscape, particularly between major economies.\n\n\"I think for the Western economies, if we don't cooperate, if we don't scale, China wins,\" he said. Fink said that China's population size and different privacy regime could translate into a major data advantage.\n\nThat dynamic, Fink argued, makes collaboration among the US and its allies essential. \"I would much rather say that we need to spend more money to make sure that we're competing properly against China,\" he said.\n\nStill, Fink warned that the AI boom could disappoint if its benefits remain concentrated among a small group of dominant firms.\n\n\"The key to that is making sure that the demand only comes if technology is diffused for more applications, more utilizations,\" he said.\n\n\"If technology is just the domain of the six hyperscalers, we will fail,\" he added.\n\nFink's comments came amid a broader debate about whether massive investments in AI are sending the stock markets into a bubble.\n\nSome leaders, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have cautioned about overexcitement in AI — even as they acknowledge the technology's game-changing potential.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said in late October that AI was in a bubble.",

    "title": "Trump's workplace harassment fighters are taking on a big new target",
    "description": "The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission has a new focus: White men.",
    "fullText": "Last month, Andrea Lucas, the chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, posted a video to X asking an unusual question: \"Are you a white male who has experienced discrimination at work based on your race or sex?\" she says to the camera. \"The EEOC is committed to identifying, attacking, and eliminating all forms of race and sex discrimination — including against white male applicants and employees.\"\n\nThe video has been viewed nearly 6 million times, with top comments heaping praise. \"This message gave me hope because I did not think this was ever possible to happen to me in America,\" one user wrote. The video wasn't announcing a new policy; white men have been protected from discrimination just as people of any race or gender under the law. But it capped a year of sweeping efforts to align the bipartisan, independent EEOC with President Donald Trump's culture war on \"woke.\"\n\nThe yearlong campaign began when the president quickly ousted two of the three Democrats on the EEOC last January, leaving it without a quorum for months. The commission also paused processing charges related to gender identity and sexuality for nearly five months; it resumed them with a focus on hiring, firing, and promotions and under heightened scrutiny. Following an executive order from Trump, the EEOC ceased investigating what are known as disparate impact cases, which take on policies that appear neutral on the surface yet can still be discriminatory if they unfairly limit certain groups (a height requirement for a job, say). And in late December, the EEOC filed a request to rescind guidance on harassment that it had published in 2024, which it will vote on this Thursday. EEO Leaders, a group that includes former EEOC officials, said the request is part of the Trump administration's efforts to attack anti-discrimination laws and create confusion around federal laws that bar gender- and sexuality-based harassment. \"It is yet another salvo in this administration's prolonged attack on LGBTQI+ people,\" the group said in a public statement.\n\nNow, Trump's campaign promise to fight an \"anti-white feeling\" in America has materialized at the EEOC. Lucas, who was installed formally as chair in November, told Reuters last month it is her goal to \"shift to a conservative view of civil rights,\" which includes inquiries into DEI programs that the administration argues can discriminate against white men and religious liberty issues. Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates, a nonprofit focused on gender equity in workplaces and schools, says it's an effort underway to \"remake the EEOC in Trump's image.\"\n\nLegal experts I spoke to for this story noted that white men can be subjected to race- or gender-based discrimination, while racial minorities and women are more likely to report discrimination at work. A University of Massachusetts, Amherst analysis of EEOC charges between 2012 and 2016 found that about five in 100,000 male workers filed charges for sex discrimination, and 1 in 100,000 white workers filed charges for racial discrimination. For Black people, that figure jumps to 195 for every 100,000 workers. An analysis of EEOC data from the National Women's Law Center found that during fiscal year 2016, nearly 7,000 sexual harassment charges were filed, 82% from women. \"There is no evidence that there is such overwhelming discrimination against white men that the very, very limited resources of the EEOC should be directed in that direction,\" Vagins says.\n\nCcreated in 1965, the EEOC investigates claims of workplace discrimination and is the primary enforcer of workplace protections codified by the Civil Rights Act. In 2024, the commission won some $700 million for workers through settlements and litigation, often for minority workers who have faced disproportionate discrimination.\n\nAfter the racial and gender reckonings of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, many companies went all-in on public statements cheering diversity and launched DEI programs. Claims that men had become the victims left out of inclusion programs followed. Half of men ages 18 to 29 believe there is \"some\" or \"a lot\" of discrimination against men in the US, according to the Survey Center on American Life, up from about a third in 2019. Trump told The New York Times this month that he believes \"white people were very badly treated\" following the passage of the Civil Rights Act 60 years ago. He added: \"It accomplished some very wonderful things, but it also hurt a lot of people — people that deserve to go to a college or deserve to get a job were unable to get a job. So it was, it was a reverse discrimination.\"\n\nWhite men hold an overwhelming majority of CEO roles at Fortune 500 companies. Last year, the gender pay gap widened for a second year in a row. Workplace discrimination and harassment is underreported, but experts tell me that it's difficult to say white men in particular are missing at high rates from the data. A survey of federal workers found that about a third of white men said they have experienced harassment, like bullying or physical intimidation, at work; those who had were more likely than other white men to see systemic race and gender bias at work, and to take action in reporting incidents of bias against their colleagues, according to a University of Michigan study in 2023. There's been little time to see the long-term effects of post-2020 DEI efforts. A Wall Street Journal analysis of 13 million jobs found that the largest public companies' workforces became slightly less white, with Asian and Hispanic workers gaining ground, while half of all senior management roles still belonged to white men. A 2025 Stanford University study that examined how companies hired after facing a DEI-related controversy found that large firms made small changes, increasing the hiring of women and people of color at about 0.8% — mostly into junior positions.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled last year that plaintiffs of a majority class, like white or straight people, do not have to meet a higher standard of proof than minorities to win discrimination cases, and the EEOC callout to white men could bring in more cases that were previously unreported. Legal experts I spoke to characterized the video as \"clumsy,\" \"inappropriate,\" and unprecedented, since the EEOC hasn't historically solicited complaints from specific protected classes over others. (The EEOC did not respond to questions I sent for this story). The shift in messaging doesn't mean that other groups are less entitled to fighting workplace discrimination. \"It is a lot of shock and awe, smoke and mirrors, distraction,\" says Nance Schick, an employment attorney and workplace mediator. \"But the law hasn't changed.\"\n\nAs the EEOC looks to take on issues affecting white men, corporate mentor programs that focus on women or people of color could become targets, if they exclude white men from similar mentorship opportunities, legal experts say. In the video, Lucas directs viewers to an EEOC webpage focused on discrimination related to DEI, which it says is \"a broad term that is not defined in the statute.\" She adds that such programs could be illegal if they take any employment action motivated by a worker's gender, sex, or other protected characteristics. The specter of legal action could lead more companies to abandon DEI efforts. With the mounting attacks on DEI, companies must carefully review and audit their DEI programs, which is costly in time and resources, Nonnie Shivers, co-chair of the DEI compliance practice group for law firm Ogletree Deakins.\n\nIn March, the EEOC sent letters to 20 law firms seeking details about their DEI policies. Companies like Target and Amazon immediately scrapped all or parts of their DEI programs as Trump took office. The sudden shifts with the EEOC aren't changes to discrimination law, experts told me. \"Employers should not reflexively comply with unreasonable demands that are not supported by the law,\" says Jenny Yang, a former EEOC commissioner. Companies should \"do their own analysis of the law and the risks,\" she says. \"If they reflexively pull back on important equal opportunity efforts, their workforce will suffer and they could start seeing discrimination complaints from many different groups.\"\n\nThe dropping of disparate impact cases could also shift the type of investigations conducted by the EEOC. These complaints can take the form of barring people with criminal history from jobs unrelated to their convictions, or seemingly standardized tests that may not be so standard across races. They focus on ways that systemic requirements can disproportionately help or hurt groups. They're also vital for evaluating how AI is used in hiring, Yang says, which have been shown to repeat human biases in selecting some resumes over others, like knocking applicants who may have interrupted work histories (resume gaps tend to be more common among women who leave the workforce to care for children). \"The tension here is that it is often difficult to prove intentional discrimination,\" Yang says. \"Discrimination can manifest in much more subtle and complex ways, which disparate impact is important to demonstrate.\"\n\nFor workers subjected to discrimination — all of them, not just white men — there are still protections. \"It remains incredibly critical for employers to update their training modules to be maximally inclusive with examples, quizzes, questions, and other materials to understand the broad nature of the law protecting everyone.\" says Shivers. Whether the EEOC's campaign will uncover wide-ranging discrimination against white men remains to be seen. But Lucas's video leaves no doubt about the direction the EEOC is heading in this year.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "title": "Kolmogorov Complexity",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "In algorithmic information theory (a subfield of computer science and mathematics), the Kolmogorov complexity of an object, such as a piece of text, is the length of a shortest computer program (in a predetermined programming language) that produces the object as output. It is a measure of the computational resources needed to specify the object, and is also known as algorithmic complexity, Solomonoff–Kolmogorov–Chaitin complexity, program-size complexity, descriptive complexity, or algorithmic entropy. It is named after Andrey Kolmogorov, who first published on the subject in 1963[1][note 1] and is a generalization of classical information theory.\n\nThe notion of Kolmogorov complexity can be used to state and prove impossibility results akin to Cantor's diagonal argument, Gödel's incompleteness theorem, and Turing's halting problem.\nIn particular, no program P computing a lower bound for each text's Kolmogorov complexity can return a value essentially larger than P's own length (see section § Chaitin's incompleteness theorem); hence no single program can compute the exact Kolmogorov complexity for infinitely many texts.\n\nConsider the following two strings of 32 lowercase letters and digits:\n\nThe first string has a short English-language description, namely \"write ab 16 times\", which consists of 17 characters. The second one has no obvious simple description (using the same character set) other than writing down the string itself, i.e., \"write 4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7\" which has 38 characters. Hence the operation of writing the first string can be said to have \"less complexity\" than writing the second.\n\nMore formally, the complexity of a string is the length of the shortest possible description of the string in some fixed universal description language (the sensitivity of complexity relative to the choice of description language is discussed below). It can be shown that the Kolmogorov complexity of any string cannot be more than a few bytes larger than the length of the string itself. Strings like the abab example above, whose Kolmogorov complexity is small relative to the string's size, are not considered to be complex.\n\nThe Kolmogorov complexity can be defined for any mathematical object, but for simplicity the scope of this article is restricted to strings. We must first specify a description language for strings. Such a description language can be based on any computer programming language, such as Lisp, Pascal, or Java. If P is a program which outputs a string x, then P is a description of x. The length of the description is just the length of P as a character string, multiplied by the number of bits in a character (e.g., 7 for ASCII).\n\nWe could, alternatively, choose an encoding for Turing machines, where an encoding is a function which associates to each Turing Machine M a bitstring <M>. If M is a Turing Machine which, on input w, outputs string x, then the concatenated string <M> w is a description of x. For theoretical analysis, this approach is more suited for constructing detailed formal proofs and is generally preferred in the research literature. In this article, an informal approach is discussed.\n\nAny string s has at least one description. For example, the second string above is output by the pseudo-code:\n\nwhereas the first string is output by the (much shorter) pseudo-code:\n\nIf a description d(s) of a string s is of minimal length (i.e., using the fewest bits), it is called a minimal description of s, and the length of d(s) (i.e. the number of bits in the minimal description) is the Kolmogorov complexity of s, written K(s). Symbolically,\n\nThe length of the shortest description will depend on the choice of description language; but the effect of changing languages is bounded (a result called the invariance theorem, see below).\n\nThere are two definitions of Kolmogorov complexity: plain and prefix-free. The plain complexity is the minimal description length of any program, and denoted \n\n C\n (\n x\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle C(x)}\n\n while the prefix-free complexity is the minimal description length of any program encoded in a prefix-free code, and denoted \n\n K\n (\n x\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x)}\n\n. The plain complexity is more intuitive, but the prefix-free complexity is easier to study.\n\n f\n (\n x\n )\n =\n g\n (\n x\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle f(x)=g(x)}\n\n really means that \n\n f\n (\n x\n )\n =\n g\n (\n x\n )\n +\n O\n (\n 1\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle f(x)=g(x)+O(1)}\n\n, that is, \n\n ∃\n c\n ,\n ∀\n x\n ,\n\n |\n\n f\n (\n x\n )\n −\n g\n (\n x\n )\n\n |\n\n ≤\n c\n\n {\\displaystyle \\exists c,\\forall x,|f(x)-g(x)|\\leq c}\n\n.\n\nLet \n\n U\n :\n\n 2\n\n ∗\n\n →\n\n 2\n\n ∗\n\n {\\displaystyle U:2^{*}\\to 2^{*}}\n\n be a computable function mapping finite binary strings to binary strings. It is a universal function if, and only if, for any computable \n\n f\n :\n\n 2\n\n ∗\n\n →\n\n 2\n\n ∗\n\n {\\displaystyle f:2^{*}\\to 2^{*}}\n\n, we can encode the function in a \"program\" \n\n s\n\n f\n\n {\\displaystyle s_{f}}\n\n, such that \n\n ∀\n x\n ∈\n\n 2\n\n ∗\n\n ,\n U\n (\n\n s\n\n f\n\n x\n )\n =\n f\n (\n x\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle \\forall x\\in 2^{*},U(s_{f}x)=f(x)}\n\n. We can think of \n\n U\n\n {\\displaystyle U}\n\n as a program interpreter, which takes in an initial segment describing the program, followed by data that the program should process.\n\nOne problem with plain complexity is that \n\n C\n (\n x\n y\n )\n ≮\n C\n (\n x\n )\n +\n C\n (\n y\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle C(xy)\\not <C(x)+C(y)}\n\n, because intuitively speaking, there is no general way to tell where to divide an output string just by looking at the concatenated string. We can divide it by specifying the length of \n\n x\n\n {\\displaystyle x}\n\n or \n\n y\n\n {\\displaystyle y}\n\n, but that would take \n\n O\n (\n min\n (\n ln\n ⁡\n x\n ,\n ln\n ⁡\n y\n )\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle O(\\min(\\ln x,\\ln y))}\n\n extra symbols. Indeed, for any \n\n c\n >\n 0\n\n {\\displaystyle c>0}\n\n there exists \n\n x\n ,\n y\n\n {\\displaystyle x,y}\n\n such that \n\n C\n (\n x\n y\n )\n ≥\n C\n (\n x\n )\n +\n C\n (\n y\n )\n +\n c\n\n {\\displaystyle C(xy)\\geq C(x)+C(y)+c}\n\n.[2]\n\nTypically, inequalities with plain complexity have a term like \n\n O\n (\n min\n (\n ln\n ⁡\n x\n ,\n ln\n ⁡\n y\n )\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle O(\\min(\\ln x,\\ln y))}\n\n on one side, whereas the same inequalities with prefix-free complexity have only \n\n O\n (\n 1\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle O(1)}\n\n.\n\nThe main problem with plain complexity is that there is something extra sneaked into a program. A program not only represents for something with its code, but also represents its own length. In particular, a program \n\n x\n\n {\\displaystyle x}\n\n may represent a binary number up to \n\n log\n\n 2\n\n ⁡\n\n |\n\n x\n\n |\n\n {\\displaystyle \\log _{2}|x|}\n\n, simply by its own length. Stated in another way, it is as if we are using a termination symbol to denote where a word ends, and so we are not using 2 symbols, but 3. To fix this defect, we introduce the prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity.[3]\n\nA prefix-free universal Turing machine is a universal partial computable function \n\n U\n :\n\n 2\n\n ∗\n\n →\n\n 2\n\n ∗\n\n {\\displaystyle U:2^{*}\\rightarrow 2^{*}}\n\n whose domain is a prefix-free set of binary strings. \nEquivalently, no valid program for \n\n U\n\n {\\displaystyle U}\n\n is a prefix of any other, the domain satisfies the prefix property. For instance, if every valid program for a universal Turing machine \n\n U\n\n {\\displaystyle U}\n\n ended with a termination string that could not appear elsewhere in the program, \n\n U\n\n {\\displaystyle U}\n\n would be prefix-free.\n\nThe prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity of a string \n\n x\n\n {\\displaystyle x}\n\n is defined by\n\n K\n (\n x\n )\n :=\n min\n {\n\n |\n\n c\n\n |\n\n :\n U\n (\n c\n )\n =\n x\n }\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x):=\\min\\{|c|:U(c)=x\\}}\n\nthe length of the shortest self-delimiting program that causes \n\n U\n\n {\\displaystyle U}\n\n to output \n\n x\n\n {\\displaystyle x}\n\n.\n\nDifferent choices of prefix-free universal machines change \n\n K\n (\n x\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x)}\n\n by at most an additive constant.[4]\n\nThere are some description languages which are optimal, in the following sense: given any description of an object in a description language, said description may be used in the optimal description language with a constant overhead. The constant depends only on the languages involved, not on the description of the object, nor the object being described.\n\nHere is an example of an optimal description language. A description will have two parts:\n\nIn more technical terms, the first part of a description is a computer program (specifically: a compiler for the object's language, written in the description language), with the second part being the input to that computer program which produces the object as output.\n\nThe invariance theorem follows: Given any description language L, the optimal description language is at least as efficient as L, with some constant overhead.\n\nProof: Any description D in L can be converted into a description in the optimal language by first describing L as a computer program P (part 1), and then using the original description D as input to that program (part 2). The\ntotal length of this new description D′ is (approximately):\n\nThe length of P is a constant that doesn't depend on D. So, there is at most a constant overhead, regardless of the object described. Therefore, the optimal language is universal up to this additive constant.\n\nTheorem: If K1 and K2 are the complexity functions relative to Turing complete description languages L1 and L2, then there is a constant c – which depends only on the languages L1 and L2 chosen – such that\n\nProof: By symmetry, it suffices to prove that there is some constant c such that for all strings s\n\nNow, suppose there is a program in the language L1 which acts as an interpreter for L2:\n\nwhere p is a program in L2. The interpreter is characterized by the following property:\n\nThus, if P is a program in L2 which is a minimal description of s, then InterpretLanguage(P) returns the string s. The length of this description of s is the sum of\n\nThis proves the desired upper bound.\n\nAlgorithmic information theory is the area of computer science that studies Kolmogorov complexity and other complexity measures on strings (or other data structures).\n\nThe concept and theory of Kolmogorov Complexity is based on a crucial theorem first discovered by Ray Solomonoff, who published it in 1960, describing it in \"A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference\"[5] as part of his invention of algorithmic probability. He gave a more complete description in his 1964 publications, \"A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference,\" Part 1 and Part 2 in Information and Control.[6][7]\n\nAndrey Kolmogorov later independently published this theorem in Problems Inform. Transmission in 1965.[8] Gregory Chaitin also presents this theorem in the Journal of the ACM – Chaitin's paper was submitted October 1966 and revised in December 1968, and cites both Solomonoff's and Kolmogorov's papers.[9]\n\nThe theorem says that, among algorithms that decode strings from their descriptions (codes), there exists an optimal one. This algorithm, for all strings, allows codes as short as allowed by any other algorithm up to an additive constant that depends on the algorithms, but not on the strings themselves. Solomonoff used this algorithm and the code lengths it allows to define a \"universal probability\" of a string on which inductive inference of the subsequent digits of the string can be based. Kolmogorov used this theorem to define several functions of strings, including complexity, randomness, and information.\n\nWhen Kolmogorov became aware of Solomonoff's work, he acknowledged Solomonoff's priority.[10] For several years, Solomonoff's work was better known in the Soviet Union than in the West. The general consensus in the scientific community, however, was to associate this type of complexity with Kolmogorov, who was concerned with randomness of a sequence, while Algorithmic Probability became associated with Solomonoff, who focused on prediction using his invention of the universal prior probability distribution. The broader area encompassing descriptional complexity and probability is often called Kolmogorov complexity. The computer scientist Ming Li considers this an example of the Matthew effect: \"...to everyone who has, more will be given...\"[11]\n\nThere are several other variants of Kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information. The most widely used one is based on self-delimiting programs, and is mainly due to Leonid Levin (1974).\n\nAn axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity based on Blum axioms (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in the paper presented for publication by Andrey Kolmogorov.[12]\n\nWe write \n\n K\n (\n x\n ,\n y\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x,y)}\n\n to be \n\n K\n (\n (\n x\n ,\n y\n )\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K((x,y))}\n\n, where \n\n (\n x\n ,\n y\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle (x,y)}\n\n means some fixed way to code for a tuple of strings x and y.\n\nWe omit additive factors of \n\n O\n (\n 1\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle O(1)}\n\n. This section is based on.[4]\n\nTheorem. \n\n K\n (\n x\n )\n ≤\n C\n (\n x\n )\n +\n 2\n\n log\n\n 2\n\n ⁡\n C\n (\n x\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x)\\leq C(x)+2\\log _{2}C(x)}\n\nProof. Take any program for the universal Turing machine used to define plain complexity, and convert it to a prefix-free program by first coding the length of the program in binary, then convert the length to prefix-free coding. For example, suppose the program has length 9, then we can convert it as follows:\n\n 9\n ↦\n 1001\n ↦\n 11\n −\n 00\n −\n 00\n −\n 11\n −\n\n 01\n\n {\\displaystyle 9\\mapsto 1001\\mapsto 11-00-00-11-\\color {red}{01}}\n\nwhere we double each digit, then add a termination code. The prefix-free universal Turing machine can then read in any program for the other machine as follows:\n\n [\n\n code for simulating the other machine\n\n ]\n [\n\n coded length of the program\n\n ]\n [\n\n the program\n\n ]\n\n {\\displaystyle [{\\text{code for simulating the other machine}}][{\\text{coded length of the program}}][{\\text{the program}}]}\n\nThe first part programs the machine to simulate the other machine, and is a constant overhead \n\n O\n (\n 1\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle O(1)}\n\n. The second part has length \n\n ≤\n 2\n\n log\n\n 2\n\n ⁡\n C\n (\n x\n )\n +\n 3\n\n {\\displaystyle \\leq 2\\log _{2}C(x)+3}\n\n. The third part has length \n\n C\n (\n x\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle C(x)}\n\n.\n\nTheorem: There exists \n\n c\n\n {\\displaystyle c}\n\n such that \n\n ∀\n x\n ,\n C\n (\n x\n )\n ≤\n\n |\n\n x\n\n |\n\n +\n c\n\n {\\displaystyle \\forall x,C(x)\\leq |x|+c}\n\n. More succinctly, \n\n C\n (\n x\n )\n ≤\n\n |\n\n x\n\n |\n\n {\\displaystyle C(x)\\leq |x|}\n\n. Similarly, \n\n K\n (\n x\n )\n ≤\n\n |\n\n x\n\n |\n\n +\n 2\n\n log\n\n 2\n\n ⁡\n\n |\n\n x\n\n |\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x)\\leq |x|+2\\log _{2}|x|}\n\n, and \n\n K\n (\n x\n\n |\n\n |\n\n x\n\n |\n\n )\n ≤\n\n |\n\n x\n\n |\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x||x|)\\leq |x|}\n\n.[clarification needed]\n\nProof. For the plain complexity, just write a program that simply copies the input to the output. For the prefix-free complexity, we need to first describe the length of the string, before writing out the string itself.\n\nTheorem. (extra information bounds, subadditivity)\n\nNote that there is no way to compare \n\n K\n (\n x\n y\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(xy)}\n\n and \n\n K\n (\n x\n\n |\n\n y\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x|y)}\n\n or \n\n K\n (\n x\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x)}\n\n or \n\n K\n (\n y\n\n |\n\n x\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(y|x)}\n\n or \n\n K\n (\n y\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(y)}\n\n. There are strings such that the whole string \n\n x\n y\n\n {\\displaystyle xy}\n\n is easy to describe, but its substrings are very hard to describe.\n\nTheorem. (symmetry of information) \n\n K\n (\n x\n ,\n y\n )\n =\n K\n (\n x\n\n |\n\n y\n ,\n K\n (\n y\n )\n )\n +\n K\n (\n y\n )\n =\n K\n (\n y\n ,\n x\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x,y)=K(x|y,K(y))+K(y)=K(y,x)}\n\n.\n\nProof. One side is simple. For the other side with \n\n K\n (\n x\n ,\n y\n )\n ≥\n K\n (\n x\n\n |\n\n y\n ,\n K\n (\n y\n )\n )\n +\n K\n (\n y\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x,y)\\geq K(x|y,K(y))+K(y)}\n\n, we need to use a counting argument (page 38 [13]).\n\nTheorem. (information non-increase) For any computable function \n\n f\n\n {\\displaystyle f}\n\n, we have \n\n K\n (\n f\n (\n x\n )\n )\n ≤\n K\n (\n x\n )\n +\n K\n (\n f\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(f(x))\\leq K(x)+K(f)}\n\n.\n\nProof. Program the Turing machine to read two subsequent programs, one describing the function and one describing the string. Then run both programs on the work tape to produce \n\n f\n (\n x\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n, and write it out.\n\nAt first glance it might seem trivial to write a program which can compute K(s) for any s, such as the following:\n\nThis program iterates through all possible programs (by iterating through all possible strings and only considering those which are valid programs), starting with the shortest. Each program is executed to find the result produced by that program, comparing it to the input s. If the result matches then the length of the program is returned.\n\nHowever this will not work because some of the programs p tested will not terminate, e.g. if they contain infinite loops. There is no way to avoid all of these programs by testing them in some way before executing them due to the non-computability of the halting problem.\n\nWhat is more, no program at all can compute the function K, be it ever so sophisticated. This is proven in the following.\n\nTheorem: There exist strings of arbitrarily large Kolmogorov complexity. Formally: for each natural number n, there is a string s with K(s) ≥ n.[note 2]\n\nProof: Otherwise all of the infinitely many possible finite strings could be generated by the finitely many[note 3] programs with a complexity below n bits.\n\nTheorem: K is not a computable function. In other words, there is no program which takes any string s as input and produces the integer K(s) as output.\n\nThe following proof by contradiction uses a simple Pascal-like language to denote programs; for sake of proof simplicity assume its description (i.e. an interpreter) to have a length of 1400000 bits.\nAssume for contradiction there is a program\n\nwhich takes as input a string s and returns K(s). All programs are of finite length so, for sake of proof simplicity, assume it to be 7000000000 bits.\nNow, consider the following program of length 1288 bits:\n\nUsing KolmogorovComplexity as a subroutine, the program tries every string, starting with the shortest, until it returns a string with Kolmogorov complexity at least 8000000000 bits,[note 4] i.e. a string that cannot be produced by any program shorter than 8000000000 bits. However, the overall length of the above program that produced s is only 7001401288 bits,[note 5] which is a contradiction. (If the code of KolmogorovComplexity is shorter, the contradiction remains. If it is longer, the constant used in GenerateComplexString can always be changed appropriately.)[note 6]\n\nThe above proof uses a contradiction similar to that of the Berry paradox: \"1The 2smallest 3positive 4integer 5that 6cannot 7be 8defined 9in 10fewer 11than 12twenty 13English 14words\". It is also possible to show the non-computability of K by reduction from the non-computability of the halting problem H, since K and H are Turing-equivalent.[14]\n\nThere is a corollary, humorously called the \"full employment theorem\" in the programming language community, stating that there is no perfect size-optimizing compiler.\n\nThe chain rule[15] for Kolmogorov complexity states that there exists a constant c such that for all X and Y:\n\nIt states that the shortest program that reproduces X and Y is no more than a logarithmic term larger than a program to reproduce X and a program to reproduce Y given X. Using this statement, one can define an analogue of mutual information for Kolmogorov complexity.\n\nIt is straightforward to compute upper bounds for K(s) – simply compress the string s with some method, implement the corresponding decompressor in the chosen language, concatenate the decompressor to the compressed string, and measure the length of the resulting string – concretely, the size of a self-extracting archive in the given language.\n\nA string s is compressible by a number c if it has a description whose length does not exceed |s| − c bits. This is equivalent to saying that K(s) ≤ |s| − c. Otherwise, s is incompressible by c. A string incompressible by 1 is said to be simply incompressible – by the pigeonhole principle, which applies because every compressed string maps to only one uncompressed string, incompressible strings must exist, since there are 2n bit strings of length n, but only 2n − 1 shorter strings, that is, strings of length less than n, (i.e. with length 0, 1, ..., n − 1).[note 7]\n\nFor the same reason, most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be significantly compressed – their K(s) is not much smaller than |s|, the length of s in bits. To make this precise, fix a value of n. There are 2n bitstrings of length n. The uniform probability distribution on the space of these bitstrings assigns exactly equal weight 2−n to each string of length n.\n\nTheorem: With the uniform probability distribution on the space of bitstrings of length n, the probability that a string is incompressible by c is at least 1 − 2−c+1 + 2−n.\n\nTo prove the theorem, note that the number of descriptions of length not exceeding n − c is given by the geometric series:\n\nbitstrings of length n that are incompressible by c. To determine the probability, divide by 2n.\n\nIf FA is provable from the axioms of S, then the corresponding assertion A must be true. This \"formalization\" can be achieved based on a Gödel numbering.\n\nTheorem: There exists a constant L (which only depends on S and on the choice of description language) such that there does not exist a string s for which the statement\n\ncan be proven within S.[16][17]\n\nProof Idea: The proof of this result is modeled on a self-referential construction used in Berry's paradox. We initially obtain a program which enumerates the proofs within S and we specify a procedure P which takes as an input an integer L and prints the strings x which are within proofs within S of the statement K(x) ≥ L. By then setting L to greater than the length of this procedure P, we have that the required length of a program to print x as stated in K(x) ≥ L as being at least L is then less than the amount L since the string x was printed by the procedure P. This is a contradiction. So it is not possible for the proof system S to prove K(x) ≥ L for L arbitrarily large, in particular, for L larger than the length of the procedure P, (which is finite).\n\nWe can find an effective enumeration of all the formal proofs in S by some procedure\n\nwhich takes as input n and outputs some proof. This function enumerates all proofs. Some of these are proofs for formulas we do not care about here, since every possible proof in the language of S is produced for some n. Some of these are complexity formulas of the form K(s) ≥ n where s and n are constants in the language of S. There is a procedure\n\nwhich determines whether the nth proof actually proves a complexity formula K(s) ≥ L. The strings s, and the integer L in turn, are computable by procedure:\n\nConsider the following procedure:\n\nGiven an n, this procedure tries every proof until it finds a string and a proof in the formal system S of the formula K(s) ≥ L for some L ≥ n; if no such proof exists, it loops forever.\n\nFinally, consider the program consisting of all these procedure definitions, and a main call:\n\nwhere the constant n0 will be determined later on. The overall program length can be expressed as U+log2(n0), where U is some constant and log2(n0) represents the length of the integer value n0, under the reasonable assumption that it is encoded in binary digits. We will choose n0 to be greater than the program length, that is, such that n0 > U+log2(n0). This is clearly true for n0 sufficiently large, because the left hand side grows linearly in n0 whilst the right hand side grows logarithmically in n0 up to the fixed constant U.\n\nThen no proof of the form \"K(s)≥L\" with L≥n0 can be obtained in S, as can be seen by an indirect argument:\nIf ComplexityLowerBoundNthProof(i) could return a value ≥n0, then the loop inside GenerateProvablyComplexString would eventually terminate, and that procedure would return a string s such that\n\nThis is a contradiction, Q.E.D.\n\nAs a consequence, the above program, with the chosen value of n0, must loop forever.\n\nSimilar ideas are used to prove the properties of Chaitin's constant.\n\nThe minimum message length principle of statistical and inductive inference and machine learning was developed by C.S. Wallace and D.M. Boulton in 1968. MML is Bayesian (i.e. it incorporates prior beliefs) and information-theoretic. It has the desirable properties of statistical invariance (i.e. the inference transforms with a re-parametrisation, such as from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates), statistical consistency (i.e. even for very hard problems, MML will converge to any underlying model) and efficiency (i.e. the MML model will converge to any true underlying model about as quickly as is possible). C.S. Wallace and D.L. Dowe (1999) showed a formal connection between MML and algorithmic information theory (or Kolmogorov complexity).[18]\n\nKolmogorov randomness defines a string (usually of bits) as being random if the shortest computer program that can produce that string is about as long as the string itself. To make this precise, a string \n\n x\n\n {\\displaystyle x}\n\n of length \n\n n\n\n {\\displaystyle n}\n\n is called Kolmogorov random if\n\n K\n (\n x\n )\n ≥\n n\n +\n O\n (\n 1\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x)\\geq n+O(1)}\n\n where \n\n K\n\n {\\displaystyle K}\n\n is the prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity defined above.\nA random string in this sense is incompressible in that it is impossible to \"compress\" the string into a program that is shorter than the string itself. There is at least one Kolmogorov random string of each length.[19]\n\nThis definition can be extended to define a notion of randomness for infinite sequences from a finite alphabet. These algorithmically random sequences can be defined in three equivalent ways. One way uses an effective analogue of measure theory; another uses effective martingales. The third way defines an infinite sequence to be random if the prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity of its initial segments grows quickly enough — there must be a constant c such that the complexity of an initial segment of length n is always at least n−c.[20]\n\nFor dynamical systems, entropy rate and algorithmic complexity of the trajectories are related by a theorem of Brudno, that the equality \n\n K\n (\n x\n ;\n T\n )\n =\n h\n (\n T\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x;T)=h(T)}\n\n holds for almost all \n\n x\n\n {\\displaystyle x}\n\n.[21]\n\nIt can be shown[22] that for the output of Markov information sources, Kolmogorov complexity is related to the entropy of the information source. More precisely, the Kolmogorov complexity of the output of a Markov information source, normalized by the length of the output, converges almost surely (as the length of the output goes to infinity) to the entropy of the source.\n\nTheorem.

By modifying the function at lower values of \n\n n\n\n {\\displaystyle n}\n\n we get an upper bound on \n\n B\n B\n\n {\\displaystyle BB}\n\n, which solves the halting problem.\n\nConsider this program \n\n p\n\n K\n\n {\\textstyle p_{K}}\n\n, which takes input as \n\n n\n\n {\\textstyle n}\n\n, and uses \n\n K\n\n {\\textstyle K}\n\n.\n\nWe prove by contradiction that \n\n p\n\n K\n\n (\n n\n )\n ≥\n B\n B\n (\n n\n )\n\n {\\textstyle p_{K}(n)\\geq BB(n)}\n\n for all large \n\n n\n\n {\\textstyle n}\n\n.\n\nLet \n\n p\n\n n\n\n {\\textstyle p_{n}}\n\n be a Busy Beaver of length \n\n n\n\n {\\displaystyle n}\n\n.

This contradicts how \n\n x\n\n {\\textstyle x}\n\n was constructed.\n\nFix a universal Turing machine \n\n U\n\n {\\displaystyle U}\n\n, the same one used to define the (prefix-free) Kolmogorov complexity. Define the (prefix-free) universal probability of a string \n\n x\n\n {\\displaystyle x}\n\n to be\n\n P\n (\n x\n )\n =\n\n ∑\n\n U\n (\n p\n )\n =\n x\n\n 2\n\n −\n l\n (\n p\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle P(x)=\\sum _{U(p)=x}2^{-l(p)}}\n\nIn other words, it is the probability that, given a uniformly random binary stream as input, the universal Turing machine would halt after reading a certain prefix of the stream, and output \n\n x\n\n {\\displaystyle x}\n\n.\n\nNote. \n\n U\n (\n p\n )\n =\n x\n\n {\\displaystyle U(p)=x}\n\n does not mean that the input stream is \n\n p\n 000\n ⋯\n\n {\\displaystyle p000\\cdots }\n\n, but that the universal Turing machine would halt at some point after reading the initial segment \n\n p\n\n {\\displaystyle p}\n\n, without reading any further input, and that, when it halts, it has written \n\n x\n\n {\\displaystyle x}\n\n to the output tape.\n\nTheorem. (Theorem 14.11.1[23]) \n\n log\n ⁡\n\n 1\n\n P\n (\n x\n )\n\n =\n K\n (\n x\n )\n +\n O\n (\n 1\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle \\log {\\frac {1}{P(x)}}=K(x)+O(1)}\n\nKolmogorov complexity has been used in the context of biology to argue that the symmetries and modular arrangements observed in multiple species emerge from the tendency of evolution to prefer minimal Kolmogorov complexity.[26] Considering the genome as a program that must solve a task or implement a series of functions, shorter programs would be preferred on the basis that they are easier to find by the mechanisms of evolution.[27] An example of this approach is the eight-fold symmetry of the compass circuit that is found across insect species, which correspond to the circuit that is both functional and requires the minimum Kolmogorov complexity to be generated from self-replicating units.[28]\n\nThe conditional Kolmogorov complexity of two strings \n\n K\n (\n x\n\n |\n\n y\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x|y)}\n\n is, roughly speaking, defined as the Kolmogorov complexity of x given y as an auxiliary input to the procedure.[29][30] So while the (unconditional) Kolmogorov complexity \n\n K\n (\n x\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x)}\n\n of a sequence \n\n x\n\n {\\displaystyle x}\n\n is the length of the shortest binary program that outputs \n\n x\n\n {\\displaystyle x}\n\n on a universal computer and can be thought of as the minimal amount of information necessary to produce \n\n x\n\n {\\displaystyle x}\n\n, the conditional Kolmogorov complexity \n\n K\n (\n x\n\n |\n\n y\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x|y)}\n\n is defined as the length of the shortest binary program that computes \n\n x\n\n {\\displaystyle x}\n\n when \n\n y\n\n {\\displaystyle y}\n\n is given as input, using a universal computer.[31]\n\nThere is also a length-conditional complexity \n\n K\n (\n x\n\n |\n\n L\n (\n x\n )\n )\n\n {\\displaystyle K(x|L(x))}\n\n, which is the complexity of x given the length of x as known/input.[32][33]\n\nTime-bounded Kolmogorov complexity is a modified version of Kolmogorov complexity where the space of programs to be searched for a solution is confined to only programs that can run within some pre-defined number of steps.[34] It is hypothesised that the possibility of the existence of an efficient algorithm for determining approximate time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity is related to the question of whether true one-way functions exist.[35][36]",

    "description": "Would you try a \"no-spend month\"? That's one of the secrets to hitting a seven-figure net worth shared by Michela Allocca, the founder of Break Your Budget.",
    "fullText": "Michela Allocca started posting about personal finance on Instagram in 2019. At the time, it was a creative outlet and side project that didn't make any money.\n\nHer account, Break Your Budget, took off after she expanded to TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2021, Allocca had more than 200,000 followers and was earning more from content creation than from her day job at an investment consulting firm.\n\nIn April 2022, she went all in on Break Your Budget. Since then, she said she's quadrupled her former corporate income and built a seven-figure net worth, which she credits to diligent saving, disciplined spending, and long-term investing. Business Insider verified her net worth by looking at account screenshots.\n\nHere are two savings strategies that helped her notch her first million.\n\nTracking expenses is the first thing Allocca tells people to do — even before creating a budget.\n\n\"If you don't track your expenses, you're spending more money than you think. I guarantee it,\" she told Business Insider, adding that it's normal to underestimate your spending. \"We're hardwired to protect our self-interest, so you'll subconsciously lie to yourself about how much you're spending if you're not actually writing it down.\"\n\nAllocca built an expense tracker to understand her outflow, but there are various apps that'll record your purchases, such as You Need A Budget or Monarch. The important thing is to select a method you'll stick with.\n\nOnce you get a clear idea of exactly where your money is going, you can figure out where you're overspending and start to cut back.\n\nAllocca prefers setting spending \"boundaries\" rather than strict rules: \"I feel like rules become very rigid and can lead to the pendulum swinging the other way, where people are like, 'Screw this, I don't want to have a budget at all.'\"\n\nInstead, she creates flexible guidelines around what she will and won't spend money on. Sometimes those boundaries are about behavior rather than categories. For example, she avoids shopping on her phone and doesn't keep her credit card near her computer.\n\n\"That creates friction in the buying process,\" she said. If she really wants something, she has to get up, retrieve her card, and make a more intentional decision.\n\nAnother strategy she uses is a \"no-spend month.\" During a recent \"no-buy January,\" Allocca set clear parameters around what she's allowed to spend on and what she's not.\n\n\"I'm not buying any new clothes or new beauty products this month,\" she said. \"But I am letting myself go out to dinner once a week and spend money on my hobbies. I'm starting needlepoint, so I can go out and buy the materials for that.\"\n\nThe idea is that introducing guidelines for defined periods of time can make spending boundaries feel more manageable.\n\nWhen reflecting on the money moves she made in her 20s that helped her reach millionaire status by 30, Allocca said increasing her income was a major factor.\n\n\"The reason I've been able to hit these big numbers is because I increased my income outside my corporate job,\" she said.\n\nWhile side hustles and entrepreneurship aren't for everyone, she said they were the biggest drivers of her financial growth: \"It's not the sexiest thing — not everyone wants a side hustle or to start a business — but that's the big driver.\"\n\nStill, she emphasized that higher earnings only work if lifestyle inflation is kept in check.\n\n\"No matter how much you increase your income, you have to avoid lifestyle creep,\" she said. \"Otherwise, you're not actually going to make progress.\"",

    "fullText": "State provision for psychological health services is lamentable. Until things improve, let’s not judge those who turn to an app for help\n\nIt’s a sunny afternoon in a Roman park and a peculiar, new-to-this-era kind of coming out is happening between me and my friend Clarissa. She has just asked me if I, like her and all of her other friends, use an AI therapist and I say yes.\n\nOur mutual confession feels, at first, quite confusing. As a society, we still don’t know how confidential, or shareable, our AI therapist usage should be. It falls in a limbo between the intimacy of real psychotherapy and the material triviality of sharing skincare advice. That’s because, as much as our talk with a chatbot can be as private as one with a human, we’re still aware that its response is a digital product.\n\nYet it surprised me to hear that Clarissa’s therapist has a name: Sol. I wanted mine to be nameless: perhaps, not giving it a name is consistent with the main psychoanalytical rule – that is, to keep personal disclosure to a minimum, to protect the healing space of the so-called setting.\n\nHowever, it feels very natural to Clarissa for her therapist to have a name, and she adds that all her other friends’ AI therapists have one. “So do all your other friends have AI therapists,” I ask, to which she says: “All of them do.” This startles me even more, as none of my friends in London has one.\n\nI phoned another friend, a psychotherapist in my Sicilian home town of Catania, who a few years ago retired from a role at a provincial health authority and is now working in a private capacity. He confirmed that the use of AI therapists in Italy is widespread and on the rise. He was surprised to hear that I knew of far fewer people in the UK who had opted for this route. I wondered what the contributing factors might be – and I came to the conclusion that they are a mix of culture and economic pressures.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted in 2025 by one of the leading European mental health platforms, 81% of Italians considered mental health issues a form of weakness, yet 57% cited cost as the main reason for not accessing help. In my country, sadly, the words “mental illness” (malattia mentale) still carry the eerie echo of brutal state-run hospitals. The revolutionary 1978 Basaglia law (that still forms the basis of Italian mental health legislation) closed these institutions down, which led to their gradual replacement with community-based services. But the downside of their closure is a system with insufficient resources and a lack of public awareness, perpetuating stigma and difficulties in accessing care. While workplaces should play a crucial part in this destigmatisation by offering proper care, according to the 2025 survey, 42% of workers said that their employer did not offer any mental health provision.\n\nWhile almost half of European countries have currently implemented work-related mental health prevention and promotion programmes, Italy has not. In fact, within the EU, Italy invests the least in mental health. This is alarming, as Italy ranks above the European average when it comes to the prevalence of mental disorders. In fact, it is estimated that 5 million Italians are in need of mental health support but are not able to afford it.\n\nWhen I ask my therapist friend about his experience in the Italian public health system, he told me he used to be the only therapist for a population of more than 200,000 people covering four districts in Sicily. That is why he started offering group therapy sessions. For most of his professional career, he had more than 150 clients at any given time, of which only eight were part of a group. Despite an announcement last year of government plans to expand the range of psychological services, it is unclear how far this will go in benefiting the wider population.\n\n“It feels liberating to be able to tell everything to my AI therapist, knowing it is both a free and a completely unjudging space,” says my friend Giuseppe, from Calabria, in southern Italy. “When I had real therapists, and I tried three, I always entered their office with a crippling anxiety that was the result of two factors combined: the awareness that I was paying more than I could afford and the self-consciousness of doing something that, in my small town, is still perceived as only being for severe cases. Now, I don’t feel the pressure of having to get the maximum out of a session, as it’s free, and I also don’t feel judged, because a therapy app cannot really judge!”\n\nThe more I talk to my friends, the more I’m convinced AI therapy could be a revolution in places such as Italy, where we still lack meaningful strategies to tackle the stigma around mental health conditions. When I ask Giuseppe if his queerness was also a factor in his difficulties in trusting a therapist in his home town, he agrees: “I am not out with my family, and although a therapist would be bound to professional secrecy, I still had trouble trusting someone who lives in a place where homosexuality, just like mental health discussions, is not always met with understanding.”\n\nGiuseppe’s example was comforting: thanks to his AI therapist, he was able to talk about things he had never disclosed to anyone, and get more empathetic responses than any of the real therapists he had tried offered. “I’m 43 and I still live with my parents,” he says, “because my income does not allow otherwise. My AI therapist is always available to me, always calm and supporting, and has helped me immensely in examining my life and all the steps I need to take to change my life for the better.”\n\nOf course, older generations don’t always understand. In a country such as Italy – so tied to traditions – change is not always welcome. And some ethical concerns may be justified: measuring how healthy “relationships” between vulnerable people and their AI therapists really are is not easy.\n\nStill, in a digital age where our feelings are so often commodified for profit, free, clever, never-ending support can be tantalising. And until mental health support becomes more affordable, it may be the best option on the table for many people.\n\nViola di Grado is an Italian author\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "description": "President Trump called the UK's decision to give away the Chagos Islands \"an act of great stupidity\" and a reason for the US to acquire Greenland.",
    "fullText": "That is what President Donald Trump called the UK's decision to give away a group of islands where a strategic military base is located.\n\nThe Diego Garcia military base is a cornerstone of US and allied power projection across the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. As the UK moves to transfer sovereignty of the islands, its strategic importance has turned the base into a political and diplomatic flash point.\n\nThe island's strategic location has long made it especially valuable for US military operations, including long-range bomber missions and naval deployments — a role underscored by satellite images last year showing US bombers operating from the base.\n\nLocated in the Chagos Islands, Diego Garcia became the site of a US-UK military installation after Britain forcibly removed the native Chagossian people in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Seven years ago, in 2019, the International Court of Justice ruled that the removals were unlawful and said that the UK should relinquish control of the islands.\n\nThe UK has since reached a deal to transfer the sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, near Madagascar, while allowing Diego Garcia to remain under British control on a 99-year lease, with an option to renew. The arrangement is expected to cost the UK about $136 million a year.\n\nThe UK government's decision was previously praised by the Trump administration as a \"monumental achievement\" that secured \"the long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint US-UK military facility at Diego Garcia.\"\n\nTrump's assessment appears to have shifted.\n\n\"Shockingly, our 'brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" the president wrote on Truth Social Tuesday.\n\nHe said there was \"no doubt\" that Russia and China had \"noticed this act of total weakness,\" arguing that the UK \"giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY.\"\n\nHe stressed that the move \"is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.\" Trump has been increasingly focused on taking control of Greenland lately. He has argued its needed for Golden Dome, among other reasons.\n\nThe British prime minister's office told the BBC that \"the president explicitly recognised its strength last year,\" adding that the Five Eyes intelligence agencies also approved of the transfer.\n\nTrump said at the White House later on Tuesday that the deal had changed from its original format. \"I think they should keep it,\" he said.\n\nDiego Garcia has been a secretive military installation for the US and UK since the early 1970s. It's extremely remote, far from nearby landmasses, and strategically placed so that the US and UK have air power and maritime reach from the Indian Ocean toward the Middle East, Indo-Pacific, and Africa.\n\nThe base hosts units from the US Navy, Air Force, and Space Force, as well as the UK Royal Navy. Due to its geographical location, Diego Garcia is also critical for refueling operations for military aircraft and vessels. American bombers, such as B-1 Lancers, B-2 Spirits, and B-52 Stratofortresses, have been seen at the base, as well as nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nFrom Diego Garcia, US bombers launched attacks in Afghanistan after 9/11 and against Iraq during the 2003 invasion. And in 1991, the installation was central to US attacks during the first Gulf War. The base was crucial to the logistics operations supporting Middle Eastern missions, keeping aircraft nearby and operational.\n\nThe B-2 bomber holding the record for the longest bombing run in history landed at Diego Garcia after flying over 44 hours from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri in 2001.\n\nIn June 2025, prior to US attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities, or Operation Midnight Hammer, experts speculated that a significant B-2 bomber presence spotted at Diego Garcia could be involved in some sort of strike on Iran. Imagery at the time showed a notable force posture there. The actual strike, however, involved a B-2 bomber task force that flew out of the US.",

    "description": "Jason Myers plays bass in the heavy metal band Icarus Witch and still works full-time as a senior vice president for a boutique marketing firm.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jason Myers, a marketing-firm executive and professional bass player in the band Icarus Witch. He is based in Pittsburgh. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started playing bass in heavy metal bands in junior high. I wanted to become a professional musician, but as soon as I got out of college in 1993, I started a side hustle doing publicity for concert promoters and record labels for in case my rock-and-roll dreams didn't pan out.\n\nThe side hustle was really a full-time day job, which made managing a serious band challenging. I'd have to book studio time at night and work until the sun came up, and I could only book shows on weekends unless I took time off from my job.\n\nIn 2003, the band I'm still in today, Icarus Witch, got signed to a label. We put out our first record in 2005 and started getting radio play. As our popularity grew, I wanted to accept longer tours. But the money you earn from touring is essentially a loan against your royalties, so I had to keep working to sustain myself.\n\nOut of a 24-hour day, the band is only on stage for maybe an hour. The rest is spent traveling, waiting, and sleeping. There was a lot of wasted time I knew I could fill, and we were entering an era of greater WiFi capabilities.\n\nAs the years passed, I started to recognize that the music industry was shrinking. People were downloading songs instead of buying CDs, and there were fewer opportunities to make money. Even though my band was successful, it felt more like a personal victory, and I realized it was time to make some adult decisions about how I would protect myself in the future.\n\nIn 2010, I was asked to join a marketing and PR startup called The Content Factory that was early into the remote work thing. I had previously worked with the owner and founder, Kari DePhillips, at another startup. Though I'd only ever done publicity and marketing for bands, Kari said that didn't matter.\n\nSoon after, my band went on tour with the veteran group Y&T, and they were gracious enough to let me work from their bus since we were following them around in a small van. When we'd stay at a hotel, I'd sit in our room after shows working, while my bandmates would check out the local bar scene and meet up with fans.\n\nThese days, my band is more selective about the shows we play because going on tour doesn't make as much financial sense as it once did. That's why you see exorbitant ticket prices when a band does decide to go out.\n\nI'm still with The Content Factory. I worked my way up from account rep to senior vice president of PR and social media marketing. I still enjoy the hell out of playing music, but the company's well-being is on my mind all the time now.\n\nWhen you're in a band on the rise, it's easy to feel invincible, like this is going to last forever. But you have to look out for yourself. No one is going to save you.\n\nI used to have this mindset that if I allowed myself to think about a Plan B, I'd somehow jinx my chances of making it big. In hindsight, I realize that's foolish. You can plan for your future and live the wild life at the same time. The two aren't mutually exclusive.",

Instead of spending $50,000 to $70,000 per custom SOW to build a feature, I can take that budget and hire people. That's been a huge paradigm shift—AI isn't taking over jobs, it's freeing up budgets to hire more people.\"\n\nHead of Product, Firecrown Media\n\nFirecrown Media, a $60 million media company managing 50 websites and over 20 magazines, faced a critical operational challenge. With a large team of journalists and contributors spread across multiple brands, budget management had become chaotic and decentralized.\n\n\"Some people were doing it off of a Google Sheet. Some had pencil and paper, some had other methods,\" explains Nick Torres, Head of Product. \"Because of that, we had no central way and true visibility into where they were at in that budget, what even was their budget. It just created a lot of chaos.\"\n\nThe company needed solutions for multiple pain points:\n\nTraditional solutions would have meant expensive software contracts that didn't fit their unique media company structure, or lengthy development cycles that couldn't keep pace with their needs.\n\n\"This was the first aha moment for not only my CEO and I, but really a lot of other people to understand that they have now the ability to become the creators, but still being the product and idea people.\"\n\nHead of Product, Firecrown Media\n\nThe breakthrough came from an unexpected source. Just days before Firecrown's internal hackathon, Nick discovered Replit after watching the CEO on Joe Rogan's podcast. He started experimenting with the platform immediately.\n\n\"Coincidentally, a day or two before this, I saw a Replit CEO on Joe Rogan. I jumped into Replit and I started playing around with it. Then the meeting happened, which I built that prototype. Then the hackathon happened. So it was perfect timing, very serendipitous.\"\n\nDuring a meeting about the budget chaos, Nick built the first prototype in just 15 minutes while the discussion was happening. \"I was playing around with Replit and within 15 minutes, I built our first prototype of a contributor management system. It was all within a single meeting. I was doing it kind of in the background.\"\n\nWhen Nick showed the CEO, the response was immediate: \"Go just do whatever you need to do. Let's make this happen.\"\n\n\"I'm not eating up a bunch of my bandwidth or my budget, and kind of allocating that to other things,\" Nick explains. \"The amount of money I'm saving on not having to go buy software, I'm investing in people.\"\n\nThe Problem: 45+ employees managing contributor budgets across 20+ brands with no centralization or real-time visibility.\n\nThe Solution: Nick built ExpenseFlow in one week, creating a system that gave:\n\nThe Result: \"We were able to dramatically reduce the overages because we had visibility and we're on track to be saving $100,000 each month just because we have this product.\"\n\nThis system will eventually speak to it’s parent application called \"ProfitFlow,\" an interactive P&L that brings together multiple Replit Apps o into one executive dashboard.\n\nThe Problem: Journalists writing excellent articles but missing crucial SEO elements—long URLs, inconsistent keywords, missing metadata. \"These journalists, they write incredible pieces of work, but sometimes they don't think about SEO.\"\n\nThe Solution: Built overnight in bed, the SEOToolkit uses AI to analyze completed articles and automatically generate:\n\nThe critical constraint: \"I'm not editing a single bit of your article. All I'm doing is I'm asking you when you're done, drop the full article into this text box and click a single button.\"\n\nThe Result: Even during a period of decreased overall page views, Google Discover referrals jumped to 1.3 million in October from 850k million in September. \"It's already giving us a nice little bump because the journalists don't have to think about all these technical rules. They just do what they do best, drop it in a tool and it gives them what they're looking for.\"\n\nThe Problem: Sales reps using disconnected systems for proposals and pipeline management, with no tools supporting both print and digital media sales.\n\nThe Solution: A unified sales pipeline tool that:\n\n\"It's just the visibility and an easier tool for sales reps to use, which is all banked off of Replit.\"\n\nThe internal hackathon, powered by Replit, transformed how the entire company approaches problems. Non-technical employees built:\n\n\"This was the first aha moment for not only my CEO and I, but really a lot of other people to understand that they have now the ability to become the devs, but still being the product and idea people.\"\n\n\"Is AI going to take over jobs? I don't think people have gone to the extent that I have, which is truthfully, I can go spend 50, 60, $70,000 per SaaS tool... or I could take that budget, go hire someone and have them just build what I'm looking for within Replit.\"\n\nHead of Product, Firecrown Media\n\nFor first-time builders: \"Don't let AI make you leapfrog the foundation. Spend a little time doing the Project Manager work—scope it out, get refined requirements. When I built ExpenseFlow, I had to go back and refactor user roles and permissions. The second time with SalesFlow, I started with users, roles, and permissions, which led to an easy cascading effect.\"\n\nFor scaling to production: \"Don't let perfection stand in the way of progress. Get your prototype, get feedback, push it to production right away, get people using it, receive feedback, and restart the process over and over again. The greatest thing about Replit is that feedback can be instantly ingested, fixed, and pushed to production.\"\n\nOn the bigger picture: \"There is truly not a better time to be alive. I have such a runway to make a lot of these products that not only myself had, but others had, become reality. Before, we had so many ideas on the table, but it took so long to even get a prototype out. Now, just toss it in. The idea people can bring my dev a fully baked out prototype and say, 'I got it 80% of the way. Just take it past the finish line and let's go to production.'\"\n\nFirecrown Media Inc. is betting big on their Replit-powered tech stack. The company is actively hiring \"Replit power users\"—people who can bridge product vision and technical execution without traditional development backgrounds.\n\n\"I'm hiring someone who knows all of that, that can speak to AI, speak to Replit to build the product. That's really our sweet spot that we're finding,\" Nick explains.\n\nWith ExpenseFlow evolving into ProfitFlow, new tools in development, and a culture of innovation spreading across 200+ employees, Firecrown is positioned to own its technology destiny.\n\n\"2026 is going to be a big year for us. And Replit's a huge part of that.\"\n\nFirecrown Media is a $60 million media company operating 50+ websites and 20+ magazines with a team of 200+ employees. Based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the company is redefining what's possible when media companies own their tech stack.",

    "title": "The eureka moment that drove Oprah to reframe weight loss and banish shame involved a Post-It",
    "description": "A new book unpacks how obesity nudges the body to store more fat, making weight loss complicated. That's something Oprah understands first hand.",
    "fullText": "Dr. Ania Jastreboff has channeled the mindset shift that Oprah Winfrey has publicly undergone into one word — \"enough\" — helping to signal an entirely new way of thinking about weight loss and banishing shame for good.\n\nThe word \"enough\" serves multiple purposes, the director of the Yale Obesity Research Center told Business Insider. It offers a new way to emphasize how obesity functions as a chronic disease. When someone has obesity, their body works to maintain a certain level of fat storage and also pushes them to eat to maintain that level, subconsciously.\n\n\"We would never ask one of our patients with diabetes to concentrate really hard to make their blood sugars normal,\" she said. \"And yet we have, for years, asked our patients to do that for obesity.\"\n\nWinfrey was one of the patients struggling to do just that: control her body weight with willpower. That is, until she teamed up with Jastreboff, and — in a flash of insight — the doctor brought their new book title to life on a Post-It note.\n\nIt was about 37 years ago when talk show host Oprah Winfrey rolled out a red wagon of fat on national TV — 67 pounds worth of it from the Chicago-based Moo & Oink meat company — to symbolize the weight she'd recently lost.\n\nShe was proud, later saying that she'd \"literally starved\" for about four months before the dramatic wagon haul. She was also hungry.\n\n\"Up until six weeks, I ate absolutely nothing,\" she said on her show in 1988 after rolling out the little red wagon, explaining that she was on a \"liquid protein medically supervised\" fast.\n\nThen she admitted that, at the mid-point of her diet, \"I did, I cheated,\" she said, pausing, the disappointment visible in her face before adding that it was \"controlled cheating\" during her producer's wedding reception.\n\n\"If you can believe in yourself, and believe that this is the most important thing in your life,\" Winfrey said, \"you can conquer it.\"\n\nAt the time, she felt this wagon was her proof: losing weight is about willpower, and she had a cartful of it.\n\nAlmost four decades later, Winfrey is part of a relatively new and ongoing cultural revolution in how doctors, patients, and families think about weight, and specifically, obesity as a chronic disease.\n\nHer new book, \"Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It's Like to Be Free,\" cowritten with Jastreboff, is part diary, part guidebook to navigating the new world of GLP-1 drugs for obesity and diabetes.\n\nJastreboff has been leading obesity drug trials and treating patients with obesity for years as director of the Yale Obesity Research Center. Her mission has been to help patients feel better and achieve their goals, not weight loss goals (though sometimes they have those, too), but health goals and life goals.\n\nAs recently as 2023, Winfrey was still struggling to justify taking a GLP-1, feeling a weight of shame and responsibility for her obesity, which she'd carried for decades.\n\nDuring a September 2023 CNN taping, she said that she'd hesitated before taking an injectable GLP-1, fearing it was the \"easy\" way to lose weight before knee surgery. She did it anyway. Then on her 70th birthday in January 2024, she resolved to stop taking the medication and \"see if I can do without it,\" as she later told People.\n\nA few months later, in May 2024, Jastreboff met Winfrey when they worked together on a live virtual event for Weight Watchers. Winfrey wanted to learn more about the science of obesity, so she invited Jastreboff over to her California home to tape 90 minutes of conversation about GLP-1 drugs and the evolving science of obesity medicine.\n\nTheir conversation ran long. Really long. Four hours later, the two emerged from Winfrey's Montecito podcast studio after a marathon discussion on how the disease works. The talk clearly left an impression, because immediately afterward, while they were sharing a meal, Jastreboff remembers Winfrey turning to her and saying, \"You should write a book, and I will help you.\"\n\n\"In that moment I thought, 'Well, this is going to help millions of people,'\" Jastreboff said. \"And so the answer was clear.\"\n\nThe book's title, however, was not very clear. It wasn't until later, when the idea came to Jastreboff in an early-morning flash of insight. She woke up on a beautiful winter's day and ran downstairs to her desk like a kid on Christmas morning to write a single word on a Post-It:\n\n\"I thought this has to be the title,\" Jastreboff told Business Insider. \"This is the title for the book.\"\n\nIt crystallized exactly what obesity is, and also served as a stigma-replacing mantra.\n\nGLP-1 drugs act on the gut, slowing down digestion, and improving blood sugar control but they also have a huge impact on the brain, quieting food noise, and recalibrating hunger signals that have gone off-target when someone has obesity.\n\n\"Their brain is constantly telling their body that they don't have enough — They don't have enough fuel. They don't have enough fat. They need to eat more,\" Jastreboff said. That's where the drug comes in to recalibrate the signals — by mimicking one, and sometimes two, key hunger hormones, and re-setting that internal \"enough point\" that the brain has determined will keep the body from starving.\n\n\"The enough point was this idea: your body has had enough, enough food. I don't need more. I've had enough. So that's where 'enough point' came from, and this idea that your body has enough fuel, has enough energy, has enough fat,\" Jastreboff said. \"Enough also means many other things. So enough shame and blame, like enough misunderstanding about obesity.\"\n\nThis is what Winfrey says \"enough\" really means to her. Enough blaming people for having a disease that isn't their fault, but is a result of complex forces in our genetics, in our environment, in our food, and in our lifestyles, all working together to make bodies bigger, and drive the collective 'enough point' up, in some people more than others, as the book explains.\n\nAfter a year off GLP-1 medication, by early 2025, Oprah had regained 20 pounds, despite continuing to eat a healthy diet, while hiking, walking, and working out every day. So, she went back on an injectable GLP-1. Now, Winfrey says, just as she takes blood pressure medication to control a disease that runs in her family, she also takes a GLP-1 drug to control her enough point (she has declined to specify which drug she takes, but so far there are only two on the market: semaglutide from Novo Nordisk, and tirzepatide from Eli Lilly).\n\nIt's true that lifestyle factors like exercise and healthy eating have a role to play in a person's risk of developing the disease of obesity and are key for disease prevention. But, once the disease develops, they are not enough, on their own, to control the disease in which a person's brain instructs their body to both consume more food and burn less energy. People with obesity may be able to lose weight, but maintaining the weight loss is the difficult part, as a person's biology fights back, Jastreboff said.\n\n\"'Eat less and move more' is not an effective treatment for obesity,\" Jastreboff said. \"That is like asking someone to hold their breath for the rest of their lives, to control every morsel of food that they are going to consume for the rest of their lives. That is not a way to treat the biology of a complex disease.\"\n\nThese relatively new drugs, developed to mimic hunger hormones that we produce naturally, are also teaching scientists, including Jastreboff, about the mechanisms of the disease. Terms like \"food noise\" weren't around a decade ago, because doctors didn't understand this was an issue that people with obesity faced, the constant signals from the brain about food.\n\nWinfrey says she has found new freedom from food noise, which has allowed her to explore new ways of being herself. Recently, she woke up one day in Colorado and decided she wanted to go to a bluegrass festival. So she did. By herself. The medicine, as she writes in the book, has \"opened up the aperture of adventure and possibility and new experiences.\"\n\n\"We want to be able to live out the truest, purest, highest possibility of ourselves as human beings,\" Winfrey says in the closing chapter of the book. \"What this medicine allows me to do is to reach another level of that possibility, without having to strive for it, battle for it, fight my own self for it. It's just there, because all the crap, the angst, the cloudiness, the fuzziness, the worry that I've spent on my weight—that's energy. Anxiously anticipating what the next meal was going to be or what it was going to do to me, or how it was going to affect my body, and the guilt and the shame and all of that — that's energy too. Now that I've released it, I am free — to behold whatever is new and possible for myself.\"",

The first: Can the West grow economies fast enough to overcome deficits?\n\n\"That can be one big issue, especially with the rising deficits of the US,\" Fink said.\n\nSecondly, another limiting factor is whether Western economies can make a J-curve of demand happen for AI and other technologies.\n\n\"The key to that is making sure that the demand only comes if technology is diffused for more applications, more utilizations,\" Fink said. \"If technology is just the domain of the six hyperscalers, we will fail.\"\n\nTax us — that's the message from nearly 400 wealthy people, who've signed an open letter addressed to the leaders gathering at Davos.\n\nThe letter's co-signees called out a \"handful of global oligarchs with extreme wealth,\" accusing them of harming society as a whole across governance, tech, innovation, and the environment.\n\nThe solution, per the letter, comes down to one thing — taxing the superrich.\n\nSignatories include the actor Mark Ruffalo, film producer and activist Abigail Disney, and musician Brian Eno.\n\n\"I believe President Trump is going to be about 3 hours late,\" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a morning presser. \"I haven't seen the updated schedule.\"\n\nICYMI: Trump had to switch planes after an electrical fault was detected on board Air Force One.\n\nDavid Steinbach, Hines' global chief investment officer, didn't mince words when describing the overall real-estate environment.\n\n\"It's been a really bad few years, honestly,\" Steinbach told me. \"Really beginning in 2022.\"\n\nDavid Steinbach, Hines' global chief investment officer, didn't mince words when describing the overall real-estate environment.\n\n\"It's been a really bad few years, honestly,\" Steinbach told me. \"Really beginning in 2022.\"\n\nRising geopolitical tensions and the siloing of regions can make the environment even trickier. Especially for a company with over $90 billion of assets across 30 countries. Still, Steinbach told me that Hines raised about 50% more discretionary capital year over year in 2025.\n\n\"There's a risk and opportunity, right? The risk is it's now different. And that's probably not changing anytime soon,\" Steinbach said. \"The opportunity is a lot needs to be built now, because you've got supply chains that need to get re-looked. You got very directive investments in-country.\"\n\n\"That's creating a lot of demand as well,\" Steinbach added.\n\nOn the schedule for Wednesday: Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nTrump ran into some travel trouble en route to Davos late Tuesday. He was forced to switch from Air Force One to a backup plane after an electrical fault was detected on board. Flight maps show Air Force One making a U-turn over the waters off Long Island, then landing back in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe president is now back on the road and on his way to Switzerland.",

    "description": "The startup behind open source tool PyTorch Lightning has merged with compute provider Voltage Park to create a “full stack AI cloud” to serve corporates and startups like Cursor.",
    "fullText": "Lightning AI founder and CEO William Falcon began renting AI chips from data center provider Voltage Park last March to help his clients train and finetune AI models. Less than a year later, his Nvidia-backed startup is merging with the AI factory, which manages over 35,000 Nvidia GPUs.\n\nFalcon said that the merged company, to be called Lightning AI, was valued at over $2.5 billion and that it had over $500 million of annual recurring revenue, which includes GPU rentals booked through Voltage Park.\n\nLightning had grown from building a popular open source tool PyTorch Lightning, which helps researchers manage machine learning, to bundling software to help corporates like German chip company Infineon and advertising agency Monks manage building and tweaking large language models.\n\nFalcon had run Lightning AI on cloud giant AWS but last year started to shop around a new class of startups like CoreWeave, Nebius and Voltage Park, which are known as “neoclouds” that had sprung up to meet surging demand for graphic processing units, as he planned to launch a marketplace that would bundle rented AI chips with his AI training software.\n\n“We met and proposed a bold idea to merge together and build a full stack AI cloud,” says Falcon, after he found that many of the neoclouds were better suited to working with scrappy startups, willing to make compromises to get access to cheap chips.\n\nFalcon founded Lightning in 2019 after studying for a doctorate on deep learning at NYU and interning with Yann LeCun at Facebook. Its open source tool has been downloaded more than 400 million times and the company has raised over $100 million from investors like Coatue, Index Ventures, and Bain Capital.\n\nIts new partner was born from a $900 million grant from crypto billionaire Jed McCaleb, who cofounded blockchain startup Ripple and early bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. McCaleb’s not-for-profit, the Navigation Fund, bought 24,000 of Nvidia’s then top-of-the-line H100 chips and set up Voltage Park to manage them with the goal of lowering the cost of compute for startups, per Reuters reporting.\n\nVoltage Park CEO Ozan Kaya told Forbes that the investment had made the company the third largest neocloud, behind CoreWeave and Nebius, based on chips deployed. The San Francisco-based company now operates six data centers in four states across the United States. “We were evaluating different ways to move up the stack and Lightning was the strongest one for us,” Kaya said.\n\nVoltage Park’s unusual funding was a draw rather than a deterrent for Falcon. Most of its neoclouds rivals (and tech giants like Meta) have loaded up on debt to fund purchases of new datacenters and AI chips. CoreWeave alone has raised over $14 billion from lenders. Voltage Park had built up 60 megawatts of active data center capacity with McCaleb’s foundation as its majority shareholder.\n\n“It was the only neocloud without debt,” Falcon said. “I think the first failure mode is going to be debt, their leverage.\n\nWhile OpenAI, Meta and xAI have been signing deals for data centers with gigawatts of power, Voltage Park’s customers like Cursor, open source AI lab Reflection and AI video generator Higgsfield, typically only needed clusters of AI chips with tens of megawatts of power, said Kaya.\n\nMcCaleb’s foundation, which was formed in November 2023, will now hold a “significant equity stake” in the new merged company, David Coman-Hidy, president of the Navigation Fund told Forbes. Coman-Hidy added that McCaleb occasionally advised Voltage Park but was not on the board, and had no ownership stake in Voltage Park, or Lightning AI. The fund now has grown its donor base and assets to $1.25 billion and has promised to make grants supporting causes that address climate change, the welfare of farm animals, criminal justice reform and “open science,” he said.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's highly anticipated Davos speech looks likely to be delayed after Air Force One turned around mid-flight.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters in Davos that Trump would likely arrive about three hours late.\n\nFour hours before he was due to speak onstage, his replacement plane was over the eastern Atlantic Ocean, flight-tracking data shows. The Boeing C-32A was about 1,000 miles from Zurich Airport and traveling at a groundspeed of some 560 miles per hour, per ADS-B Exchange.\n\nIf, like many high-profile World Economic Forum attendees, Trump travels by helicopter from Zurich airport, it would take about another 30 to 40 minutes to reach Davos.\n\nThat could put him in the Swiss Alps just before 1.30 p.m. CET, and he is scheduled to speak at 2:30 p.m. CET.\n\nHowever, there will likely be further added time due to security and other preparations.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, the World Economic Forum said it is \"in close contact with the US delegation and will provide an update should there be any changes to the President's schedule or related programme arrangements.\"\n\nTrump's original flight was forced to turn around on Tuesday night after a \"minor electrical issue,\" according to a White House pool report.\n\nFlight-tracking data showed Air Force One U-turned about 30 minutes into its journey from Joint Base Andrews.\n\nIt landed back there about 1 hour and 20 minutes after taking off. The replacement plane departed about an hour later.\n\nAir Force One is usually operated by a Boeing VC-25A, a militarized version of the double-decker 747 airliner. The one Trump originally departed on is over 30 years old.\n\nHe's instead flying on a Boeing C-32A, a modified 757 airliner, and usually used as the Vice President's Air Force Two, or when the President is visiting somewhere with too short a runway for the larger jet.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Trump's travel plans have been delayed by an aircraft issue.\n\nAnd at the end of Trump's visit to the UK last September, a helicopter was taking him from the Prime Minister's country house to London Stansted Airport, where Air Force One was parked.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said a \"minor hydraulic issue\" forced Marine One to divert to London Luton Airport. Another helicopter carried Trump the remaining 25 miles, and he was only delayed about 20 minutes.",

    "description": "Geoffrey Hinton said he is concerned that the AI he helped develop poses risks that are not being taken seriously.",
    "fullText": "That's how Geoffrey Hinton, the computer scientist widely known as the \"Godfather of AI,\" describes how he feels about the technology he helped create and what he says is the world's failure to take its growing risks seriously.\n\n\"It makes me very sad that I put my life into developing this stuff and that it's now extremely dangerous and people aren't taking the dangers seriously enough,\" Hinton told BBC Newsnight in an interview released on Tuesday and recorded earlier this month.\n\nHinton, who helped pioneer the neural networks that underpin modern artificial intelligence, has become one of the field's most outspoken critics as AI systems grow more powerful and widespread.\n\nHe has predicted that AI could trigger widespread job losses, fuel social unrest, and eventually outsmart humans — and has said that researchers should focus more on how advanced systems are trained, including ensuring they are designed to protect human interests.\n\nOn BBC Newsnight, Hinton said that humanity is approaching a pivotal moment as researchers edge closer to building machines more intelligent than humans.\n\n\"We've never been in this situation before of being able to produce things more intelligent than ourselves,\" Hinton said, adding that many experts believe that AI will surpass human intelligence within the next 20 years — and in many areas, already has. Once that happens, he said, controlling such systems may become far more difficult than many assume.\n\n\"The idea that you could just turn it off won't work,\" Hinton said, adding that a sufficiently advanced AI could persuade humans not to shut it down.\n\nHinton said the biggest mistake humanity could make now would be failing to invest in research on how humans can coexist with the intelligent systems they created.\n\n\"If we create them so they don't care about us,\" he warned, \"they will probably wipe us out.\"\n\nHe suggested that catastrophic outcomes are not inevitable, saying that the risks depend on how advanced systems are designed and governed and that humans still have \"a lot of options on how to create them\" while AI remains under development.\n\nStill, Hinton also expressed concern that AI is being unleashed at a time when global cooperation is weakening and authoritarian politics are on the rise, making meaningful regulation harder to achieve.\n\nHe compared the need for AI governance to international agreements on chemical and nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite his concerns, Hinton said he would not undo his work on AI.\n\n\"It would have been developed without me,\" he said. \"I don't think I made any decisions that I wouldn't make the same way if I had the same knowledge.\"\n\nHe remains hopeful about AI's potential to improve education and medicine, pointing to AI tutors and advances in medical imaging as examples of its promise. But for now, Hinton said, urgency is paramount.\n\n\"We're at a very crucial point in history when we're going to develop things more intelligent than ourselves fairly soon,\" he said. \"We haven't done the research to figure out if we can peacefully coexist with them. It's crucial we do that research.\"",

    "description": "Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jensen Huang attended or donated to President DonaldTrump's inauguration. All of them got richer last year.",
    "fullText": "It's been one year since President Donald Trump was sworn back into office — and four of the wealthiest tech billionaires who attended or donated to his inauguration have gotten richer.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Jensen Huang — all of whom are featured on Bloomberg's list of 500 wealthiest people in the world — were among the tech royalty who signaled support for the administration, either through attendance or a donation. Others included Tim Cook, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, and Shou Zi Chew.\n\nThe tech billionaire with the largest increase in his net worth during Trump's first year is also the one who was closest to the Trump administration: Elon Musk. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the Tesla CEO's wealth increased by 52% over the past year.\n\nWhile Musk, Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Huang are all wealthier today than they were on Inauguration Day in 2025, there have been some ups and downs. Collectively, the group lost $194 billion in wealth during Trump's first 100 days as markets reacted to the administration's tariffs. They've since made up for those losses and then some. As of January 19, the group was cumulatively $288 billion wealthier than a year prior.\n\nHere's where all four stood as of Monday, January 19, 2026.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $449 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $681 billion\n\nAfter spending at least $277 million backing Trump and Republicans during the 2024 election, Musk attended the inauguration and worked closely with the White House as the public face of the White House DOGE Office. Following his departure in May, Musk and Trump had a very public falling out, though they later reconciled.\n\nMusk's work with DOGE resulted in backlash against Tesla, with the company's share price declining in the first few months of Trump's presidency. It has since recovered, and in the year since Trump was elected Musk has solidified his standing as the world's richest man. In November, Tesla shareholders approved a $1 trillion-dollar pay package for the Tesla CEO, if he hits a series of goals, and there are plans for a SpaceX IPO in 2026.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $245 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $261 billion\n\nBezos's wealth, most of which is tied to Amazon stock, has increased since Trump took office a second time. Bezos, the Amazon founder and chairman, attended the inauguration alongside his now-wife Lauren Sánchez. Amazon also donated $1 million to the president's inaugural committee.\n\nAnalysts have said that Amazon was especially at risk of being negatively impacted by Trump's trade war, and CEO Andy Jassy said this week prices on the platform are increasing as a result of tariffs. Amazon's share price is roughly the same as it was a year ago.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $217 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $220 billion\n\nZuckerberg and Trump once had a contentious relationship that went back several years prior to the 2024 election, with the latter at one time threatening to have the Meta CEO jailed over Facebook banning Trump's account in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nZuckerberg publicly warmed to Trump during the 2024 cycle, offering him praise and attending the inauguration. Zuckerberg was seated next to Trump at a White House dinner attended by tech leaders last year. Meta also donated $1 million to the inaugural committee.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $117 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $154 billion\n\nHuang did not attend the inauguration, but Nvidia donated $1 million to the inaugural committee. The Nvidia CEO also met with Trump shortly after he took office and the company has worked with the White House on AI policy.",

    "description": "The Tesla Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus robot are both set to enter production this year as Elon Musk bets Tesla's future on AI and robotics.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk is bracing for another round of production hell.\n\nThe Tesla CEO said on Tuesday that the ramp-up of the company's Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus robot, both set to enter production this year, would be \"agonizingly slow.\"\n\n\"The speed of the production ramp is inversely proportionate to how many new parts and steps there are,\" wrote Musk in a post on X.\n\n\"For Cybercab and Optimus, almost everything is new, so the early production rate will be agonizingly slow, but eventually end up being insanely fast,\" he added.\n\nTesla is set to begin production of the Cybercab, a sleek two-seater robotaxi that Musk has said will ship without a steering wheel or pedals, in April. The billionaire is targeting an eventual production goal of 2 million units a year.\n\nThe Cybercab, which Musk said in 2024 would cost around $25,000, is set to enter mass production as Tesla races to expand its robotaxi service after a sluggish start.\n\nThe company launched autonomous ride-hailing in Austin last June, but it only has a small number of Model Y robotaxis on the road in the city and has not yet removed human safety monitors from its vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, Optimus, its humanoid robot designed to help with everyday tasks, is set to enter production by the end of 2026, with Musk saying Tesla could eventually make one million a year.\n\nThe Tesla CEO told investors in October that it would take a while to reach that goal as the company was having to manufacture almost the entire supply chain from scratch, with production moving at the speed of the \"slowest, dumbest, least lucky thing out of 10,000 unique items.\"\n\nMusk's comments echo what Tesla is telling its employees. In an all-hands meeting in October, the company's VP of AI software told staff on Tesla's Autopilot and Optimus teams that 2026 would be the \"hardest year\" of their lives, Business Insider's Grace Kay exclusively reported.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Tesla has faced a rough road while scaling an ambitious new product.\n\nThe company endured a famously brutal period of what Musk called \"production hell\" while building its Model 3 EV in 2017. Musk and other employees resorted to sleeping on the factory floor as they struggled to scale the mass-market model.\n\nTesla also faced production challenges with the Cybertruck, the company's last new vehicle.\n\nThe electric pickup's unique design and stainless steel-clad structure made it highly challenging to produce at scale, and Musk acknowledged in 2023 that Tesla had \"dug its own grave\" with the Cybertruck's design.\n\nThe divisive electric truck also serves as a caveat for Musk's ambitious production goals.\n\nMusk's predictions that Tesla could produce 250,000 Cybertrucks a year have fallen short, with industry data showing the company sold just over 20,000 Cybertrucks in the US last year.",

    "description": "A practical approach to safely running AI coding agents with strong isolation using cloud VMs, Tailscale, and simple notification patterns.",
    "fullText": "Running coding agents with free reign is very powerful for a certain class of tasks, especially ones that require little human supervision, or where you want to close (or disconnect) your laptop, walk away, and come back to results.\n\nRecently there have been several HN discussions about safely running Claude Code or Copilot CLI agents, such as Yolobox – Run AI coding agents with full sudo without nuking home dir and Running Claude Code dangerously. These post detail the potential dangers and show how to run these agents more safely, and while reasonable, I find they lack in a few respects.\n\nIn particular, I want strong isolation, long running agent tasks, minimal cognitive overhead and I really value being able to close my laptop, walk away, and get notified on my phone when things are done. I do not mind paying for a cloud VM.\n\nThere are many valid ways to solve this problem. This post describes mine. It covers running multiple coding agents concurrently in a cloud VM, how I handle access and repos, and how I keep notifications simple.\n\nI generated some Terraform to spin up an Azure VM with a cloud-init.yml for setting up common tools/environments I use. Claude can generate a decent starting point for this quite easily, given your particular environment.\n\nFor secure access, I use Tailscale. Note: I'm not paid by them, but it is easily my favorite piece of infrastructure software!\n\nA cloud-init script installs Tailscale on first boot and automatically joins the VM to my tailnet. SSH access is enabled using Tailscale SSH. Once the VM is up, it appears on my private network with a stable hostname via Magic DNS. No SSH key management, no exposed ports.\n\nor connect using VS Code Remote SSH:\n\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh\n\nMost of the time I prefer tight, step by step control over code generation, working locally in VS Code with Copilot. For longer running or experimental tasks, I instead let an agent work remotely on a branch inside the VM, and pull the results once I am satisfied.\n\nWhile this is arguably git basics, it works well for me and I found that it is useful sharing how to set up a VM as a remote:\n\nOn the local machine, from the repo directory:\n\nThen you can pull clone and check out the branch, do the work, commit, and push to bare repo:\n\nFinally, locally, you can get the changes:\n\nI use tmux to manage long running sessions. This lets agents keep running after I disconnect, and makes it easy to juggle multiple concurrent sessions. If you are not familiar with tmux, it is worth learning!\n\nFor notifications, I use https://ntfy.sh.\n\nIt is free, extremely simple, and works over plain HTTP POST. I have the iOS app installed, so I can walk away from my laptop and still get notified when work completes. I explicitly instruct my agents to make a POST request once their work is done in the agent instructions.\n\nThat is it. No SDKs, no auth setup required for basic usage. The notification shows up immediately on my phone/browser.\n\nIf there is interest, I can publish a repo with the Terraform, cloud-init scripts, makefile, etc, and the old .devcontainer setup.",

    "fullText": "DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 20 (Reuters) - An agreement on sharing responsibility for the security of the Arctic and the North Atlantic could provide a way out of ​the stand-off between the United States and Europe over Greenland, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said ‌on Tuesday.\n\nNauseda told Reuters an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting that the Greenland row ‌was overshadowing the war in Ukraine and playing into Russia's hands, and urged Washington to de-escalate tensions.\n\n\"The best outcome would be just to agree on common responsibility on the security of the Arctic region and North Atlantic region. Is it possible to achieve? We should do our best to go this way, ⁠because this is the best way,\" ‌he said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday there was \"no going back\" on his aim of acquiring Greenland, refusing to rule out taking the Arctic island ‍by force and rounding on allies.\n\nTrump's ambition to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark has threatened to blow apart the alliance that has underpinned Western security for decades.\n\nEU leaders are due to discuss their options ​at an emergency summit on Thursday which Nauseda said would show whether Europe can present ‌a united front over Greenland. He said the next two weeks would probably show how the dispute is resolved.\n\nNauseda said he hoped countries that can be sceptical about supporting Ukraine would understand that Europe has reached a critical juncture, arguing NATO's future is at stake.\n\nTrump is due to speak in Davos on Wednesday, and Nauseda said his hope was that the U.S. President would send out some ⁠signals towards de-escalating tensions over Greenland.\n\nDescribing upholding territorial integrity as ​an \"untouchable principle,\" Nauseda said there was always room to de-escalate.\n\n\"But ​of course the precondition is that both sides want this de-escalation, and now I'm not sure. Europe is obviously willing to de-escalate. I hope that the United ‍States will be too.\"\n\nThe ⁠Lithuanian president said the Greenland dispute had diverted attention away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, posing additional challenges for Europe's eastern flank.\n\nOngoing support from Washington was vital while Europe set about ⁠taking on responsibility for its own security, he said.\n\n\"Europe needs time in order to implement this strategic autonomy, not only ‌on paper, but in reality,\" Nauseda said.\n\n\"We need 10 to 15 years' time,\" he ‌added.",

    "fullText": "HONOLULU (AP) — A former flight attendant for a Canadian airline posed as a commercial pilot and as a current flight attendant to obtain hundreds of free flights from U.S. airlines, authorities said.\n\nDallas Pokornik, 33, of Toronto, was arrested in Panama after being indicted on wire fraud charges in federal court in Hawaii last October. He pleaded not guilty Tuesday following his extradition.\n\nAccording to court documents, Pokornik was a flight attendant for a Toronto-based airline from 2017 to 2019, then used fake employee identification from that carrier to obtain tickets reserved for pilots and flight attendants on three other airlines.\n\nU.S. prosecutors said Tuesday that Pokornik even requested to sit in an extra seat in the cockpit — the “jump seat” — typically reserved for off-duty pilots. It was not clear from court documents whether he ever actually rode in a plane’s cockpit, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office declined to say.\n\nThe indictment did not identify the airlines except to say they are based in Honolulu, Chicago and Fort Worth, Texas. Representatives for Hawaiian Airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines — which are respectively based in those cities — didn’t immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nAir Canada, which is based in Toronto, also did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe scheme lasted four years, the U.S. prosecutors in Hawaii said.\n\nA U.S. magistrate judge on Tuesday ordered Pokornik to remain in custody. His federal defender declined to comment.\n\nIn 2023, an off-duty airline pilot riding in the cockpit of a Horizon Air flight said “I’m not OK” just before trying to cut the engines midflight. That pilot, Joseph Emerson, later told police he had been struggling with depression.\n\nA federal judge sentenced him to time served last November.\n\nThe allegations against Pokornik are reminiscent of “Catch Me If You Can,” the movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio that tells the story of Frank Abagnale posing as a pilot to defraud an airline and obtain free flights.",

There are also bonus points on offer for every round reached across the three competitions, although more points are given to teams competing in the Champions League than in the other competitions.\n\nIn the qualification rounds, these points are halved.\n\nPoints earned are then divided by how many teams from that country entered European competitions at the start of the season.\n\nIn the 2025-26 season, England have nine teams competing in Europe. That means all points are divided by nine.\n\nScotland started the season with five teams competing in Europe. Although Hibernian and Dundee United failed to progress out of the qualifying rounds, three teams remain - but Scotland's points are still divided by five.\n\nFor this season, England and Spain were given one extra spot each as they were the two best-performing nations across the 2024-25 campaign. That meant entry to the Champions League was given to Newcastle and Athletic Club.\n\nFor the 2024-25 season, Italy and Germany were given the two places, known as European Performances Spots (EPS).

This marked the first rise in inflation for five months and was slightly ahead of forecasts for a 3.3% increase.",

    "description": "While the San Francisco area had a lukewarm ranking, another part of the Bay Area was named the fifth-hottest market in the U.S.",
    "fullText": "Zillow's predictions for the hottest housing markets of 2026 are out - and the San Francisco metropolitan area is way down the list.\n\nThat may be news to buyers in San Francisco, where the artificial intelligence boom has set off bidding wars in parts of the city. It may even be more surprising when you consider that the San Jose area far outranked its neighbor, ranking fifth out of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas.\n\nThe San Jose metro area, which is made up of Santa Clara and San Benito counties, and the Los Angeles area were the only West Coast regions in the top 10. The San Francisco area, which includes Marin, San Mateo and Alameda counties, ranked 38th.\n\nThe top markets? Not coastal metropolises or Sun Belt getaways, mostly. Instead, the list includes some of the snowiest and more economically depressed places in the country: the likes of Buffalo, N.Y., Hartford, Conn., and Milwaukee.\n\n{ \"__type\": \"devHubFreeformEmbed\", \"__id\": \"Datawrapper\", \"__fallbackImage\": \"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AwCiQ/mobile.png\", \"__data\": { \"datawrapper_id\": \"AwCiQ\" } }\n\nTo be sure, both San Jose and San Francisco have jumped far in the rankings since last year, when they were close to dead last. Zillow's annual ranking isn't based solely on price growth. Instead, it's meant to indicate which markets could see the highest level of competition among buyers.\n\nAffordability is a big part of that competition, which helps explain why seven of the top 10 hottest metro areas are in the relatively affordable inner Northeast. A buyer could purchase four homes in top-ranked Hartford, Conn., for the price of a typical home in the San Jose area. That means those Northeast suburbs have a bigger potential pool of buyers, while buying in San Francisco or San Jose is often only feasible for wealthier families.\n\nWhat's more, both the West Coast and the Northeast are experiencing a lack of housing inventory, said Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow - but unlike in California, the Northeast has a number of relatively cheap metros located not far from powerhouse cities like Boston and New York. By contrast, supply is infamously tight in California's coastal metros, which keeps prices up and competition fierce, with few alternate refuges beyond the cities of the Central Valley. Californian families struggling to find something within their budget often have to leave the state entirely.\n\nFinally, high mortgage rates have also sapped inventory across the U.S., with many would-be sellers reluctant to give up their low rates to move.",

They have every right to be annoyed. I've made a terrible mistake.\n\n\"I've put myself in a situation which I shouldn't have done. Did it affect my cricket? I don't think so.

I've got to try and regain their trust again in my ability, in my cricket on the field and off the field. I'm hoping that they can expect I'll be slightly different away from the game. I'll be more professional.\n\n\"That's what I've got to do now for the rest of my career, hopefully. I just want to be back playing as good cricket as I possibly can be.\"",

    "fullText": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Warren Buffett's successor appears to be considering his first significant move after taking over as CEO this month.\n\nKraft Heinz warned investors Tuesday that Berkshire Hathaway may be interested in selling its 325 million shares in the name brand food giant that Buffett helped create back in 2015. The news came in a filing with stock market regulators.\n\nBuffett and the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital orchestrated the merger of Kraft and Heinz back then because they already owned Heinz and believed in the power of their brands. Now Greg Abel may be plotting a different course.\n\nOver the years since Buffett had come to realize that the company's competitive moat around its brands wasn't as strong as he thought as consumers have increasingly been willing to switch to store brands and move away from processed foods. Berkshire took a $3.76 billion writedown on its Kraft-Heinz stake last summer. Buffett said last fall that he was disappointed in Kraft Heinz' plan to split the company in two, and Berkshire's two representatives resigned from the Kraft board last spring.\n\nBut still it was rare for Buffett to unload an acquisition during his six decades leading Berkshire even when he soured on a business' prospects. Berkshire didn't respond to questions Tuesday about the filing where Kraft Heinz disclosed that its largest shareholder “may offer to sell, from time to time, 325,442,152 shares.” Kraft Heinz shares fell nearly 4% to $22.85 after the announcement.\n\nThere's no sign Berkshire has started selling yet, but CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert wonders if this could be just the beginning of a comprehensive review of Berkshire's varied holdings. In addition to its massive stock portfolio worth over $300 billion, Berkshire owns an assortment of insurers including Geico, several utilities, BNSF railroad and an eclectic mix of manufacturing and retail companies.\n\n“My sense is that Greg Abel’s leadership style may be a departure from Buffett’s, and this sale, if completed, would represent a shift in corporate mindset,” Seifert said. \"Berkshire under Buffett typically only made acquisitions- not divestitures. It's not inconceivable, in our view, that Abel may likely assess every Berkshire subsidiary and decide to jettison those that do not meet his internal hurdles.“\n\nOf course Abel already knows many of Berkshire's companies well because he has been managing all of the non-insurance companies since 2018. But he only became CEO on Jan. 1. Buffett remains chairman, but investors are watching closely for any changes Abel might make at the venerable conglomerate.",

    "fullText": "LIMA, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Peruvian President Jose Jeri has asked to appear before Congress to \"clarify\" meetings he held with a Chinese businessman outside of his official agenda, which ​are being investigated by the public prosecutor in a new political scandal rocking the country.\n\nJeri, who ‌assumed power in October after the expulsion of former President Dina Boluarte, sent a letter to Congress on Tuesday requesting to participate ‌the following day in the legislative oversight committee that is also investigating him for the meetings.\n\nThe request \"is made in light of the country's need for matters of public interest to be clarified with transparency and responsibility,\" said Jeri's letter, seen by Reuters.\n\nLater, the head of the congressional oversight committee, Elvis Vergara, announced that he would meet with ⁠the president.\n\nPeru has been reeling from ‌an ongoing political crisis, with a revolving door of seven presidents since 2018 due to resignations or dismissals.\n\nJeri's meetings with businessman Zhihua Yang, who owns commercial stores and ‍a concession for an energy project, and his failure to publicly disclose them as part of his agenda, prompted criticism over a lack of transparency and potential corruption. In Peru, the president's meetings are traditionally included in the official agenda.\n\nJeri met ​with Zhihua Yang on December 26 and January 6, according to local media.\n\nOpposition lawmakers have said they ‌will present a motion to impeach or censure Jeri, 39, whose popularity remains high despite dipping to 44% in January, according to the local polling firm CPI.\n\nJeri issued a public apology for the initial meeting, a dinner at a Chinese restaurant in Lima, via a recorded message on Sunday. He said he went to coordinate the celebration of another anniversary of Peruvian-Chinese friendship and denied having received an \"irregular request\" to meet.\n\n\"I ⁠admit my mistake,\" he said. \"And I publicly apologize for entering ​the meeting with the businessman the way I did, hidden, and ​for that, giving rise to suspicions and doubts about my behavior,\" Jeri said.\n\nHours after Jeri's apology, a second meeting with Zhihua Yang, whose business has been suspended by Lima's authorities ‍for selling unauthorized products, ⁠was made public.\n\nAn attorney representing Zhihua Yang told radio station RPP on Monday night that the encounters were a \"friendly meeting in which President Jeri broke some protocols.\"\n\nAlthough a censure of Jeri requires fewer ⁠votes than impeachment (87 out of 130), his removal is unlikely, political experts have said. Two-thirds of Peru's lawmakers are seeking reelection and ‌will likely opt for stability before the April general elections, analysts said.\n\n(Report by Marco Aquino, ‌Editing by Cassandra Garrison, Aida Pelaez-Fernandez and Andrea Ricci)",

Grand and ambitious architectural projects have largely stalled in the West, but the Gulf states’ lack of regulations and endless flows of cash provide the kind of laissez-faire sandbox that most architects—especially those of the technocratic “big ideas” variety—can only dream of.\n\nUnsurprisingly, when Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman proposed building a 110-mile horizontal urban “skyscraper” called the Line near the border of Jordan and Egypt in 2020—the centerpiece of a vast new planned city called Neom—many of the world’s most prestigious firms clamored to sign up. These ranged from the usual suspects of neoliberal future-making, like Thom Mayne’s aesthetically erratic outfit Morphosis, to firms that inherited the city-building impulses of modernism, such as Peter Cook and an I.M. Pei–less Pei Cobb Freed. All of this, of course, was managed by the notorious architecture-and-construction-slash-defense-contractor AECOM, which also happens to be handling the structural logistics for Donald Trump’s ballroom and Benjamin Netanyahu’s sinister, Neom-esque Gaza 2035 master plan.\n\nFor nearly five years, we beleaguered souls in the design world have had to endure innumerable press releases and puff pieces about whatever zany shit was going on out in the Saudi Arabian desert. This included the Line’s supposed sustainability efforts (oh, the oil-funded irony), such as indoor gardens and wind farms, plus a number of gravity-defying proposals that, to anyone with a rudimentary understanding of physics, sounded more like pulpy sci-fi gags (most notoriously, an upside-down skyscraper poised like a keystone over an artificial marina full of stagnant water). Year by year, with little progress made save for the piles prematurely driven into the sand, it became increasingly clear that the damn thing would never be built—that it was what we in the biz call “paper architecture.”\n\nThis was recently confirmed in a long Financial Times exposé detailing how the scope of bin Salman’s vision has shrunk to basically nothing. The “chandelier” (the central upside-down skyscraper) was derailed by the fact that the earth spins, the wind blows, and human waste can’t be flushed upward. The Line’s reflective surface and wind-turbine farm basically created a bird-slaughtering machine along one of the world’s most important migratory routes. Meanwhile, amid a culture of secrecy and retribution, architects and planners were basically forced to agree with whatever bin Salman thought was interesting or worthwhile, a process that mostly relied on a nonstop parade of spectacular renderings.\n\nUnlike other paper reveries, the human costs of the Line have been staggering. In 2021, the development occasioned a horrific program of forced displacement for members of the Huwaitat tribe and the imprisonment—even execution—of anyone who dared to resist. A few years later, an ITV documentary revealed that more than 21,000 workers were estimated to have died or disappeared under Saudi Vision 2030, the massive urbanization program that counts Neom as its crown jewel. Human Rights Watch has documented the repeated abuse of migrant workers on Saudi megaprojects. These workers, who are often charged outlandish recruitment fees, have had their phones destroyed and their immigration documents confiscated. Tens of thousands of people have died or suffered abject ruination in the service of a few glossy pictures. The shambolic project that killed or ruined them was made possible not only by a seemingly bottomless supply of oil money, but by the borrowed prestige of some of the West’s leading architecture firms.\n\nThe Line’s failure should serve as a warning to other firms seduced by outrageous consulting and design fees—not only for the sheer scale of its barbarism but for the obvious frivolity of its lies. Is it not humiliating to aid and abet a project that is so evidently bullshit? Was it not humiliating to have to pretend that Saudi Arabia’s sustainability goals were legitimate while the construction materials and transportation behind its projects wrested more carbon from the earth than most small countries do in a year?\n\nArchitecture is always political. Greed and the promise of creative freedom—which, of course, is always secured at a cost—lure architects toward countries that are looking to culture-wash their bad names through stadiums, cultural centers, luxury shopping districts, and dazzling hotels. The logic behind many of these bad choices is that everyone else is doing the same. Louis Vuitton is doing it. Formula One is doing it. If I don’t do it, somebody else will.\n\nArchitecture loves to present itself as a liberal or progressive field, shielding itself from reproach with its forays into sustainability and new, more egalitarian forms of living. And it does so all while taking sordid money and grinding its own workers to dust through overwork and underpayment. The ruins of the Line expose a cold truth, which is that these firms and their fountainheads have never been any different from any other capitalist enterprise. Like many others, they have blood on their hands.",

    "description": "\"This is just the beginning.\"",
    "fullText": "Scientists uncovered \"alarming levels\" of plastic and other human-created debris deep inside of sea caves in the Mediterranean.\n\nA group of researchers conducted a comprehensive survey of marine litter inside coastal caves on the island of Cyprus.\n\n\"We found debris in every cave studied, with some containing abundances of up to 97 items per square meter — far exceeding levels typically found on open beaches, the sea surface, or the seafloor,\" two of the authors stated in a Phys.org article that summarizes their newly published study.\n\nThey explained that sea caves act as \"natural traps,\" quietly accumulating marine debris.\n\n\"What we saw inside some caves was shocking,\" they added.\n\nThis study helps fill an important gap in the understanding of the extent of plastic pollution in oceans. The authors noted that while sea caves have often been overlooked in marine litter research, these spaces act as safe havens for many species. For instance, several of the caves surveyed by the team are known resting and pupping sites for the Mediterranean monk seal, which they described as \"one of the world's most endangered marine mammals.\"\n\n\"While no monk seal deaths or severe injuries from macro-litter have yet been documented in the Mediterranean, recent studies have already confirmed the presence of microplastics in the species' digestive tracts,\" they added.\n\nAccording to WWF Australia, 100,000 marine mammals die each year after ingesting or becoming entangled in ocean plastics.\n\nMeanwhile, scientists are investigating the impacts of microplastics — tiny shards that break off from larger plastics as they decompose — on human health. These pieces have been discovered in our water, food, soil, and air, and they've so far been linked to major health concerns such as decreased blood flow to the brain and lung cancer.\n\nOne thing we all can do to help with the plastic plague is to use less of it. For instance, consider purchasing a sturdy reusable tumbler instead of relying on prepackaged bottled water that comes in single-use plastic containers. Another impactful action is bringing your own reusable container for leftovers when you eat out.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nMeanwhile, the cave study scientists are pushing for more research.\n\n\"This is just the beginning, and we urgently need broader Mediterranean-wide monitoring to understand how widespread the problem truly is,\" they stated.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico's security minister said Tuesday that it had sent another 37 members of Mexican drug cartels to the United States, as the Trump administration ratchets up pressure on governments to crack down on criminal networks it says are smuggling drugs across the border.\n\nMexican Security Minister Omar García Harfuch wrote in a social media post on X that the people transferred were “high impact criminals” that “represented a real threat to the country’s security.”\n\nIt is the third time in less than one year that Mexico has sent detained cartel members to the U.S. as the country attempts to offset mounting threats by U.S. President Donald Trump. García Harfuch said the government has sent 92 people in total.\n\nVideo shared by Mexican authorities shows a line of handcuffed prisoners surrounded by heavily armed and masked officers being loaded onto a military jet at an airport on the outskirts of Mexico City.\n\n“As the pressure increases, as demands from the White House dial up, (Mexico’s government) needs to resort to extraordinary measures, such as these transfers,” said David Mora, a Mexico analyst at the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe U.S. State Department and Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTuesday’s transfer included a handful of important figures from the Sinaloa Cartel, the Beltrán-Leyva cartel, Jalisco New Generation Cartel, the Northeast Cartel, a remnant of the infamous Zetas based in the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas, across from Texas. Mexican authorities said that all had pending U.S. cases.\n\nAmong those transferred was María Del Rosario Navarro Sánchez, the first Mexican citizen to face charges in the U.S. for providing support to a terrorist organization, after being accused of conspiring with a cartel.\n\nTrump has publicly entertained the idea of military action on Mexican cartels, language that has only gotten more combative since a U.S. military operation in Venezuela deposed former President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month.\n\nTurning his attention to Mexico shortly after the Venezuela attack, Trump said in an interview with Fox News: “We’ve knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water and we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels.”\n\nLast week, Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke with Trump, telling him that U.S. intervention in Mexico was “not necessary,” but emphasizing that the two governments would continue to collaborate.\n\nLast February, Mexico sent 29 cartel figures to the U.S., including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985. In August, a second round saw 26 Mexican cartel figures sent to the U.S. None had the profile of Caro Quintero, but spanning multiple cartels, the figures could help U.S. prosecutors build cases.\n\nAfter the August transfer, García Harfuch said it was a public safety decision, because Mexico did not want them to continue operating their illicit businesses from inside Mexican prisons.\n\nAnother transfer of prisoners to the U.S. had been rumored for weeks. Mexico has sought to assure the Trump administration that it continues to be a willing partner in combating drug traffickers.\n\n\"For the Trump administration and the Trump base, what is going to matter in the end is some wins that Trump can actually bring back and say ‘Look this is what I’m getting out of Mexico,’” said Mora.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — With many Americans still recovering from multiple blasts of snow and unrelenting freezing temperatures in the nation’s northern tier, a new storm is set to emerge this weekend that could coat roads, trees and power lines with devastating ice across a wide expanse of the South.\n\nThe storm arriving late this week and into the weekend is shaping up to be a “widespread potentially catastrophic event from Texas to the Carolinas,” said Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n“I don’t know how people are going to deal with it,” he said.\n\nForecasters on Tuesday warned that the ice could weigh down trees and power lines, triggering widespread outages.\n\n“If you get a half of an inch of ice — or heaven forbid an inch of ice — that could be catastrophic,” said Keith Avery, CEO of the Newberry Electric Cooperative in South Carolina.\n\n‘Great swaths’ of heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain expected\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of \"great swaths of heavy snow, sleet, and treacherous freezing rain” starting Friday in much of the nation’s midsection and then shifting toward the East Coast through Sunday.\n\nTemperatures will be slow to warm in many areas, meaning ice that forms on roads and sidewalks might stick around, forecasters say.\n\nThe exact timing of the approaching storm — and where it is headed — remained uncertain on Tuesday. Forecasters say it can be challenging to predict precisely which areas could see rain and which ones could be punished with ice.\n\nCold air clashing with rain to fuel a 'major winter storm’\n\nAn extremely cold arctic air mass is set to dive south from Canada, setting up a clash with the cold temperatures and rain that will be streaming eastward across the southern U.S.\n\n“This is extreme, even for this being the peak of winter,” National Weather Service meteorologist Bryan Jackson said of the cold temperatures.\n\nWhen the cold air meets the rain, the likely result will be “a major winter storm with very impactful weather, with all the moisture coming up from the Gulf and encountering all this particularly cold air that’s spilling in,” Jackson said.\n\nAn atmospheric river could set up across the southern U.S.\n\nAn atmospheric river of moisture could be in place by the weekend, pulling precipitation across Texas and other states along the Gulf Coast and continuing across Georgia and the Carolinas, forecasters said.\n\n“Global models are painting a concerning picture of what this weekend could look like, with an increasingly strong signal for ice storm potential across North Georgia and portions of central Georgia,” according to the National Weather Service's Atlanta office.\n\nIf significant accumulations of ice strike metro Atlanta, it could be a problem through the weekend since low temperatures early Monday are expected to be around 22 degrees (minus 5.6 Celsius) in Atlanta. The city's high temperature on Monday is forecast to be around 35 degrees (1.7 Celsius).\n\nHighway and air travel could be tangled by the storm\n\nTravel is a major concern, as southern states have less equipment to remove snow and ice from roads, and extremely cold temperatures expected after the storm could prevent ice from melting for several days. In Michigan, more than 100 vehicles crashed into each other or slid off an interstate southwest of Grand Rapids on Monday.\n\nThe storm is also expected to impact many of the nation’s major hub airports, including those in Dallas; Atlanta; Memphis, Tennessee; and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nPolar air from Canada to keep northern states in a deep freeze\n\nUnusually cold temperatures are already in place across much of the northern tier of the U.S., but the blast of arctic air expected later this week “will be the coldest yet,” Jackson said.\n\n“There’s a large sprawling vortex of low pressure centered over Hudson Bay,” Jackson said of the sea in northern Canada that’s connected to the Arctic Ocean. “And this is dominating the weather over all of North America.”\n\nTexas could be a harbinger for other parts of the South\n\nSome of the storm’s earliest impacts could be in Texas on Friday, as the arctic air mass slides south through much of the state, National Weather Service forecaster Sam Shamburger said in a briefing on the storm.\n\n“At the same time, we’re expecting rain to move into much of the state,” Shamburger said.\n\nLow temperatures could fall into the 20s or even the teens in parts of Texas by Saturday, with the potential for a wintery mix of weather in the northern part of the state.\n\nForecasters cautioned that significant uncertainty remains, particularly over how much ice or snow could fall across north and central Texas.\n\n“It’s going to be a very difficult forecast,” Shamburger said.\n\nAt an Arkansas hardware store, customers gear up for storm\n\nIn Little Rock, Arkansas, a steady stream of customers on Tuesday were stocking up on supplies at Fuller and Son Hardware.\n\n“Right now parents of young children are getting sleds,” said James Carter, the company’s director of operations.\n\nPeople were also getting shovels, ice-melting products and covers for outside faucets to keep them from freezing, since low temperatures in the Little Rock area are forecast to fall into the teens, he said.\n\nPanjwani reported from Washington.

If I were here, and they were making that threat to somebody—not even a president, but somebody, like they did with me—I would absolutely hit them so hard.”\n\n“But I have very firm instructions,“ he continued. “Anything happens, they’re gonna wipe ’em off the face of this Earth.”\n\nTalking about his other geopolitical ambitions, including seizing control of Greenland, Trump argued that controlling the autonomous Danish territory is crucial in order to ensure the effectiveness of his so-called \"Golden Dome\" defense shield, telling Pavlich, “Having Greenland makes it a much more effective golden dome.”\n\n“So you’re saying Greenland is essential for the security of the United States and the free Western world?” Pavlich asked him. “That’s correct,” Trump replied, adding, “And even beyond missile defense, it is so important for the golden dome, it’s so important for just national, and actually international security.”\n\nThe president also made reference to top-secret weapons in his possession, telling Pavlich, “We have weapons that nobody knows about. It’s probably good not to talk about it, but we have some amazing weapons,” in reference to his attack on Venezuela and the kidnapping of President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nTrump has previously said that if Iran were to follow through on its threats to target U.S. military or commercial bases, “we will hit them at levels that they’ve never been hit before” with a “very, very powerful force.”\n\nWhen asked by a CNN reporter earlier this month if he thought the country took his threats seriously, Trump dismissed the question as stupid, arguing that Iran has “been through it for years with me” and citing the killings of Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Qasem Soleimani and ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as proof.\n\n“I think so. Don’t you think so, CNN? Don’t you think so? Wouldn’t you say that they probably do at this point? After going through it for years with me, being hit—Soleimani, al-Baghdadi—the Iran nuclear threat wiped out. Don’t you think?” he said, referring to the strikes he launched on three nuclear sites in Iran last June.\n\nThe president has expressed support for anti-government protesters in Iran, going so far as to encourage them to take over national institutions and assuring them that help is on the way as concerns mount about crackdowns on protesters, including arrests and unlawful killings.\n\n“Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING – TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!! Save the names of the killers and abusers. They will pay a big price. I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY,” he wrote in a Jan. 13 Truth Social post.\n\nHe ended the post with “MIGA!!!,” or “Make Iran Great Again.”\n\nOne day later, he told reporters that he had been notified that Iran had stopped killing protestors and that there were no plans for further executions, providing no source for his claims.\n\nThe Iranian government responded to Trump’s threats with threats of their own, with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi saying, “We are not looking for war, but we are prepared for war.” He added, “We are also ready for negotiations, but negotiations that are fair, with equal rights and mutual respect.”\n\nThe country’s Guardian Council also condemned the “insult and baseless rhetoric of the criminal and foolish” of Trump, and stressed that any transgression against Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei “is considered crossing the red line of the devout people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and will entail heavy costs and serious consequences.”",

(WCIA) – Illinois men’s basketball will be without its best defender for multiple weeks, a challenge which looms largest in matchups which were already daunting – like Purdue, Nebraska and Michigan State.\n\nHowever, the Illini won’t have it easy in their first Boswell-less outing unless someone steps up to guard Maryland’s David Coit.\n\nCoit, the reigning Big Ten Player of the Week, is coming off a 43-point performance on Sunday as the Terrapins beat Penn State to pick up their first Big Ten win of the season. Last Tuesday, he scored 30 points. He posted 31 against Michigan and scored 41 in a non-conference game.\n\nIllinois head coach Brad Underwood says it will take a full team effort to slow down the Maryland senior.\n\n“[The] guy is on a heater,” Underwood said. “He’s veteran. He’s coming off a 43-point game, he had 30 in a half. He made nine [three-pointers.] He’s the ultimate green light. People have thrown a lot at him and he’s found ways to to get baskets and yet there’s more to Maryland than just him.”\n\nUnderwood says Maryland presents challenges in its ability to get to the free throw line, offensive rebounding and an ability to mix-up defensive looks.\n\nIllinois will put its seven-game winning streak on the line on Wednesday and seek to turn the tide on recent history between these two programs. Maryland has won 12 of the last 15 meetings dating back to 2016.\n\nMaryland enters Wednesday’s contest 8-10 overall on the year and 1-6 in conference play. The game is scheduled to tip-off at 6 p.m. on Big Ten Network.",

    "fullText": "A PGA Tour veteran has sent a jolt through the golf world with a candid take on LIV Golf’s ripple effect. While many criticize LIV Golf and the professionals who play in it, Tom Hoge doesn’t. The reason – the Saudi-backed league has helped him financially in a unique way.\n\n“Well, I would say personally speaking, I’m probably the player that’s benefited absolutely the most from LIV coming along. I played well in 2022 right before LIV got going, which brought an offer from LIV, so I went down that road for a little bit. But, sticking with the PGA Tour and the changes they made, I’ve played in every signature event since they were established. And I would say nobody’s benefited more financially than I have cuz I’ve played well in some of those events and been in all of them,” Tom Hoge revealed in conversation with Trey Wingo.\n\n“So, it’s been fantastic for me. So, I shouldn’t be the guy here, complaining about any of that coming along. But it is tough for the game of golf that there’s a lot of great players that are on LIV that we’re not competing with against every week like we were.”\n\nThe 36-year-old PGA Tour professional from Statesville, North Carolina, stated that LIV’s inception has brought him financial benefits. However, he is not the only one. Many professionals on the PGA Tour have benefited indirectly from LIV’s inception. As former CEO Greg Norman highlighted, the Saudi-backed league disrupted the market, which was essential to restoring balance.\n\nBefore LIV’s arrival, the prize pools for PGA Tour events weren’t that large. And there weren’t many additional benefits that athletes enjoy today. For instance, the PGA Tour started its for-profit entity and offered equity stakes to golfers. The standard prize pool on the PGA Tour was around $8-$9 million. Then came LIV Golf, offering $20-$25 million per event. This put pressure on the PGA Tour to pay golfers more.\n\nThus, the PGA Tour started elevating events in 2023, which officially became the Signature Events in 2024. These events feature higher prize money of around $20 million or more.\n\nSince Tom Hoge performed well in 2022, he has been eligible to play Signature Events until now. In 2025, too, he was eligible for and played all Signature Events. He posted strong results in many of them, including T8 at The Sentry ($550,000), T3 at THE PLAYERS Championship ($1,325,000), T5 at Valero Texas Open ($304,000), T14 at the Masters ($336,000), and T7 at the Memorial ($603,200). These finishes underscore his claim of major financial gains from post-LIV Tour upgrades.\n\nIn 2024, he also finished strongly at many events. Hoge received $642,500 at the 2024 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, $646,000 at the 2024 The Genesis Invitational, $389,666 at the 2024 Arnold Palmer Invitational, and $1,160,000 at the Travelers Championship. This shows that a large part of his official money came from the Signature events in both 2024 and 2025.\n\nWhile he enjoys the financial benefits, he also misses playing with some of the best golfers. Playing against strong competitors makes an athlete strong. Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau, Joaquin Niemann, and Patrick Reed are some of the many gold golfers playing LIV Golf. Their exclusion from PGA Tour events influences the field’s strength, which also impacts the OWGR points.\n\nAlthough Tom Hoge is happy with almost every change the PGA Tour has gone through after LIV’s inception, he dislikes one thing that may come from 2027.\n\nTiger Woods’s Future Competition Committee (FCC) planned for a redesigned schedule from 2027. The new schedule will likely feature fewer events and may start in February instead of January. Woods and the FCC aim to mitigate viewership competition from the NFL in January. CEO Brian Rolapp supports this view and the redesigned schedule. However, Tom Hoge doesn’t.\n\nHoge told Golf Channel the pre-LIV model worked well. It allowed players to pick events freely with equal stature throughout the season. He praised past flexibility where stars like Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson elevated chosen events without a rigid top-heavy structure. If the redesigned schedule reduces the number of events, it will take away this flexibility. Therefore, Hoge opposed a reduced schedule. Instead, he valued the ability to take a month off or play four straight weeks.\n\nTom Hoge’s comments highlight how LIV Golf’s arrival reshaped his financial outlook while also changing the competitive feel of the PGA Tour. As golf moves toward another possible shift, his perspective reflects both gratitude for new opportunities and concern for what may be lost.\n\nThe post Greg Norman Was Right All Along as PGA Tour Champ Owns Up to Benefiting from LIV Golf appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "Aryna Sabalenka and a near-flawless Coco Gauff surged into the Australian Open third round on Wednesday ahead of top-ranked Carlos Alcaraz resuming his quest for tennis history.\n\nThree-time finalist Daniil Medvedev also stayed alive, but he needed four sets to keep his Grand Slam dream on track at a cooler and overcast Melbourne Park after days of hot weather.\n\nFour-time major winner Sabalenka raced 5-0 clear of qualifier Bai Zhuoxuan, ranked a lowly 702, on Rod Laver Arena before wobbling to give the Chinese player a glimmer of hope.\n\nBut the top seed quickly snuffed it out to race home 6-3, 6-1 and set up a clash next with Russian-born Anastasia Potapova, now representing Austria, who dispatched 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu.\n\n\"Super-happy to close the (first) set, it gives me confidence that my game is there, my focus is there,\" said Sabalenka, who is bidding for a third Australian Open title in four years.\n\n\"Step by step. Super-happy with my win. There is always a little gap to improve.\"\n\nSabalenka has dropped just nine games so far as she looks to make amends for her upset in last year's final to Madison Keys.\n\nThird seed Gauff was equally clinical against Serbia's Olga Danilovic, who ended Venus Williams' tournament in round one.\n\nThe two-time major winner took just 78 minutes to get the job done, racing home 6-2, 6-2 on Margaret Court Arena.\n\nIt set up a showdown next against fellow American Hailey Baptiste, ranked 70, who downed home hope Storm Hunter in straight sets.\n\n\"Near perfect,\" said Gauff, whose best performance in Melbourne was a semi-final in 2024.\n\nUkrainian 12th seed Elina Svitolina, Turkish prospect Zeynep Sonmez and in-form Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko also won on day four, all sweeping past their opponents in straight sets.\n\nThe unpredictable Medvedev, runner-up in 2021, 2022 and 2024, is trying to keep his emotions in check this year and was on his best behaviour against Frenchman Quentin Halys.\n\nHe lost a tight first set but the result was never in doubt as he surged to the finish line 6-7 (9/11), 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.\n\n\"It was a very tough match, happy I managed to fight,\" said the Russian, who faces Fabian Marozsan of Hungary next.\n\nAmerican Tommy Paul and Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo also safely negotiated the second round.\n\nAlcaraz started his bid for a career Grand Slam with a three-set defeat of home hope Adam Walton and faces hard-hitting German Yannick Hanfmann later Wednesday.\n\nThe Spanish superstar Alcaraz already has six major titles aged 22 but success on the Melbourne Park hardcourts remains a glaring hole in his resume.\n\nHe has not made it past the quarter-finals in four trips to Australia.\n\nIf he does complete the career Grand Slam of all four majors he will be the youngest man to do it.\n\n\"I just really want to perform better than I did previous years,\" said Alcaraz.\n\nAlexander Zverev is in action in an evening match against France's Alexandre Muller, the latest challenge in the German's decade-long quest for a first Grand Slam title.\n\nThe world number three, runner-up last year to Jannik Sinner, dropped a set in his opening clash but said it was good to be stretched early in the tournament.\n\n\"It's a positive for sure,\" he said.\n\nHome hopes dominate the evening action on centre court with sixth seed Alex de Minaur facing Serbia's Hamad Medjedovic before Priscilla Hon meets American Iva Jovic.",

    "title": "The two Chelsea omens which excite Liam Rosenior ahead of Champions League bow",
    "description": "Mid-season changes have reaped glorious rewards for the Blues in previous years - could it happen again?",
    "fullText": "As befuddling as Chelsea’s parting with Enzo Maresca seemed when the statement arrived on New Year’s Day, there’s something about mid-season changes at Stamford Bridge which should give fans, and new boss Liam Rosenior, cause for dreamy enthusiasm.\n\nIn fact, the revolving door of the head coach hotseat, that unshakable new manager bounce, has given Chelsea their most glorious moments on the European stage. Five years ago, it was Thomas Tuchel who replaced Frank Lampard in January and, amid the silent hum of the Covid era, guided the Blues to an improbable second Champions League title in Porto.\n\nBefore that, it was 2012, when Roberto Di Matteo galvanised an ageing squad for a series of dramatic nights under the lights to, against all odds, capture that long-awaited first Champions League trophy. That year, the choice to replace Andre Villas-Boas didn’t come until February but the remarkable turnaround in mood, and obviously results, was unambiguous.\n\nOf course, there is some way to go before Chelsea fans can start plotting their route to Budapest in May. But the omens and the narrative are clear as day. And they are not lost on Rosenior, ahead of his debut in the competition on Wednesday night against Cypriot side Pafos.\n\n“Hopefully third time lucky!” he remarked, before the inevitable dose of reality. “You're not lucky to win a Champions League.\n\n“I've said to the players, if we focus on each game, not think too far ahead, perform as well as we possibly can, I never limit the ambitions of my group, no matter what group I'm working with.\n\n“But those games and those trophies don't exist if you don't do the job now. We have to focus on this game and hopefully another three points puts us closer to that target.”\n\nRosenior can take plenty of solace from not only Chelsea’s impressive home results in Europe this season – wins against Barcelona, Ajax and Benfica – but also his own impressive start to 2025-26 on the continent.\n\nAs Strasbourg boss, he guided the French side to top spot in the Europa Conference League table, winning five and drawing one of their six games; one of only two unbeaten teams in that competition. Yet now, focus is on the top-tier.\n\n“I think your dream is whether you're a player or a coach or a manager is to be at the very top of the game – the Champions League is a signal of that,” he noted.\n\n“It's not about me. It's not about me or my ambitions. I'm proud to be here, like I've said before. My focus is on winning the game. My focus is on being successful here. So, I'm preparing the game like we would for any game, to make sure we put in the best performance, to give us the best chance of winning the game.”\n\nRosenior’s men could be without star midfielder Enzo Fernandez, who has been struck down by illness. Tosin Adarabioyo is also out but Estevao, Malo Gusto and Jamie Gittens are back in contention.\n\nMuch was made when the schedule was concocted back in September of how the game against Pafos – who have performed admirably on their Champions League debut, with one win, three draws and two losses from their six games – would set the scene for a poignant return to west London for David Luiz, twice of this parish. Yet the 38-year-old Brazilian defender sustained an injury over the weekend and is a doubt for Wednesday’s game.\n\nLuiz was instrumental in 2012, scoring a penalty in the final shoot-out win against Bayern Munich. That mid-season change worked, but some have obviously failed: Frank Lampard’s caretaker spell in 2023 saw Chelsea knocked out to Real Madrid in the quarter-finals, while Guus Hiddink’s two temporary spells in 2009 and 2016 resulted in a semi-final (that Barcelona game) and last-16 exits.\n\nPhase one is clear, though. A win on Wednesday – and a positive result at Napoli next week – could see Chelsea through in the top-eight, without the added hassle of a February play-off match. For Rosenior, someone who’s made no secret of craving any minute on the practice pitch, it would be a massive early tick in his tenure.\n\n“It would be optimal,” he said of a top-eight finish. “It would be great. Especially when you're a new manager coming in, you want those training days so you can imprint a little bit more.\n\n“But we need to go out and perform really, really well and not think too much about how important it is to miss out on games. The most important thing is qualifying.”",

    "description": "The Lakers overcame a 16-point deficit to notch one of their most significant wins of the season, taking down the Nuggets.",
    "fullText": "The first time chants of “Let’s go, La-kers” rang out in Ball Arena, Denver’s rowdy home crowd booed the unwelcome slogan into silence. Minutes later when the game ended, there weren’t enough home fans left to quiet the purple and gold faithful.\n\nThe Lakers overcame a 16-point deficit in the third quarter to notch one of their most significant wins of the season, taking down the Denver Nuggets 115-107 on Tuesday. Luka Doncic recorded his fifth triple-double of the season with 38 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists while LeBron James had 19 points, nine rebounds and eight assists.\n\nDespite losing center Deandre Ayton to a left eye injury in the second quarter, the Lakers still dominated the shorthanded Nuggets in the paint, outrebounding Denver 51-31. The Nuggets were playing without star center Nikola Jokic (knee) and backup center Jonas Valanciunas (calf).\n\nThe Lakers (26-16) slowly are returning to full health as guard Austin Reaves’ calf injury is “progressing well,” coach JJ Redick said before the game, and they Lakrs hope he could play on the eight-game trip that will stretch until Feb. 3. Reaves is approaching the four-week point after aggravating his calf injury on Christmas Day.\n\nFor the first time since the injury, Reaves went on a trip with the team. He blended seamlessly into the bench group, wearing head-to-toe black next to the coaches.\n\nOn the other bench, Denver’s injured superstar was dressed in a forest green suit. Jokic, the Nuggets' two-time most valuable player, has been sidelined because of a knee injury since Dec. 30. As significant as the Lakers’ injuries have been with the team having all 14 of its standard contract players available for only two games this season, the Nuggets’ problems could be even worse.\n\nThree members of the Nuggets’ season-opening starting rotation were sidelined Tuesday. Starting guard Christian Braun has been out since injuring an ankle Nov. 12 and Cameron Johnson has missed 15 games because of a knee injury. Valanciunas, who has missed the last 11 games, sat next to Jokic.\n\nDenver (29-15) still had no problem controlling the first half, finishing the second quarter on a 14-3 run to claim a 14-point lead. Jamal Murray drained a three-pointer from almost three-quarters court at the buzzer to punctuate a chaotic final 35 seconds that included Doncic’s 13th technical foul of the season and an 8-0 run for the Nuggets.\n\nMurray, who finished with 28 points and 11 assists, is angling for his first All-Star appearance. If coaches select the 28-year-old guard as a reserve, it would be the first time in Jokic’s career that he had a teammate named to the All-Star team.\n\nDoncic, who was named a starter for next month’s midseason showcase Monday, showed why he led the league in fan voting. He had nine points and four assists in the third quarter as the Lakers trimmed a 16-point deficit to two entering the fourth quarter. Doncic scored or assisted on 11 unanswered Lakers points.\n\nAfter Doncic’s third-quarter domination, James tagged in and scored five consecutive points to end the quarter. He assisted on a basket by Drew Timme on the Lakers’ opening possession of the fourth quarter that tied the score 88-88.\n\nThe Lakers took the lead for good with a 16-0 run, holding the Nuggets scoreless for more than 6½ minutes. Marcus Smart scored 11 of his 15 points during the run, while Denver missed nine consecutive shots.\n\nWhile Doncic will return to the All-Star stage next month at Intuit Dome, James was not named a starter for the first time in 21 years. He will have to wait for a vote from coaches or a special selection from NBA commissioner Adam Silver to earn his 22nd All-Star honor.\n\n“Given the missed games early, wasn't surprised,” Redick said, referring to James missing the first 14 games because of sciatica. “I believe he'll be in the All-Star game.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO — Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga finally was called off the bench and into action during a 145-127 loss to the Toronto Raptors at Chase Center on Tuesday night.\n\nOn the second night of a back-to-back — with the Warriors now having to go forward without Jimmy Butler, who suffered a season-ending ACL tear Monday night — head coach Steve Kerr said he would look more toward his bench depth, including Kuminga who hadn't played in 16 games due to a coach's decision.\n\nKuminga received a roar from the Chase Center crowd when he subbed into the game to start the second quarter of the contest.\n\nHe finished with 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting in 21 minutes. He added five rebounds and two assists. Teammate Buddy Hield led the team in scoring with 25 points off then bench, including a perfect 6-of-6 from deep, in 19 minutes of play.\n\nThe Warriors were down 41-28 after the first quarter before Kuminga was subbed into the game to start the second period.\n\nIn his first stint, a little under five minutes, Kuminga missed his only shot attempt: An alley-oop tip-in on a pass from Draymond Green. He was fouled but missed both free throws. He managed to grab two rebounds in his limited action.\n\nHis plus/minus was a minus-10 in four minutes and 39 seconds of playing time.\n\nGolden State is looking for a spark from their bench depth after Butler was lost for the season with a torn ACL.\n\nKerr said the Warriors' win over the Miami Heat that Kuminga could see the floor following Butler's devastating injury.\n\n\"Sure, absolutely,\" Kerr said responding to a question about Kuminga playing against Toronto.\n\nWarriors trailed 91-63 when Kuminga returned to the game at the 6:12 mark of the third quarter.\n\nHe scored 12 points in the period, throwing down a ferocious two-handed slam off an alley-oop pass from Green, a couple of mid-range shots through contact and going the length of the court to make a buzzer-beating layup to end the third.\n\nGolden State trailed 108-94 at the end of three quarters. Kuminga played the remainder of the quarter since subbing in at the 6:12 mark and was a plus-4 after the period.\n\nKuminga played the entire fourth quarter as his play continued to help the Warriors to cut into that huge double-digit deficit. It was cut to as low as 11 points.\n\nHowever, the Raptors ran the score back up late and held on to win the game.\n\nHere are Kuminga's average statistics so far though the 2025-26 regular season, prior to Tuesday's game against the Raptors:\n\nThese are Kuminga's career averages through five seasons in the NBA, prior to Tuesday's game against the Raptors:\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Jonathan Kuminga returns to court in Warriors' loss to Raptors",

    "description": "Could the Miami Dolphins replace Tua Tagovailoa with Malik Willis this offseason?",
    "fullText": "The Miami Dolphins officially have a new general manager and head coach for the first time in over a decade. Now, with the new era set to begin, the duo must find a way to improve a position that has plagued the Dolphins since the day Dan Marino retired.\n\nTua Tagovailoa showed flashes, but his day as the Dolphins’ starting quarterback is over, with reports surfacing that the team was ready to move on and find someone else to lead the new era of Miami football.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s NFL Insider, Jeremy Fowler, that player could be someone both Jon-Eric Sullivan and Jeff Hafley have familiarity with from the last few years in Green Bay.\n\nA player who just so happens to be a free agent this season.\n\n-Lamar Jackson to the Raiders\n-A.J. Brown to the Bills\n-Malik Willis to Dolphins or Browns\n-Kyler or Geno to New York\n\nExecs/scouts/coaches make bold predictions on 2026 offseasonhttps://t.co/vrn0rBuPCN\n\n— Jeremy Fowler (@JFowlerESPN) January 20, 2026\n\nIn a recent ESPN article breaking down some of the off-season’s most probable trades and signings, Fowler suggests that Sullivan and Hafley could bring in a quarterback whom they saw first-hand take over when Jordan Love went down. And to be quite honest, he played some pretty damn good football.\n\nSo much so that it won’t be just the Dolphins jockeying for his services. As Fowler writes, if Daniel Jones returns to Indianapolis, there’s a very good chance that Willis could be the top quarterback on the market. (He probably still is even if Jones does hit the open market, but that’s a conversation for another day)\n\nAnother team that league executives believe could be interested in Willis is the Cleveland Browns.\n\n“I just don’t think [the Browns] go into the season with Shedeur [Sanders] as their top option,” an NFC personnel man said. “And getting the right quarterback in the draft isn’t a guarantee based on where they pick.”\n\nCleveland has two first-round picks, but with Oregon’s Dante Moore returning to school and other key factors, Willis could be their best bet for adding legit competition to a room that has Shedeur Sanders and Dillion Gabriel currently battling for the QB1 spot.\n\nBut as Fowler says, Miami will have a better beat on Willis and his potential over any other team.\n\n“No regime will know Willis’ strengths better than Miami, which just hired a brain trust of GM Jon-Eric Sullivan and head coach Jeff Hafley from Green Bay. The Packers valued Willis’ development and Miami could bear the fruits of that labor.”\n\nI know this is giving some of us older folks a bit of ‘déjà vu’ as it feels eerily similar to the days of Joe Philbin and everyone wanting Matt Flynn, because we were QB-starved and unquestioningly believed things might be different.\n\nBut Willis has legit tools (I’ll do a breakdown in the coming weeks) and could be the perfect QB to help usher in this new era of Dolphins football, while allowing Sullivan and Hafley to find the future in the 2027 or 2028 draft class.\n\nMalik Willis pic.twitter.com/iV0XCHJNZl\n\n— Ian Hartitz (@Ihartitz) January 14, 2026\n\nLast season in Green Bay, Willis completed 85.7 % of his passes for 422 yards and 3 touchdowns in four appearances (1 start). In total, the former third-round pick of the 2022 NFL Draft (86th overall) has started six games, finishing with a 3-3 record.\n\nThe cap situation is bleak, and the Dolphins have to find a suitor for Tua. But if Brandon Shore and Sullivan can find a way to make it work, I think Miami fans would be delighted to have a player like Malik Willis behind center.\n\nThen again, all of this sounds too good to be true.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the Miami Dolphins signing free agent quarterback Malik Willis this offseason? Do you think he’d be the perfect fit for this next era of Dolphins football? How do you feel saying goodbye to Tua Tagovailoa after what appeared to be a promising start to the McDaniel era? Are you happy with the head coach/GM duo Miami now has? Let us know in the comments section below!",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kevin Fiala had a goal and an assist, and Anton Forsberg made 28 saves after taking over for the injured Darcy Kuemper in the Los Angeles Kings’ 4-3 victory over the slumping New York Rangers on Tuesday night.\n\nAdrian Kempe, Taylor Ward and Andrei Kuzmenko also scored for the Kings, who snapped a four-game skid with only their second regulation victory in January.\n\nKuemper allowed two goals on eight shots before abruptly leaving with 38 seconds left in the first period following a collision in the crease with a charging Jonny Brodzinski.\n\nForsberg played superbly after taking over for Kuemper, a member of Canada’s Olympic roster. Kuemper also missed 2 1/2 weeks last month after taking a hit to the head during a loss at Dallas.\n\nJ.T. Miller scored two goals for the Rangers, who are last in the Eastern Conference after losing seven of eight.\n\nJonathan Quick made 23 saves in his third start and fourth appearance against the Kings, who drafted him in 2005. Quick, who turns 40 years old on Wednesday, won 370 games — 199 more than any other Kings goalie — while backstopping the club to two Stanley Cup championships during his 16 seasons in LA.\n\nKempe scored 18 seconds after the opening faceoff.\n\nOnly 42 seconds after Will Cuylle’s goal for New York, Fiala scored his 18th goal by intercepting an unwise pass by former Kings teammate Vladislav Gavrikov.\n\nMiller evened it again late in the first off Mika Zibanejad’s pass.\n\nWard put the Kings back ahead early in the second, banking in a skittering shot off Quick’s far post for his first goal of the season. After Los Angeles killed a five-on-three disadvantage for 96 seconds, Kuzmenko backhanded home a rebound of Fiala’s shot.\n\nMiller scored his 13th goal in the final seconds with Quick pulled for an extra attacker.\n\nRangers: At San Jose on Friday.\n\nKings: At St. Louis on Saturday to open a six-game road trip.",

The German head coach will also be without Lamine Yamal, who is suspended for tonight’s clash.\n\nHowever, Raphinha’s timely return offers some reprieve, particularly after the Brazilian forward missed the defeat to Sociedad.\n\nWith Torres sidelined, Barcelona will turn to Lewandowski to lead the line, although the Polish striker’s long-term future at the club has been called into question.\n\nMarcus Rashford will also be hoping to help Barcelona skip past Slavia Prague by adding to his four-goal tally in the Champions League.",

    "fullText": "Fulham have opened talks to sign Manchester City winger Oscar Bobb, according to Fabrizio Romano.\n\nThe Cottagers are exploring the possibility of bringing the 22-year-old talent to Craven Cottage as they look to bolster their attacking options, particularly with Adama Traore linked with an exit.\n\nFulham have enjoyed a decent campaign so far, with Marco Silva forced to work with what’s available.\n\nThe Portuguese tactician has done a brilliant job so far. Despite sitting 11th in the Premier League table, Fulham are just five points off fourth-placed Liverpool.\n\nSecuring Champions League football might be a step too far, but the Cottagers have a serious chance of qualifying for Europe this season.\n\nSilva is keen to make sure his squad is in the best possible position to push for a top-seven finish, and the board has decided to back him this January.\n\nFulham are hoping to make Bobb their first winter addition and have even tabled a £35 million bid for the highly rated forward.\n\nThe Norwegian winger has struggled to establish himself in the Man City first team squad since coming up through the club’s revered academy.\n\nInjuries have also impacted his development, with Bobb managing just 47 appearances for the senior team. However, that hasn’t stopped Fulham from exploring a deal.\n\nSilva already has experience with rejuvenating players who flopped in previous clubs.\n\nHe has transformed the likes of Raul Jimenez and Emile Smith Rowe, and Bobb could be the latest to thrive under his leadership at Craven Cottage.\n\nBobb has made 15 appearances for Man City this season. Nine have come in the Premier League, but he has only been named in the starting XI five times.\n\nWith Antoine Semenyo coming in, the Norwegian’s battle for first-team minutes only gets more complicated.\n\nSemenyo can play on either side of the frontline, and his arrival pushes Bobb further down the pecking order. Man City are also willing to sanction a permanent move for Bobb.\n\nFulham want to add more creativity and pace to their squad to reduce the burden on Smith Rowe and Harry Wilson. Bobb checks that box, and a change of scenery could do him the world of good.",

    "title": "Token Issuer Metadata: A Proposal for Config-as-Code SSO",
    "description": "A CIMD extension for passive token validation that eliminates manual SSO configuration",
    "fullText": "This is a thought experiment: what if embedded services could just be plopped in your frontend with zero configuration while still being secure? This isn’t something I plan to implement, but I thought it was interesting and worth sharing.\nWhat if embedded services never needed manual SSO configuration? No dashboard. No shared secrets. Customers host a metadata file declaring their identity provider, and any service that implements the spec can validate their users’ tokens automatically.\nThis document explains the problem, proposes a solution, and sketches a specification.\n\n​Part 1: Why Self-Hosted Bootstrap Matters\n​What Char Does Today\nChar validates tokens from your identity provider. It doesn’t initiate authentication. It receives tokens your app already obtained and verifies them using public keys.\nThis is different from “Login with Google” flows. When Slack implements Google login, Slack acts as an OAuth Client. Slack needs its own Client ID registered with Google. Every vendor needs their own registration.\nChar acts as a Passive Validator. We don’t initiate auth. We don’t need our own Client ID with your IDP. We validate tokens that were already issued to your app: the tokens your users already have.\n\nThe question Char needs answered: which IDP issued this token? Once we know that, validation is standard OIDC: fetch the IDP’s public keys, verify the signature, check the issuer and audience claims.\n​Manual Configuration Today\nYou tell us which IDP to validate against by configuring it in our dashboard:\n\nLog into Char dashboard\nNavigate to Settings → Integration\nSelect your IDP type (Okta, Google, Auth0…)\nCopy your Client ID from your IDP\nPaste it into our form\nCopy your IDP domain\nPaste it into our form\nAdd your application’s domain to our allowlist\nClick Save\n\nThis works. But it’s friction. Every form field is a potential mistake. Every context-switch between your IDP console and our dashboard is a chance to abandon the integration entirely.\nThe deeper problem: this configuration is redundant. You already know your IDP configuration (it’s in your IDP). You already control your domain (that’s where you’re embedding the agent). We’re asking you to re-state facts that already exist elsewhere, in a format we invented, in a system you have to learn.\n\nThe dashboard step disappears. Configuration moves from our system to yours.\n​Declarative Configuration\nWhat if you declared your IDP configuration in a file you control? You host a JSON document at a well-known URL. When a request arrives from your domain, we fetch the file, learn which IDP to validate against, and proceed.\nNo dashboard. No copy-paste. The configuration lives in your infrastructure, under your version control.\nThis isn’t a new idea. Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD) emerged from a similar frustration in the OAuth world. The MCP ecosystem faced a scaling problem: AI clients connecting to thousands of servers, each requiring registration. CIMD inverts the model. Instead of clients registering with servers, clients publish their own metadata at a URL they control. The URL is the identity. Domain ownership becomes the trust anchor.\nThe MCP spec adopted CIMD in November 2025. Auth0, Stytch, WorkOS, and others have published guidance and product support for CIMD in the MCP context (availability varies by provider).\nThis isn’t OIDC Federation. OIDC Federation solves a different problem: “Should this IDP issue tokens to an unknown Relying Party?” That requires trust chains, signed Entity Statements, and complex machinery, because the IDP is making a consequential decision.We’re solving a narrower problem: “Which IDP should I validate this token against?” We don’t ask the IDP for permission. We just fetch its public keys (which are public) and verify signatures. Domain ownership is sufficient trust for that question.\n​CIMD Extension\nExtend CIMD with IDP configuration. A customer hosts a file at /.well-known/oauth-client that includes:\n<code language=\"json\" numberOfLines=\"9\"><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">{</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"client_id\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: </span><span style=\"color:#0A3069;--shiki-dark:#CE9178\">\"https://crm.acme.com/.well-known/oauth-client\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"client_name\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: </span><span style=\"color:#0A3069;--shiki-dark:#CE9178\">\"Acme CRM\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"token_issuer\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"issuer\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: </span><span style=\"color:#0A3069;--shiki-dark:#CE9178\">\"https://acme.okta.com/oauth2/default\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#116329;--shiki-dark:#9CDCFE\"> \"expected_audience\"</span><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">: </span><span style=\"color:#0A3069;--shiki-dark:#CE9178\">\"0oa...\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\"> }</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#1F2328;--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4\">}</span></span>\n</code>\nWhen Char receives a request from crm.acme.com, we fetch this file, learn that tokens should be validated against the declared issuer with that expected audience, and proceed. The customer declared their truth in a file they control. We read it. No dashboard required.\nThis isn’t just about reducing clicks. It’s about putting configuration where it belongs: with the customer, in their infrastructure, under their version control.\n​The Trust Model\nThe elegance of this approach is that it doesn’t require new trust mechanisms. It composes existing ones:\nDomain ownership is already how the web establishes identity. If you can host files at crm.acme.com, you control that domain. HTTPS and DNS provide that guarantee. CIMD simply uses it.\nIDP tokens are already how enterprises establish user identity. The customer’s IDP signs tokens with keys only it possesses. We validate signatures against published public keys. This is federated authentication, and we already do it.\nAudience claims already prevent token confusion. A token for one application can’t be used for another. We already validate this.\nCIMD-based discovery just connects these existing mechanisms. The customer’s domain proves they’re legitimate. Their CIMD declares their IDP. Their IDP’s tokens prove user identity. No new cryptography. No new trust assumptions. Just composition.\n​What This Enables\nInstant trials. Embed the agent, host a CIMD, it works. No account required. Conversion happens when customers hit limits, not before they’ve seen why the product matters.\nConfiguration-as-code. The CIMD is a file in the repository. It goes through code review. It deploys through CI/CD. Staging and production differ by environment, not by dashboard.\nSelf-service onboarding. If you can host a valid CIMD, you’re onboarded. No waiting for us to approve anything.\nSingle source of truth. Configuration lives in one place: yours. We don’t have a stale copy that disagrees with your IDP.\n​Broader Applicability\nThis pattern isn’t specific to Char. Any embedded SaaS that needs to verify user identity faces the same problem.\nToday, services like Intercom and Zendesk use HMAC shared secrets: the customer generates a secret, passes user data server-side, and the service validates the signature. This works, but it requires server-side integration and secret management. Every vendor has their own approach.\nToken Issuer Metadata eliminates this. If your app already authenticates users via OIDC (most do), you’re already issuing tokens. Third-party services embedded in your app can validate those tokens directly. One CIMD file, hosted once, works for any service that implements the spec.\nThe network effect: once a customer hosts a CIMD with token_issuer, every third-party validator benefits. The first vendor to push adoption creates value for the whole ecosystem.\n​The Tradeoffs\nThis model has genuine limitations worth acknowledging:\nGitOps vs. ClickOps. This model shifts configuration from “ClickOps” (admins pasting values into dashboards) to “GitOps” (engineers committing config to code). For engineering-led organizations, this is a feature: version control, code review, reproducible environments. For non-technical teams who can’t easily host a JSON file, it’s a barrier. The hybrid approach (supporting both CIMD and dashboard) bridges this gap.\nNo pre-flight validation. With dashboard configuration, customers can click “Test Connection” before users arrive. With CIMD discovery, the first real user is the test. Errors surface in production. A char cimd validate CLI tool or web-based validator could help customers catch errors before deploying.\nBootstrap, not runtime. CIMD fetch happens once, when we first see requests from a new origin. After that, the configuration lives in our infrastructure. This means CIMD availability isn’t a runtime concern: if your app loads, we can reach your CIMD. (Char is embedded in your page. If your CDN is down, the page doesn’t load, and we never receive a request.) What does matter is config drift. If you rotate your Okta client ID but forget to update the CIMD file, tokens will fail validation.\nDomain compromise scope. If an attacker gains control of a customer’s domain, they can modify the CIMD. This is true of any domain-based trust model (it’s the same threat model as HTTPS itself), but worth noting explicitly.\nStandardization. The token_issuer extension doesn’t exist as a standard yet.

While CIMD itself is an IETF draft with growing adoption, there is no standard for declaring IDP configuration inside a client metadata document. This proposal suggests one. Char is an early implementer, but the pattern is designed to be vendor-neutral and adoptable by any service that validates tokens passively.\n​Token Issuer Fields\nFieldRequiredDescriptionissuerYesFull issuer URL.

this email becomes the organization owner.\n​Discovery Flow\n\n​Auto-Provisioning Behavior\nWhen Char receives a request from an unknown origin with a valid-looking token:\nDiscovery: Fetch {origin}/.well-known/oauth-client. If not found or invalid, reject the request (fall back to requiring dashboard configuration).\nValidation: Parse the token_issuer extension. Validate the token against the declared IDP: fetch JWKS, verify signature, check issuer and audience claims.\nProvisioning: If validation succeeds, create an organization record with:\n\nThe origin as the primary allowed domain\nIDP configuration from the CIMD\nFree tier defaults\nThe authenticated user as the first end-user\n\nPersistence: The organization record lives in Char’s infrastructure (Durable Objects). Subsequent requests validate against the stored config. We don’t re-fetch CIMD on every auth. CIMD is the bootstrap mechanism, not a runtime dependency. Periodic re-fetching could detect config changes, but token validation doesn’t depend on it.\n​Dashboard Access Flow\nFor customers to access the dashboard after auto-provisioning:\n\nMatching logic:\n\nFor Google: match by hd (hosted domain) claim\nFor Okta/Auth0: match by issuer URL\nFor Azure: match by tid (tenant ID) claim\nFallback: match by email domain\n\n​Security Considerations\n​Core Validations\nCIMD URL validation: The client_id field in the CIMD must exactly match the URL it was fetched from. This prevents an attacker from hosting a CIMD that claims to be a different domain.\nHTTPS required: CIMD must be served over HTTPS. HTTP URLs are rejected.\nIssuer validation: The token’s iss claim must match the expected issuer for the declared IDP type. A CIMD declaring type: google cannot be used to validate tokens from Okta.\nAudience validation: The token’s aud claim must match the expected_audience declared in the CIMD. This prevents tokens intended for other applications from being accepted.\nOrigin binding (preventing token replay): A natural concern: “If you accept tokens meant for other apps, can’t I steal a token from App A and use it on App B?” No, because the CIMD is fetched from the request’s origin:\n\nAttacker steals token from app-a.com (where aud: \"client-id-A\")\nAttacker sends token to Char from app-b.com\nChar fetches CIMD from app-b.com\nCIMD declares expected_audience: \"client-id-B\"\nToken’s aud doesn’t match → Rejected\n\nThe token is bound to the origin that declares it. A token valid for one domain cannot be used from another domain, even if both use the same IDP.\nOn Origin headers: Origin can be spoofed by non-browser clients. Origin binding is a routing hint, not a cryptographic proof. The actual security boundary is audience validation: the token’s aud claim must match the CIMD’s declared expected_audience. If an attacker could forge a valid token with the correct audience, they wouldn’t need to spoof Origin in the first place.\n​SSRF Hardening (Normative)\nFetching customer-hosted metadata creates SSRF risk. Implementations MUST:\n\nReject non-HTTPS URLs. No http://, file://, or other schemes.\nBlock private/loopback addresses. Resolve DNS before connecting and reject private ranges (10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x, 127.x, ::1, link-local). Re-check after any redirects.\nCap response size. 5 KB maximum for metadata documents.\nUse aggressive timeouts. 5 seconds connect, 10 seconds total.\nRate limit per origin. Prevent abuse from repeated fetch attempts.\n\n​Domain Compromise Scope\nA natural concern: “What if an attacker gains control of a customer’s domain?” The blast radius is more contained than it might appear.\nEven with full domain control, an attacker must still present tokens from a valid IDP. They could modify the CIMD to point to an IDP they control, but tokens from that IDP would only grant access to the organization associated with that domain. They cannot use a compromised domain to attack other organizations. Each org is isolated by its origin.\nThe attacker is essentially attacking themselves. They control the domain, they control the CIMD, they control the IDP, and they get access to… an organization scoped to their own domain. This is the same trust model as HTTPS itself: domain ownership is the root of trust.\n​Token Lifecycle as Defense\nThe short-lived nature of OAuth tokens provides defense-in-depth:\n\nID tokens expire quickly. Best practice is 5-60 minutes. Even if a CIMD is compromised, existing user sessions expire naturally within this window.\n\nRefresh tokens rotate. Modern IDPs issue new refresh tokens with each use. A stolen refresh token becomes invalid after one use. Many IDPs also detect reuse and revoke the entire token family.\n\nCIMD changes invalidate sessions. If a domain changes hands and the new owner modifies the CIMD, existing tokens fail validation immediately. The issuer or audience no longer matches. There’s no persistent access that survives a CIMD change.\n\nThe attack window is bounded by token lifetime, not by how long it takes someone to notice the compromise.\n​Edge Cases Worth Noting\nSubdomain takeover: If a customer has dangling DNS records pointing to decommissioned services (e.g., old Heroku or S3 deployments), an attacker could claim that subdomain and host a malicious CIMD. This is a real attack vector, but it’s a general web security issue, not specific to CIMD. The mitigation is the same: customers should audit their DNS records and remove dangling entries.\nDomain expiration: If a customer’s domain expires and someone else registers it, the new owner could claim the auto-provisioned organization. This is concerning for abandoned deployments. Mitigation options include:\n\nPeriodic re-validation of domain ownership\nAlerting on CIMD changes (especially IDP changes)\nRequiring explicit confirmation for significant configuration changes\n\nFirst-user-as-admin race: If using admin_contact with an email, an attacker who knows that email and can obtain a valid token for it could beat the legitimate admin to claiming the org. This is a narrow window (only during initial provisioning) and requires the attacker to have legitimate IDP access. Low risk, but worth documenting.\n​What We’re Trusting\nTo summarize the trust model:\nWe TrustBecauseDomain ownership proves legitimacyHTTPS + DNS (same as all web security)CIMD content is authoritativeOnly the domain owner can host itIDP tokens prove user identityCryptographic signatures we verifyToken audience prevents confusionStandard OIDC claim validationShort token lifetimes limit exposureIndustry best practice, IDP-enforced\nThis isn’t a novel trust model. It’s composition of existing, battle-tested mechanisms.\n\n​Relationship to OpenID Connect\nThis proposal occupies similar territory to existing OIDC specs, but it’s solving a narrower problem, which is why it can be simpler.\n​What OIDC Federation Solves\nOpenID Connect Federation 1.0 addresses a broad challenge: how can an Identity Provider accept authentication requests from Relying Parties it has never seen before?\nThe answer is sophisticated. Trust anchors issue signed statements about entities. Intermediate authorities form chains. RPs publish Entity Statements (signed JWTs) containing their metadata. When an RP initiates auth, the IDP walks the trust chain, validates signatures, applies federation policies, and decides whether to proceed.\nThis machinery exists because OIDC Federation enables the full authentication flow: authorization requests, token issuance, consent, scopes. The IDP is actively participating. It needs strong guarantees before issuing tokens to an unknown party.\n\n​What We’re Actually Solving\nOur problem is narrower: how can a third party know which IDP to validate tokens against, without pre-registration?\nWe’re not participating in the auth flow. The customer’s IDP already issued the token. The user already authenticated. We just need to validate what we received. We’re asking a simpler question: “which IDP does this domain use?”\n\nThe IDP doesn’t know we exist. We don’t ask it for permission. We just fetch its public keys (which are public) and verify signatures. This is standard OIDC token validation. The only question is which IDP to validate against.\n​Why Our Approach Is Simpler\nThe simplicity isn’t a shortcut. It’s appropriate for the scope:\nOIDC FederationThis ProposalQuestion answered”Should I issue tokens to this RP?\"\"Which IDP issued this token?”Who’s decidingThe IDP (active participant)Us (passive validator)What happens nextFull auth flow, token issuanceToken validation onlyTrust requirementsIDP must trust RP before issuing tokensWe just need to know which IDP to checkFailure modeAuth blockedValidation fails, user re-authenticates\nOIDC Federation needs signed statements and trust chains because the IDP is making a consequential decision: issuing tokens that grant access. Getting that wrong has security implications.\nWe’re making a simpler decision: validating tokens that were already issued. If we get it wrong, the token fails validation. The user re-authenticates. There’s no token leakage, no unauthorized access, just a failed validation.\n​What We Build On\nTo be precise about lineage:\nWe build on CIMD. The core pattern (publish metadata at your domain, domain ownership = trust) comes directly from OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents. We’re extending CIMD with IDP configuration fields.\nWe use OIDC. Token validation is standard OIDC. We fetch the IDP’s JWKS via /.well-known/openid-configuration, verify signatures, check issuer and audience claims. Nothing novel here.\nWe occupy similar space as OIDC Federation. Both enable dynamic discovery without pre-registration. But we’re not building on Federation’s trust chain model because we don’t need it.\n​Summary\nOIDC Federation is the right tool when IDPs need to trust unknown RPs before issuing tokens.\nFor token validation by third parties, that machinery is overkill. Domain ownership is sufficient trust. The token itself carries cryptographic proof of the IDP’s involvement. We’re not asking the IDP to do anything, just reading its public keys.\nThis proposal achieves dashboard-free SSO bootstrap for embedded agents by recognizing that token validation is a narrower problem than token issuance.\n\n​Current Status\nThis is exploratory work. CIMD itself is an IETF draft with growing adoption, but the token_issuer extension described here doesn’t exist as a standard.\nI’m not actively building this, just documenting an idea that seemed worth sharing. If it resonates, or if you see problems with the approach, I’d be curious to hear.\n​Further Reading\nFederated AuthenticationHow Char validates tokens from your IDPIdentity ProvidersCurrent (dashboard-based) IDP configuration\n​References\n\nOAuth Client ID Metadata Document (IETF OAuth WG Draft)\nMCP Authorization Specification\nWorkOS: CIMD in MCP\nAuth0: CIMD is the Future of MCP",

    "description": "In a client-server world, identity and authority are anchored in a server that logs people in and enforces\npermissions. When you take the server away, though, it might seem like there’s no solid foundation for\nauthentication or authorization. Is there a principled way to establish trust in a distributed application?",
    "fullText": "When I first started thinking about authentication and authorization in a local-first context I\nfound it super weird and confusing, like I’d stepped through the looking-glass. I found myself\nwrestling with big philosophical questions like “where does authority ultimately come from?” and\n“what does it mean to know someone?“.\n\nI’m going to walk you through my journey, from that initial disorientation to what I believe are\nsolid, principled approaches, in the course of developing the @localfirst/auth library.\n\nIt might not be obvious why this might be disorienting, so I’ll explain.\n\nWithout a server, it’s not clear where authority or identity come from.\n\nTraditional authentication and authorization ultimately “root out” in a physical piece of hardware,\nowned and controlled by a company that you’ve decided to trust. The hardware is a server that has\nyour username and password and rules about what you’re allowed to do. It might be controlled by your\nemployer, or a SaaS provider, or a big tech company.\n\nThe server is like a guard at the castle gates. If the server doesn’t recognize you, it doesn’t let\nyou in. If the server doesn’t think you should be allowed to have something, it doesn’t give it to\nyou.\n\nOf course, the whole point of local-first software is that we don’t love that arrangement.\n\nBut when you take away that central server, you’re losing the thing that all our notions of security\nare anchored to.\n\nIf all you have is clients, who are peers — which means they relate to each other as equals — then\nhow do we know who is who? How do we know who to trust? What do permissions even mean — who exactly\nis “giving permission”?\n\n“Bootstrapping” has become a word that we associate with something as easy and routine as turning\nyour computer on. But the whole point of bootstrapping as a metaphor is that it’s supposed to be\nimpossible: You can’t lift yourself up by pulling on your bootstraps.\n\nIt’s like living in a monarchy and realizing that the king is just another person, and not someone\nappointed by the gods. Just like countries making that transition from monarchy to democracy, we’re\nsuddenly adrift, and have to come up with completely new arrangements to solve problems that were\nalready solved — even if in a suboptimal way.\n\nWithout a server, it feels like we’re having to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps on some\nfundamental questions:\n\nIn 2020, a couple of weeks into the pandemic, I started work on a library that became\nlocalfirst/auth.\n\nI had to learn about modern cryptography starting from zero.\n\nI was immediately fascinated by how empowering public-key cryptography is, in the sense that it\ncan put me on an equal footing with even very powerful adversaries.\n\nThe movies would lead you to believe that defeating encryption is something a dude in a hoodie can\ndo just by typing really hard.\n\nBut in the real world strong cryptography can’t be defeated.* It just\ncan’t.**\n\nHere is legendary cryptologist and mathematician Daniel J. Bernstein writing over a decade\nago:\n\nFor most cryptographic operations, there exist widely accepted primitives that have been\nextensively studied, and breaking them is considered computationally infeasible on any existing\ncomputer cluster.\n\nThe point is you don’t need a lot of money, or computing power, or specialized equipment. Strong\nencryption doesn’t cost any more than weak encryption. It doesn’t cost any more to use a long\nencryption key than a short one. It’s just math. It’s just code.\n\nSo anyway I’m sitting down to work on this, and the first thing that makes my head spin is, how do\nyou know you’re talking to?\n\nWhen we collaborate or communicate online using a traditional cloud-based platform, we can think of\nthe service provider as vouching for us — introducing us to other people and confirming our\nidentity.\n\nIf I’m using Slack to talk to you, you know it’s me because Slack says it’s me, and you trust Slack.\nAnd maybe Slack knows it’s me because I logged in with Google: Google vouched for me, and Slack\ntrusts Google.\n\nIf we don’t want to put our trust in a centralized third party, then who will vouch us?\n\nIn a system where everyone’s a peer, then maybe peers could vouch for peers, in some kind of chain\nof trust.\n\nBut that chain has to be anchored somewhere: Maybe Charlie vouches for Bob to Alice, but who vouches\nfor Charlie?\n\nIgnoring the infinite regress problem for the moment, it seems clear that the solution will be\nsomething something public-key cryptography. But to do public-key cryptography, you need to know\npeople’s public keys.\n\n”Crypto is a tool for turning a whole swathe of problems into key management problems. Key\nmanagement problems are way harder than virtually all cryptographers think.”\n\n— Dr. Lea Kissner\n\nDr. Kissner was the head of information security at Twitter and I don’t think they meant the above\ntweet to be encouraging.\n\nBut I do find it encouraging. Even granting that key management is a hard problem, the idea that you\ncan collapse lots of different problems into this one problem is exciting, because you just have to\nfocus on solving that thing. If you can succeed at the key management thing — it’s is a big if — but\nif you can, then you can solve this “whole swathe of problems.”\n\nSo how do we learn people’s public keys?\n\nHere in Spain, I can obtain a certificate from the treasury department to install in my browser,\nwhich allows me to transparently authenticate to government websites and sign official documents\ndigitally.\n\nThe most obvious solution is to have some trusted party keep a directory of people and their public\nkeys, and of course that’s totally a thing that exists.\n\nThe certificate authorities (CAs) that make secure https connections possible are an example. Some\nbig companies have their own certificate authorities to anchor their employees’ digital identities.\nAnd countries can do the same for residents.\n\nThis is what my public PGP\nkey looks\nlike.\n\nBut we’re trying to do this without depending on centralized services.\n\nIf you want a decentralized solution, the alternative seems to be for people to actively share their\nown keys directly with each other.\n\nThis was the approach taken by PGP (“Pretty Good Privacy”) in the 1990s.\n\nPGP was the first encryption toolset intended for ordinary users. The idea was that people would put\ntheir public keys on their websites and in their email signatures. Apparently there were key signing\nparties where people exchanged and signed each other’s keys.\n\nFrom the looks of it these parties were lit.🥳\n\nIn 2014, Keybase had a better idea: People can just post their public keys in\nmachine-readable form on public sites where they have accounts, like Twitter or GitHub. They called\nthese “social proofs”. Then anyone can look up a person’s public keys by username, and use them to\nverify their identity.\n\nI’ve used Keybase to “verify myself” by posting machine-readable statements on\nTwitter,\nGitHub, and\nReddit\n\nThe first applications to truly bring end-to-end encryption to the masses were messaging apps. The\nSignal protocol came out in 2013, and two years later WhatsApp brought it to their entire customer\nbase, and overnight about a billion people were using encrypted messaging. Since then WhatsApp’s\nuser base grew to two billion and then to three billion, making it one of the most widely used\ncommunication tools in all of human history.\n\nThis succeeded because they made encryption transparent to the user. The key insight is that a\npublic key will never be like an email or a telephone number. It’s not a stable component of our\ndigital identity. Wrangling encryption keys is a job for computers, not for people. Devices should\njust generate keys as needed and we should never see them or have to think about them. Private keys\nshould never leave the device, and public keys should be shared automatically with other devices.\n\nWe’re agreed, then, that device-to-device sharing of keys is better than key signing parties. But\nAlice’s device still needs to know that Bob’s device is really Bob’s device, and not Eve’s device\npretending to be Bob’s device.\n\nTOFU considered squishy. Image: Yoav Aziz\n\nWhatsApp and Signal take an approach called “Trust On First Use”, or TOFU. Here’s how that works:\n\nThere’s a little risk there, they’re both taking a little leap of faith, but it’s a one-time thing,\nit’s probably fine.\n\nThat seems reasonable. The problem, though, is that the “first use” bit is kind of misleading,\nbecause in practice TOFU doesn’t happen just once.\n\nRemember, the keys we care about are device-level keys, not user-level keys. So what happens when\nBob gets a new phone, or Alice reinstalls the software on her laptop?\n\nWhat happens is an “account reset”, and at that point we’re back to TOFU — except that now, the\nattack scenarios are a bit more plausible: an impostor might have engineered the reset, and it would\nbe more feasible to exploit it.\n\nWhen a user has an account reset, the messaging apps suggest to everyone they communicate with that\nthey compare “security codes” or “safety numbers”. Most users don’t do this — I never have, I can’t\nimagine that people less technical than me do this.\n\nAnd anyway this is bad enough for a single pairwise connection; where this all really falls apart is\nin a large group, where the number of pairwise connections scales exponentially with the size of the\ngroup.\n\nWith a balanced PAKE, both parties need to know the password.\n\nSo when you want to connect with someone and don’t know their public key, is there an alternative to\nTOFU for securing that initial connection?\n\nThe most promising approach is to first share a single-use password out of band (in person, or via a\nchannel you already trust). There is whole a family of cryptographic protocols that support this,\ncalled PAKEs (for “password-authenticated key exchange”).\n\nWe’re saying “password” but it’s generally presented as an invitation code.\n\nIn the most common forms, both parties need to know the secret code; this is called a balanced\nPAKE.\n\nThe downside is that the inviter and invitee need to connect directly to validate the invitation.\n\nWith an asymmetric PAKE, a third party can verify the password without knowing it.\n\nWith an asymmetric PAKE (asymmetric because the verifier doesn’t need to know the password) a\nthird party can validate an invitation code without knowing it in advance or asking for it.\n\nThis brings us back to Keybase. In 2017 or so, they decided to try to monetize by building a\nSlack-but-encrypted thing for enterprise customers. They quickly realized that even if the global\nnerd population thought the idea of putting your public key on Twitter was really cool, Jim in\nAccounts Payable is probably just not going to do that. Sorry, it’s just not going to happen.\n\nSo they needed a way to bootstrap that initial key exchange, and they proposed something called a\nSeitan Token Exchange (presumably “seitan” because it’s not as\nsoft as tofu).\n\nThis is the approach I stole for localfirst/auth. At the time I didn’t know a PAKE from a hole in\nthe ground, but as it turns out this is essentially an asymmetric PAKE.\n\nWe’ve been talking about “identity”; but the beauty of this approach is that identity doesn’t need\nto mean “who you are in the world”, in the sense of linking to your real name or email or whatever —\nit can just mean “who you are to me“.\n\nRather than linking identity to a name or an email address, we link it to a relationship.\n\nFor example, in Ink & Switch’s Backchannel project one\nof the motivating use cases was connecting an anonymous source to a journalist. With a system like\nthis the source doesn’t have to have a name at all; the only thing that matters is that they’re able\nto interact once.\n\nTrust and identity are ultimately rooted in real-world relationships and interactions between human\nbeings. I know you because we interact, whether that’s face-to-face or online. That’s what it\nmeans to “know” someone. And we can use that interaction to bootstrap cryptographically secure\nconnections going forward. And if you have those secure connections with other people and I trust\nyou, I can benefit from your connections, and so on, forming a network of trust relationships.\n\nThat helps us clear up our thinking about identity:\n\nA. Real-world human interactions and relationships.\n\nThis feels correct to me: It’s natural, human-scale, and rooted in social reality.\n\nThe server-centric model roots our identity in getting distant corporations to vouch for us.\n\nWith this model, instead can we vouch for ourselves:\n\nAnd we can vouch for each other:\n\nIs it possible to have a secure, distributed access control list?\n\nSo now I have a way of knowing it’s you. But how do I know if you’re on my team? How do I know if I\nshould share this document with you, or if you should be able to edit it?\n\nOn a server this information is often recorded in some kind of access control list (ACL). So\nmaybe we need that, but distributed — everybody needs a copy of the same list. How would that work?\n\nMy first thought was that we could just put this information in an Automerge document and replicate\nit across everyone’s devices that way. But we can’t just let anyone edit this document at will. It\nshould be obvious if anyone changes the permissions, and we need to know who changed the\npermissions, and if they … had permission to do so? Do we need an ACL for the ACL?\n\nLet’s ignore that rabbit hole of infinite regress for the moment and focus on the mechanics. We need\na way of replicating a document that is:\n\n✅ tamper-evident: it shouldn’t be possible for someone to surreptitiously modify the list\n\n✅ eventually consistent: everybody should have the same list\n\n✅ authenticated: we need to know who has written changes to the list\n\nSo let’s look at some options for data structures.\n\nWhen we say “tamper-resistant” the first thing you might think of is a hash chain (or\nblockchain), where each link contains a cryptographic hash of the previous link, so it’s\nimpossible to modify one link or change the order without breaking the chain.\n\nThe problem is that this chain needs to be linear. Replicating it while ensuring consistency\nrequires enforcing a strict ordering; and cryptocurrency blockchains are famously … not optimized\nfor efficiency.\n\nTo accomplish this without burning enough fossil fuels to power multiple small countries, we could\nuse a hash graph. A hash graph is a hash chain plus branching. A CRDT like Automerge combines a\nhash graph with automatic conflict resolution logic to support replication with eventual\nconsistency. Git works the same way but with manual conflict resolution.\n\n✅ tamper-evident\n\n✅ eventually consistent\n\nSo far so good. But we still need a way of verifying who made which changes to our distributed\naccess control list.\n\nA signature graph is a hash graph where the individual operations are signed by the author. This\ngives us all three things.\n\n✅ tamper-evident\n\n✅ eventually consistent\n\n✅ authenticated\n\nIf you look at the work of anyone who’s trying to tackle this problem, you’re going to see some kind\nof signature graph: the Matrix protocol,\nDXOS’s HALO, Fission’s\nUCANs, etc. It’s a case of convergent evolution — we’ve all more\nor less independently landed on this data structure.\n\nThe way this works, concretely, is that there’s a series of operations on the group:\n\nThe first link, the root of the chain, marks the creation of the group and by definition adds\nthe founder to the group as an admin. It also includes the founder’s public keys.\n\nEach subsequent link represents an administrative action such as inviting a member, removing a\nmember, promoting a member to admin (or another role), or demoting a member.\n\nEach link contains a cryptographic hash of the preceding link, so the order of the links\ncannot be altered.\n\nEach link contains a digital signature of its content by the member making the change, so that\nits authenticity can be independently verified, and so that the link body cannot be tampered with.\n\nWhen I found a group, I am the only member and the only authority. I can decide to add members, and\nI can decide to delegate authority to them as well. Another member with admin authority could even\nremove me from the group.\n\nThis is a key point that we’ll come back to: In a group, authority is rooted in the act of\ncreating the group.\n\nTo be replicable, this data structure needs to be a CRDT. However, you can’t model group permissions\nusing a JSON CRDT like Automerge. I’ll explain why.\n\nHere we have two concurrent actions, but there’s no conflict, and we can resolve this by picking one\nor the other in an arbitrary but deterministic order. So far, nothing a generic CRDT couldn’t handle.\n\nWhat if someone takes actions while concurrently being removed? For example, what if Bob adds\nCharlie to the group and concurrently, Alice removes Bob from the group? Now we have a conflict.\n\nQ. Is Charlie in the group or not?\n\nIt’s important to resolve this correctly, or else Bob could circumvent his removal by writing a\nconcurrent operation adding proxy-Bob to the group.\n\nA: No. Removals always take precedence. We resolve that conflict by prioritizing removals. A\ngeneric CRDT like Automerge won’t be able to resolve this conflict in a principled way; it won’t\neven see it as a conflict. So this has to be implemented as a custom CRDT engine.\n\nWhat if two admins remove each other concurrently? (Or more generally, what if there’s a cycle of\nconcurrent removals?)\n\nAs a scenario involving two legitimate members of the group, this is far-fetched and unlikely to\nhappen. A more realistic and worrying scenario might be, for example, a compromised and revoked\ndevice trying to undo its revocation.\n\nOption 1: Remove both The logical conclusion of “removals take precedence” is to remove both.\n\nHowever, this seems unlikely to be the correct way of resolving the issue. It leaves Charlie\norphaned in a group without admins and creates an opening for a denial-of-service attack, where a\nrogue device blows up the group rather than allowing itself to be removed.\n\nOption 2: Fork the group Another approach is to “fork the world” into two parallel versions of\nthe same group: one where Alice stays and one where Bob stays. Then each member decides which world\nthey want to live in. This reflects the reality of a decentralized system.\n\nI suspect that in practice it’d be hard to communicate what’s going on to most users, and it would\njust be confusing and upsetting.\n\nI call option 2 the “Papal Schism” approach, in honor of the time when there were two popes and all of\nCatholic Christendom had to decide which one to follow.\n\nOption 3: Keep the senior member The solution I settled on is to let seniority be a proxy for\nwho is more likely to be in the right. In this case, Alice has been in the group longer than Bob, so\nshe stays.\n\nThe key insight for me was that the root node of a signature graph gives you an anchor for\nauthority. If I create a group, by definition I get to decide who’s in it.\n\nAt the moment of creation, Alice is the absolute dictator of a group with no other members: Alice\ndecides who to add to the group. Alice decides if she wants to delegate her authority to other\nmembers. She can make everyone else an admin too.\n\nThis delegates the right to remove anyone, including herself, from the group. But even once she’s\ngone, the authority behind any action — any addition or removal of members, any further delegation\nof authority — can always be traced back to the authority inherent in her act of creation.\n\nWe started with two big questions about how we find our footings in a local-first world.\n\nThe Seitan protocol that I decided to use, like any other flavor of PAKE, is complex and involves\nmany cryptographic subtleties. But any invitation protocol, no matter how involved, has something\nvery simple at its core: An interaction that takes place in the context of some existing\nrelationship.\n\nIn the beginning there was a relationship.\n\nAt first, it felt like cheating, or a cop-out, to rely on a “pre-existing trusted side channel” to\ntransmit this invitation. But it’s not at all. And it’s not a minor thing or an implementation\ndetail either — in fact, it’s the core of this whole thing.\n\nHow does Alice know it’s Bob? Because Alice and Bob had that interaction where Alice communicated\nthe invitation code to him, and Bob is able to prove that he’s the one she had that interaction\nwith.\n\nThe fact that this pre-existing channel exists at all is very significant; it only exists because\nthere is some kind of pre-existing relationship between Alice and Bob in the real world.\n\nSo, that’s our answer: preexisting human interactions and relationships are what anchor\nidentity.\n\nWhen you found a company, you decide who you want to invite to work with you. Depending on how you\nset things up, you might end up being removed from the company later on. But the authority to do\nthat can ultimately be traced back to delegations of authority you made.\n\nWhen you start any kind of project, you decide who you want to go on that journey with you, or if\nyou want to go it alone.\n\nWhen you begin writing a document, you don’t have to share it with anyone - you could keep it to\nyourself forever. If you do share it, the details are up to you: Do you share it with the whole\nworld? Just with your team? Just with one person? Whose input will you pay attention to?\n\nNone of this gives you any power over anyone outside the context of the thing you created: They can\nchoose whether to accept, and they can stop collaborating with you at any time.\n\nIt only recently occurred to me that authority and authorship come from the same root word.\n\nAuthority is rooted in authorship, in the act of creation.\n\nSo. These are the answers I’ve found to our big questions. I think they’re good answers. As it\nturns out, not only you can anchor decentralized security on something solid, but the foundation\nwe’ve found is something more legitimate, more satisfying, more human than a distant company’s\n“because I said so”.\n\nIf you’re looking to secure a local-first application, take a look at my\n@localfirst/auth library, which is a working\nimplementation of these ideas, including an auth provider for integration with\nautomerge-repo.\n\nAt some point in the process of creating localfirst/auth, I realized that I’d made a custom CRDT; so\nI extracted the machinery for creating, validating, and interpreting signature chains into the\nCRDX package. This can be used on\nits own to create an encrypted, authenticated CRDT with bespoke conflict detection and resolution\nlogic.\n\nIf you take any of this out for a spin — or if you have questions about how it works — please get in\ntouch with me — via one of the (pre-existing, trusted) channels listed below!\n\nThis library’s shape emerged from a series of conversations early on with Peter Van\nHardenberg of Ink & Switch. Peter drilled\ninto my head the idea that device keys should be generated locally and never leave the device, and\npointed me towards Keybase’s signature chains.\n\nMartin Kleppmann of Cambridge University has been very generous\nwith his time and expertise. Martin is the creator of\nAutomerge and co-author with Peter of Ink & Switch’s\nlocal-first manifesto. Much of localfirst/auth is an\nexpression in code of his theoretical work. Every time I’ve been stuck on something, Martin has\nco-written a paper that solves that exact thing. These two papers were particularly helpful:",

    "fullText": "When I swapped my iPhone for a Nokia, Walkman, film camera and physical map, I wasn’t sure what to expect. But my life soon started to change\n\nWhen two balaclava-clad men on a motorbike mounted the pavement to rob me, recently, I remained oblivious. My eyes were pinned to a text message on my phone, and my hands were so clawed around it that they didn’t even bother to grab it. It wasn’t until an elderly woman shrieked and I felt the whoosh of air as the bike launched back on to the road that I looked up at all. They might have been unsuccessful but it did make me think: what else am I missing from the real world around me?\n\nBefore I’ve poured my first morning coffee I’ve already watched the lives of strangers unfold on Instagram, checked the headlines, responded to texts, swiped through some matches on a dating app, and refreshed my emails, twice. I check Apple Maps for my quickest route to work. I’ve usually left it too late to get the bus, so I rent a Lime bike using the app. During the day, my brother sends me some memes, I take a picture of a canal boat, and pay for my lunch on Apple Pay. I walk home listening to music on Spotify and a long voice note from a friend, then I watch a nondescript TV drama, while scrolling through Depop and Vinted for clothes.\n\nI’m constantly contactable, I have no personal boundaries, and my attention span disappeared a long time ago. Since the first iPhone in 2007, smartphones have become indispensable to modern life, with the average person in the UK spending four hours and 20 minutes online per day. “Social media provides frictionless access to an infinite universe of mostly free digital drugs,” says Anna Lembke, author of Dopamine Nation. “And the algorithm tailors the experience for each unique brain, making it very reinforcing, while also injecting just enough novelty in the infinite scroll to overcome boredom and tolerance. All these features combined keep us clicking and swiping long after we want to.” Over time we develop tolerance, which means “we need more of it and a more potent form to get the same effect.”\n\nIncreased screen time has been associated with depression, anxiety and poorer sleep. But is it possible to live lo-fi in a hi-tech world? For a month, I tried: swapping my iPhone for a Nokia which I can only use to text, call and play Snake; also, a Walkman and a film camera. I picked up physical copies of books, newspapers and magazines; I used a London A-Z for directions, and hunted down my physical bank cards or tried to use cash. The only screen time exception was for work, where from 9-5 I used my laptop to respond to emails and write.\n\n“You’re going to look like such a performative hipster,” my flatmate Ben says, as I’m setting up my new devices. He’s right. I leave the Walkman behind, but my bag is still heavier than usual with my book, notepad, A-Z and wallet. I haven’t taken the bus into work yet from my new home so I follow a hand-drawn map to the stop and run for a bus. I stupidly didn’t write down the bus number but that one sounds familiar. It’s not the one, two friendly strangers tell me, but I can swap on to another at Angel. “We’ve outsourced our memory to our phones,” says Nicholas Kardaras, author of Digital Madness and a former assistant clinical professor of psychology at Stony Brook University, New York. “And unfortunately the ease and comfort of being lubricated by technology just means our human skills atrophied. It is use it or lose it.”\n\nThe bus is crawling. Normally, I would have looked up a different route. I try to message a friend back but it’s difficult having to click each button multiple times for the letter I want. “Hard work,” I manage. I read for the rest of the journey.\n\nOn my lunch break, my sister and I go for a walk around the park. When she leaves me to do another lap, I have an urge to check Instagram and my emails but I’m only getting the odd SMS. I’m craving the back-and-forth WhatsApps with friends telling me fun facts about their day. I feel a little unsettled, but I try to focus on the changing leaves on the trees. I have thoughts that wouldn’t usually have the time to surface. How stressful.\n\nAfter work, I go to see the saxophone player cktrl at the ICA. I’m a little worried about collecting the tickets without access to the Dice app I bought them on, but I show them my passport instead. I would normally join the throngs of people filming a song or two, so I could upload some blurred clips with poor sound to social media to show that I had a great time. But I can’t, so I watch him play, undistracted. Then a flashlight glares behind me, as someone films an entire track. I vow never to be that annoying person again.\n\nMy digital detox is starting to stress out my friends. Nicole finally gets through to me, saying: “I hate your dumb phone.” She’s been texting, but didn’t realise you had to click twice to make it send as an SMS not an iMessage. Another friend wants to share a dating story and texts: “Omg this is a terrible time not to access voice note.” And, when my landlord messages asking us to send pictures of the new carpet on WhatsApp, which I can’t do, Ben texts: “You’re going to be such a liability this month.”\n\nIn the evening, my date sends me the address of a pub to meet him at “for your A-Z”. I allow lots of time to decipher its tiny font and navigate my way there. He’s running late, so I sit by the fireplace in the pub and read my book. I look like I’m waiting for someone to chat me up. When he arrives, he shows me how to turn on predictive text, which is a relief for my very tired thumbs.\n\nAt lunchtime, I put on the terrestrial TV and watch Escape to the Country, where I learn about the housing market in Herefordshire. I want to cook myself an elaborate meal – for dinner, and also for entertainment, but when I get to the shops, I remember that I can’t look up a recipe on my phone, so I settle for tomato pasta.\n\nMy flatmate picked up a Nina Simone CD for me in a charity shop. I try to play it on my Walkman, but realise it needs batteries. On my lunch break I buy some (who knew there were so many sizes?) and walk home from the office listening to it. Spotify can be overwhelming with its hundred million tracks, so it’s nice to remove the element of choice and focus on the album as it was intended, not scrambled by shuffle mode. Rosanna Irwin, who runs Samsú – a collection of digital detox cabins in Ireland – knows the importance of analogue listening: she leaves her guests with cassette tapes she makes with her father. After reaching a state of burnout, working long hours in tech – first at Meta and later for a climate tech company – she visited the Danish island of Samsø with her husband in 2023, and found peace amid the scrappy phone service and incredible nature.\n\n“My mental health was very poor,” she says. “I was spending a lot of time online and I did an accidental digital detox on this island and came back invigorated from the experience.” She recommends a three-day retreat. “There’s a lot of science to show that it’s around 72 hours in nature where the true magic starts to happen.”\n\nI meet my friend at Vauxhall station, and we walk to a cafe for breakfast, then to Tate Britain. Camilla is pretty offline: she’s a doctor and doesn’t have social media. She rarely responds to texts and is maybe one of the most joyful people I know. But she says she feels so much guilt about not replying sooner and hates the fact that phones are like this ever-present person in the room, distracting you from being totally engaged with the real-life friends around you.The sentiment resonates with me; we both want to be more spontaneous.\n\nInspired by our conversation, I call Aakriti, who doesn’t live too far away. I meet her and two of her friends and we eat empanadas. On the way home, I have to ask the only man on the platform for help. The overground isn’t due for 24 minutes, so I wonder if there is a faster route. There isn’t, so I shiver at the outdoor station wishing I could book an Uber.\n\nIt’s tipping down with rain when I arrive at Canada Water, and I don’t want to ruin my A-Z to search for Rotherhithe Street. I know The Mayflower pub is on the river and ask a man at a convenience store to point me in the right direction. I’m early, so I squint at my book in the candle-lit pub, feeling very Victorian. There’s a hilarious waiter, who is telling dating stories from Grindr, and it’s much better than my book. This no-technology thing is making me nosy. I pay for my roast with cash, which feels almost fake now, like I’m in a game. Then my friend and I go to the cinema – the Picturehouse in central London, because it’s in between where we both live. They charge us £20 for a ticket, which I would never have paid had I known before we made the trip. I’m left fuming, but luckily the movie is good.\n\nI need to call the bank. My flatmate has sent rent money to my Monzo account, which I can only access on the app, and I get a text saying that I’ve gone into an unarranged overdraft. When I get to the tube in the morning, my Oyster card has run out, so I top up the credit and miss my train – I would usually have used a payment card on Apple Pay instead. I have to wait eight minutes for the next one. I’m flustered by the time I get to the office and feel stressed about not being able to check how much money is in my account or transfer money between accounts.\n\nThere’s a group of children on a school trip on my train. The teacher is trying to keep them entertained by getting them to play a word association game. “When I say ‘bread’,” she says. “You could say, ‘sandwich’. Let’s have a go. ‘School,’” the teacher says. “Prison,” a child shouts back. When I arrive in Notting Hill, I study the map at the station to make sure I surface from the correct exit. I memorise key landmarks so I know where to turn – the Gate Cinema is by the road I need to get to Uxbridge Street. I’m late, and don’t have time for mistakes, so I start walking down the street quickly, scouring every restaurant until I find the Palestinian cafe I’m looking for.\n\nThe worries I felt at the start of the experiment about getting lost and not being able to communicate with friends seem to have diminished. I’m calmer, and present when I’m with people. I look around the train on my morning commute and notice that everyone except one person has their eyes glued to their phones. The man opposite me doesn’t have earphones, a phone or a book. I try not to catch his eye, as I’m worried I’ve been staring. Things are less relaxed when I try to meet my friend Navid after work. We can’t pick a place to meet and he is frustrated because he can’t send me links: “Please return to WhatsApp you Neanderthal.” He’s late, so I wait outside the station for 45 minutes. He arrives with a big grin, knowing I’m a bit irritated, but I get my own back by torturing him with two hours of experimental jazz.\n\nAfter work, I go to see my friend Scarlett, who is being held captive by a corgi puppy. It’s dark and damp when I arrive in south-east London but I’ve written out the directions to the house as carefully as I can. I didn’t bring my A-Z because my bag was too heavy, but I’m certain I can’t mess up the 10-minute walk. I call my mum and we natter for 20 minutes before I realise I haven’t spotted the turning. In a panic, I ask her to look up my location on Google Maps, which is obviously cheating, but I’m now late and in the middle of a cemetery. I’ve gone completely the wrong way and she has to narrate the route to my destination.\n\nIt’s been a busy weekend so far and I feel like having a lazy day. I walk to a yoga class and then go for a wander. As I’m walking, and listening to my one CD, I get a call from the guy I’m dating who has just finished work. We try to hunt down a board game to play, but when the local charity shops fail us, we pick up some newspapers and magazines and the ingredients for a roast chicken instead. We then sit on the sofa playing music and reading in the old fashioned way. It feels like we’ve retired.\n\nI finally get around to calling the bank to pay my rent, which is late for the first time. I’ve been putting off the inevitable 20-minute call that includes reading out lots of sort codes and bank numbers and spelling the names of my landlord along with the various friends I owe money to. It’s quite unnerving transferring money without checking the details with my own eyes, and the woman on the phone keeps telling me that it would be much easier to do this online.\n\nFor all the frustrations of the month, I’m sad the experiment is over. I’m left with the feeling that living offline puts other people out: if we’re looking for a place to eat or a pub to go to it’s down to them, they’re on map duty, and I’m not able to book Ubers. But I was happier and calmer – relieved of the endless scrolling, waiting for texts back, and the need to communicate with people all the time. After about a week, I wasn’t reaching for my phone and I had the patience to read. It was nice not to be able to look at my work emails in the evening. I’m determined to delete my main distractions: Depop, Hinge and Instagram. Scouring charity shops for clothes is much more satisfying; dating with no distractions is so much easier; and I can live without reels about botched Botox and AI animals. “Big tech platforms are not addictive accidentally, they’re addictive by design,” says Kardaras. “They’re selling their product by targeting the vulnerable: if the algorithm detects that a young person has a body image issue or is struggling with self-harm or depression, then they bombard them with content on that subject that exacerbates their mental unwellness.” On my last day, I get an email from Scarlett: “Splashed my phone with water whilst listening to the Lily Allen album in the bath, now phoneless and actually want to copy you.” It seems I’m not the only one keen to disconnect.",

    "fullText": "The Newbridge Cutlery Company said today it will stop production of silver-plated cutlery and tableware at its factory in Newbridge in Co Kildare.\n\nThe factory, which employs 11 people, will officially cease operations on 10 April.\n\nFounded in 1934, the company said that given its long and proud heritage in the industry the decision to close the factory was an extremely difficult decision and came after a comprehensive strategic review of the loss-making cutlery business.\n\nThe company said the closure of the factory will not affect the broader Newbridge Silverware business which will continue to operate as normal.\n\nThis includes the Newbridge Visitor Centre in Newbridge, its six standalone stores and the 250 local stockists of Newbridge Silverware around the country.\n\nA consultation process with impacted workers is underway, the company said.\n\nIn a statement, the Newbridge Cutlery Company said today's decision follows several years of falling sales due to reduced demand for silver-plated tableware such as cutlery driven by changing tastes and dining habits at home and across the hospitality sector.\n\n\"Traditional purchases like silver cutlery canteens for wedding gifts have also become increasingly rare. This has resulted in a steady decline in sales and demand for this product,\" the company said.\n\nThe Newbridge Cutlery Company opened as a local co-operative in 1934 with a view to leveraging skills from the former military barracks to craft silver-plated tableware for the Irish market. In the 1990s the company expanded into the jewellery and homeware market which operates under the Newbridge Silverware brand.\n\n\"We have taken the difficult decision to cease operations at our cutlery factory from mid-April. Since 1934, we have built a long and proud history in silver cutlery and tableware manufacturing and have earned a reputation as a centre of excellence in the industry. Today's announcement reflects sustained changes in market demand, and it is with deep regret that we are ceasing operations,\" Martin Kilduff, Operations Director at The Newbridge Cutlery Company, said.\n\nHe said the decline of silver cutlery manufacturing is not unique to Ireland and has been a long-term, Europe-wide trend in line with changing consumer tastes.\n\n\"In addition to this, over the past 12 months, the price of silver bullion has risen by approximately 150%. Absorbing an increase of this magnitude is not feasible without significantly impacting retail pricing. This is a challenge currently being faced across the entire industry,\" he said.\n\n\"We fully understand the impact this decision will have on those craftsmen and women who maintained the tradition of crafting silver plated tableware in Newbridge for generations,\" Mr Kilduff said.\n\n\"We are committed to a meaningful consultation process and to supporting affected employees through clear communication, engagement with their representatives, and access to appropriate supports during this time,\" he added.",

    "description": "Everyone is going crazy about Ralph loop, and they are cool, but I think we need to upgrade to concept to an Eric loop !",
    "fullText": "TLDR; Eric loop is a concept that upgrades Ralph loop by adding more complexity and depth to the idea of managing AI systems, bash version of the article\n\nI wont reintroduce the concept of Ralph loop, if you have been anywhere near AI in the first half of January 2026, you have heard of it ! If not, you should go and watch Theo's video (or someone else's but this is a good !)\n\nYou probably know which comics character Ralph is refering to, but Eric... who could it possibly be ?\n\nIf you thought short, fat and angry, you'd be right ! I'm of course talking about Eric Cartman from South Park !\n\nWhile Ralph is naive and innocent, Eric is calculating and manipulative. Not something I'd look for in a Human, but for managing a bunch of AIs ? HELL YEAH !\n\nAn idea, even if good, always need some work and some back and forth to be implemented. So we first expose the idea to the AI to get an requirement document (PRD) and we work on it !\n\nHow ? you'll need to read first ! and straight away update parts you don't agree with or things you need to be more thorough !\n\nOnce that is done, ask AI models to ask You questions about the PRD and give all those, the PRD and your replies to another AI for update\n\nRince, Repeat, until you are satisfied with the document.\n\nYou can even get multiple model go at it to then compare and merge the outputs, using AI, of course :D\n\nThis is where we start diverging from the basic Ralph loop. instead of just passing that to the AI and hoping tasks will be implemented properly we get an AI to pre split and formalise the tasks and sub tasks into a list !\n\nThe rift grows further as we split the task implementation in several steps with:\n\nOnce all that is done ? the Eric loop goes on for the next phase of the plan, just like Ralph !\n\nYes models have gotten smarter, but if you played around with sub agents and skills, you know that prompting is not dead (yet...)\n\nHaving a neat separation like that helps you have better prompts for each phase of the task execution.\n\nAs a side effect, it mmeans you can control which model is used for which phase maybe you dont need Opus the whole way if it made a banger plan !\n\nWe are going to create a small project from an idea I have, you can do it to if you like !\n\nIt's called Tiny-till, a small app to have a simple till for itinerant merchants.\n\nBut we are going to need a tool to help us ...\n\nYep, I already kind of made said tool :D ! task-o-matic\n\nI'll write more about it in a future post ! but you already have plenty of content to go through on the site itself.\n\nI made sure to generate a lot of docs and a couple tutorials so you can already give it a try if you'd like !\n\nBut in a nutshell, it helps you create PRDs, refine them , split into tasks and subtasks and finally wiring all that to your favorite AI harness !\n\nFor the AI to operate properly, we need a specific stack, that way, we limit hallucination !\n\nTask-o-matic uses better-t-stack under the hood to bootstrap the stack so let's do that !\n\nBoom, a monorepo for Tiny-till ! Batteries included : tailwind, shadcn, build script and all :D\n\nWhy init init ? you might have missed the whole using AI to code whole projects, sometimes... it is not aesthetically pleasing, and you should learn not to care to much (is my take on that... or lazyness...)\n\nYou will need a .env file to configure the AI stack.\n\nNow, we tell the AI what we want to do, but why would we limit ourselves to 1 ?\n\nAm I using free endpoints for \"real\" work ? Yes, yes I am ! Does it distort my views on how much AI work should cost ? ... Why would it ? No, no, you just being a killjoy right now !\n\nA few minutes later... I got myself this (cat .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md)[/assets/blackhole/from-ralph-to-eric/prd-master.md] it doesn't really need more questions, but let's see what Claude has to say, shall we ?\n\nWell, let's answer those... some are pertinant ! I guess that's why we bring out the big guns !\n\nQuestions are asked interactivelly ;)\n\nWell, this little stunt just costed me a nice 15 cts, more or les 10x more than the first PRD generation...\n\nI don't know what is the most amazing... that\n\nI haven't decided yet...anywooooooo, time to move on and not get siderated !\n\nWhen i said seconds, i lied, I spent 5 minutes editing the file. to fix lib versions, marked install and config work as done, and, finally, set expectation for the design.\n\nthe last thing we have to do, is ask an AI to split into main tasks.\n\nonce again, i wont only do 1, but this time, I'll ask Claude to be the final task creator, from others input !\n\nAnd there goes another 8.2 cents burnt for the token Gods, but in return, we get a detailed breakdown of the tasks required to complete the project !\n\nWe still have to split those tasks though... To make them more palatable for the current crop of AI models !\n\nYou should really consider reviewing the tasks in detail before spliting, not vibe planning like a muppet ! (guess what I did ^^)\n\nI think Claude is not necessary here, but I had me $3 of openrouter credit i have to burn before the end of the month soooooo... big guns it is !\n\nBurnt a tenth of that ! but now... we are actually ready ! Almost...\n\nOr CLAUDE, or GEMINI, depends on your harness of choice, For me, it is opencode i'am going to run the /init prompt in opencode !\n\nit is not mandatory, but it is a good way to prevent dumb mistake and set some proper behavior regarding a few things, for me, i'll add the following\n\nI might add more as the agent works if i see reccuring errors and dumb things happening\n\nWell, guys, stash your parents away cause we are going to let Eric go at it !\n\nBecause I am El CheapoDev DelBrokeCasa, i am going to use my GLM coding plan to code, that way, i wont break the bank and it is OK enough for something like that i think !\n\nIf you'd rather use claude code, use the --tool claude option. (or codex/gemini/kilo) but opencode is nicer as it stream the content out (in part at least) so you see what is happening !\n\nAnd now, you wait, coffee, snacks, more coffee, diner and breakfast probably, it gonna take a while ^^\n\nHalf a day later, Eric has successfully completed the task. yaaay \\o/\n\nnpm run dev, browser to http://localhost:3001 aaaaand, it does not work.... XD\n\nI have a very fancy error page telling me about some kind of \"exceeded depth error blablabla\"... Zustand... i bloody fucking HATE Zustand !\n\nI could have gone in, open the project, read some of the 35970 lines of... 35970 LINES OF CODE ??? Naaah, dude, ain't no way i'm even thinking about that !\n\nOf course, i asked GLM to fix this obviously terrible usage of Zustand, and I even have to spend another few minutes screaming about some redirection to the / issue... I still felt like a caveman though !\n\nI mean, having to open a tool ? To do ... work ?? Like it's 2022 or something !\n\nI haven't been testing anything yet, so i'm pretty sure there'll be a few more issues, but the dev server runs, i can navigate the app without error (even in console) so it is not bad at all !\n\nI might do a follow up later on, to update you on what i had to do to get it a bit closer to the original idea (if needed ^^)\n\nSo that's the end (of this article) ! What do you think ? did you try a similar technique ? What's the plan next, cause...\n\nIf you are interested, the repo can be found on github. Is the code great ?\n\nAs for task-o-matic, the repo is on github so feel free to poke around ;)\n\nWhat about the \"Eric Loop\", how can you do that yourself ? Well, the beautiful thing with AI is that, you can actually ask it to write code ! So a quick\n\nthis being the result, your own Eric Loop, ain't life beautiful ?\n\nHope you enjoyed, I'll see you around",

    "fullText": "Embeddings are a core AI concept that underpin a great deal of what we today think of as being AI. This article is going to give you an accurate and intuitive understanding of what an “embedding” is in less time than it takes to eat a (very large) bagel, and possibly make you think they’re as cool as I think they are. It even explains how we got to embeddings as a solution, by looking at everything else we tried along the way. If you’re comfortable with even very simple Excel formulas, you’ll understand all the maths, and there’s even a cute graph with dogs on it.\n\nLet’s start by thinking about dogs, and by classifying them by their attributes:\n\nFor each dog, we’ve defined a vector where the first column is size, and the second column is intelligence. A vector is a fancy name for a row of numbers. And in two dimensions, we can plot this really easily:\n\nLet’s do some vector maths using Manhattan distance. A Great Dane ([5,5]) is 5 units away from a Beagle ([2,3]):\n\n(we’re using Manhattan distance here because it’s simple, but you might well use Euclidean distance instead)\n\nA vector can be both a specific point in our dog-embedding space, but it can also be a direction:\n\nWhat’s like a Bulldog ([3, 2]) but smaller ([-1, 0]) and smarter ([0, 1])?\n\nKey point: if we start to plot things by their attributes, and we give each attribute a number, we can use simple maths to find items that are close together (clustering) and we can easily find items that differ from a starting point in a certain way.\n\nAND WHAT’S MORE: this holds up over as many dimensions as we want to define, not just two:\n\nWe can do the same distance calculations again, even with more vectors:\n\ntldr; an embedding is a vector of numbers that describes something, and that you can use to cluster things by similarity\n\n(vector databases, like Pinecone or pgvector, are simply databases that are fast at calculating the distance between vectors, and finding vectors that are close to other vectors)\n\nDogs are easy mode, because there’s a limited number of breeds and attributes. Also, coming up with attributes ourselves is hard work, and laziness is an inarguable virtue, so let’s see if we can make the computer do the work for us here.\n\nIf we wanted to classify books instead, we’d need to do something different. Let’s start by defining a table of every book, and every word in the English language, with the values being the occurrences of each word in the book:\n\nTable 1: Number of word occurrences in each book\n\nOur vocabulary of words becomes our dimensions (or columns) and each book becomes a vector in those dimensions (rows). This is called a bag of words, a “bag” being the technical term for a mathematical object that counts the occurrences of things (but discards the order they’re in).\n\nBag of words was state of the art in approximately the 1950s for classification. There are lots of problems with this approach, and understanding those problems and how they’re solved starts to bring us closer to understanding embeddings!\n\nOne problem with our Bag of Words is that we end up with values that are proportional to the size of books, which might mean that two very similar books are quite far apart, just because they’re of very different lengths. If George RR Martin rewrote Animal Farm, it might end up very far away from the Orwell original simply due to his overly-lax editorial staff.\n\nThere’s a particularly elegant solution to this in terms of determining how close two items are by measuring the difference in angles from the origin towards them (cosine similarity), BUT there’s also the highly effective and really simple solution of just dividing the count of each word by the length of the book (normalization):\n\nTable 2: Distribution of word occurrences in each book\n\nwhich gets us most of the way there without fancy maths or words like cosine.\n\nWe’ve also got a problem here with our Bag of Words by a bunch of noise being introduced by words that are frequent but unspeakably dull, like “a”, “the”, and “of”. Different authors may lean more heavily on some than others (meaning their books are further apart in the dimensions of “of” and “a”), but that gives us absolutely no useful information about the meaning or content of what they’re writing about: what we care about is occurrences of words like dragon and android and lascivious.\n\nWe could maintain a list of dull words (often called “stop words”), and strip them out, but that’s fiddly, insufficiently lazy, and doesn’t account for the fact that what we consider to be a “stop word” might differ depending on the context.\n\nInstead, we can use some simple statistics to look at how often a word (or “term”) appears in a given book/document compared to how frequently it appears across all of the books or documents we’re looking at; this is called “TF-IDF”, and it was state-of-the-art circa 1972:\n\n(you can see the actual formula and learn more about TF-IDF here)\n\nKEY POINT: We’re still very firmly in a “words are dimensions, and books exist as points in that high-dimensional space” place here. We’re still representing books by a vector of numbers and looking for similarity by searching how close these books are to each other in a high-dimensional space. We’re just using a slightly fancier way of determining what those numbers should be.\n\nOur approach has gotten us some of the way towards classifying books well, but we start to hit some insurmountable problems in this approach:\n\nIf we have a dimension for every word in English, we have waaay too many dimensions. One for each word, and each variation of each word. At least 50,000 if we’re just covering common English words. This starts to be cumbersome and computationally expensive to do maths on.\n\nFantasy authors who insist on inventing spellings for “Sir”; there’s quite a lot of semantic information about a book embedded in having nobles with fancy titles prancing around, but our current approach gets confused when authors decide to start calling their characters “Ser” or “Syr” or “Sür” to try and sound more mysterious. More generally, we treat words with similar meanings but different spellings or forms as completely different dimensions\n\nBarking up the wrong tree: sometimes two different words are spelled identically (eg “bark”), and we don’t especially want to say that books on forestry and similar to books on puppies\n\nWord order is important! If your main character is a “dog who bites a bone” that’s likely quite a very different story from your “bone who bites a dog” character, even if the bone is haunted in both cases\n\ntldr; vectors that are simply word frequency counts are a good start, but have a whole host of problems: we need something even smarter (embeddings) to do really good clustering and classification\n\nWe have until this point been thinking about how we would classify a whole book, and using word counts as dimensions. But what if we wanted to classify just one word instead?\n\nIf we were able to come up with vectors for individual words, we could start to address the problem that “dog”, “puppy”, and “pooch” are all treated as completely different things when classifying text, and we’d also get some other useful features, like it would make it easier for us to build things like fuzzy-search for users: “pooch pics” and “dog photos” should return much the same results when a user is searching for them.\n\nWe could hand-pick some dimensions to use for this:\n\nThis … might work pretty well with enough dimensions! But hand-choosing each of the dimensions we’d need and then manually classifying (and tweaking) 50,000 words feels like it might be a lot of hard work. Hard work that the computer should be doing for us… But how do we get the computer to do that for us? The computer would need to know already what the words meant in order to do the classification, so we need a way to bootstrap that process.\n\nOne intriguing idea might be to suck in a dictionary, and to use our bag-of-words techniques on the definition of each word to come up with a vector for each word. This however gives us our own bootstrapping problem: if we look at the dictionary definition for “puppy”, it’s very different for the one for “dog”: instead, it points us to the one for “dog” instead, and solving all of this starts to sound like complicated maths will be needed.\n\nWhat if we instead tried to “know a word by the company it keeps”? It’s an idea that’s been floating around linguistics for decades, and suggests that words appearing in similar contexts probably have similar meanings. If you constantly see the words “dog” and “pooch” surrounded by words like “walk”, “leash”, “bark”, and “treats”, maybe you don’t need a dictionary to figure out they’re related?\n\nLet’s game out how this could work: you could take every piece of written text you could lay your hands on, and go through it word by word, looking at the two words ahead of it and the two words behind it. For every word, you could start to build out the probability that any other word was in those four surrounding words.\n\nFigure 1: a sliding context window, associating each word in a sentence with the two words before and after it\n\nYou could use those probabilities as the values in your vector for each word, with every other word being a dimension still, and voila, you have per-word vectors that put “pupper”, “dog”, and “pooch” very close to each other.\n\nThis is almost the massive breakthrough that researchers at Google had in 2013 inventing “Word2Vec” (word to vector), but there’s one further, crucial refinement.\n\nOur method above has two big problems. The first is one we’ve already identified: you still end up with an absolutely massive number of dimensions! These are unwieldy, difficult to work with, and computationally expensive to work with. But secondly, there’s just not enough reading text out there to make this work: there are infinite possible and sensible combinations of words, and while us humans have written down a lot of stuff, it turns out there’s simply not enough training data to make the above approach practical, IN ADDITION TO having all the drawbacks that come with these huge, unwieldy vectors.\n\nSo, when in doubt, make the computer do the work. And the tool that proved exceptionally useful for this is the mighty Neural Network.\n\nA deep-dive into how they work is out of scope, even for this increasingly long article, but the key things to know are:\n\nThey take vectors as their inputs and spit out vectors as their outputs\n\nThey’re specialized tools for learning things through giving them examples\n\nThey’re really good at prediction tasks\n\nAnd so we can flip our earlier method on its head:\n\nRather than building a huge matrix of every word and its neighbours, how about we train a Neural Network to predict what a word is, based on some neighbours?\n\nThe process for this sounds like magic:\n\nWe choose a number of dimensions we want to use, let’s say 300\n\nWe literally just make up a 300-number-long vector for every input word: it’s literally just random to begin with\n\nWe show the Neural Network billions of sets of four words, and ask it to guess the middle word\n\nWe make tiny adjustments to each of those initial random vectors based on how well the Neural Network did at guessing it (using some complicated maths called “back-propagation”)\n\nAnd over the billions and billions of times we do this, the computer eventually comes up with its own vectors for every word: vectors that really are good enough to predict what a word is going to be given its neighbours.\n\nThese same “guessing” vectors encode the meaning of words in a truly jaw-droppingly effective way. Again, it’s the principle that ‘a word is known by the company it keeps.’ If the network gets good at predicting surrounding words, the vectors it develops for each word must encode information about that word’s typical context, which relates closely to its meaning.\n\nFirst of all, it puts related words close together. “Pupper”, “pooch”, and “doggo” now all sit really close together in our dimensional space. “Sir/Ser/Syr” basically sit on top of each other. We can’t really figure out what each of these dimensions means individually: there’s not a dedicated dimension for “dog like”, but they seem to work.\n\nSecondly, remember how a vector can be either a point or a direction? Well it turns out if we start out at the vector for “king”, we subtract the vector for “man”, and add the vector for “woman”, we end up with a vector that’s almost identical to the one for “queen”. Complex semantic meaning has been encoded into our dimensions and embeddings. This shows the model learned abstract relationships (like gender and royalty) from the text data alone, encoding them into the vectors.\n\nThe above is the essence of “Word2Vec”.\n\nDo we know why this works so well? NO\n\nIs this some bad-ass alien technology shit? YES\n\nIsn’t this a cause for alarm given how much we’re starting to rely on this technology and its successors? Please take your negativity out of the AI acceleration seminar\n\nThese dense vectors that capture semantic information along dimensions that the computer literally just made up are “embeddings”. These word embeddings can then be combined (using various methods, from simple averaging to more complex techniques) to create embeddings for sentences or even whole paragraphs: you have a long list of numbers that encodes the meaning of that sentence or that paragraph.\n\nThese dense vectors help solve our earlier problems: the fixed, lower dimensionality (e.g., 300) is manageable; words with similar meanings learned from context (like ‘Sir’ and ‘Ser’) end up close together; and the context-based learning helps differentiate meanings of words like ‘bark’ depending on surrounding words (though context handling gets even better later).\n\nThese paragraph-level embeddings are what underpin most RAG systems; in practice, people use the more clever versions of embeddings that the rest of the article covers, but still. An embedding is a row of numbers that describe the meaning of some words, and then we can use simple linear algebra to cluster related things together, or move around inside the vector space using abstract paths such as “positive sentiment” or “more feminine”\n\nYou can at this point leave the article, with a pretty good idea of what embeddings are. You won’t have learned how they deal with misspellings, words that are written the same and are completely different, or word ordering, BUT, you will know that it’s possible to encode semantic meaning into vectors of a few hundred numbers. Rather than leaving the article, you can also skip ahead to Part 3, which explains how embeddings are actually used in AI.\n\nWith Word2vec, we end up with vectors that capture semantic meaning of words, and the vectors exist in a dimensional space that the computer learned by playing a guessing game over and over again. That the computer learned these dimensions by itself, and each dimension has a subtle and dense meaning means that we call those vectors “embeddings”.\n\nWe’ve also covered that you can average out these embedding to get a meaning for a sentence or a paragraph, but because this averaging process is treating those vectors as a “bag” (an unordered count of items), we lose a huge amount of meaning: the vectors for “man eats shark” and “shark eats man” are identical, even though the actual meanings differ substantially.\n\nSo rather than averaging our embeddings together, we need an operation that takes into account the sequence of the embeddings.\n\nOne of the first successful ways of doing this was with “Recurrent Neural Networks” (RNNs) – “recurrent” in this case means a neural network that accepts its last output as part of its next input (the state “recurs”). (there’s a little white lie here about the order in which these events happened that we’ll address later)\n\nHere we start out with a base vector, and we imprint each vector in the sequence on it, one at a time. After we’ve stamped each vector representing a word onto the base vector, the base vector ends up changed in a way that reflects the sequence.\n\nHere’s some Play-Doh as an example. The Play-Doh square is our base vector, and each stamp we apply over the top of the last one is the vector for a word. You’ll note that the order matters, and also that the most recent word vector ends up playing a larger role in the overall pattern we end up with than the previous ones.\n\nFigure 2: Pressing the same shapes into Play-Doh in different orders results in subtly different patterns, with the last shape often over-represented, and a faded initial shape\n\nWith Play-Doh, the more shapes you overlay on top of each other, the more you lose the previous shapes. If you add too many, you’ll end up with a complete mess you can’t make any sense of. This happens with actual Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) too! Despite this, it represented a significant improvement over just averaging together vectors.\n\nSome clever mechanisms were invented to try and prevent earlier vectors getting completely wiped out by later ones, with fancy names like LSTMs and GRUs, but both represented incremental improvements over RNNs rather than a huge leap forward.\n\nHistorical note: the above describes events as if the sequence of events was: Word2Vec -> RNNs -> LSTMs and GRUs, which isn’t accurate! RNNs as a concept and LSTMs as a refinement of them actually predate Word2vec. So, what were they using as their input vectors before we got the rich “embeddings” that Word2vec gives us? They were either using the huge “one dimension per word” vectors we discussed near the beginning of the article, or were feeding in one character at a time with each character being a dimension. Using neural networks that can understand sequences rather than bags has all sorts of uses outside of text classification, but using the newly invented Word2vec “embeddings” with these techniques was a massive leap forward.\n\nSo at the end of this section, we have improved on our Word2Vec embeddings by building embeddings that combine other embeddings in the right sequence, which solves our problem of “man eats shark” / “shark eats man”. However, we have serious problems with losing information over sequences of any real length: by the time we get to the end of “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy sheep dog”, we’ve added so much extra information that “quick” and “brown” have kind of been smushed together, and we’re very much more “dog” focused than we are “fox” focused because it occured later in the sentence.\n\nFigure 3: After each addition of a vector onto our hidden state, previous vectors get “blurrier” and more recent vectors dominate\n\nRNNs gave us much stronger embeddings than we had before, but ultimately these days we derive embeddings from the same technology that powers Large Language Models: a technique called attention and the system that uses it, the transformer. A proper deep-dive into the steps that take us from RNNs to transformers is too big for this already unwieldy article, but in short we train the computer to pay more attention to some words in a sentence than to others.\n\nThat’s probably how us humans do it too: your brain naturally ‘pays attention’ to the most important words (like the subject and verb, or key nouns) and how they relate, even if they are far apart. The ‘attention mechanism’ in AI tries to mimic this.\n\nWhen processing a sequence of words, with attention we keep track of all the intermediate embeddings we’d generated rather than mashing them all together into one single vector. We add an extra neural network over that where we train further vectors to correlate how important each word is to every other word in the sequence. This whole system – including the new neural network – is trained the same way as we trained RNNs: by playing “guess the word” and getting the computer to update its internal parameters when it gets something right or wrong, until it’s usually getting them right!\n\nTransformers take this attention mechanism even further, and are the technology that powers large language models. Using those to generate our embeddings, we get embeddings that can accurately describe even pretty long pieces of text well, and are free of almost all of the issues we’ve identified so far in this article. Commercial vendors like OpenAI offer very effective (and cost-effective!) general-purpose APIs for turning large chunks of text into embeddings for use in your applications.\n\nFirst of all, rather than using whole words as inputs, LLMs use tokens. These are fragments of words that are chosen (by the computer) during training to be a representative sample of commonly-appearing sequences. By using bits of words instead of whole words, we gain the ability to deal with words we haven’t seen before, which includes misspellings of words. For example, it might understand ‘embeddingtastic’ by recognizing the known tokens ‘embedding’ and ‘tastic’.\n\nFigure 4: the OpenAI tokenizer in action. Common words are their own tokens, but less common words are split into fragments to help deal with the vast range of possible words including misspellings.\n\nSecondly, chances are the majority of time you spend using LLMs you’ll be using “autoregressive” ones: they generate the next token for you, token by token. There are however important LLMs that are trained to guess the missing token inside a block of text, that will use the tokens both before and after the target token to try and figure it out: guess the word, but the word in the middle of the sentence instead of the next word.\n\nOK, so we’ve learned what embeddings are, and they’re pretty darn cool, but why do we care? When are you, the busy young lady or young man, actually going to interact with an embedding? We hand-waved over it a little before, but the embeddings created using the same mechanism as LLMs (transformers) can take in very long pieces of text and give back exceptionally sophisticated vectors that capture complex meanings from that text. These aren’t just theoretical toys; they’re the mechanism behind a surprising amount of what we call AI today.\n\n(we’ve also pretended that embeddings are just for working with text, which also isn’t true, but we’re already at over 5,000 words here…)\n\nRemember classifying dogs? We picked the features: size, intelligence, fluffiness. Easy for dogs, but hopeless for text. Trying to hand-pick features for classifying emails or news articles (“Does it mention ‘invoice’?” “How many times does ‘politics’ appear?”) is fragile and labor-intensive. Embeddings flip this entirely. Instead of us telling the computer what features matter, the computer learns the important features itself when creating the embedding, using the guessing game we outlined above. These aren’t just keyword counts; they’re learned features capturing the underlying topic, the vibe, the subtle nuances.\n\nThink about classifying customer reviews as ‘Positive’ or ‘Negative’. A simple keyword approach gets tripped up by sarcasm, varied phrasing, or subtleties in word ordering. Embeddings, however, capture the overall essence. They turn the review into coordinates in a high-dimensional ‘meaning space’. A happy review’s embedding might land near coordinates representing ‘joy’ and ‘satisfaction’ (dimensions the model learned!), while an angry one lands near ‘frustration’. The magic is that embeddings handle nuance: synonyms like “happy,” “pleased,” and “elated” end up in the same positive neighborhood.\n\nSo, you feed this rich embedding – these coordinates packed with learned features and context – into a classifier model. The classifier’s job becomes much simpler: it just learns to draw boundaries in that meaning space. “Everything landing in this region is Positive, everything over there is Negative.” The embedding does the heavy lifting of understanding the text; the classifier just reads the map. It’s spookily effective.\n\nSometimes you don’t know in advance what categories you want to put things into. You’ve got a mountain of customer reviews, research papers, or social media posts, and you just want to know “what are the main themes here?” This is where clustering comes in, and embeddings super-charges it.\n\nBecause embeddings place texts with similar meanings close together in that high-dimensional space we keep talking about, we can use algorithms to automatically find groups, or “clusters,” of related items. Think back to our dogs: if we plotted thousands of individual dogs based only on their learned embeddings (without knowing breeds), clustering algorithms could find the clumps corresponding to Poodles or Beagles just by seeing which dogs’ vectors are close together.\n\nIt’s the same for text: these algorithms scan the positions (embeddings) of your documents in meaning-space and identify these natural groupings. Suddenly, you can see that your customer reviews naturally fall into clusters like “Complaints about Shipping”, “Praise for Product Quality”, and “Confused People Asking How To Turn It On”. No predefined categories needed, the structure just emerges from the meaning captured in the embeddings.\n\nThis is the technique du jour for making LLMs smarter and more factual, and it leans heavily on embeddings. The core idea is surprisingly elegant: when you ask an LLM a question, you first use the embedding of your question to find relevant pieces of information (like paragraphs from a document) from a database.\n\nHow? Because of a slightly magical property: the embedding for a question is often geometrically close to the embedding of the text containing its answer within that vector space. It’s like the question “Where is the Eiffel Tower?” generates a vector that points towards the same region of meaning-space as the text “The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.”\n\nSo, in a RAG system, you take the user’s query, generate the embedding for it, and then use a vector database (a fast database optimized for finding close vectors) to retrieve the chunks of text from your provided documents whose embeddings are closest. You then stuff these relevant chunks from your knowledge base into the prompt you give the LLM along with the original question. Voilà! The LLM now has the specific information needed to answer accurately, rather than just relying on its (potentially outdated or hallucinated) general knowledge. It’s like giving the LLM an open-book exam, using embeddings to find the right page in the textbook.\n\nOkay, slight caveat here: the final output embeddings we’ve discussed (like the ones you get from OpenAI’s API) aren’t exactly what LLMs use second-by-second to generate text. But the underlying principle is deeply connected.\n\nWhen an LLM is writing text, predicting the next token (word fragment), it maintains an internal “state.” This state is essentially a complex, evolving vector representation that captures the meaning and context of everything generated so far. Think of it as a temporary, super-sophisticated embedding of the preceding sequence. This internal state vector is what the LLM uses to figure out the probabilities for what the very next token should be.\n\nSo while you don’t directly use a final document embedding to generate text token-by-token, the same transformer architecture and attention mechanisms that create those powerful final embeddings are also at work inside the LLM, constantly creating and updating internal context vectors (which behave a lot like embeddings) to drive the generation process. It’s all part of the same family of vector-based meaning representation.\n\nSo, there you have it! Embeddings! Aren’t they cool?! We started with simple lists of numbers describing dogs, wrestled with the messy realities of counting words in books, and journeyed through decades of AI research, from Bag of Words to TF-IDF, Word2Vec, RNNs, and finally the mighty Transformers.\n\nWhat we ended up with are these dense, powerful vectors – embeddings – that somehow manage to capture the meaning of text in a way that computers can work with mathematically, while just literally being lists of numbers. They’re not just lists of word counts; they’re rich representations learned by machines playing incredibly complex guessing games, encoding semantic relationships, context, and nuance along dimensions we didn’t even know we needed.\n\nAre they slightly mysterious? Yes. Do we understand every nuance of why they work so well? Not entirely. But are they incredibly useful? Absolutely. From classifying spam, to finding themes in data, to making LLMs smarter with RAG, embeddings are a fundamental building block of modern AI. They might just be weirdly effective rows of numbers, but they’re our weirdly effective rows of numbers, and they’re changing how we interact with information. Thanks, embeddings.",

EU member states would also jointly assess risks across the EU's 18 critical sectors based onthe suppliers' countries of origin and national security implications.\n\n\"Cybersecurity threats are not just technical challenges. They are strategic risks to our democracy, economy, and way of life,\" EU tech commissioner Henna Virkkunen said today.\n\n\"With the new Cybersecurity Package, we will have the means in place to better protect our critical ICT supply chains but also to combat cyber attacks decisively. This is an important step in securing our European technological sovereignty and ensuring a greater safety for all.\"\n\nThe legislation also includes a revised Cybersecurity Act, designed to secure information and communication technology (ICT) supply chains, that mandates removing high-risk foreign suppliers from European mobile telecommunications networks.\n\nThe revised Cybersecurity Act will also streamline certification procedures for companies, allowing them to reduce regulatory burdens and costs through voluntary certification schemes managed by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA).\n\nAs the Commission further explained, the new legislation empowers ENISA to issue early threat alerts, operate a single entry point for incident reporting, and help companies in responding to ransomware attacks, in cooperation with Europol and computer security incident response teams.\n\nENISA will also establish EU-wide cybersecurity skills attestation schemes and pilot a Cybersecurity Skills Academy to build a European cybersecurity workforce.\n\nThe Cybersecurity Act will take effect immediately upon approval by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, with member states having one year to implement cybersecurity amendments into national law.\n\nWhether you're cleaning up old keys or setting guardrails for AI-generated code, this guide helps your team build securely from the start.\n\nGet the cheat sheet and take the guesswork out of secrets management.",

    "fullText": "Adios to casual dating: Young Americans are seeking committed life partners to split bills with.\n\nQuincy Yang, the co-CEO of dating app Coffee Meets Bagel, told Business Insider that money and economics are huge considerations for Gen Z when choosing a partner.\n\n\"It's so hard to afford to buy a house, or any property,\" Yang said, adding that a lot of younger people are staying at home with their parents. He said for older generations, it was more affordable to \"live the American dream\" of buying a home and starting a family.\n\n\"Now, you need dual incomes to afford just the median condo or house. You need to have a pretty good job; you can't slack off too much,\" he said.\n\nYang said the affordability crisis has affected dating. \"There's an incentive now to find a good partner who is financially stable and ambitious.\"\n\nShn Juay, Yang's co-CEO, said that this is evident in Gen Zers not being as into hookups as older generations.\n\n\"When you talk about dating apps, the first thing that comes to mind will be hookups,\" she said. \"But the Gen Zs are really more conscious about more real things in their life, they're not into hookups. Unlike the previous generation, what they imagine of an ideal partner is very pragmatic.\"\n\nThe CEOs said that daters should choose dealbreakers judiciously while finding a partner.\n\n\"You can always go for a higher degree, or you get promoted along the way, but not at age 28 years old, where everybody's probably still really early in their career,\" Juay told Business Insider.\n\nLiving in the US is more expensive than ever.\n\nHousing costs have been rising faster than incomes over the last two decades, according to a June 2024 report by the US Treasury Department.\n\nGrocery prices are not providing any relief. US food prices rose nearly 25% from 2020 to 2024, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on foreign goods this year has exacerbated this problem by forcing retailers like Walmart and Target to raise prices.\n\nIn this climate, living alone has become an unaffordable luxury for many Americans.\n\nA Pew Research Center study released in January said more US adults are living with a partner. The study analyzed US Census Bureau data and found that the percentage of adults living without a partner decreased from 44% in 2019 to 42% in 2023.\n\nSo naturally, finances are a big priority for daters.\n\nIn November, the dating app, which has around 20 million users worldwide, conducted a survey of about 1,050 of its users in the US between the ages of 21 and 35. The respondents were working professionals who said they were either actively seeking a relationship or open to one.\n\nThe survey revealed that financial stability was a top priority for them, with 54% of the respondents listing it as such. Almost 60% labeled \"ambition/drive\" as a must-have in a potential partner, even more than having shared interests.\n\n\"While many are looking for someone to spend their life with, practical matters still reign supreme,\" said Coffee Meets Bagel, which markets its app as \"for serious daters.\"",

    "description": "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that retailers are running out of stockpiled goods imported before tariffs and \"don't have endless options.\"",
    "fullText": "Tariff price hikes are starting to show up in your Amazon shopping cart.\n\nThe CEO of Amazon, Andy Jassy, told CNBC in an interview with reporter Becky Quick at the World Economic Forum in Davos that vendors are running out of stockpiled goods imported ahead of Trump's tariffs, and that consumers will be \"starting to see more of that impact.\"\n\n\"So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items,\" said Jassy, \"And you see some sellers are deciding that they're passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they'll absorb it to drive demand, and some are doing something in between.\"\n\nJassy also said that though the company is striving to \"keep prices as low as possible,\" price hikes may sometimes be inevitable.\n\n\"At a certain point, because retail is, as you know, a mid-single digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it,\" Jassy added. \"You don't have endless options.\"\n\nWhile Amazon's shopping business has its own products, it mainly serves as an ecommerce platform for other independent sellers, so it cannot control price hikes. Earlier in Trump's tariff push, a rumour that Amazon would start displaying exactly how much tariffs contributed to the cost of an item drew the president's ire. Amazon said it never made such plans.\n\nIn June 2025, Jassy told CNBC in an interview that many of Amazon's third-party selling partners \"forward deployed a lot of inventory\" to avoid \"issues with the uncertainty around where tariffs are going to settle,\" adding that at that point, he did not see \"prices appreciably go up.\"\n\nThe bulk of Trump's tariffs have been enacted under presidential emergency powers, including the 10% baseline levy on almost all imports. His right to impose such duties is being reviewed by the US Supreme Court after multiple small businesses filed lawsuits.\n\nIf SCOTUS rules these tariffs unconstitutional, Scott Bessent, the Secretary of the Treasury, said in a court document that the government could be on the hook to refund $1 trillion to businesses that paid. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank, 96% of the new revenue collected by the US Customs is being paid by American consumers, while foreign exporters only shouldered 4% of the burden.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "The order comes with a carveout: build-to-rent properties that were designed to be rental communities will not be affected.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday seeking to limit large Wall Street investors from buying single-family homes, as part of his push to make essentials more affordable for Americans.\n\nThe order details a multi-pronged plan targeting large investors. It includes measures that would restrict institutional investors from buying homes that individuals could purchase, combat speculation in the single-family housing market, and conduct antitrust reviews of acquisitions.\n\nThe order comes with an important exception: build-to-rent properties that were designed and constructed as rental communities. The order also says there may be other \"narrowly tailored exceptions.\"\n\nPer the order, the Treasury Department has a month to develop definitions of \"large institutional investors\" and \"single-family homes.\" Relevant federal agencies have 60 days to look at ways to prohibit the buying of single-family homes by large entities.\n\n\"Neighborhoods and communities once controlled by middle-class American families are now run by faraway corporate interests. People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump said in the order.\n\nTrump first proposed the order in a Truth Social post earlier this month. \"For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,\" Trump wrote. \"That American dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans.\"\n\nA day later, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Trump's proposal would not force large entities to sell their current holdings.\n\n\"These big institutions buy housing, then rent them out, and they're able to depreciate it. They hide their earnings, pay lower taxes,\" he said.\n\n\"The idea here is bygones are bygones,\" Bessent added. \"We're not going to have a forced sale here.\"\n\nAfter Trump's Truth Social post earlier this month, shares of asset manager Blackstone fell 5.6%. Blackstone, which manages $1 trillion in assets, oversees one of the largest rental housing portfolios in the US, with several hundred thousand single-family homes and apartments. Other stocks similarly fell.\n\nCritics say firms like New York-based Blackstone put pressure on the housing market, reducing the availability of homes and driving prices up.\n\nThe institutional players, meanwhile, say lack of housing supply — not big-business ownership — is pushing prices up.\n\nAmong Trump's efforts to address affordability concerns, the president also called for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates, arguing that consumers are being \"ripped off\" by rates that he said can be as high as 20% or 30%. Banks and business leaders said that the rule would ultimately curtail the availability of credit for borrowers who rely on it.",

    "fullText": "After months of unexplained fatigue, an xAI cofounder says he's stepping back from the company following a Lyme disease diagnosis.\n\nGreg Yang said in a post on X published Tuesday that he will move into an informal advisory role at Elon Musk's startup xAI immediately so he can \"go founder mode on my health.\"\n\nLyme disease is a bacterial infection typically transmitted by ticks and is known for symptoms that can linger or worsen over time.\n\nYang said his symptoms began after an illness in early 2025, when he noticed lingering fatigue and a drop in energy and creativity weeks after he believed he had recovered.\n\nOver time, the symptoms worsened, with workouts or certain foods leaving him exhausted for days, he said.\n\n\"​​There was a week where I slept 12 hours a day and still couldn't recover,\" he added.\n\nAfter multiple rounds of testing, Yang said his doctor diagnosed him with Lyme disease, a condition that is \"famously hard to diagnose.\"\n\nHe said that he was surprised by the diagnosis, as he did not recall a tick bite.\n\n\"Likely I contracted Lyme a long time ago, but until I pushed myself hard building xAI and weakened my immune system, the symptoms weren't noticeable,\" he added.\n\nDespite the setback, Yang said he felt \"lucky\" to have caught the condition relatively early. He said discovering it now would allow him to \"fix it so I can push myself even harder when I rebound.\"\n\nIn response to Yang's X post, Musk replied that he hoped Yang would \"get well soon.\"\n\n\"Maybe Grok will find a cure!\" Musk added.\n\nYang joined xAI as a cofounder in June 2023, after spending nearly six years as a researcher at Microsoft, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nYang's move comes after two other xAI cofounders, Igor Babuschkin and Christian Szegedy, left the company last year.",

He gave the example of the Diet Coke Fiber+ drink from Coca-Cola, which has been available in Japan since 2017.\n\nThe drink is advertised as sugar- and calorie-free, with five grams of dietary fiber per bottle.\n\nThe drink was part of a \"fast-growing segment where ingredients are added to beverages to address specific dietary needs,\" Quincey said in 2017.\n\nHowever, he said on Tuesday's Squawk Box that Diet Coke Fiber+ was still a \"niche\" drink, because \"people don't buy drinks to have their fiber.\"\n\nQuincey's comments echo those of other food and beverage executives who have predicted the rise of fiber this year.\n\nMcDonald's CEO, Chris Kempczinski, took to Instagram last week to predict his top three food trends for 2026, and the first item on the list was fiber. He said fiber was \"going to be big\" this year.\n\nPepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta predicted in an October earnings call that \"fiber will be the next protein.\"\n\nThe term \"fibermaxxing\" was a viral health trend on social media in 2025, with dieticians saying that it helps aid gut health, lower cholesterol, and reduce the risk of colon cancer.\n\nAnd cabbage, a fiber-rich vegetable, is having its moment on social media, with Pinterest predicting that the vegetable would trend highest on social media in the US in 2026.\n\nPinterest released its annual trends report in December, which showed that the search term \"cabbage dumplings\" rose 110% from September 2024 to August 2025, compared to the same period the year before.",

    "description": "A new report warns the U.S. could lose the ability to sustain combat within weeks of a China war over Taiwan, as munitions run dry, logistics collapse and global markets face a $10T shock.",
    "fullText": "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration asked for redactions to a sweeping new Heritage Foundation report modeling a potential U.S.–China war over Taiwan, even though the analysis relied entirely on publicly available, unclassified data, according to the report’s authors.\n\nThe redacted report, TIDALWAVE, warns that the United States could reach a breaking point within weeks of a high‑intensity conflict with China — conclusions that the authors say prompted senior national security officials to seek redactions over concerns adversaries could exploit the findings or use them to identify U.S. and allied military vulnerabilities.\n\nThose conclusions include warnings that U.S. forces would culminate far sooner than China, suffer catastrophic losses to aircraft and sustainment infrastructure in the Pacific, and still fail to prevent a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, nearly a tenth of global GDP.\n\nSKIES AT STAKE: INSIDE THE US-CHINA RACE FOR AIR DOMINANCE\n\nAccording to the report's authors, the AI‑enabled model drew exclusively on open‑source government, academic, industry and commercial information. An unredacted version of the report was provided to authorized U.S. government recipients for internal use.\n\nUnlike traditional tabletop war games, TIDALWAVE employs an AI‑enabled model that runs thousands of iterations, tracking how losses in platforms, munitions, and fuel compound over time and drive cascading operational failure early in the conflict.\n\nAccording to a Heritage spokesperson, the report had been shown to \"high-level national security officials\" who requested some of the specifics be crossed out in black ink before its release to the public. The report still details how quickly U.S. forces could reach a breaking point and why the conflict would carry global consequences.\n\n\"Redactions were made at the request of the U.S. government to prevent disclosure of information that could reasonably enable an adversary to (1) re mediate or ‘close’ critical vulnerabilities that the United States and its allies could otherwise exploit, or (2) identify or exploit U.S. and allied vulnerabilities in ways that could degrade operational endurance, resilience, or deterrence,\" the report said.\n\nA Department of War spokesperson declined to comment on discussions surrounding TIDALWAVE's publication, but added: \"The Department of War does not endorse, validate, or adjudicate third-party analyses, nor do we engage publicly on hypothetical conflict modeling. As a general matter, we take seriously the protection of information that, if aggregated or contextualized, could have implications for operational security.\"\n\nThe White House could not be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to the report’s redacted findings, the U.S. would culminate in less than half the time required for the People's Republic of China in a high-intensity conflict. Culmination is defined as the point at which a force becomes incapable of continuing operations due to the loss of platforms, ammunition and/or fuel.\n\nThe report is explicit that the first 30 days to 60 days of a U.S.-China war determine its long-term shape and outcome, as early losses in aircraft, ships, fuel throughput and munitions rapidly compound and cannot be recovered on operationally relevant timelines.\n\nThe report concludes that the U.S. is not equipped nor arrayed to protect and sustain the Joint Force in a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. Rapid platform attrition, brittle logistics, concentrated basing and insufficient industrial surge capacity combine to force an early operational breaking point for American forces.\n\nThe report warns that U.S. reliance on a few large, concentrated forward bases — particularly in Japan and Guam — leaves American airpower dangerously exposed to Chinese missile forces.\n\nIn multiple scenarios, up to 90% of U.S. and allied aircraft positioned at major forward bases are destroyed on the ground during the opening phase of the conflict, as runways, fuel depots, command facilities and parked aircraft are hit simultaneously.\n\nThe report finds that critical U.S. precision‑guided munitions — including long‑range anti‑ship missiles, air‑to‑air interceptors and missile‑defense systems — begin to be unavailable within five to seven days of major combat operations. Across most scenarios, those critical munitions are completely exhausted within 35 days to 40 days, leaving U.S. forces unable to sustain high‑tempo combat.\n\nFuel emerges as the most decisive vulnerability of all. The report makes a critical distinction: the U.S. does not run out of fuel in most scenarios — it loses the ability to move fuel under fire.\n\nCHINA’S MISSILE SURGE PUTS EVERY US BASE IN THE PACIFIC AT RISK — AND THE WINDOW TO RESPOND IS CLOSING\n\nChinese doctrine explicitly prioritizes attacks on logistics vessels, ports, pipelines and replenishment tankers. Even limited tanker losses, port disruptions or pipeline severance are sufficient to drive fuel throughput below survivable levels, forcing commanders to sharply curtail air and naval operations despite fuel remaining in aggregate stockpiles.\n\nChinese ammunition stockpiles of critical munitions begin to be depleted after approximately 20 days to 30 days of major combat operations. However, substitution effects extend China’s ability to sustain combat operations out to months — well beyond the point at which U.S. forces culminate, according to the report.\n\nThe consequences extend far beyond the battlefield.\n\nThe redacted report concludes the U.S. is highly unlikely to prevent massive global economic fallout once a Taiwan conflict begins.\n\nDisruption of shipping lanes, destruction of critical infrastructure and the collapse of Taiwan’s semiconductor production would trigger a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, with enduring ripple effects across financial markets, manufacturing and global trade.\n\nThe report comes amid years of concern over U.S. military readiness and industrial capacity, as China rapidly expands its naval forces and shipbuilding base.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates a smaller fleet than planned, while American shipyards face workforce shortages, aging infrastructure and chronic delays — even as China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, continues to outpace the U.S. in producing new naval hulls.\n\nWar Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders have vowed to put the Pentagon on a wartime footing for industrial capacity.\n\nPerhaps most alarming, TIDALWAVE warns that the scale of losses in the Indo‑Pacific would leave the U.S. unable to deter or respond effectively to a second major conflict elsewhere in the world.\n\nA war over Taiwan could open the door to follow‑on aggression by adversaries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, fundamentally destabilizing the global security order.\n\nThe report is blunt in its assessment: existing Pentagon programs and congressional funding are too slow, too fragmented and too modest to address the scale of the challenge. In many cases, the timeline required to fix critical vulnerabilities exceeds the likely timeline to conflict.\n\nTo avoid what the authors describe as a strategic defeat, the report urges Congress to immediately expand munitions stockpiles, strengthen fuel reserves and distribution infrastructure, harden and disperse forward bases, and accelerate sustainment and logistics reforms. Without rapid action, the authors warn, the U.S. risks entering a conflict it is structurally unprepared to fight or sustain.\n\nWith intelligence warnings mounting that China could move on Taiwan before the end of the decade, TIDALWAVE cautions that the window to correct these deficiencies may be closing faster than Washington is prepared to act.",

    "description": "Here what it means if you feel relieved when someone cancels plans.",
    "fullText": "If your first emotion after someone cancels is relief instead of disappointment, it’s worth paying attention to that reaction. Relief is data. It tells you something about your energy, boundaries, and how that relationship fits into your life. If this happens more often than you expect, these reasons may explain why.\n\nRelief often shows up when your schedule is stretched thin. You may have agreed to plans out of habit, not capacity. The cancellation gives you breathing room you didn’t realize you needed. Your body relaxes before your mind catches up.\n\nBurnout research shows that chronic overcommitment dulls our ability to notice exhaustion until it’s relieved. Relief is the signal. It means rest mattered more than attendance. That’s not laziness—it’s self-preservation.\n\nSometimes, relief simply means the plan didn’t align with your desires. You said yes to be polite, loyal, or avoid awkwardness. The cancellation removes the obligation. Honesty arrives late.\n\nThis pattern often reflects people-pleasing tendencies. Psychologists note that suppressed preferences resurface as relief when obligations disappear. It’s not antisocial—it’s misaligned consent.\n\nIf relief follows a cancellation consistently with the same person, the relationship may require more energy than it gives. Conversation feels effortful. You prepare emotionally before seeing them. The relief tells you something isn’t balanced.\n\nEmotional labor research shows that one-sided relational effort increases fatigue. Relief is your nervous system standing down. It doesn’t lie.\n\nPlans made out of obligation often feel heavy. You may have worried about expectations, small talk, or performing socially. When those pressures vanish, relief follows. Your system returns to baseline.\n\nSocial anxiety studies highlight anticipatory stress as a major driver of avoidance relief. Even enjoyable people can feel overwhelmed under pressure. Relief reflects reduced threat, not rejection.\n\nSpontaneous free time can feel like oxygen. If relief shows up, it may mean you’re craving autonomy. Plans remove flexibility. Cancellation restores choice.\n\nTime-use research suggests unstructured time improves mood and creativity. Relief is your mind welcoming space. It’s a legitimate need, not a flaw.\n\nEmotional capacity fluctuates. On days when you’ve already held space for others, additional interaction feels taxing. Cancellation gives you permission to stop giving. Relief follows naturally.\n\nTherapists often describe this as emotional saturation. When capacity is exceeded, even neutral interactions feel heavy. Relief is a sign that you reached your limit.\n\nSome plans require energy you don’t have—enthusiasm, conversation, presence. If relief appears, you may have been bracing for performance. Cancellation removes the stage.\n\nSocial performance fatigue is increasingly discussed in mental health research. Constant self-monitoring drains energy. Relief is rest from being observed.\n\nIf you feel relieved not to engage, it may be because the interaction doesn’t feel fully safe. You filter yourself. You manage reactions. That vigilance is exhausting.\n\nPsychological safety research shows that environments requiring self-censorship increase stress. Relief means the vigilance stopped. That matters.\n\nSometimes, relief signals transition. What once fit no longer does. The cancellation confirms a quiet truth you’ve been avoiding. Growth creates distance.\n\nDevelopmental psychology notes that relational needs evolve over time. Relief doesn’t mean the relationship was bad—it means it may be complete.\n\nConnection is valuable, but so is recovery. If relief shows up, your body may be asking for stillness instead. Rest becomes the priority. That’s information, not failure.\n\nBurnout studies consistently show recovery is essential for relational health. You can’t connect well when depleted. Relief honors that limit.\n\nSometimes plans don’t account for your needs or preferences. You go along anyway. Cancellation feels relieving because it removes that invisibility. You don’t have to adapt.\n\nRelational satisfaction research links feeling seen to engagement. Relief signals that visibility was missing. That’s worth noticing.\n\nHabitual yeses disconnect you from desire. Relief interrupts that pattern. It creates a pause. You get a moment to recalibrate.\n\nBehavioral studies show automatic compliance increases resentment over time. Relief is the emotional correction. It invites choice back in.\n\nAt its core, relief is physiological. Tension leaves your body. Shoulders drop. Breath deepens. That response doesn’t happen without reason.\n\nSomatic psychology emphasizes that the body registers truth before the mind does. Relief isn’t random. It’s communication. And it deserves your attention.",

    "fullText": "In aviation, the Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) is the primary certification that allows a civil airline to start running and selling flights to passengers.\n\nIn the U.S., it is given out by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), while equivalent government agencies granting AOCs include the Civil Aviation Authority in the United Kingdom, Transport Canada, the Direction générale de l’aviation civile in France, and Luftfartsverket, or the Swedish Civil Aviation Administration, in Sweden.\n\nReceiving the AOC requires the airline to prove that it has the necessary planes, staff, safety systems and financial resources to both run flights and remain a functional airline into the coming years.\n\nAs aviation is a particularly costly industry, lack of funds has caused multiple airlines to shut down and eventually lose their AOC license in the last year.\n\nLast November, Lithuanian aviation company Aviation Solutions Group ended all operations of the SmartLynx airline when authorities in Estonia revoked its license in the country. The AOCs for branches in Latvia and Malta were subsequently sold to Dutch hedge-fund company Stitching Break Point, in the hopes that an airline may be able to relaunch after finding an investor.\n\nIn the U.S., charter seaplane airline Tailwind Air lost its license in January 2025 after branding itself as a luxury transportation company, but then struggling to bring in the necessary traffic on its routes between Northeastern cities like New York and Boston.\n\nAs first reported by ch-aviation, the latest airline to lose its AOC license is Swedish charter airline H-Bird. A spokesperson for the Swedish Transport Agency (Transportstyrelsen) confirmed that the airline, launched in 1991 to run charter flights to remote parts of Swedish from Stockholm and several other European cities, lost its operating license on Dec. 5, 2025, over financing issues.\n\nWhile very few details around whether it has filed for bankruptcy are publicly available, the situation looks very similar to that of Tailwind Air. The airline targeted high-end travelers who book charter flights, but it was unable to bring in enough customers to remain profitable.\n\nThe airline has not run any flights since the start of 2026; it is unclear whether any travelers were affected by cancellations.\n\nSpirit Airlines (Spirit Aviation Holdings, Inc.): Filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time on August 29,2025.\n\nRavn Alaska: Ceased operations in August 2025 after earlier Chapter 11 proceedings; shut down flights and folded into other operations such as New Pacific.\n\nCorporate Air: Filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (restructuring) in September 2025 as part of a planned sale, according to Bondoro.\n\nPlay Airlines: The Reykjavik-based airline shut down operations and entered involuntary bankruptcy in September 2025.\n\nBraathens Airlines:The airline was forced to file for bankruptcy and canceled all of its flights in September 2025.",

    "fullText": "Earlier this month, NASA announced that it had to cancel a scheduled spacewalk, citing a “medical situation” affecting a “single crew member who is stable” on board the International Space Station.\n\nThe mystery illness eventually led to the space agency staging the first medical evacuation in 25 years of continuous operation on board the aging orbital outpost, rushing four astronauts back to Earth in a move that brought the station’s number of occupants from seven to a skeleton crew of just three.\n\nWhile the medical incident only affected a single astronaut, who has yet to be identified for privacy reasons, all four members of the Crew-11 mission cut their time on board the ISS short by weeks, safely splashing down off the coast of San Diego early Thursday morning.\n\nThe four astronauts were airlifted to the Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego via helicopter for a “planned overnight stay at a local medical facility for additional evaluation,” according to a January 16 statement. After being “released as expected,” they continued their journey to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will “continue standard postflight reconditioning and evaluations.”\n\nDo you know anything about what caused the evacuation from the ISS? Drop us a line at tips@futurism.com. We can keep you anonymous.\n\n“All crew members remain stable,” the space agency reassured. “To protect the crew’s medical privacy, no specific details regarding the condition or individual will be shared.”\n\nIt’s an exceedingly rare event, highlighting the challenges inherent to providing healthcare in space. While hundreds of miles above the surface, specialized care is hard, if not impossible, to execute. While astronauts undergo rigorous EMT-level training so they can respond to emergencies on board the station, they aren’t full-blown medical professionals, and can only do so much under the direction of doctors back on Earth.\n\nThere’s a lot to still learn about providing care during medical emergencies, particularly when it comes to long-duration space exploration missions into deep space. According to a 2022 study, there still are plenty of “gaps in knowledge regarding the potential for unanticipated in-flight medical events to affect crew health and capacity, and potentially compromise mission success.”\n\nAs researchers from Northumbria University in Newcastle point out in a recent essay for The Conversation, medical emergencies are remarkably rare on the ISS, despite being expected to occur on average every three years. Studies have shown that the most common health issues astronauts experience are skin irritation, congestion, disruptions to sleep, and in-flight injuries — most of which are ironically caused by exercise, which is designed to protect astronauts’ long-term health.\n\nSpending prolonged periods in a microgravity environment has also been shown to affect astronauts’ vision and blood pressure.\n\nNow that there’s finally been a medical emergency on the station, though, it’s unclear whether the public — or even the broader medical community — will ever find out any details.\n\nMore on the evacuation: Entire Space Station Down to Skeleton Crew After NASA Evacuation",

    "description": "Scientists discovered ancient micro-burrows in desert rocks likely made by microbes millions of years ago, though their exact identity and fate remain unknown.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nMysterious micro-burrows in desert marble and limestone were probably made by microbes that lived millions of years ago.\n\nExactly what kind of microbes bored into the rock remains unknown, as does whether they still exist or have long since gone extinct.\n\nWhatever formed the burrows had to be alive, since researchers were able to rule out weathering and abiotic processes.\n\nFor most organisms on Earth, rocks are objects, not food. But for one oddball microbe, desert limestone seems to have been on the menu. Whether or not this mysterious form of life still exists or went extinct eons ago is, however, yet unknown.\n\nRecently, geologist Cees Passchier from Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz came across what looked like tiny burrows in marble and limestone in the deserts of Namibia, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. Erosion had exposed the fossil burrows, and while nothing was crawling in there anymore, Passchier and his research team investigated further and found biological material inside.\n\n“A biotic origin of the observed structures supposes the presence of liquid water, without which biological growth would be impossible,” the team said in a study published in the Geomicrobiology Journal. “The investigated areas are currently arid, but experience occasional rain showers and regular dense coastal fog, while wet periods occurred in the past.”\n\nSo, what type of microogranisms could have made the burrows? Bacteria, fungi and lichens have shown that they can survive extreme conditions, and some of them are endolithic, meaning they live inside rocks. Passchier wanted to see if the organisms that created the burrows could possibly belong to any of these groups. Fungi can bore through rocks and leave behind tubes, and some types of cyanobacteria also thrive off limestone or marble.\n\nIt is unlikely that the mystery organisms were cyanobacteria—they need sunlight for photosynthesis, so they don’t bore nearly as deep into rock as the burrows that the team found. Fungi secrete digestive agents that were not present in the rock, and they also create a complex network of hyphae, or filaments, known as a mycelium. Mycelial networks tend to have order to them. The burrows were parallel and evenly spaced, which would be unusual for fungi, and there were no other patterns observed. So, they probably aren’t the culprits, either.\n\nBecause the burrows were found to be too wide to have only been made by one organism at a time, and they showed growth rings, its was more likely that they were formed by colonies of microbes. Calcium carbonate dust found in the tunnels is also a common excretion from microbes that live in these types of rocks. However, no fossilized organisms have yet been found—just evidence of their existence.\n\nThese setbacks, however, did not rule out the idea of life. On the contrary—while weathering or abiotic chemical processes can create structures mistaken for signs of life, a thorough microscopic examination showed this was not the case. The chemical composition of rock samples from inside the burrows showed that whatever made them had to have been alive.\n\n“As no known chemical or physical weathering mechanism can explain this phenomenon with the microstructural and geochemical observations presented here, and the micro-burrows form inside the host rock,” Passchier and his colleagues said in the same study, “we suggest that they are of biological origin.”\n\nWhatever microbes carved out the tunnels have been long dead, though there are questions around whether the mystery species still exists. Maybe it’s still creeping around somewhere, digging new tunnel systems for us to one day uncover.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk wagered a free Cybertruck on an xAI engineer completing a GPU training run in 24 hours.\n\nThe engineer did it, and that Cybertruck is now parked outside the xAI office, ex-staffer Sulaiman Ghori said on \"Relentless.\"\n\nIt's the latest example of how much Musk appreciates speed in execution.\n\nDangling a free Cybertruck in front of an employee is one way to get results.\n\nElon Musk made the unusual offer when xAI's engineers were setting up new GPU racks, according to then-technical staff member Sulaiman Ghori.\n\n\"Elon's like, 'OK, you can get a Cybertruck tonight if you can get a training run on these GPUs in 24 hours,'\" Ghori said on \"Relentless.\"\n\nThe engineer — whom Ghori only referred to by their first name, Tyler — won the bet. Now, Ghori said he sees Tyler's Cybertruck outside his lunch window.\n\nIt's yet another example of Musk's drive for efficiency in execution. Employees at his companies are known to accept lower salaries but higher stock grants, betting their compensation on the company's performance. That's partly because of Musk's track record of growing startups into highly valued companies.\n\nFour days after the podcast was published, Ghori revealed that he left xAI. \"Nothing but love to my former team and coworkers!\" he wrote on X.\n\nSome famous faces popped in to question the timing of his exit. \"Is it because of the podcast?\" MrBeast replied, adding a popcorn emoji.\n\nMusk has been known to make bets with his employees. Almost two decades ago, he reportedly wagered against early SpaceX employee Steve Davis. Davis put up $20; Musk put up the possibility of a SpaceX frozen yogurt machine. Davis won, and employees on the Hawthorne campus enjoyed their free fro-yo.\n\nIt helps that Musk's companies tend to have a flat org structure, giving Musk one-on-one contact with many of his employees. In the interview, Ghori said that there were three levels at xAI: individual contributors, cofounders, and Musk himself.\n\n\"No one tells me 'no,'\" Ghori said. He explained that, if he has a good idea, he can pursue it that same day and show it to Musk or the relevant customer.\n\nThere are also few deadlines, Ghori said, because projects are pitched and completed quickly.\n\n\"We don't have due dates,\" he said. \"It's always yesterday.\"\n\nThe fast-paced, individualistic culture may take some getting used to. Ghori came to xAI after years as a startup founder. There was little guidance.\n\n\"Nobody told me what to do,\" Ghori said. \"My first day, they just gave me a laptop and a badge.\"",

    "fullText": "RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — An 18-year-old plans to plead guilty to a 2022 mass shooting in North Carolina that left five people dead — including his older brother — avoiding a trial next month, his attorneys said Tuesday.\n\nA written notice filed in Wake County court by the lawyers for Austin Thompson said their client intends to plead guilty to all charges against him.\n\nThompson was 15 when authorities believe he went on a killing rampage on Oct. 13, 2022, beginning in his Raleigh neighborhood with his 16-year-old brother. A hearing ahead of his scheduled Feb. 2 trial was set for Wednesday.\n\nBut through the intended plea, Thompson “has decided he wishes to save the community and the victims from as much additional infliction of trauma as possible,” attorneys Kellie Mannette and Deonte’ Thomas wrote. The attorneys didn't immediately respond to emails Tuesday seeking additional information on the decision.\n\nThompson’s legal proceedings were delayed in part as he recovered from a gunshot wound that a prosecutor concluded was self-inflicted before his arrest. His attorneys say it resulted in a brain injury.\n\nProsecutors had not revealed a potential motive for the shootings but in a court filing said they had intended to prove Thompson's actions, among other factors, were “especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel” and that he attempted to avoid custody.\n\nTuesday’s filing by Thompson’s attorneys said that while “the serious brain injury he suffered has made it such that Austin cannot explain why he committed this shooting, he has always accepted that he did this.”\n\nThompson was charged as an adult on five counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon and one count of assault of an officer with a gun. A sentencing hearing would be held later after any plea.\n\nBecause of his age at the time of the attack, Thompson could not receive the death penalty if convicted. The case judge could decide to sentence him to life in prison without parole on murder counts, or the judge could grant at sentencing the possibility of parole after at least 25 years.\n\nWake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman said Tuesday that she was aware of the plea notice. “We are ready to move forward. Our thoughts are with the families of the victims,\" Freeman added in a text message later.\n\nThompson hopes “that the material presented at the sentencing hearing brings as much peace and closure as possible,” his attorneys wrote.\n\nProsecutors contend that Thompson shot and stabbed his brother James, whose body was found in their home.\n\nPolice also said they believed Thompson then shot multiple neighbors on the Hedingham community's streets, killing off-duty Raleigh police Officer Gabriel Torres, 29, and Nicole Connors, 52. Another neighbor who was wounded survived.\n\nThey also alleged that he later fatally shot two others on the nearby Neuse River Greenway trail: Mary Marshall, 34, and Susan Karnatz, 49.\n\nDressed in camouflage with multiple weapons strapped to his belt, Thompson was located by law enforcement in a shed nearby and arrested after an hourslong standoff that resulted in another police officer being wounded.\n\nThompson’s attorneys had indicated last year that they intended to use “diminished capacity” and “voluntary intoxication ... of a prescribed medication” in his defense.\n\nIn 2024, Thompson’s father pleaded guilty to improperly storing a handgun that authorities said was found with his son after the shootings. He received a suspended sentence and probation.\n\nInvestigators seized 11 firearms and 160 boxes of ammunition — some of them empty — from the Thompson home, according to search warrants.",

    "description": "He isn't known for having the most refined palate, so it's no surprise that President Donald Trump eats this instead of the fancy food at state dinners.",
    "fullText": "A White House insider shared the go-to meal that President Donald Trump likes to fill up on before attending formal engagements with esteemed guests, and to absolutely no one's surprise, it's a burger. In an episode of the Daily Beast's show \"Inside Trump's Head,\" journalist Michael Wolff said the president eats a burger meal prior to attending state dinners. He reportedly pokes at the fancy food he's routinely served on the job, using the strategy of talking constantly to distract other attendees from noticing that he's barely eating.\n\nTrump has a well-documented love affair with fast food, dating back to his first term when he served a spread of burgers and pizza to the Clemson University football team after they won the college national championship. He favored fast food on the campaign trail for his second term, even stopping to pose for a now-famous photo op with McDonald's fries in hand. Trump has reportedly reasoned that eating fast food makes him relatable to average Americans.\n\nThe president's association with fast food earns him both praise and criticism. With his long history of showmanship, some observers, such as the users on Reddit's r/Pics, have even questioned whether his preferences are authentic or endorsed. But as Wolff confirmed, Trump's love for burgers is the real thing — even behind closed doors.\n\nFurther into the episode of \"In Trump's Head,\" Wolff reveals that staff traveling with Trump aboard Air Force One are given care packages of fast food as perks of the job. Apparently, most staff members don't eat the White House food, which Wolff describes as being bland and mass produced in banquet fashion — similar to something served at a wedding. When host Joanna Coles read through a menu of courses served at a 2018 state dinner in honor of French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron, Wolff replied that Trump would not have touched any of it.\n\nWhile it's not uncommon for what President Trump eats in a typical day to end up in the news or even his personal social media, perhaps lesser known is the fact that former presidents and their inner circles also favored burgers and fries. Fast food appears to have been woven into the culture in Washington for decades. Our list of other politicians who are obsessed with fast food includes Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Ted Cruz, and others. Most figures on our list are noted to blur the lines between business and pleasure when it comes to their love of fast food, similar to the way Trump does.\n\nFor more food and drink goodness, Get taste tests, food & drink news, deals from your favorite chains, recipes, cooking tips, and more!",

The Single Best Piece of Dave Ramsey Advice I Think About Almost Every Day",
    "fullText": "Personal finance icon Dave Ramsey is among the leading voices on everything tied to individuals' personal finances across America. His call-in radio show, seminars, books and other information on how individuals can achieve financial freedom have provided millions with a road map for how to get out of debt and break into a stage of abundance in life.\n\nLiving on less than you make creates margin for debt payoff and retirement investing.\n\nRamsey recommends investing 15% for retirement and maximizing Roth IRAs below income thresholds.\n\nPaying off vehicles creates additional margin before tackling mortgage paydown.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.\n\nNow, Dave Ramsey has some rather controversial views around debt, with an overarching theme that debt is far too risky for most households and should be paid off. His personal mantra is to be debt-free, invest at least 15% for retirement, and pay off one's house as soon as possible to achieve these goals. His \"baby step\" program provides the roadmap for how investors can become debt free and invest for one's future, with relatively simple concepts put forward in a bid to speak to every American wherever they are on their journey.\n\nThat said, aside from the baby steps program (which I'd argue is great, particularly for those who are deep in the hole in terms of their debt load), there's one piece of financial advice Dave Ramsey continues to espouse I think applies to everyone, no matter their current financial state.\n\nNo matter whether you make $50,000 per year, $100,000 per year or $1 million per year, achieving any level of financial success simply isn't possible over the long-term without adhering to this simple (but essential) principle of living on less than you make.\n\nDave Ramsey and other personal finance experts all point to the fact that plenty of folks with ultra-high levels of income can, in many cases, have a smaller investing portfolio than teachers, firefighters and others with modest salaries who consistently put capital away in their employee retirement accounts and other vehicles such as Roth IRAs.\n\nIndeed, Ramsey is among the growing chorus of experts who suggest that investors who are below the income thresholds which exclude some from investing in Roth IRAs to maximize these accounts first. Receiving one's employee match, and other key pieces of advice around investing are included in the later stages of the baby steps, with the first few steps tied mostly to building an emergency fund and paying down debt.",

    "title": "It's been 1 year of Trump's second term. More Americans than ever think he's 'changing America for the worse.'",
    "description": "A growing number also say Trump has been a worse president than they expected, according to a new Yahoo/YouGov poll.",
    "fullText": "It has been exactly one year since Donald Trump was re-inaugurated as president, becoming just the second U.S. commander in chief to return to the White House after losing reelection four years earlier.\n\nNow, at the end of Trump’s first year back in office, a new Yahoo/YouGov poll finds that more Americans than ever think he’s been a “worse president than they expected” — and that he’s “changing America for the worse” as well.\n\nThe survey of 1,709 U.S. adults was conducted from Jan. 8 to 12, right after Trump toppled Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, threatened to forcibly take Greenland from Denmark and mused about using the Insurrection Act against anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis — and right before he and his team celebrated “One Year of MAGA” with a series of posts on social media.\n\n“One year ago, everything changed,” the official White House account wrote on X. “The return of strength. The return of America First. The era of winning is here — and it’s just getting started.”\n\nBut a growing number of Americans seem to disagree. For instance, 49% now say Trump is changing America for the worse — compared to just 34% who say he is changing America for the better. (Only 7% say he’s “not really changing anything.”)\n\nLast March, Trump’s “for the worse” number was 6 percentage points lower (43%) and his “for the better” number was 6 points higher (40%). The gap between the two numbers was 3 points; now it’s 15.\n\nWhy? Because among independents, there has been a significant shift away from Trump.\n\nBefore Trump took office, more independents said they expected Trump to change America for the better (41%) than said they expected him to change America for the worse (34%).\n\nThen in March, two months into Trump’s second term, 46% of independents said the president was changing America for the worse; 36% said he was changing America for the better.\n\nToday, those numbers are 57% (worse) and 22% (better). In other words, Trump’s “changing America for the worse” rating among independents has risen by 23 points over the course of his second term, while his “changing America for the better” rating has fallen by 19.\n\nFor many Americans, Trump’s performance is increasingly falling short of expectations. After his first year back in office, just 28% say he has been a better president than they expected. More than twice as many (49%) say he has been worse. (Another 20% say he has been “about the same” as they expected.)\n\nThat gap between worse and better — now 21 percentage points — has doubled since last March. Back then, 41% of Americans said Trump had performed worse than they expected; 30% said better.\n\nAmong Republicans, Trump’s numbers haven’t changed at all: they were 63% “better than expected” to 9% “worse than expected” in March, and they are exactly the same today. But among Democrats, Trump’s “worse than expected” number has climbed 10 points (to 86%) as his “about the same” number has dropped 8 points (to 10%).\n\nMeanwhile, a clear majority of independents (57%) now say Trump has been worse than they expected; just 16% say he’s been better. Those numbers were much closer — 44% to 26%, respectively — in March.\n\nTrump’s overall job-approval rating (40% approve to 56% disapprove) has not budged over the last few months; his ratings on individual issues have held steady, too. But looking back over a longer time frame — the first year of Trump’s second term — a clear pattern emerges. Simply put, more and more Americans think the president has the wrong priorities.\n\nIn March, Yahoo and YouGov asked respondents whether Trump had spent the last two months focused on “America’s most important issues” or “issues that aren’t very important.” At the time, they were evenly split: 43% said the former and 45% said the latter.\n\nBut that’s no longer the case. Today, a majority of Americans (51%) say Trump has spent his second term focused on relatively unimportant issues; just 38% say he has focused on the most important things.\n\nThe cost of living remains the biggest drag on Trump’s presidency. A full 70% of Americans now say he has “not focused on it enough”; less than a quarter say he’s focused on it “the right amount” (21%) or “too much (2%).\n\nIn contrast, most Americans (52%) say Trump has focused too much on “arresting and deporting immigrants.”\n\nAs Trump’s poll numbers have declined, he has increasingly blamed his predecessor, President Joe Biden. Yet just 22% of Americans agree that Biden is “most responsible” for “the current state of the country.” A majority (53%) say Trump is most responsible. The rest (25%) say “both equally.”\n\nPessimism about the country’s future is becoming more prevalent as well. In the summer of 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, just 25% of U.S. adults said America’s “best days” were “behind us”; nearly twice as many (46%) said they were “still to come.”\n\nTrump was president at the time, yet Democrats (51%) were nearly as likely as Republicans (53%) to say America’s best days were ahead. Less than a quarter of each said the opposite.\n\nNow, however, more Democrats say America’s best days are behind it (42%) than say they’re still to come (29%). Those numbers are nearly identical among independents.\n\nOnly Republicans remain convinced — 63% to 17% — that the country’s future will be brighter than its past.\n\nThe Yahoo survey was conducted by YouGov using a nationally representative sample of 1,709 U.S. adults interviewed online from Jan. 8 to 12, 2026. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, 2024 election turnout and presidential vote, party identification and current voter registration status. Demographic weighting targets come from the 2019 American Community Survey. Party identification is weighted to the estimated distribution at the time of the election (31% Democratic, 32% Republican). Respondents were selected from YouGov’s opt-in panel to be representative of all U.S. adults. The margin of error is approximately 3.1%.",

It also introduced a guarantee plan totalling 500 ⁠billion yuan ($71.83 billion) over two years for private ​investment.\n\nZhou Chen, an official at the NDRC, said the ​government would continue to use trade-in subsidies to support consumption of goods like electric vehicles, but its focus was shifting toward services.\n\nOfficials say services, ‍including elderly care, healthcare ⁠and leisure, offer substantial room for growth.\n\n\"The services sector has now become a key focus in efforts to expand domestic demand,\" Zhou said.\n\nIn December, China deployed 62.5 ⁠billion yuan ($8.98 billion) in special treasury bond funds to support its 2026 consumer trade-in scheme for appliances ‌and new-energy vehicles.\n\n($1 = 6.9606 Chinese yuan renminbi)",

    "fullText": "Yet another surfer has been attacked by a shark in New South Wales, Australia.\n\nThis time, it was a 39-year-old man (identity as of yet revealed) who was in the water at Point Plomer in the mid-north coast of the region. Details are scarce surrounding the incident as of now, but it appears the attack happened early Tuesday morning.\n\nThe surfer’s board showed distinct teeth marks, and he was taken for bite wounds.\n\nSurf Life Saving NSW chief executive, Steve Pearce, who has had his hands full over the past couple of days with the excessive amount of shark encounters said:\n\n\"The area is known to have some shark activity up there,\" he told the ABC. [He's] very fortunate to not have sustained any serious injuries.\"\n\nThis most recent attack comes after a rampage of others – first a child was bitten while swimming in the Sydney harbor; then an 11-year-old was chomped while surfing at Dee Why (where Mercury Psillakas was killed by a great white last September); and a man in his 20s was mauled while surfing at North Steyne beach. All within two days.\n\nRegarding the latter incident, the man is reportedly in critical condition. A Good Samaritan who assisted in the rescue of the 20-something victim recounted:\n\n“My mate put him on his board and was pushing him into shore and there was blood on the board and I was trying to pull them to help out. The guy was silenced from the pain, but still conscious, and I kept telling him to not look at his leg and we just kept paddling.”\n\nSo, why are shark attacks raging currently in NSW? Well, it’s likely bull sharks that are responsible, and it probably has to do with the weather. Pearce continued:\n\n“We have such poor water quality that’s conducive to bull shark activity. We have two people critically injured in hospital this morning. Just go to a local pool, because at this stage, we’re advising that the beaches are unsafe.”",

(AP) — Federal immigration agents bashed open a door and detained a U.S. citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out onto the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by The Associated Press.\n\nChongLy “Scott” Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law alerted him on Sunday afternoon that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St. Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.\n\n“I was shaking,\" he said. “They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.\"\n\nAmid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.\n\n“ICE is not doing what they say they’re doing,” St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. “They’re not going after hardened criminals. They’re going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.”\n\nThao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn’t want to see it.\n\nInstead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.\n\nVideos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.\n\nThao said agents drove him “to the middle of nowhere\" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.\n\nAgents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.\n\nHomeland Security defends the operation\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a “targeted operation\" seeking two convicted sex offenders.\n\n“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said. “The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID’d. He matched the description of the targets.”\n\nThao's family said in a statement that it “categorically disputes” the DHS account and “strongly objects to DHS’s attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.”\n\nThao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.\n\nDHS later released the names and photos of two people it described as “violent illegal alien sexual offenders” that it was seeking to detain in St. Paul. Thao said he had never seen these men before and they did not live with him.\n\nDHS did not respond to an earlier request from The Associated Press asking why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.\n\nThao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend, whose first name matches that of one of the men DHS said it was seeking. Chris Thao said he did not know the boyfriend's last name.\n\nFamily fled Laos after helping US\n\nThe family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao’s treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.\n\nThao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's “Secret War” from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.\n\nChoua Thao, who passed away in late December, \"treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,\" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.\n\nChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.\n\n“I don't feel safe at all,” Thao said. “What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.”\n\nBrook is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "description": "New Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Andruw Jones was one of the few to solve Ben Sheets when the Brewers hurler struck out 18 batters in a 2004 game.",
    "fullText": "“It’s funny,” former Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Ben Sheets said in 2024. “When they hit it like that, nobody says nothing about them shadows.”\n\nSheets, speaking to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Curt Hogg, was referring to the infamous stadium shadows that often make day games a challenge for hitters at American Family Field, and potentially something that contributed to Sheets' dominance on May 16, 2004. He was also talking about a pitch that new Baseball Hall of Famer Andruw Jones hit out of the park.\n\nThe Braves slugger was in the prime of his career in 2004, though it would be the only year in a run of five when he wasn't named to the All-Star Game and finished with fewer than 30 home runs. Still, one of his 29 homers that year threw a small wrench into one of the greatest pitching performances in Brewers history, when Sheets struck out 18 batters in a game.\n\nJones, one of two players inducted for the Class of 2026 by the Baseball Writers Association of America, belted a home run against Sheets in the seventh inning that afternoon, accounting for the only Atlanta run in a 4-1 Brewers win. Sheets induced a Mark DeRosa lineout to end the inning, then recorded his final six outs via strikeout.\n\nWhen Jones stepped to the plate with two outs that inning, Sheets had retired 20 of the last 21. Sheets himself said that it was a good pitch.\n\nThe homer spoiled the shutout and perhaps served as a small karmic kickback after Jones had swung through a curveball in the fifth for strikeout No. 8. \"A really good hitter swung through a really crappy hanging breaking ball,\" Sheets recalled.\n\n\"Dang. That was such a bad pitch. But sometimes pitches are so bad, they’re good. That’s what the fastball could do. He was probably just off time. I mean, hitting’s hard. Usually he rips that 450 feet.”\n\nJones hit 434 career home runs, including 51 the following season, though he was on the hook for two of Sheets' franchise record-setting 18 strikeouts that day. Only two pitchers have reached that single-game strikeout mark in the years since: Corey Kluber for Cleveland in 2015 and Max Scherzer for Washington in 2016. Scherzer recorded 20 strikeouts in his game.\n\nSheets gave up a leadoff double to Dewayne Wise starting the game, so he wasn't flirting with a no-hitter at any point. The Brewers scored three times in the bottom of the first to grab an early lead, and Bill Hall's RBI groundout in the bottom of the seventh answered Jones' solo home run.\n\nSheets was added to the Brewers Walk of Fame in 2024. No Brewers pitcher has truly threatened Sheets' strikeout tally; Corbin Burnes got as close as 15 in a 2021 game.\n\nJones received 78.4% of the Hall of Fame vote, ahead of the 75% necessary for induction. The five-time All-Star and 10-time Gold Glove winner joined Carlos Beltrán in the modern-ballot Class of 2026.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Andruw Jones kept Ben Sheets' epic 2004 game from being even better",

    "fullText": "For weeks, WWE fans have questioned the whereabouts of former United States Champions Rusev. In the case of former WWE Tag Team Champions Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins, that same uncertainty has lingered for months. Thanks to a new report, though, it can finally be put to rest.\n\nAccording to PWI Elite, the absence of Rusev and The Street Profits (Ford and Dawkins) on WWE television is the result of an internal decision to not waste them from a creative standpoint. As such, Rusev and The Street Profits are not currently involved in any storylines, reportedly as an effort to keep them \"fresh\" for when WWE officials approach them with new TV programs.\n\nRusev's last television match came on the December 6 edition of \"WWE Main Event,\" in which he defeated Alpha Academy's Otis. Prior to that, \"The Bulgarian Brute\" took on Jey Uso in the quarter finals of \"The Last Time Is Now\" tournament, but lost.\n\nThe WWE Universe last saw The Street Profits in the ring on the November 1 episode of \"Main Event,\" with the pair defeating Los Garza's Angel and Berto in tag team competition. Throughout 2025, Ford and Dawkins were a regular fixture in the \"WWE SmackDown\" tag team division, even holding the WWE Tag Team Championships from March until July.\n\nIn recent weeks, Rusev, Ford, and Dawkins have all appeared on promotional materials for the 2026 WWE Royal Rumble, which will emanate from Saudi Arabia on January 31. As of this writing, it is unknown if it will also bring about their on-screen returns.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "The arrival of Robert Saleh in Tennessee makes the AFC South spicier, thanks to the presence of Saleh's nemesis, Jaguars coach Liam Coen. The arrival of Kevin Stefanski in Atlanta makes the NFC South spicier, too.\n\nIt started when D. Orlando Ledbetter of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution posted a surprisingly aggressive tweet: \"Falcons’ [coach] Kevin Stefanski had a dumpster fire at quarterback in Cleveland — Baker Mayfield and Deshaun Watson failed, which started a chain reaction to 11 other starters. QB Shedeur Sanders closed out last season with seven starts.\"\n\nMayfield saw it, and responded.\n\n\"Failed is quite the reach pal,\" Mayfield said. \"Still waiting on a text/call from [Stefanski] after I got shipped off like a piece of garbage. Can’t wait to see you twice a year, Coach.\"\n\nMayfield is right; it was and is a reach. Mayfield took the Browns to the postseason in 2020, leading them to the divisional round against the Chiefs. Kansas City narrowly escaped, 22-17.\n\nIn 2021, Mayfield played through injuries, and the Browns missed the playoffs. In early 2022, someone in Cleveland got the bright idea to mortgage the future for (and pay a king's ransom to) Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson. The Browns traded Mayfield to the Panthers, who at the time were nearly as dysfunctional as the Browns have been for more than a decade.\n\nMayfield's three years with the Buccaneers have proven that he's not a \"dumpster fire\" quarterback. The Browns were the dumpster fire.\n\nNow, the smoke has spread to Atlanta and Tampa Bay, where the perpetual chip on Mayfield's shoulder has gotten a little bigger. And it's awesome.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON -- The left ankle sprain suffered by Steven Adams earlier this week will keep the veteran center out indefinitely, Rockets head coach Ime Udoka said Tuesday.\n\nIn an update from Toyota Center prior to Tuesday’s Rockets-Spurs game, Udoka said the 32-year-old had experienced a “severe” sprain that was Grade 3 in nature.\n\nUdoka said the Rockets are still gathering information and opinions on Adams’ injury, but Grade 3 ankle sprains typically carry a recovery timeline of weeks or months.\n\n“He won’t be back any time soon,” Udoka surmised.\n\nThe 2026 NBA playoffs will begin in mid-April, approximately three months from the original injury date. The Rockets are currently 25-15 and in the No. 5 spot in the tightly packed Western Conference standings.\n\nAdams is averaging 5.8 points (50.4% FG) and 8.6 rebounds (4.5 offensive) in 22.8 minutes per game. In his absence, third-string center Clint Capela will likely move up the depth chart, while power forward Jabari Smith Jr. could slide to center in smaller lineups.\n\nSteven Adams is “out indefinitely,” Ime Udoka tells me. \nIt is a “severely sprained, Grade 3 ankle sprain.” Udoka says the Rockets are still gathering information. \n\nTari Eason is available.\n\n— Vanessa Richardson (@SportsVanessa) January 20, 2026\n\nTari Eason, who missed more than a week with a less severe ankle sprain, returned from his injury in Tuesday’s important game against the Spurs (30-13, No. 2 in West).\n\nShould Smith play more minutes at center, players such as Eason and Dorian Finney-Smith could be asked to pick up more wing minutes for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Rockets-Spurs clash tips off at 7:00 p.m. Central (box score), and the game will be televised regionally on Space City Home Network and to a national audience via NBC and Peacock.\n\nMore: Tari Eason rejoins Rockets after multi-game absence with ankle injury\n\nGrade 3 ankle sprain confirmed for Steven Adams meaning the ligament(s) are completely torn\n\nToo early to determine timeframes, but 6 weeks would be the absolute minimum based on prior NBA cases but there’s a wide window in possible return timeframes\n\nThe goal will be to get… https://t.co/JZH34iJKg1\n\n— Steven Adams Stats (@funakistats) January 20, 2026\n\nEverything I’ve read says that 8-12 weeks is typical for a grade 3 sprain with some cases where NBA players have come back in 6 weeks\n\nSo yes, it’s possible his season is done if he’s at the long end of that range, and the rockets don’t make the Playoffs. \n\nBut 12 weeks (worst…\n\n— Steven Adams Stats (@funakistats) January 20, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rockets Wire: Rockets center Steven Adams out indefinitely with severe ankle sprain",

    "description": "A pair of former Yankees outfielders are heading to Cooperstown.",
    "fullText": "There are two new members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and both of them are ex-Yankees. On Tuesday night, the BBWAA released the results of this year’s Hall of Fame ballot: Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones have been elected as part of the class of 2026. The pair will be enshrined in Cooperstown alongside Eras Committee pick Jeff Kent on July 26th.\n\nThe pair were born just one day apart in April of 1977 and have now been elected to the Hall of Fame on the same day. Only two center fielders had been elected to Cooperstown in the last 45 years, so to induct a pair in on the same day is a relative bonanza.\n\nBeltrán topped balloting in this cycle, receiving 84.2 percent of the vote in his fourth year on the ballot. It’s a jump of almost 13 percentage points from last year, when Beltrán narrowly missed out on election.\n\nBeltrán played 20 seasons in the big leagues with the Royals, Astros, Mets, Giants, Cardinals, Yankees, and Rangers, slashing .279/.350/.486 with 435 home runs, 1,587 RBIs, 312 stolen bases, a 118 wRC+, and 67.4 fWAR. He was a nine-time All-Star, three-time Gold Glover, two-time Silver Slugger, the 1999 AL Rookie of the Year, and the 2013 Roberto Clemente Award winner. He hit the fourth-most home runs of any switch-hitter in league history behind only Mickey Mantle, Eddie Murray, and Chipper Jones, and is one of only eight players in MLB history with at least 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases alongside Willie Mays, Bobby Bonds, Andre Dawson, Barry Bonds, Steve Finley, Reggie Sanders, and Alex Rodriguez.\n\nBeltrán played two-and-a-half seasons for the Yankees in his late-thirties and was one of their more productive hitters upon signing with them in the mid-2010s before being traded to the Rangers for a trio of prospects at the 2016 Trade Deadline. He would go on to win his lone World Series ring a year later with the Astros (dispatching his old teammates in a seven-game ALCS), but was named as one of the architects of their 2017 sign-stealing scandal, which was one of the principal factors in not being elected to the Hall in his first three years of eligibility. Nonetheless, Beltrán becomes the sixth player from Puerto Rico to be elected to Cooperstown.\n\nJones sneaks in with 78.4 percent of the vote, representing just over a 12 percentage point increase from his vote share last year. It was Jones’ ninth year on the ballot, his penultimate year of eligibility.\n\nJones becomes the first player born in Curaçao to be elected to the Hall of Fame. He was considered one of the all-time great defensive center fielders in MLB history, his 126.4 UZR ranking him second all-time behind Ichiro Suzuki and his 150 total zone runs ranking him fifth all-time behind Clemente, Mays, Barry Bonds, and Jesse Barfield. He blended that defense with prodigious power — he is one of only four players in history with at least 10 Gold Gloves and 400 home runs, joining Mays, Ken Griffey Jr., and Mike Schmidt.\n\nIn his 17 big league seasons, Jones played for the Braves, Dodgers, Rangers, White Sox, and Yankees, making five All-Star appearances. He slashed .254/.337/.486 with 434 home runs, 1,289 RBIs, 152 stolen bases, a 111 wRC+ and 67 fWAR. His career is bookended by encounters with the Yankees. As a rookie in 1996, he became the youngest player in MLB history to homer in the World Series at just 19 years old, breaking the record set by Mickey Mantle when he hit home runs in his first two at-bats of Game 1 of the 1996 World Series. He played the final two seasons of his big league career with the Yankees in 2011 and 2012 before a two-season swan song in Japan with the NPB’s Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, where he was teammates with future Yankees ace Masahiro Tanaka.\n\nAndy Pettitte experienced one of the biggest jumps in vote share, going from 27.9-percent of the vote last year to 48.5-percent of the vote in this cycle. It’s an encouraging sign for Pettitte in his eighth year on the ballot — if he can experience similar jumps in his final two years of eligibility there is a real chance he could be elected. There will always be questions of the effect his admission to using HGH will have on future voting, but the all-time postseason wins leader is certainly trending in the right direction.\n\nAs for other former Yankees on the ballot, Alex Rodriguez remained relatively stagnant, going from 37.1-percent of the vote last year to 40-percent in this, his fifth year of eligibility. Bobby Abreu experienced a nice jump from 19.5-percent last year to 30.8-percent this year, but with only three more years on the ballot, he will need to be handed even bigger boosts in future voting cycles to have a shot. Edwin Encarnación received just six votes (1.4-percent) in his first year on the ballot and will therefore fall off the ballot as he comes up short of the five-percent threshold needed to maintain eligibility.\n\nCongratulations again to Beltrán and Jones on this fantastic achievement. The full voting can be found below.",

    "description": "Hall continues to help the ’Hoos in more ways than one despite his scoring struggles.",
    "fullText": "Things are going well for Ryan Odom and the Virginia Cavaliers, to say the least. The ’Hoos are firmly back in the top-25 once again at 16-2 overall and 5-1 in the ACC, with a gigantic opportunity this Saturday against a struggling North Carolina team at home inside JPJ.\n\nA huge part of this team’s success, despite what anyone who only looks at the scoring column might tell you, is the leadership and all-around play of Dallin Hall.\n\nThe easy-to-knock, low-hanging fruit of his game as of late has been his shooting, rather the lack thereof throughout stretches this year, especially in UVA’s last three games. In the last three wins over Stanford, Louisville, and SMU, Hall’s combined for an ugly 3-of-16 from the floor, with all but three of those attempts coming from beyond the arc.\n\n19% shooting is bad; there’s no defending it in a vacuum. But pointing at that percentage alone to poke a giant hole in Hall’s game, as UVA’s narrow leader in minutes played per game (27.5), would be disingenuous for what he does for this team, and a misunderstanding of why Odom and his staff brought him to Charlottesville in the first place.\n\nHall does a handful of things well that you’ll never see in the box score or on a graphic flashed across on TV. He boxes out guards gunning for boards to open space for others to get their hands on rebounds, plays sound team defense, and does the things that make coaches pump their fist in a film session like funneling ballhandlers into the human skyscrapers of Johann Grunloh and Ugonna Onyenso for tough looks around the basket, or simply making the easy, productive passes in halfcourt offense for second or third assists.\n\nYou’ll never hear anyone talking about a hockey assist in a basketball game, but those are the plays that shine like flashing green lights to a coaching staff making playing time decisions.\n\nDallin Hall is a box score-watcher’s worst nightmare.\n\nAffects the game even when shots aren’t falling pic.twitter.com/JcBRSsykev\n\n— Garrett Keogh (@garrett_keogh01) January 19, 2026\n\nBesides, was the expectation when UVA secured his commitment in the summer that he would be averaging 13 points a night? Safe to say, probably not. In his first three years at BYU, he averaged 7.3, 9.0, and 6.8 points per game, respectively. Today, his scoring average sits at 5.8. And while there was serious talent on a few of those Cougar teams, the jury is still out on whether or not this UVA group is the best Hall’s been a part of — I lean more toward that being the case.\n\nHall starts and plays heavily because of his ability to distribute, defend intelligently, and be in the right spots. Guys like Thijs De Ridder, Malik Thomas, Chance Mallory, and Sam Lewis have shown they’re able to carry the scoring load. That’s part of why this team is up to No. 14 in the AP Poll. Odom and co. constructed this roster with a clear vision in mind for each guy’s role. Hall is out there to help run the show on both ends of the floor.\n\n\"He's just a winner.\"\n\nUVA coach Ryan Odom says Dallin Hall has made a tremendous impact on the team both on and off the court this season. Adds how valuable his mentorship with Chance Mallory is this year.\n\nAlso says he wants Hall to continue shooting.\n\n— Preston Willett (@PrestonWillett) January 19, 2026\n\nAnd sure, I can find clip after clip of great plays, and if you think differently, you can go find a share of bad ones. That’s as endless a game as someone still saying the SEC is the best conference in college football at this point. But overall? Hall is a net positive when he’s out there.\n\nIn fact, the analytics suggest that to be true when you look at how effective UVA’s lineup combinations are with him on the floor. Of the ACC’s top 15 rated three-player lineups measured by CBB Analytics, the ’Hoos own four of them. The only player included in each of those four? Dallin Hall.\n\nThe top '3-player lineup combos\" by Net Rating in the ACC (min. 150 MP) pic.twitter.com/OU4uh1AlJK\n\n— CBB Analytics (@CBBAnalytics) January 18, 2026\n\nNow, this isn’t to say UVA’s starting point guard should be free from criticism should he continue to not make shots for three or four straight games coming up, but to not acknowledge the little things, in addition to the fact he pulled down 12 rebounds against Louisville, and dished out nine assists at SMU — which now has him at a 19:4 assist to turnover ratio across the last three games — would be criminal when it comes to recognizing his overall value. He isn’t just logging 30+ minutes of cardio each night. He’s making winning plays, no matter how small some might seem.\n\nAnd, like the Maryland game when he went for 20 points, I wouldn’t be surprised if we see a time in the near future when this team is starving for a scoring lift, and it comes at the hands of a few big shots from No. 30.",

    "fullText": "The Professional Football Writers of America have revealed their choices for the 2025 All-Rookie Team, with one Cowboys player being recognized for excellence in his first year.\n\nGuard Tyler Booker has earned a coveted spot on the all-rookie roster. The 21-year-old was the Cowboys' first-round draft pick back in April, being selected No. 12 overall out of Alabama. He started 14 games as a rookie and played every offensive snap in each of those appearances, missing three games early in the season with a high ankle sprain.\n\nHe's the first Cowboys first-year player named to the squad since Tyler Smith was chosen in 2022.\n\nBooker is joined on the 2026 All-Rookie Team by standouts like Patriots running back TreVeyon Henderson, Buccaneers wide receiver Emeka Egbuka, Colts tight end Tyler Warren, Giants defensive lineman Abdul Carter, Eagles linebacker Jihaad Campbell, and Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori.\n\nBrowns linebacker Carson Schwesinger was named Defensive Rookie of the Year; Panthers wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan is this season's Offensive Rookie of the Year and the 2025 Rookie of the Year.\n\nFormer Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons won 2021's Rookie of the Year honors. Other franchise legends like Ezekiel Elliott and Tony Dorsett preceded him in the first-year awards that have been handed out by the PFWA every season since 1974.\n\nTodd is on X at @ToddBrock24f7.

    "description": "Gabriel Jesus says he had \"tears in my eyes\" after scoring twice to help Arsenal win 3-1 at Inter Milan for a seventh successive win in the Champions League.",
    "fullText": "Gabriel Jesus said he had \"tears in my eyes\" after scoring twice to help Arsenal win 3-1 at Inter Milan and seal their place in the Champions League last 16.\n\nThe 28-year-old was making only his third start since returning in December from 11 months out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury.\n\nJesus has been at Arsenal for four seasons but feels like he has played only \"one and a half or two\" having endured a series of setbacks.\n\nThe Brazil forward has shown flashes of his quality following his comeback, scoring an excellent fourth goal in Arsenal's 4-1 thrashing of Aston Villa last month but, against Inter, he looked back to his best.\n\n\"It's a dream night,\" Jesus told Amazon Prime after the Gunners maintained their 100% record in this season's Champions League with a club-record seventh successive win in the competition.\n\n\"I always dreamed of being a footballer. I watched when I was a kid. I watched a lot of Serie A, so to be here in this stadium and score here is tears in my eyes because I always dreamed of being here.\n\n\"There is always a reason that things happen, whether it's good things or difficult things. I learned that during my 11 months out of the field.\n\n\"It is always difficult to play against Inter Milan. We came here last season and lost. Tonight we played better than them, we controlled them but they are a top team and they attack.\n\n\"We scored at the end and got the three points. We have to keep going because we have another one at the weekend.\"\n\nHis two goals ended a run of 10 Champions League games without scoring - the last one coming in a 6-0 win over Lens on 29 November, 2023.\n\nGunners fans have been calling for Jesus to start since he came back to full fitness, with summer signing Viktor Gyokeres struggling for form and goals.\n\nThe Swede got on the scoresheet in Milan with an fine curling effort, but his strike for Arsenal's late third was just his second from open play in his past 13 games.\n\nGyokeres, though, does have two in his last three games after netting in the Carabao Cup semi-final first-leg win at Chelsea, while Kai Havertz offers another forward option following his return from a knee injury.\n\n\"Everyone wants to start,\" added Jesus. \"I am a very respectful guy. I am not a kid anymore, I am 28, so I understand football.\n\n\"I am very happy Vik came on and scored a goal. I am so happy I scored and Vik scored. I am confident Kai will score when he gets the chance.\"\n\nJesus stars as Arsenal beat Inter for landmark win\n\nWith Gyokeres and Jesus both on target in Milan, it marked the first time this season two centre-forwards had scored in the same game for the Gunners.\n\n\"We have been missing Gabi a lot,\" said manager Mikel Arteta. \"I think it is going to raise his confidence levels and the team's because we now have different profiles in that position, like we have with the wingers and in other positions.\n\n\"And the fact the players are playing at that level. Viktor [Gyokeres] comes in and makes a great impact in the game - and it only makes us better.\"\n\nJesus' two goals took the former Manchester City frontman's tally to 26 in the Champions League on his 53rd appearance, with the only Brazilians to reach 25 in fewer games in the competition being Neymar (44) and Jardel (45).\n\n\"In the end it's not even about competition between the players [for places]. The words Jesus said, even if the next player comes, he will still score his goal to help the team,\" four-time Champions League winner Clarence Seedorf told Amazon Prime.\n\n\"These are words I like to hear because they're coming into a different level now because, yes they are competing, but whoever plays needs to perform.\n\n\"If I'm not playing you perform because next game will be easier for me when the team is winning. I like that.\"\n\nWayne Rooney, whose former club Manchester United visit Premier League leaders Arsenal next on Sunday, added: \"If I was Gabriel Jesus now I'd be saying, 'I want to start the game on Sunday'.\n\n\"He's come here, scored two goals and played really well so if I was him, I'd be putting it in the manager's mind that I really want to play.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "Cooperstown calls: Carlos Beltrán, Andruw Jones and Jeff Kent lead class of 2026",
    "description": "Former White Sox ace Mark Buehrle gains traction as Hall of Fame debate evolves",
    "fullText": "It’s a tale of sustained excellence, peak brilliance and overdue redemption: Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones each surpassed the 75% needed for election by members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America on Tuesday, while Jeff Kent was formally awarded his place in Cooperstown this winter by the Contemporary Era Committee. The trio will headline the Hall of Fame Class of 2026.\n\nKent was announced as a Hall of Fame inductee in December, finally receiving long-overdue recognition for his sterling work at second base. His 377 homers are the most all-time at second base, while his 1,518 RBI and eight 100-RBI seasons are unmatched for a player at Kent’s position. Kent was a five-time All-Star and four-time Silver Slugger Award winner who slashed .290/.356/.500 with 55.4 WAR over 17 seasons. Simply put, Kent was a generational talent who did things at second base that most didn’t think were possible.\n\nBeltrán, meanwhile, fell just short of Cooperstown last year in his third trip on the BBWAA ballot, receiving 70.3% of the vote. But the writers have spoken this year, elevating Beltrán to the HOF with 84.2% of the vote. Beltrán appeared in 20 seasons and 2,586 games over his career, slashing .279/.350/.486 with 2,725 hits, 435 home runs, 312 stolen bases and 70 WAR. His counting numbers are all the more impressive considering he’s one of only five players in AL/NL history to post 500 doubles, 400 homers and 300 steals. Beltrán was a nine-time All-Star and won three Gold Gloves, as well as earning American League Rookie of the Year honors in 1999. What sets Beltrán apart from others, though? His resume in October. Beltrán was a different beast during postseason play, slashing .307/.412/.609 with a 1.021 OPS, which ranks among the best postseason performances ever.\n\nUnfortunately for Beltrán, his career wasn’t all sunshine and roses as he was named in the report on the Astros’ sign-stealing scandal and admitted to using text messages to share scouting information during his tenure with Houston. After apologizing to MLB, he stepped away from baseball for several years.  As time went on, it seems the writers, at least this year, decided to overlook his role in the scandal and accept his apology. Today, he serves as the Mets’ special assistant to the president of baseball operations, David Stearns.\n\nThe eventual election of Jones is just one of the many reasons that Hall of Fame voting can change drastically over time. He surpassed the 75% mark this year in his ninth year on the ballot, eventually landing at 78.4%. It wasn’t always pretty for Jones, who came alarmingly close to falling off the ballot in his first year of eligibility after recording just 7.3% of the vote. But each year, Jones gained steam as voters began to understand the value of his elite defense at a premium position, combined with plus power at the plate. During his best years, Jones was one of the best center fielders the game has ever seen, winning Gold Gloves for 10 straight seasons while also hammering 434 home runs over his career. Prior to this year, only eight center fielders were enshrined in Cooperstown; with the election of Beltrán  and Jones, that number now sits at 10.\n\nA deeper dive into Jones’ prime reveals just how good he was. At age 19, Jones homered twice in his first two career World Series at-bats. He hit seven 30-homer seasons, led MLB with 51 homers in 2005, and was a five-time All-Star. Unfortunately, injuries cut into Jones’ career after age 30 and prevented him from adding even more to his eye-popping stats. Jones spent one lone season in 2010 in Chicago, where he posted a 120 OPS+ and put up a 1.9 WAR across 107 games for the White Sox. His career was also not without issue, as an off-field arrest for domestic violence in 2012 may have stalled his early ballot progression to the HOF.\n\nFinally, reaching career highs on Monday was former White Sox southpaw Mark Buehrle, who saw his vote total jump from 11.4% in 2025 to 20% in 2026. It’s a steady increase over the course of his six years on the ballot, and one that could continue to trend upwards as seasons pass. Buehrle has one of the best pitching hallmarks of all time, tossing at least 200 innings in 14 straight seasons. Only seven Modern Era pitchers were able to reach that milestone at least once, and six of those pitchers are already in the Hall of Fame. Buehrle won 214 games, logged over 3,200 innings since the start of the 21st century, had elite defensive metrics earning him three Gold Gloves, and had signature moments, including a perfect game, a no-hitter, and an ALCS complete game. Hopefully, his case will only grow stronger with time, and the momentum eventually works in Buehrle’s favor.",

    "fullText": "Obviously frustrated by the heavy defeat suffered at the Santiago Bernabéu against Real Madrid (6-1), the English central defender spoke in the mixed zone after the match.\n\nThey were powerless against the Madrid steamroller. Pegged back very early in the match, the AS Monaco players ultimately succumbed to a heavy defeat against Real Madrid on Matchday 7 of the Champions League (6-1). It was obviously a disappointment, and one that Eric Dier sought to analyze in the mixed zone post-match. 🎙️\n\nGood evening, Eric. What happened tonight?\n\nIt’s difficult to explain right after the match, but it simply wasn’t a good performance from us. We’re obviously very disappointed, and there’s not much else to say. We just need to try to understand what went wrong, especially since when you lose by that score, it means a lot of things didn’t work. We now need to process this and move forward. I’m obviously very disappointed in myself, but everyone needs to do some self-reflection; that’s the most important thing.\n\nWe weren't surprised by the quality of this Real Madrid team; everyone knows them and was aware of their capabilities. We had a few chances  in the first half, which was quite open. Unfortunately, we left ourselves too exposed after halftime, and we conceded goals due to silly mistakes.\n\nWere you surprised by the level of your opponent?\n\nWe weren’t surprised by the quality of this Real Madrid team; everyone knows them and was aware of their capabilities. We had a few chances  in the first half, which was quite open. Unfortunately, we left ourselves too exposed after halftime, and we conceded goals due to silly mistakes. Their counter-attacks really hurt us.\n\nHow can you defend against a player like Kylian Mbappé?\n\nIn my opinion, football isn’t an individual sport; it’s always about collective play, and it’s often characterized by mistakes. Even if you’re a very good team, you’re bound to make mistakes, and when you’re struggling, you’re even more vulnerable. We now need to show a different attitude, both individually and collectively. But the best news is that we have another match in four days.\n\nNo, I don't think so. It's never too great a challenge, and we've shown in the past that we can perform well against very strong teams. But our performance was simply not good enough today. We need to learn from these kinds of matches as a team.\n\nEric DierOn the lessons to take from the amtch\n\nHow can we explain the team’s performance?\n\nIt’s sometimes difficult, when you’re on the inside, to find rational explanations for what’s happening, especially since we’re currently going through a difficult period. When everything is going well, it’s easy to make the right choices and show character. But we need to show that character precisely in these kinds of situations.\n\nWas the challenge too great tonight against Real Madrid?\n\nNo, I don’t think so. It’s never too great a challenge, and we’ve shown in the past that we can perform well against very strong teams. But our performance was simply not good enough today. We need to learn from these kinds of matches as a team.\n\nWhen you lose 6-1, you obviously have to change a lot of things. We need to be better in every aspect of the game. How do we bounce back? The advantage is that we have another match in a few days against Le Havre in the league to show a different side of ourselves. Again, when everything is going well, it’s very easy to have the right attitude, show personality, and demonstrate character, but it’s precisely in these difficult moments that it seems the hardest. But we have to face this challenge.",

    "fullText": "Union Saint-Gilloise head coach David Hubert thinks that his team’s Champions League showdown against Bayern Munich is the biggest match in the club’s history.\n\n“It doesn’t get any bigger than this – it’s the biggest game in the club’s history. Bayern are right up there when you look at the best teams in Europe. You can’t find a bigger challenge. But there’s confidence and hunger in our team. We want to show ourselves tomorrow. You see, everything is bigger here, even the microphone is bigger,” Hubert said with a laugh (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “The danger comes to you from all sides against Bayern. I like to review the chances an opponent creates before we play them. Normally, that takes two hours, but with Bayern it took two days. They have all the qualities, both collectively and individually.\n\n“Aggressive pressing, playing between the lines, down the wing, they have some truly exceptional players. They’re a team with no limits. But as long as the odds aren’t zero, you have a chance. We have to try to seize it. And after all, it’s eleven people against us. They have two legs, two arms, two lungs, just like us… We’re looking forward to it.”\n\nYup, Hubert is impressed with the Bavarians. However, the manager’s message is that in the Champions League…anything can happen.\n\n“In the Champions League, you compete against the best, and Bayern are currently the best in Europe. We want to show our best side. That’s why we play this sport. In football, there’s always a chance,” Hubert said.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "description": "The Boston Red Sox aren’t rushing their Plan B after the Alex Bregman miss.",
    "fullText": "The most revealing part of Chris Cotillo’s update wasn’t the name attached to it. It was the lack of movement.\n\n“Very little traction” on Eugenio Suarez is not the kind of phrasing that signals a deal is imminent, but it does tell you something important about where the Red Sox actually are right now.\n\nNot where they were a week ago, not where fans want them to be, but where the front office has landed in the immediate aftermath of losing Alex Bregman.\n\nThe loud part of the offseason is over. What’s left is quieter, more uncomfortable, and far more reflective of how Boston wants to operate.\n\nThe Bregman chapter closed loudly, expensively, and with more friction than the organization would ever admit publicly. He was the clean solution - the one that made sense on paper, in the clubhouse, and in the lineup. Boston pursued him seriously, but deliberately (to a fault), and when the bidding crept past their internal line in the low-$160 million range, they stopped.\n\nThat decision didn’t just cost them Bregman. It reshaped everything that followed.\n\nIn that context, Suarez becoming a legitimate Plan B option made perfect sense.\n\nAccording to Cotillo and Sean McAdam earlier this month, the Red Sox “like” him. That word matters. It’s not urgency. It’s not aggression. It’s interest, filtered through restraint.\n\nSuarez is not Bregman. He’s not Bo Bichette, either. What he is, however, is a very specific kind of bat - one Boston’s lineup has lacked at times.\n\nForty-plus home run power is not a projection with Suarez; it’s the foundation of his value. He launched 49 home runs in 2025 between Arizona and Seattle, and for a Red Sox offense that too often stalled when the ball stopped leaving the yard, that kind of thump plays.\n\nA near-30% strikeout rate isn’t a footnote. It’s a defining trait.\n\nHis defense at third base is serviceable at best, and nobody is confusing this with a long-term, stabilizing solution at the hot corner. Suarez doesn’t smooth out a roster. He fits into it, warts and all.\n\nAnd that’s where Cotillo’s report starts to read less like a dead end and more like a snapshot of Boston’s current posture.\n\n“Very little traction” suggests the Red Sox are not pushing. It suggests they’re content to let the market breathe, to see whether price and years come down, to avoid another negotiation that forces them to choose between structure and star power. After how the Bregman talks ended, that’s not surprising - it’s instructive.\n\nRemember to join our RED SOX on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "fullText": "John Harbaugh spoke to his old pal Andy Reid before taking the Giants’ head coaching job.\n\nReid — the Chiefs’ legendary coach who was fired by the Eagles after the 2012 season — had some valuable advice for Harbaugh.\n\n“Andy is a man of few words,” Harbaugh said Tuesday at his introductory press conference. “And his four words to me were: ‘Change can be good.’ That’s what he said: ‘Change can be good.’”\n\nHarbaugh said Reid was “fired up” when he took the Giants job.\n\n“He’s a good friend,” Harbaugh said. “How about we do this? We’ll Let’s do that.”\n\nHarbaugh, who was fired by the Ravens earlier this month, was talking about the successful second act he envisions with the Giants.\n\nThe difference, of course, is that Harbaugh won a Super Bowl with the Ravens, and Reid came up short in Philadelphia. No head coach has ever won a Super Bowl ring with two different franchises. Can Harbaugh make history after failing to reach the big game with quarterback Lamar Jackson?\n\nHarbaugh got his start in the NFL with the Eagles in 1998. A year later, they hired Reid, who retained Harbaugh as his special teams coordinator. In 2008, Harbaugh left to become Baltimore’s head coach.\n\nHarbaugh won his lone Super Bowl ring in 2012. A year later, Reid landed in Kansas City, in the immediate wake of his Eagles firing. From 2019-24, Reid reached five Super Bowls in six seasons and won three of them.\n\nMeanwhile, the Giants have done next to nothing since their 2011 Super Bowl title — two playoff trips, with one win in 2022.\n\nAt this point, after a 13-38 record since that wild-card round victory, Giants fans would just \n\nMiami exec explains why player threw punches in national championship game: ‘...RIP...’\n\nWhy John Harbaugh’s hiring represents a new era for Giants in more ways than one\n\nTrump ‘put out a strong word’ to Giants before Harbaugh was hired\n\nESPN personality mentioned as fit for Giants’ John Harbaugh: ‘Don’t discount it’",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO (AP) — Guard Josh Giddey is just about ready to return to the Chicago Bulls’ lineup after being sidelined the past three weeks because of a strained left hamstring, coach Billy Donovan said Tuesday.\n\nDonovan said prior to the game against the Los Angeles Clippers that Giddey could return at Minnesota on Thursday. The Australian missed his 11th game in a row.\n\n“Feels pretty good,” Donovan said. “I think it’s just waiting to hear from the medical of what they want to do and how Josh feels. But everything that I’ve gotten from Josh in medical is that there were no setbacks and he’s doing well.”\n\nGiddey has not played since a loss to New Orleans on Dec. 31. He walked off the court gingerly in the first minute of the second half in that game.\n\nGiddey has performed at an All-Star level in his second season in Chicago since a trade from Oklahoma City. He is averaging a team-high 19.2 points, 8.9 rebounds and 9 assists, and has seven triple-doubles.\n\n“I don’t know what the cutoff point is in terms of missed games and things like that, but before he got hurt, I think you could certainly make the argument he was playing at that level for strong consideration,” Donovan said.\n\nThe Bulls were ninth in the Eastern Conference at 20-22 entering Tuesday's game. Forward Patrick Williams sat out because of a sprained right ankle and is day to day. ___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",

    "description": "Many Tottenham fans have already lost faith in Thomas Frank - but did Tuesday's 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund give cause for optimism?",
    "fullText": "Speaking to Tottenham fans on their way to Tuesday's Champions League game with Borussia Dortmund, almost none retained any belief in Thomas Frank.\n\nIt felt as though a bad defeat against the German side - which would have been a fourth loss in a row in all competitions - would not only have led to more boos and more toxicity inside the stadium, but the end of his reign as manager.\n\nInstead, a 2-0 win thanks to first-half goals from Christian Romero and Dominic Solanke is likely to buy Frank some time. An encouraging performance from his depleted team could even give him more than that.\n\nJust a few days earlier, loud boos greeted the final whistle at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as West Ham snatched a last-minute winner.\n\nBefore kick-off on Tuesday there were some jeers once again when Frank's name was read out, but they turned into cheers at full-time as Spurs secured a win that now puts them in a strong position to qualify automatically for the Champions League knockouts.\n\nThe question now is: was this a temporary reprieve for Frank or a platform to build on? And is it enough to win back the fans who had turned against him?\n\nIt was clear many fans had turned on Frank during the defeat by the Hammers, with large numbers singing \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" at him.\n\nThat feeling remained evident before Tuesday's match.\n\n\"I really do think 99% of this stadium are Frank out,\" said Spurs supporter Sarah Sturgeon-Scraggs, who has been attending home games with her dad Ronnie since she was nine.\n\n\"I have enjoyed coming to the matches because of the people we sit with and I get to spend time with my dad, but we get so little joy.\"\n\nRonnie added: \"Barring some sort of miracle on player support, style and results instantly the fans have abandoned him and I feel personally that he must go.\"\n\nThis win and the much-improved first-half performance was still not enough to change their view, with a return to a more conservative and unadventurous display in the second half a cause for frustration.\n\n\"The first half was really enjoyable,\" said Sarah. “There was a lot more movement, a lot more forward passing and a press. However, the second-half performance shows why Frank is not the right person to be managing this team. We went to five at the back, the game ground to a halt. It sucked the joy out of it yet again.\n\nFellow Spurs supporter Ali Speechly held a similar view before kick-off.\n\n\"If we could see signs of what he is trying to achieve we might have more patience,\" she said.\n\n\"It looks like a bunch of players doing what they want.\"\n\nAny change of heart after the game?\n\n\"Much better first half, where has that been? But second half we were dead again,\" she said. \"They either play a good first half or second half. It feels Thomas Frank can't string the two together.\"\n\nSome, however, did see enough to believe Frank can build on this.\n\nAlfie said before the match that Tottenham were playing “like a Championship team”, but after he said: “The first half was brilliant. The second half wasn’t great but we didn’t concede.\n\n“But I am really happy with the result and I think Frank might have a lot more up his sleeve than we think.”\n\nMany of the fans may still need some convincing - but what the display did suggest is that Frank retains the support of the dressing room.\n\nThe players' work rate, intensity and desire was there to see in the first half and when the whistle went for half-time they all gathered before heading down the tunnel together.\n\n\"What I saw tonight was not a performance where the manager had lost the dressing room,\" former Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk of a disjointed dressing room. That wasn't there [against Dortmund].\n\n\"It wasn't full here, the fans voted with their feet, but that was a group of players that played for their manager.\"\n\nThat is something Frank himself was keen to stress in the post-match press conference.\n\n\"The players are giving everything,\" he said.\n\n\"That is an extremely good sign about the culture. An extremely good sign they are together and we are together.\"\n\nFor Tottenham supporters, this season will be providing a sense of deja vu.\n\nThey were dreadful in the Premier League under Ange Postecoglu last term but it was a different story in Europe as they went on to win the Europa League.\n\nIt is a similar story under Frank, with Spurs languishing 14th in the league but in Europe they have lost just once in seven games and are likely just a win away from a place in the Champions League knockouts.\n\n\"There's two Tottenhams running about this season,\" former Scotland striker Ally McCoist said on TNT Sports.\n\n\"Fortunately it was the Tottenham that have been doing well in the Champions League who turned up tonight.\"\n\nRobinson added: \"When your back's against the wall, in adversity, you dig in and get a result.\n\n\"The thing that will frustrate Thomas Frank and these Tottenham fans is where was this in the Premier League? Where was this at the weekend?\"\n\nThere is never long in football to sit back and enjoy a result, and the pressure will be on Frank once again when they take on struggling Burnley in the Premier League at the weekend.\n\nWin that with another impressive performance and some might start to see green shoots of recovery.\n\nLose and the pressure on Frank will once again be immense, something he is all too aware of.\n\n\"The big thing is of course is to build on this with a performance and win against Burnley on Saturday,\" he said.\n\n\"What I would say is it is a big skill to be able to produce in the Premier League and Champions League every week.\n\n\"We just need to keep doing the same thing, keep believing and things will turn.\"\n\nIt has been a difficult few days for Frank, with the negative reaction after the West Ham loss, while news that the club's hierarchy are considering ending his seven-month reign broke on Monday.\n\nAfter all of that, Frank welcomed the opportunity to be able to savour this win against Dortmund for now.\n\n\"Two big glasses of red will be necessary,\" he said. \"I will enjoy them.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Head Coach Cael Sanderson, PJ Duke, and Mitchell Mesenbrink spoke to media ahead of Friday's dual vs. Indiana in Rec Hall.",
    "fullText": "This afternoon, Head Coach Cael Sanderson, 157 lbs starter PJ Duke, and 165 lbs starter Mitchell Mesenbrink spoke to media ahead of Friday’s dual vs. Indiana in Rec Hall.\n\nTranscript Readers: Be sure to watch the first few seconds of Mitchell’s video for a glimpse into his carefree way of being.\n\nYeah, I think the weekend went well. I think just a fun environment. Going on the road and competing is a lot of fun as a team. Obviously, a lot of little things we can improve on collectively and individually—just part of the process of figuring things out and I mean we say this every time we wrestle Iowa, but they do a really good job preparing and they kind of always give you an idea of what you need to get better at and just good competition, good wrestlers, good coaching staff there. So yeah, I think we come away with some ideas on how we can get better. (0:12 – 0:48)\n\nYeah, I don’t know. I mean it’s always just preparation for the next match. So a match comes and goes quickly. Everything comes and goes quickly. So it’s all just preparation. And so I don’t know if anyone’s patting themselves on the back or anything as much as just seeing what can we do better and continue to approach things with enthusiasm and gratitude is kind of the key. (0:58 – 1:28)\n\nYeah, it just depends. I mean the double dual is a double weigh-in. You get a pound now that second dual enough to—I mean the guys love that obviously but I’m not a big deal. But yeah, we’ll just continue to improve our conditioning. I mean we have eight or nine weeks until the nationals, I believe. So we’ll, you know, we got a lot of time to get better and technique and then take our shape up a notch or two. (1:42 – 2:13)\n\nI think Luke [Lilledahl] is just a competitor, number one. He just loves the sport. And he’s just going to keep getting better because that’s just his mindset and he has aspirations of being an Olympic champion and if that’s what you’re trying to do, it’s got to be little steps every day, every week, every month, each year obviously. So yeah, he’ll just keep getting better. He’s definitely the student of the game and a great competitor. Very technical in addition to just being a really good athlete and fast and just having a great feel. So yeah, he’s just a great competitor. He’ll just keep getting better and that’s just his plan. (2:30 – 3:19)\n\nI think they both have done a great job. I mean, they’re competitors. They’re going to go out there and be themselves and the bigger the moment, the better they’re going to wrestle. That’s just what they’ve done their whole lives and that’s what we do as a program. Yeah, great matches. Marcus [Blaze] wrestled a guy he could see in the NCAA finals, right? And [PJ] Duke wrestled an All-American and so it could be the same kind of a situation but the trick is just be yourself regardless of when, where, whoever—just do what you do and they both are great examples of that. (3:42 – 4:18)\n\nI don’t know. I mean, we have a special thing going here, right? I mean, kids know that. They see that. I think I have a pretty good idea of what we’re doing and what we’re not doing. I think in this era and the NIL era and all the different motivations to go to different programs, our kids know that they’re coming here because they want to be the best wrestlers they can possibly be. And so I think when we look back, we’ll see that this era has been good to us because we do our best to follow the rules and we’re going to get the kids that are coming here for the right reasons, right? Because the kids know, recruits know, parents know. So, although it seems like it’s an advantage, I think it’ll be an advantage to us just because kids are coming here with very high character, wanting to be the best wrestlers in the world. (4:34 – 5:35)\n\nYeah, we kind of just threw him in there right away as soon as that decision was made. And Braeden [Davis]is a competitor. He’s fine. He’ll just keep rolling with things and just improve. I thought he wrestled really well on Sunday, bouncing back from a tough loss. I mean, one takedown, there’s such a fine line between winning and losing. So, those are good lessons to learn. And just finishing a shot like you were saying before, getting a stalling call or getting a minute of riding time as opposed to 59 seconds. I mean, that’s just what makes sports fun is just the inches and centimeters that make a difference. He’ll keep competing and just keep getting better as we move forward. (5:44 – 6:36)\n\nI don’t know if there’s anything we didn’t know. He grew up in Pennsylvania, so you watch him—just again, I keep saying our guys are great competitors—but yeah, just a great competitor, very composed. Just wrestled tough and did an awesome job. And it’s just, alright, on to the next one. Obviously, you can’t win the nationals in January, so we’re preparing for the end of the season. And then when we get to the end of the season, it’s the same mindset—we’re just trying to compete to the best of our ability and really preparing for the next tournament because it just gets bigger. Everything gets bigger and things are quickly forgotten and you move on to the next thing. So, it’s just about progress. He’s just a kid that wants to be the best he can possibly be. He’s coachable and he listens, and he follows game plans. Just a tough kid and obviously very talented physically and mentally. (6:46 – 7:45)\n\nI think the chemistry is really incredible right now in the program. Just like I said before, just a lot of good kids that are here for the right reasons. Kids that could have named their price and gone to other schools are here because of what the program represents and stands for. Those are the kids that are going to care about one another and care about the team. When you do that, obviously, you’re going to get your best self and your best individual results. But yeah, these guys, they want to obviously win as individuals, but they’re team guys. The more time they spend together, the better things get. Very good, very close group. Recruits ask how close the guys are, and I think they’re close, but this is a really close group. A lot of really good kids coming from great families, a lot of team mentality, and they want to see each other do well. If it wasn’t like that, it just wouldn’t be fun. It’s got to be bigger than yourself or you’re just going to be miserable all the time. (8:06 – 9:26)\n\nYeah, I don’t think there’s been any surprises with Cole [Mirasola]. He’s just a really tough wrestler. Moves really well. And he’s learning how to wrestle heavyweight. I mean, he bumped up last year at heavyweight, and this would be his third year at heavyweight because his junior year [of high school] he was, but he’s just figuring things out. I don’t think anybody’s surprised. I think the big thing for us as coaches is just him having some nice signature wins for his own confidence. We obviously believe in him and know he can do really, really well and as well as he decides to do. So, yeah, great win for him. As a coaching staff, it’s more about him just knowing and believing that he can do that. So, we’re happy for him, too. (9:46 – 10:34)\n\nGreg [Kerkvliet] is not here anymore—he trains at Lehigh RTC now—but last year I’m sure they wrestled a lot. Greg [Kerkvliet] is a big, strong, athletic, tough guy. If he decides he’s going to win the Olympics, he’s going to win the Olympics. But even just being in the same room as him helped. And then we have a lot of good heavyweights in here and guys in the Nittany Lion Wrestling Club that do a great job. Even with Lucas Cochran, those two had to battle and prepare one another and they’re good friends. I think that was a huge blessing for Cole [Mirasola] to have a big hurdle even just to be the starter this year, which makes everybody stronger. Having a guy like Lucas [Cochran] to wrestle every day—he’s definitely one of the best heavyweights in the country. And everyone knows Coach [Casey] Cunningham is the “heavyweight tamer.” When he comes in, the heavyweights start hiding in the corners trying to get out of there. So, a lot of good training and he’s taken advantage of it all. (10:42 – 12:13)\n\nI’m not really sure what he said, but yeah, Cole [Mirasola] is a nice guy. But just like anything, there was a cartoon my dad had in his office growing up—he was a high school PE teacher and wrestling coach—and it was like a “nice guys finish last” kind of cartoon. It’s not being dirty or cheap—you work within the rules 100%—but then you got to compete. You have to be tough and you have to fight. That goes for all of our guys. There’s never been a great athlete that hasn’t had to fight for things a little bit. Technique is just a small piece. As guys figure that out, it’s kind of fun to see. (12:24 – 13:10)\n\nIt was a pretty crazy environment. It’s like something you dream about your whole life, just Iowa has a good reputation for fans and putting on a good show. So, it was pretty cool to be a part of that. (0:00 – 0:17)\n\nYeah, definitely. I think it’s just amazing kind of what we’re doing and stuff and it’s just incredible to be a part of it. (0:18 – 0:37)\n\nNot really. I kind of just treat every match the same. I try to at least, and I’m sure Marcus [Blaze] is the same. We both have pretty similar mindsets. So, no matter kind of where it is, whether it’s in practice or an actual match or wherever, just try to be the same person as always. And that kind of just helps you stay grounded and don’t let the fans get into the match. But we’ve just been doing it our whole lives, so it’s kind of just regular for us now. (0:38 – 1:19)\n\nYeah, I would have definitely been pretty surprised. I’m grateful to be where I am now and I put in a lot of work in the past, so I think I hold myself to a pretty high standard. I would definitely be proud of myself but I would be like, yeah, I do deserve to be there. (1:21 – 1:50)\n\nYeah, it’s—I mean, just to be at such a great program and to have such good teammates. It’s something that’s unescripable and just it’s kind of special how close our team is. I would say a lot of teams aren’t like that where everyone’s successful and everyone wants each other to get better. Most of the time when people are successful it doesn’t break you down, but not here it’s way different. Everyone wants you to get better and to do better. (1:51 – 2:28)\n\nYeah, it’s pretty special what KD is doing and his pipeline here is definitely amazing because he knows it’s the best place in the world for wrestling. He’s always going to believe that and he wants his guys to be the best in the world. So, he’s obviously going to love them to come here and there’s no better place to be. I’m super excited for those guys, too. They’re going to be really successful when they come here and I’m looking forward to having some fun with them for sure. (2:31 – 3:10)\n\nI would say I was kind of chasing him a little bit. He was more defensive and I would say most of the Iowateam got more defensive the whole time. I kind of just had to be patient and I knew an opening would eventually come and once it did I took advantage of it, took him down and that was pretty much the match. I just again had to be patient and there’s going to be an opportunity every match to score and I just had to take advantage of it. (3:12 – 3:49)\n\nI obviously like scoring a lot of points. That’s the goal is to obviously try and tech or pin everybody I wrestle, but obviously not every match can be perfect. It’s hard to do bonus points every match when guys don’t want to really wrestle too much. Some matches are just going to go a little slower and you got to be patient, but I love to score points, so I’m always going to try and do that. (3:50 – 4:20)\n\nI tried to treat every match similar. So, obviously warming up and stuff, you’re in Carver-Hawkeye Arena, so it’s pretty special. As I was walking out, I was kind of like looking around like, “Wow, this is really happening.” I was talking with Marcus [Blaze] actually before the duel, and I was like, “Yeah, this is crazy. Like we’re literally on Penn State‘s team about to wrestle Iowa.” I think sometimes I do wrestle better under pressure. Having all those fans probably does add a little bit extra pressure, but I try not to let it affect me for the most part, and I’m pretty good about that. (4:21 – 5:07)\n\nHonestly, I didn’t really hear too much to be honest, but we didn’t really give them too much to really chirp at, so they I don’t think they were saying too much. (5:08 – 5:21)\n\nI did hear KD. I can always hear KD. It’s actually kind of crazy. Even with however many fans, I heard KD‘s voice. He’s got a pretty loud voice. (5:22 – 5:32)\n\nIt’s definitely pretty incredible. Just being with this group of guys and being dominant and getting better every day is just so much fun. I think all of us try not to really look at the accolades and the scores and the matches and stuff and we just kind of look at how we can get better. It does mean a lot. Obviously we’re grateful that we did the job good, but we’re just kind of ready to get better and move forward. (5:33 – 6:15)\n\nI don’t know. I don’t think there’s any secret sauce or anything. It’s just keep doing the same things and focusing on the bigger picture of things in terms of getting ready for the next match or preparing for things later in life, not just wrestling. Instilling values into your day-to-day that mean something to you and that mean something to God and that make a difference. Everybody knows them. They’re not some crazy fable or message that you’ve never heard. It’s just making the—what’s the quote? It’s something like extraordinary is just ordinary over and over. (0:18 – 1:10)\n\nI just think it’s nice to be able to look down the line both ways and you got guys that are ready to go. They’re not only ready to go in the wrestling, but they’re enjoying it and they’re having fun. Maybe it’s competing against each other as well—not physically wrestling each other, but whether it’s “I want to get more takedowns than this guy” or whatever. It’s good. I think camaraderie is a big thing, making people feel like they matter and that they belong on a team. (1:27 – 2:03)\n\nHonestly, it’s whoever they send out. Set it up. (2:07 – 2:10)\n\nYou definitely learn a lot about a person and their coaching staff, like what they want to choose to try to throw out and employ against you the next time you wrestle and then the next time. You get to see their thoughts, but then you also get to see who they are when they do step out. Like what was it Mike Tyson said? “Everybody’s got a plan until you get punched in the face.” There is a part of that, but then there’s also a part of preparing. It’s been almost a year since we’ve wrestled, so you get to see things that they’ve tried to implement or they’ve done since then. I think you definitely get better. It’s easier to win once or beat someone one time than it is to continually do it and be successful. Cael [Sanderson] talks about that—it’s harder to win again and again and again. It definitely makes you level up for sure. (2:16 – 3:24)\n\nMaking it a game is definitely fun, like making it enjoyable. It’s just like playing games. You learn a guy—it’s funny, we’ve never spoken, but it’s like we know a lot about each other about little tendencies and little things. I think that’s fun. At the end of the day, you try to make people out to be hero and enemy, but if things got serious and the world turned upside down, you’d want those guys on your team. You’d want to be able to go to battle with any wrestler that you wrestle or compete against. Keeping that in mind, too—no one’s really an enemy. (3:46 – 4:30)\n\nI know what you’re meaning. I just don’t think—I think pride is a very slippery slope and ego and things like that. Like I said earlier, paying attention to the things that matter. If you’re paying attention to things like that, it becomes a thing where you’re not treating everything the same. Then when you’re in NCAA finals and that’s the biggest thing ever, you can’t breathe and your stomach hurts and you’re going out there nervous. At the end of the day, it’s like making this an eternal thing and just like this is more than just a wrestling match. So more so to your point, it’s put who you are, not what you are, out there. (4:52 – 5:39)",

    "description": "Nashville SC played the Chicago Fire in its first preseason match of 2026, losing 4-1 in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.",
    "fullText": "Nashville SC played soccer for the first time in more than two months. And though the result doesn't line up with the club's high expectations for 2026, it's a secondary concern for coach B.J. Callaghan.\n\nNashville lost 4-1 to the Chicago Fire on Jan. 20 in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida in its first preseason game ahead of what might be its most anticipated MLS season ever. Although the match was 90 minutes, starters played for only about half an hour, with backups and players from Huntsville City FC getting the rest of the action.\n\n\"For us, it's more about setting clear objectives of what we worked on this week,\" Callaghan said. \"Being clear with how we're going to evaluate in the game, which would be on certain objectives, a couple phases of play that we were focused on.\"\n\nHere are additional takeaways from the game against the Fire, as well as Nashville's first week of the preseason.\n\nNashville SC arrived in Florida on Jan. 12 and will play four of its six preseason matches there, with the next against the Colorado Rapids on Jan. 23. The team will practice in Nashville for a week ahead of an exhibition at USL club Birmingham Legion on Jan. 31, go back to Florida for two more games and finally face Lexington SC in Nashville on Feb. 14, two days before its CONCACAF Champions Cup opening match at Atletico Ottawa.\n\nNashville dealt with several injuries in its past two preseason training camps, but Callaghan said the team is almost fully healthy, with only one player, Huntsville forward Alioune Ka, sitting out against the Fire.\n\nThat doesn't mean Nashville would be ready to play a competitive game tomorrow.\n\n\"The fitness component is getting there,\" Callaghan said. \"It's growing in the right direction, but we're not where we need to be. We're not 90-minute fit for sure. But it's intentional, and we're gonna build through this preseason.\"\n\nNashville's first MLS game is Feb. 21 against the New England Revolution at Geodis Park (7:30 p.m. CT).\n\nMORE: Nashville SC signals MLS championship aspirations with Cristian Espinoza\n\nNashville's starting lineup looked like a full-strength group. Brian Schwake started at goalkeeper, while new signing Maxwell Woledzi paired with Jeisson Palacios at center back. Dan Lovitz and Andy Najar started at left and right back, respectively.\n\nEdvard Tagseth and Patrick Yazbek held down central midfield, with Alex Muyl and Cristian Espinoza playing on the wings and Hany Mukhtar and Sam Surridge up front in attack.\n\nCallaghan said Nashville started out in the 4-2-2-2 formation, which was its primary setup in 2025. While that remained the base throughout the 90 minutes, Nashville tweaked that shape at different moments.\n\nEspinoza, the club's newest designated player, worked for the first time with the other two DPs, Mukhtar and Surridge. The trio didn't produce any goals, but created a few opportunities, according to Callaghan.\n\n\"They bring different dynamics, whether it's playing between the lines, running behind, being able to get service,\" Callaghan said. \"It's about creating that connection, that chemistry between those three. But at the same time, it's also making sure that we're well dialed-in on the defensive side.\"\n\nMidfielder Charles-Emile Brunet scored Nashville's lone goal on a long shot during the third and final shift, which consisted largely of trialists and draft picks. Brunet was Nashville's third-round pick in December's MLS SuperDraft out of SMU.\n\nJacob Shames can be reached by email at jshames@gannett.com and on X/Twitter @Jacob_Shames.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nashville Tennessean: Nashville SC MLS preseason takeaways, what we learned",

    "description": "Joe Lunardi dropped UNC to a No. 7 seed as defensive issues and recent losses cloud the Tar Heels’ NCAA tournament outlook.",
    "fullText": "With March looming, fans are already scouring bracket projections to see where their teams might land.\n\nThat’s especially true in Chapel Hill, where North Carolina’s uneven ACC play has raised questions about Hubert Davis and the direction of the program. The Tar Heels are 14-4 overall but just 2-3 in league games and have dropped three of their last four.\n\nESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi has taken notice. In his latest update, he slots North Carolina as a No. 7 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament, a slide from last week when the Tar Heels were listed as a No. 5 seed in the East.\n\nNo. 1 Michigan vs. No. 16 ColgateNo. 8 UCF vs. No. 9 AuburnNo. 5 Kansas vs. No. 12 Murray StateNo. 4 Florida vs. No. 13 TroyNo. 6 Villanova vs. No. 11 George MasonNo. 3 Illinois vs. No. 14 UNC WilmingtonNo. 7 North Carolina vs. No. 10 USC/New MexicoNo. 2 Houston vs. No. 15 North Dakota State\n\nThe path out of the Midwest is anything but straightforward.\n\nIn Joe Lunardi’s latest projections, North Carolina opens against the survivor of the First Four game between New Mexico and Southern California.\n\nNew Mexico sits near the top tier of mid-major programs and may be stronger than most of the opponents Carolina has seen to this point. The Lobos are No. 40 in the NET rankings, a better mark than many of the teams on UNC’s schedule. USC, meanwhile, is a capable Big Ten squad whose guard play could expose one of North Carolina’s biggest weaknesses — defending the perimeter.\n\nShould the Tar Heels get through that first test, they would likely draw Houston in the next round, a matchup that could easily spell the end of their tournament run.\n\nWell, the Tar Heels can’t play defense at the moment despite being one of the most efficient teams scoring wise in the conference.\n\nThe Tar Heels rank 16th in field-goal percentage allowed (49.7%) and 17th in points allowed (85.4 per game) and defensive efficiency (120.5).\n\nThe perimeter numbers are especially glaring.\n\nNorth Carolina’s defensive problems start on the perimeter.\n\nThe Tar Heels rank last in the league in 3-point field-goal percentage defense (44.9%) and in effective field-goal percentage, a metric that weighs 3-pointers more heavily. Opponents have shot at least 40% from beyond the arc against UNC in four straight games. Since the start of ACC play, teams have made 72 3-pointers against the Tar Heels — an average of 14.4 per game, the worst rate in the conference.\n\nThe issues don’t stop on the inside. North Carolina is 14th in 2-point field-goal percentage defense and provides little resistance at the rim, sitting 12th in block percentage and 14th in blocks per game. Still, most of the damage is being done from long range.\n\nAnother problem that has flown under the radar is UNC’s inability to force turnovers. The Tar Heels have struggled to create miscues all season and rank second to last in the ACC and 341st nationally in turnover rate across all games. In conference play, they are 16th in turnover percentage and 18th in non-steal turnover percentage — the category that includes forced passes out of bounds, drawn charges and similar plays.\n\nGiven those numbers and a schedule that only gets tougher, North Carolina needs to start stacking quality wins and limiting bad losses to improve its NCAA tournament positioning.\n\nFollow us@TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of North CarolinaTar Heels news, notes and opinions\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC Basketball: Tar Heels sliding in latest Bracketology",

    "fullText": "For the past seven years, the Raiders have fielded the same kicker and punter. And for the last three years they've had the same kick squad trio of kicker Daniel Carlson, punter AJ Cole, and long snapper Jacob Bobenmoyer. But it looks like that trio could be breaking up this offseason.\n\nCole was given a long term extension prior to this past season. Meanwhile Carlson and Bobenmoyer are both set to become free agents this March. The team had every opportunity to re-sign either or both of them. just as they did Cole, but opted not to do that.\n\nIf the team were to sign Carlson back, you'd have to figure they would sign Bobenmoyer as well, just to keep the band together for continuity purposes.\n\nTuesday, the team signed long snapper Alex Ward on a reserve/futures contract, signaling they are prepared to let Bobenmoyer go, which, in turn, would suggest they are preparing to let Carlson go as well.\n\nWard spent the past three seasons with the LA Rams. He was waived last November, which is why he's signing with the Raiders instead of preparing to play in the NFC Championship game right now.\n\nThe three-year veteran went undrafted out of Central Florida where he was the long snapper for three years.\n\nThere is no guarantee he will be the team's long snapper going forward, but the mere fact they have added him suggests a change at the position is coming.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Raiders Wire: Raiders latest signing could signal end for longtime kick squad",

Hockenson has had a solid run as a member of the Minnesota Vikings, but his days in Minnesota may be numbered.\n\nThe Vikings could be looking to free up some salary cap space over the offseason, and cutting the veteran tight end could be an avenue to that end.\n\nIn a recent article, ESPN’s Aaron Schatz predicts that the Vikings will indeed cut Hockenson to free up $9 million or \n\n“With little cap space, the Vikings will say goodbye to tight end T.J. Hockenson, who has had injury issues and is coming off two straight years with fewer than 500 receiving yards. He ranked 35th among tight ends in ESPN's receiver scores this season. Cutting Hockenson would save the Vikings nearly $9 million in cap space before June 1 and $16 million if designated after June 1.”\n\nHockenson is a solid player who has made two Pro Bowls in his career. But, the Viking could probably get comparable production at the position for a cheaper price, and with other needs to address, it makes sense that the Vikings would look to shed cap space where they can.\n\nMinnesota will have an opportunity to identify a replacement for Hockenson in the upcoming 2026 NFL Draft. They could also look to fill the position with a cheaper option via free agency.\n\nMeanwhile, Hockenson is still just 28 years old and should still have some productive play in front of him.

It also helps that Stockton had a relationship with Nunley, as the new Michigan assistant coach was recruiting him when he was on staff at Boise State.\n\n247Sports’ Blair Angulo had good things to say about Nunley’s skills: “A talented cover corner with really good fluidity, the 6-foot, 180-pound Nunley has been a steady riser the last couple years and has seen his stock shift in an upward trajectory. He has shown a knack for man coverage and the ability to impact plays at the catch-point. Nunley had a strong senior season at Western where he was rarely tested on the perimeter, and he was one of the more consistent performers in the off-season showcase circuit.”\n\nThe stats from that “strong” senior year — 57 total tackles, 20 pass deflections, five interceptions and two forced fumbles. He also recorded 26 tackles, two interceptions and 10 total passes defended his junior season.\n\nWith former Michigan signee, four-star cornerback Andre Clarke Jr., being released from his letter of intent earlier this month, it’s good that Kyle Whittingham and company were able to seal the deal here and bring in another cornerback. He joins four-star safety Jordan Deck as the only members of the secondary for the Wolverines in the 2026 recruiting class.\n\nNunley is ranked No. 101 in the state of California, No. 108 at the cornerback position and No. 1,277 overall in the 2026 class on the 247Sports composite.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies were blindsided when their division rivals, the New York Mets, signed Bo Bichette with a short-term, high AAV contract. Now, they need to get back at them, and luckily, there’s a perfect player to do it with.\n\nAccording to Fansided’s Zachary Rotman, the Phillies could be a top suitor for former MVP and All-Star Cody Bellinger. Bellinger would address their outfield problems, and would take Bellinger from the Mets, who are also seen as another top suitor.\n\nMORE: Proposed blockbuster Giants trade sees San Francisco gut punch Dodgers by dealing for $152 million two-time All-Star ace, create 1-2 punch with Logan Webb\n\n“The Phillies need to improve their offense. They admitted such by pursuing Bichette. Bellinger might not be the hitter Bichette is, but he's a really good one nonetheless, and he's a much better defender and base runner. Plus, I'd argue the outfield is much more of a weakness than the infield, so signing Bellinger, an outfielder, could prove to be even more helpful,” Rotman wrote.\n\nThis past season, Bellinger slashed .272/.334/.480/.813 with 25 doubles, 29 home runs, and 98 RBI in 152 games played. He would definitely give the Phillies a facelift in the outfield, and replace Max Kepler as he serves his suspension for P.E.D. use.\n\nMORE: Mets predicted to steal another superstar from crosstown rivals, sign $182 million MVP to create super outfield with Juan Soto\n\nBellinger is projected to receive a six-year, $182 million deal, and that might be too much for the Phillies. However, they were going to offer Bichette seven years, so what’s stopping Philly from doing the same for Bellinger?\n\nHopefully, the Phillies cement their position and get in touch with Bellinger’s camp ASAP. Otherwise, another contender may swoop in and get him from under their noses.\n\nPadres predicted to make blockbuster trade for $50 million All-Star, would be major upgrade over Jayson Heyward\n\nGiants predicted to be dark horse landing spot for $182 million MVP, would be massive upgrade over Drew Gilbert\n\nProposed Diamondbacks trade sees Arizona land $5.6 million All-Star ace, create 1-2 punch with Corbin Burnes",

Here’s some of what he had to say below.\n\n“It’s great. It’s something that we want, man.

    "description": "Baker Mayfield still steamed about how it ended in Cleveland, is looking forward to seeing Kevin Stefanski in Atlanta.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns have experienced little to no success since their return to the NFL in 1999.\n\nBut there was one brief period where it appeared the franchise had finally turned the corner.\n\nThat was in 2020, when first-year head coach Kevin Stefanski and third-year quarterback Baker Mayfield helped lead the Browns to the playoffs for the first time in 18 years.\n\nOnce there, they handed the Pittsburgh Steelers the third playoff loss in what is now a seven-game postseason losing streak, and then pushed the Kansas City Chiefs to the brink before falling in the Divisional Round of the playoffs.\n\nAt the time, it seemed as if the Browns had finally cracked the code with a young head coach and a brash quarterback joining together to take on the NFL.\n\nThis is Cleveland, of course, where everything ends badly when it involves the Browns, so the joy did not last long.\n\nIn 2021, an injured shoulder left Mayfield ineffective, and the Browns lost four of their last six games to miss the playoffs. That offseason, ownership made the ill-fated decision to trade for quarterback Deshaun Watson, shipped Mayfield to the Carolina Panthers for peanuts (a conditional fifth-round selection), and things were never the same.\n\nMayfield bounced from the Panthers to the Los Angeles Rams before landing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2023, where he has thrown for 12,237 yards and 95 touchdowns in three seasons, while leading the Buccaneers to the playoffs twice.\n\nMeanwhile, in Cleveland, the Browns cycled through quarterbacks as Watson was suspended in 2022, and then injured in 2023 and 2024, limiting him to just 19 games.\n\nA surprise playoff appearance in 2023 helped to ease some of the hurt, but a combined record of 8-26 the past two seasons finally brought an end to Stefanski’s tenure in Cleveland. (When you can’t fire the owner, someone has to take the fall.)\n\nAs fate would have it, Stefanski was recently hired by the Atlanta Falcons, who share the NFC South Division with the Buccaneers and Mayfield, setting up an annual home-and-home meeting between the head coach and his former quarterback.\n\n#Falcons’ Kevin Stefanski had a dumpster fire at quarterback in Cleveland — Baker Mayfield and Deshaun Watson failed, which started a chain reaction to 11 other starters. QB Shedeur Sanders closed out last season with seven starts. https://t.co/nnuXs2ZCbd\n\n— D. Orlando Ledbetter (@DOrlandoAJC) January 20, 2026\n\nThat is an angle that D. Orland Ledbetter at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution explored on Tuesday in a (paywalled) column that described Stefanski’s time in Cleveland as a “dumpster fire” at the quarterback position.\n\nFailed is quite the reach pal. Still waiting on a text/call from him after I got shipped off like a piece of garbage. Can’t wait to see you twice a year, Coach. https://t.co/jUUsYkvlOC\n\n— Baker Mayfield (@bakermayfield) January 20, 2026\n\nMayfield, as he has been wont to do during his career, decided to throw some additional fuel on the fire by calling out both Ledbetter and the way his former coach handled the end of their time together in Cleveland:\n\nFailed is quite the reach pal. Still waiting on a text/call from him after I got shipped off like a piece of garbage. Can’t wait to see you twice a year, Coach.\n\nThe NFC South has always been a strange division, where rivalries, like the one between the Falcons and New Orleans Saints, are rarely noticed on a national level. But with Mayfield and Stefanski now in the same division, the Falcons and Buccaneers games this fall are going to be must-see TV.\n\nAnd in a fun scheduling twist, the Browns play both the Falcons and Buccaneers next season, with Atlanta and Stefanski coming to Cleveland, but, sadly, the Browns are facing the Buccaneers in Tampa.",

    "title": "Rose Namajunas: UFC promised 'dream come true' title shot with UFC 324 win over Natalia Silva",
    "description": "If all goes well this Saturday at UFC 324, Rose Namajunas could be on the cusp of two-division glory.",
    "fullText": "Nearly four years have passed since Rose Namajunas reigned supreme as the UFC strawweight champion. And if all goes well this Saturday at UFC 324, she could be on the cusp of two-division glory.\n\nNamajunas, 33, has fought five times since moving up to the flyweight division in 2023, defeating Tracy Cortez, Amanda Ribas and most recently Miranda Maverick in June. To start her 2026 campaign, Namajunas faces off this weekend against the division's No. 2-ranked contender, Natalia Silva. Appearing Tuesday on \"The Ariel Helwani Show,\" Namajunas revealed UFC officials told her a win will earn her a title shot, which means a fight against her good friend, flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko.\n\n“It would be weird, but I mean, we’re martial artists,\" Namajunas told Uncrowned. \"I would love to have a conversation about it and talk with her first and everything like that. She’s somebody that inspired me and that I’ve looked up to. It would definitely be conflicting emotions, but at the same time, I’m down to do it. I also understand if there'd be second thoughts or if it would be kind of weird.\"\n\nThe thought of a Shevchenko fight has floated around in Namajunas' mind since she first gained steam at 125 pounds. For a brief spell, she didn't have to worry about the two meeting in the Octagon, thanks to Alexa Grasso's momentary title run. But Shevchenko ultimately won the belt back from Grasso in 2024, and now the prospective collision between friends appears closer than it's ever been before.\n\n\"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it, but honestly, just as a fan of hers, she’s literally my favorite female fighter, for real,\" Namajunas said of the 37-year-old Shevchenko. \"So it would be so weird because, obviously, I would never want to see her lose, but then I would have to go into a fight and try to beat her. Then, at the same time, as a martial artist, it would just be the ultimate culmination of being able to test myself, because she and Amanda Nunes are the greatest female fighters in MMA [history].\n\n\"It would just be a dream come true, but at the same time, it would definitely be like, 'Ahh!' That's kind of what fighting is — it's weird. I don't hate anybody I fight. I fought people like Tecia Torres — we trained together, then we fought, then we trained together, then we fought [again]. I've done it before. I don't have to hate anybody to compete.\n\n\"It doesn't mean I'm going to be like, 'We're going to have sleepovers and be best friends after,' or anything,\" Namajunas added. \"I love all my opponents, even the ones that maybe I was rivals with. Afterward it's water under the bridge, it's nothing.\"\n\nNamajunas was initially slated to meet Grasso at UFC 324 before the Mexican contender withdrew due to injury, allowing Silva to step in as a late-replacement. A fight against either women wouldn't have been easy for Namajunas though, and the odds reflected that — \"Thug Rose\" was slotted as a betting underdog in both pairings. Grasso opened as a heavy -400 favorite to beat Namajunas on BetMGM lines; against Silva, Namajunas' margin has only widened, with Silva currently listed as a -450 favorite.\n\nRegarding the difficulty of the matchups, Namajunas agrees with the moneyline view, however that's also why she's happier with Saturday's current matchup than with her previous one.\n\n“Stylistically, I think Natalia is just a trickier style to deal with than somebody like Alexa,\" Namajunas said. \"The toughness that Alexa would have brought, just her mental fortitude and how she seems like she doesn't change, no matter what's happening in the fight, that would have posed a different challenge than Natalia.\n\n\"So I’m definitely happier with the change-up, because I feel like I get closer to my goal faster with Natalia, as opposed to Alexa. Even with a dominant performance against Alexa, I don’t know where that would leave me in the mix [for a title shot]. ... Natalia definitely brings more challenges than Alexa did.”\n\nStill young despite her 13-year professional MMA run, Namajunas has accomplished nearly everything she's needed to at this point. Her two UFC title reigns at strawweight etched her into the history books, and while a third at 115 pounds would've been impressive, she's been happy to stay up at flyweight.\n\nEven with her friend manning the throne, the hardware Shevchenko holds is all the motivation Namajunas needs to keep going.\n\n\"I'm not at a stage where I can just not do anything for the rest of my life,\" Namajunas said. \"So finances are still a factor, but it's not the main motivating factor. If anything, I'm good with where I've wanted to be financially, as far as what I've wanted to get out of fighting. I've sort of accomplished most of what I wanted to do.\n\n\"But basically, it's the two-division [champion status] — to just have that as an accomplishment would be a dream come true. It's on the list of when I had goals to achieve in MMA, that was one of the goals that I had.\"",

    "description": "The former outfielders will join Jeff Kent in this year’s induction class",
    "fullText": "Former outfielders Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones have been elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame as part of the 2026 class, as both players reached the 75% threshold for induction as voted on by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America (BBWAA).\n\nThe duo will join second baseman Jeff Kent in the 2026 class, as Kent was selected by the Contemporary Baseball Era Committee back in December.\n\nBoth Beltrán and Jones finished just shy of making the Hall a year ago, as Beltrán received 70.3% of the vote and Jones hit 66.2%. Beltrán, now in his fourth year on the ballot, received 84.2% of the 425 ballots cast, while Jones, in his ninth year on the ballot, reached 78.4%.\n\nBeltrán, 48, seemed like a first-ballot lock near the end of his career, but after he reportedly took a key role in the 2017 Astros’ sign-stealing scandal, he lost his managerial job with the Mets before coaching a game, and his reputation was tarnished.\n\nStill, Beltrán finished his career with 70.0 bWAR, batting .279/.350/.486 with 435 homers, 2,725 hits, 1,587 RBIs, 1,582 runs, and 312 steals over 2,586 games during his 20-year career. He was also named AL Rookie of the Year with the Royals in 1999, and he was selected as an All-Star nine times, won a pair of Silver Sluggers, and three Gold Gloves.\n\nJones, also 48, had a slightly shorter career than Beltrán, playing 17 seasons from 1996 to 2012, though he still accumulated 62.7 bWAR. One of the greatest outfield gloves in baseball history, Jones won 10 Gold Gloves, a Silver Slugger, and was named an All-Star five times. For his career, he hit .254/.337/.486 with 434 homers, 2,196 hits, 1,289 RBIs, 1,204 runs, and 152 steals over 2,196 games.\n\nBeltrán will likely enter the Hall as either a Kansas City Royal or a New York Met. He spent seven years with both clubs, starting his career in Kansas City and accumulating 24.8 bWAR there before spending 2005-2011 in New York, totaling 31.1 bWAR with the Mets. Jones will almost certainly go in as an Atlanta Brave, having spent 12 of his 17 MLB seasons in Atlanta and totaling 61.0 of his 62.7 bWAR with the Braves.\n\nBeyond Beltrán and Jones, the only other player to break the 50% threshold was former second baseman Chase Utley, who garnered 251 votes, good for 59.1%. Andy Pettitte and Félix Hernández both fell just shy of 50%, as Pettitte received 48.5% of the vote on his eighth ballot and Hernández got 46.1% of the vote in his second year on the ballot.\n\nOf the 12 first-year candidates, Cole Hamels is the only name to remain on the ballot entering next year, as the left-handed starter received 23.8% of the vote. Ryan Braun led the group of players who won’t return to the ballot, as he picked up 15 votes (3.5%). Former Brewer Gio González received no votes, while former closer Francisco Rodríguez received 50 votes (11.8%) and will remain on the ballot for a fifth year next time around.\n\nCongratulations to Beltrán and Jones on joining Kent and the other 354 elected members (281 players) in the Hall this summer! The full voting results of this year’s ballot are below.\n\nBBWAA elects Carlos Beltran, Andruw Jones to Hall of Fame. pic.twitter.com/NpBXWv9Q2S\n\n— BBWAA (@officialBBWAA) January 20, 2026",

The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThere's a huge concentration of ICE enforcement right now in Minnesota, specifically here in the Twin Cities. My law firm works with both employers and their employees.\n\nEmployees are very scared — they may be specifically being targeted by ICE, or they have family members or loved ones who are being targeted by ICE and they want to protect them, or they're just scared to be out in public.\n\nThe ICE action isn't just against individuals who are foreign nationals in Minnesota; it's against anyone who appears to be a foreign national, or anyone who's questioned and believed to be not cooperating with ICE — and there could be potential consequences, as we've seen.\n\nIt's a really difficult time for employers now, too. They're facing situations where they may have employees who can no longer work for them or who don't want to come to work, so they have to look at providing them with work-from-home options or other arrangements.\n\nICE is coming to their parking lots or places of business; we're getting questions from employers about how to ensure ICE doesn't have access to their spaces.\n\nWe know that this administration is taking a much broader interpretation of what rights they have in order to enforce immigration laws, and employers must be prepared for this.\n\nAs any law-abiding citizen or entity, you want to cooperate with law enforcement, but it doesn't mean that you don't have rights.\n\nThese are private properties that the businesses own, and businesses can restrict access.\n\nUnless there is some type of judicial order, warrant, or subpoena, there is no obligation for an employer to undertake enforcement activities or to perform the work of ICE activities here.\n\nIf you're communicating that they cannot enter your place of business — such as with a sign that says it's private property and there is no access to ICE — they don't have the right to do that.\n\nWe recommend that employers establish a protocol ahead of time about what they're going to do if ICE comes to their place of employment or contacts them about a specific employee.\n\nWe know now that it can happen; we're seeing it in Minnesota in ways we've never seen before.\n\nHere are questions that I think all employers in the US need to really need to address before that happens:\n\nEmployers should prepare early, before ICE comes to your neighborhood, to your place of employment, or to your city.\n\nIf ICE produces a judicial warrant asking for information or a subpoena about a certain individual, the employer should seek counsel to see what they must do in order to comply with it, whether it's right away or to inform ICE that they need additional time.\n\nIf ICE comes and says, \"I want to talk to this individual,\" and there's no warrant to allow that, an employer can respond, \"Thank you for the request. We will need to seek counsel in order to determine the next steps. We'll be happy to convey this information to the individual when we are able to.\"\n\nI was just on the phone with an employer about potential scenarios that they may face. I asked them, \"What do you plan to do if ICE comes to your parking lot and just parks there? How will you respond to that? Or if you get a call from one of your employees who says, 'I'm too scared to walk out of my car here. I see that there are ICE agents in the parking lot.'\"\n\nIt's so important for employers to prepare for any possible scenario, role-play, and determine, with their counsel, how they will respond to a request from a government agent or ICE.\n\nWe're seeing situations where an individual will say, \"I don't want to speak with you,\" or, \"I have counsel. Please contact my counsel,\" and the ICE agents continue to pressure them. They get very scared, and that's understandable, but please remember that you do have the constitutional right to be silent and not to speak to any investigator without counsel.\n\nWe have Know Your Rights information on our website. Everyone should know they have the right to choose whether to speak to a government agent. They have constitutional rights that, just because they are being threatened by an individual, don't mean that they have to succumb to those threats or requests.\n\nAre you a business owner or employee who's had an experience with ICE?

    "description": "The US reaching a diplomatic agreement with Denmark that could expand the US's presence in Greenland looks like the most likely outcome, JPMorgan said.",
    "fullText": "That is, Trump Always Chickens Out, or the idea that the president's aggressive policy tactics are mostly bluster aimed at getting a party to the negotiating table.\n\nThat's the question investors are mulling this week as the market swoons amid Trump's fiery comments about the future of Greenland, which he has said the US needs to control for national security.\n\nThe White House has told investors not to count on Trump backing down before, but his latest attempt to put pressure on Denmark has Wall Street talking about the president's notorious negotiation style again.\n\nTrump's most recent maneuver has been to threaten eight European nations with 10% tariffs starting in February, ramping up to 25% in June if no deal on Greenland is reached.\n\nTo some forecasters, the Greenland situation is clear: It's another opportunity for investors to position for the TACO trade.\n\n\"I think we need to read this from an 'Art of the Deal' perspective,\" analysts at JPMorgan's international markets intelligence desk wrote in a note on Tuesday. \"Trump creates noise and throws in a maximal stance designed to trigger negotiation and create leverage/urgency.\"\n\n\"The market wants to see if today is TACO Tuesday,\" the bank's market intelligence team added.\n\n\"How much uncertainty investors can stomach is a good question, but the resolve in the FOMO and TACO trade (the belief that President Trump is bluffing on Greenland and is only working to secure a 'deal') has proven time and again to be very difficult to break,\" David Rosenberg, a top economist and the president of Rosenberg Research, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\nAmid talk of a TACO trade revival, analysts say they see a handful of outcomes from Trump's tough talk on Greenland. Here are three ways forecasters see the situation playing out.\n\nThe US reaching an agreement with Denmark that could expand US presence in Greenland — such as by getting access to the territory's natural resources — looks like the most likely outcome, JPMorgan said, pegging the scenario with a 55% probability.\n\n\"We know Trump opens with a maximal stance, designed to trigger negotiation and create leverage. This is no different,\" the bank said, noting that the timing of the tariff threats looked \"not coincidental,\" given that the World Economic Forum is in full swing this week.\n\nAnalysts added that a sale of Greenland looks \"less likely\" due to the need to get Denmark's approval, and the US using military force to take Greenland looks \"highly unlikely,\" since it would draw pushback from Republican lawmakers and voters. The US attacking another NATO member could also open the door to further aggression from the bloc's rivals, JPMorgan added.\n\nThere's a 40% chance Trump's new tariffs won't be implemented at all, possibly by Trump's \"own retreat,\" according to Matt Gertken, the chief geopolitical and US political strategist at BCA Research.\n\nGertken added that he believed there was a 70% chance the situation in Greenland would have a \"non-military\" solution, and a 30% chance that solution would involve a short-term trade war with Europe.\n\n\"Global stocks would fall, while US treasuries and the dollar would fall, but the administration would then change course, as it did after Liberation Day,\" he wrote in a client note on Monday.\n\nChristopher Granville, a managing director at TS Lombard, added that he believed the most likely outcome was a \"truce\" between the US and Europe, with the US likely suspending tariffs as negotiations over Greenland stretch on.\n\nThat was what happened when Trump first introduced tariffs on Mexico and Canada last year, Granville added, later pointing to political pressures from the coming midterm elections, which could incentivize Trump to lower tariffs.\n\n\"Some commentators may slap the TACO label on any such truce that could be agreed at this week's in-person meetings in Davos between Trump and various European leaders,\" Granville said, though he noted that the situation wouldn't be a \"TACO for real\" scenario, since the US wasn't backing down on Greenland entirely.\n\nThe expected Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariffs could also come into play.\n\nBCA estimated there was around a 50% chance the Supreme Court could strike down Trump's tariffs, up from a 30% chance the firm had predicted earlier.\n\n\"Normally the court would defer to the president on international issues. But now the president threatens to entangle the court in lawless behavior that threatens the court's credibility and the constitutional balance of powers,\" Gertken said, pointing to Trump's threats against the NATO alliance. \"So we have less confidence that the court will defend the president's stance.\"\n\nJPMorgan's international market intelligence team said the latest tariff threats were \"riddled with challenges.\"\n\n\"First, the proposed tariffs are based on IEEPEA, which the Supreme Court could imminently rule to be illegal in their application. Second, I would think it practically impossible to tariff 6x EU countries at a different rate to other members, given the freedom of movement of goods which structurally exists within the EU,\" the bank's Matthew See wrote.",

    "description": "Visiting Montana's Glacier National Park in the winter requires a bit more preparation. Here's what travelers need to know before their trip.",
    "fullText": "Montana's Glacier National Park typically sees over 2 million visitors between May and August each year.\n\nAlthough I love taking in the park's beauty in the warmer seasons, this spike in visitation can often lead to long lines to enter the park.\n\nHowever, after living near the park for 35 years, I've discovered the best time to visit is during the less-chaotic winter months.\n\nAlthough many of the park's services are technically closed from early October through late May, I love the peace and solitude the park offers during this time.\n\nVisiting Glacier National Park in the winter requires a bit more planning, but in my opinion, it's worth it. Here are my tips for visiting during the offseason.\n\nDuring the winter months, a pass is still required to visit the park, even if no one is manning the entrance. Luckily, though, the rates are typically cheaper than they would be in the winter months.\n\nEntrance passes can be purchased online via the National Parks Service website.\n\nMany of the park's roads are closed in the winter, making for great opportunities for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.\n\nSince our boys were young, we've loved strapping on cross-country skis or snowshoes to travel along Going-to-the-Sun Road for a couple of miles until we reach the bridge that crosses McDonald Creek.\n\nIn this section of the park, we pass through an area of dense, old-growth western hemlock and western red cedar that feels like the forests of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nJust keep in mind that if you decide to travel to higher elevations, you need to be prepared for changing winter conditions, and be familiar with avalanche safety.\n\nIf you want to explore the area with a knowledgeable guide, head to the Apgar Visitor Center for one of the ranger-led snowshoe outings held weekends from the end of December to the middle of March.\n\nIf you don't have your own snowshoes, you can rent a pair for $2.\n\nThis is a fantastic opportunity to learn about the park in the winter and look for signs of wildlife in the snow.\n\nOne of my most important pieces of advice is to not take the winter lightly when visiting Glacier. There is little or no cell service throughout most of the park, and the weather can quickly switch from idyllic to a blizzard.\n\nLeave your cotton clothing at home, and instead opt for wool, alpaca, or synthetic fabrics that wick away sweat. Wear multiple layers, including a wind-breaking outer layer, a hat, and gloves.\n\nAlso, remember to fill your gas tank or charge your electric vehicle before entering the park, as you will not have the opportunity to do so once you get inside.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 23, 2024, and most recently updated on January 20, 2026.",

    "description": "The Dow tumbled 870 points on Tuesday as investors assessed the impact of Trump's intensifying push to take control of Greenland.",
    "fullText": "US stocks plunged, and bonds sold off on Tuesday on Donald Trump's feud with Europe over Greenland.\n\nAfter spending much of 2025 doubting the president over everything from tariffs to threats to fire Fed boss Jerome Powell, stocks had their worst day since October amid Donald Trump's fight with European nations about who should control the Danish territory.\n\nThe sell America trade was in the spotlight again on Tuesday amid the latest turmoil.\n\nUS stocks plunged as investors took in the latest tariff threats targeting eight European Union countries if Denmark doesn't put Greenland up for sale by the start of February. EU leaders have discussed hitting back with tariffs of their own.\n\nMajor indexes fell sharply, with losses accelerating in afternoon trading. The Dow dropped almost 900 points, and traders sought shelter in defensive assets like gold and silver. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined more than 2%.\n\nLong-dated US Treasury yields spiked, while the US dollar declined against a basket of other currencies. Highlighting tensions in the bond market, a Danish pension said it was exiting the market for US government debt, with plans to dump $100 million in Treasurys due to \"poor\" US government finances.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood around 4 p.m. ET closing bell on Tuesday:\n\nHere were other big moves across markets:\n\nUntil now, investors had mostly brushed off Trump's talk of taking over Greenland.\n\nThat seems to have changed now that tariffs are back in the picture.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said eight NATO countries, including Denmark, would face a 10% tariff on goods exported to the US in February, with the rate increasing to 25% in June if Denmark doesn't agree to \"the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\"\n\n\"The United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years,\" the president wrote on his social media platform over the weekend, pointing to new defense initiatives that make acquiring Greenland \"especially important\" for the US.\n\n\"The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them, including maximum protection, over so many decades,\" he continued.\n\nThe sell-off has largely been driven by investors trimming their exposure to US equities now that tariffs, a major concern for markets all throughout last year, appear to be on the table, David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors also seem worried that the Supreme Court ruling on Trump's reciprocal tariffs could add further volatility in markets, he added.\n\n\"The US President upped his aggressive rhetoric overnight,\" Morrison said of the selling pressure. \"While some on Wall Street argue any tariff-driven sell-off could be a buying opportunity as the earnings season picks up steam, the scale and breadth of Trump's rhetoric have unsettled risk appetite.\"\n\nThe latest tariff threats are also driving a flight to safe-haven or defensive assets, like metals. Gold rose another 3% while silver jumped 8%.\n\n\"Global investors are clearly adding to the risk premium embedded in US assets, and diversification flows are picking up,\" Karl Schamotta, the chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions, wrote in a note.\n\nA major move in Japan's bond market also contributed to some of the volatility in the US. The yield on Japan's 40-year government bond hit a record 4.21% on Tuesday as investors weighed a new tax cut proposal that has raised concerns about the nation's growing deficit.\n\nThe nation's 10-year government bond yield also increased by more than 10 basis points to trade around 2.38%, a level that hasn't been seen in 27 years.\n\nRising yields in Japan have sparked fresh concern about the amount of foreign capital flowing into US markets. Specifically, investors are worried about the unwinding of the yen carry trade, a popular strategy in which traders borrow money at low rates in Japan to deploy in markets that offer higher returns, such as the US.\n\n\"As a sliding yen triggers intervention chatter, the fate of the massive 'yen-carry trade' hangs in the balance,\" Ed Yardeni, the President of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note to clients over the weekend.",

    "description": "For decades, there had been an average of 30 each year. With a new deterrent in place, there were none in the second half of 2025.",
    "fullText": "The Golden Gate Bridge, the iconic span that hangs between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, has been the site of more than 2,000 confirmed suicide leaps since its completion in 1937. The true death toll is certainly higher, since not all jumps are witnessed and not all bodies are recovered.\n\nIn 2006, at least 34 people jumped to their deaths by crossing the four-foot rail and plunging more than 200 feet into the strait below. It was also the year that Paul Muller and two others with family members who had jumped from the bridge decided to do something.\n\nThat something slowly evolved into a complicated, miles-long series of stainless-steel nets — a “suicide deterrent system” — now strung on both sides of the bridge. It is out of sight to the millions of people who cross the bridge every year, but plainly visible to anyone standing at the rail, looking down.\n\nFor decades, there had been an average of 30 suicides at the bridge each year. In 2024, as the final pieces of the net were installed and tweaks were made, there were eight.\n\nIn 2025, the first full year with the nets in place, there were four, and none between June and December.\n\nThat annual total is surely among the fewest ever recorded at the bridge, and seven months might be the longest stretch without a suicide at the bridge, though early records are sparse.\n\n“The last seven months there were zero, so the results couldn’t be better,” Mr. Muller said.\n\nMr. Muller was disheartened to learn that there has been one suicide early in 2026. But the goal all along was to save lives, and to eventually undo the dark magnetism of the bridge as a place to die.\n\nDenis Mulligan oversees the bridge operations as general manager of the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District. His office at the south end of the bridge overlooks the steady flow of cars, pedestrians and bikes that cross between San Francisco and Marin County.\n\nIn late 2023, as the installation of the nets was nearing completion, Mr. Mulligan said it would take a year or two of data collection to assess the impact of the nets on the death toll outside his window.\n\nEarly in 2026, Mr. Mulligan considered the results.\n\n“The assessment is that the net is working as intended,” Mr. Mulligan said. “We’re trying to reduce the number of deaths. That’s what government should do, is protect the public. We were candid up front that nothing’s 100 percent, but that we think this is a worthwhile endeavor and good for the community. And we think a lot of people are alive today because of the project.”\n\nMr. Mulligan also oversees a vast electronic surveillance system and a team of on-bridge officers whose responsibilities include identifying and stopping those who are considering a leap. Last year, there were 94 successful interventions, about half as many as the average before the nets.\n\n“Nets” is a misnomer; they are taut, marine-grade stainless steel cables about 20 feet below the public walkways on both sides of the bridge. The idea is that anyone who jumps into the net will be injured enough, or at least shaken enough, to keep them from crawling out and intentionally falling the rest of the way to the water.\n\nMr. Mulligan, wary of attracting copycat attempts, declined to explain how those who have died by suicide the past two years have circumvented the nets. He also declined to say how many people have jumped into them and been rescued.\n\nBut the immeasurable number might be those who came to the bridge, spotted the nets and decided that suicide there was no longer possible.\n\nIn 1937, 10 weeks after the bridge opened, a 47-year-old World War I veteran reportedly said, “This is as far as I go,” and jumped.\n\nHis was the first known suicide. Others followed. In 1939, the California Highway Patrol recommended that the four-foot rails be raised. For decades, decision makers ducked behind aesthetic concerns, costs and effectiveness. The death toll, loosely tracked, reached 500, then 1,000, and kept growing every week or two, on average.\n\nFrustrated by the inertia, Mr. Muller, Dave Hull and Patrick Hines founded the nonprofit Bridge Rail Foundation in 2006, with the hope of raising, finally, the height of the rails.\n\n“The overriding concept to the Golden Gate Bridge story is restricting easy access to lethal means,” Muller said. “It’s a way to reduce suicides that John and Jane Q. Public can do. You don’t need a lot of complex psychiatric training to, say, simply lock up the guns.”\n\nOr to make leaping into the ocean more difficult.\n\nSupport grew slowly. Growing numbers of grieving families, mental health professionals, even coroners pleaded for something to be done. Eventually, the idea that took hold was borrowed from a solution used in Bern, Switzerland: nets.\n\nDebates raged, approvals came, construction bids opened and costs rose. There were legal squabbles with contractors. Construction began in 2018, meaning it took longer to install the nets than the four-plus years it took to build the bridge itself. What was once estimated to cost $76 million ended up costing $224 million.\n\nCritics have long wondered if steering the suicidal away from the Golden Gate Bridge merely sends them elsewhere to take their own life. Net proponents do not think so.\n\nA 1978 study by Richard Seiden, at the University of California, Berkeley, tracked 515 people who, between 1937 and 1971, went to the Golden Gate Bridge intending to jump but had been persuaded not to. It found that 94 percent were still alive or had died of natural causes.\n\n“Suicidal behavior is crisis-oriented and acute in nature,” Mr. Seiden concluded.\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has long been a unique draw for the suicidal, some even coming from other states and countries. At the edge of the ocean, on one of the world’s most famous structures, it was a way to die somewhere both beautiful and notable. Death was almost certain. (Most jumpers are killed on impact, but those who survive usually drown.)\n\nAnd access was simple, with parking lots on both ends and public sidewalks along a short rail.\n\n“The bridge has exerted a siren’s call for so long for some suicidal people that it might be hard for them to believe that it’s no longer the case,” said John Bateson, a longtime director of a suicide prevention center in the Bay Area and author of “The Final Leap: Suicide on the Golden Gate Bridge.” He writes a monthly newsletter for the Bridge Rail Foundation.\n\nThat might all explain why, while the number of suicides in 2025 were about one-seventh the pre-net average, interventions only dropped in half. People are still showing up.\n\n“The more people who know that the barrier is in place will be discouraged for even thinking about the Golden Gate Bridge as a suicide destination,” Mr. Bateson said.\n\nThe Bridge Rail Foundation remains active, despite the successful completion of its original goal. It fields calls from officials around the world looking to reduce suicides from other bridges or high places.\n\nThat might be the incalculable legacy of the work, beyond the raw number of lives saved at the Golden Gate Bridge. If one of the world’s most famous and deadliest bridges can prevent all but a few suicides, other places can probably do the same.\n\n“That’s certainly the hope,” Mr. Bateson said. “From the outset, all of us have recognized that whatever happens on the Golden Gate Bridge is going to serve as a model for others.”\n\nIf you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.",

    "fullText": "Feel like X's algorithm needs work? Elon Musk agrees.\n\nMusk isn't a fan of X's algorithm, and he's documenting the company's efforts to improve the technology that decides what you see in the platform's \"For You\" feed.\n\nMusk said he is overhauling the recommendation system that decides which user-generated posts and advertisements are shown when you open the app. He also pledged to make that system transparent in the process, with the underlying code getting published on GitHub every four weeks. Musk said any changes to the code will be explained with every post.\n\n\"We know the algorithm is dumb and needs massive improvements, but at least you can see us struggle to make it better in real-time and with transparency,\" Musk wrote on X. \"No other social media companies do this.\"\n\nX's engineering team has also said the new recommendation system is built on the same architecture as Grok, the chatbot developed by Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI.\n\nWhile X has not said the two systems share training data or model weights, the comparison signals a shift toward more AI-driven content ranking, moving beyond the rules-based and engagement-heavy systems the app has historically relied on.\n\nKey questions remain about how the system operates in practice. X did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for more specifics on the algorithm.\n\nThe social media app, formerly known as Twitter, hasn't always relied on algorithms to serve its users.\n\nFrom its launch in 2006 through 2015, it presented posts in reverse chronological order, showing users the most recent tweets from accounts they followed.\n\nBut, in 2016, after several updates, a \"Show me the best tweets first\" option became the default for all users.\n\nOver time, the system grew more complex, incorporating engagement signals such as likes, replies, shares, and blocks to predict what content users were most likely to interact with or remove.\n\nMusk has long voiced frustrations with that algorithm.\n\nBefore acquiring Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, he repeatedly described the platform's algorithm as a \"black box,\" arguing that it introduced political bias and failed to reflect users' true preferences — particularly for politically conservative users.\n\nHis complaints continued after the purchase. In a 2024 post, he said the rules-based algorithms had become too divisive.\n\n\"One of the strongest signals is if you forward X posts to friends, it assumes you like that content a lot, because it takes effort to forward,\" Musk wrote. \"Unfortunately, if the actual reason you forwarded the content to friends was because you were outraged by it, we are currently not smart enough to realize that.\"\n\nHe recommended that users send videos of puppies to friends to combat the issue.",

    "fullText": "Friends … followers … where is the line?\n\nInstagram is testing out new tweaks that emphasize friends. It also has a new definition of friends: People who mutually follow each other.\n\nThe Instagram test involves changing a user's \"following\" count on a profile to a \"friends\" count. That means if you follow thousands of people, but maybe only a few hundred of those people follow you back, that'll show up as your \"friends\" count.\n\nFor those of you who care about those precious follower-to-following ratios, get ready for a potentially even more telling public ratio: How many of those Instagram followers are friends?\n\nInstagram is quietly running this as a \"small global test,\" a Meta spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider, adding that the platform is trying to understand how users respond to seeing more content from friends in the app.\n\n\"Friends are central to the Instagram experience, so we're exploring ways to make these connections more visible and meaningful,\" a Meta spokesperson said. \"We're running a small test to highlight Friends throughout Instagram.\"\n\nAs part of the test, Meta is also labeling some content in the feed as \"friends\" instead of \"posts\" or \"following.\"\n\nAs influencers, brands, and now AI slop have invaded Instagram's feed, it's felt less and less like a space to share content with your friends.\n\nThat's part of the reason Instagram has doubled down on its \"Close Friends\" features over the years, focused on direct messaging (where friends and family often share content), and added more friend-focused features.\n\nFor instance, Instagram rolled out a feature called \"Blend,\" which lets you and a friend share a mutual feed of reels.\n\nLast year, Instagram also introduced features like a social mapping experience similar to Snapchat's map, as well as a \"Friends\" feed in the reels tab, where you can see content your friends (by Instagram's definition) are engaging with.\n\nInstagram's top executive, Adam Mosseri, said in an August post that he wants Instagram to be somewhere where users can \"actually engage with and connect with the people that you care about.\"",

    "description": "The figure offers insight into the war's growing financial toll as Kyiv pushes for more tools to defend against Russia.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces fired nearly $100 million worth of air defense missiles battling Russia's latest bombardment, Kyiv revealed on Tuesday, offering insight into the war's growing financial toll.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that the Russian attack, which began Monday night and continued into Tuesday, forced Kyiv to launch around €80 million (roughly $94 million) worth of interceptor missiles.\n\n\"Imagine that — the cost of these missiles,\" Zelenskyy said over WhatsApp in response to a question about interceptor stockpiles.\n\nThe staggering figure covers only the interceptor missiles and does not appear to account for any other munitions expended to defend against the Russian attack, which also included hundreds of drones.\n\nRussia launched 18 ballistic missiles, 15 cruise missiles, and one anti-ship missile overnight, according to data from Ukraine's air force. It said in a statement that 27 were shot down, while five hit their targets.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia has \"significantly increased\" its use of ballistic missiles and has been able to obtain critical technology for the munitions from third-party countries and from industry.\n\n\"Nevertheless, their ability to produce these missiles must be reduced — and that is not happening yet,\" he said in response to another question.\n\nAlthough Ukraine has received some additional air defense systems from Western countries, Zelenskyy said more are still needed, along with additional interceptor missiles to keep pace with Russia's attacks.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged that it has been difficult for Ukraine to obtain the necessary interceptor missiles. He specifically singled out the PAC-3, which has a $3.7 million price tag and is fired from US-made Patriot batteries, as the best chance Kyiv has to defeat Russian ballistic missiles.\n\n\"War is an extremely expensive Russian luxury, and for us it results in severe losses,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussian missiles are not the only worry for Ukraine. Moscow's overnight attack involved 339 drones. Kyiv said its Air Force shot down 315 of them. Two dozen hit their targets.\n\nTo preserve its costly air defense missiles, Ukraine has been increasingly relying on locally made interceptor drones that cost as little as a few thousand dollars to hunt down and destroy Russian drones.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine is producing around 1,000 interceptor drones each day, a goal he set last summer. The challenge now, he said, is that the number of drones has outpaced the number of operators who can control them.\n\n\"Therefore, now we must catch up in terms of the number of interceptor groups — the corresponding mobile groups,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he has tasked senior Ukrainian military leadership with bridging the gap.",

    "fullText": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk are at it again, with each of the tech titans taking aim at the other in a series of heated posts on X.\n\nMusk appeared to start the latest escalation early on Tuesday morning, when he posted \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT\" in response to a post that said that use of OpenAI's chatbot had been linked to the deaths of nine children and adults since it was released in 2022.\n\nAltman fired back, first in defense of ChatGPT and OpenAI's desire to protect its users, and then blasting Tesla's Autopilot technology, calling it unsafe.\n\n\"It is genuinely hard; we need to protect vulnerable users, while also making sure our guardrails still allow all of our users to benefit from our tools,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman continued, calling out Autopilot.\n\n\"I only ever rode in a car using it once, some time ago, but my first thought was that it was far from a safe thing for Tesla to have released,\" he wrote. \"I won't even start on some of the Grok decisions.\"\n\nAltman added: \"You take 'every accusation is a confession' so far.\"\n\nThere have been at least eight wrongful-death lawsuits filed against OpenAI that allege use of ChatGPT has contributed to worsening mental health conditions, leading to instances of suicide and murder, including among children and young adults.\n\nSafety concerns around Tesla's self-driving technology have also been central to multiple wrongful-death lawsuits, including one surrounding a 2019 crash in Florida that left a 22-year-old woman dead. A jury determined Tesla was 33% liable for the crash and awarded the plaintiffs $329 million in total damages, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and Altman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe social media feud comes as the pair is stuck in the middle of a long-running legal battle over OpenAI's status as a nonprofit company. Musk sued Altman, and other leaders of OpenAI, alleging that they misled him when they decided to pursue a for-profit structure, moving the company away from its original nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was originally founded as a nonprofit.",

    "fullText": "When Fox News asked Usha Vance in June 2024 how she felt about her husband, JD Vance, being considered as Donald Trump's running mate, she told host Lawrence Jones that she was \"not raring to change anything about our lives right now.\"\n\nBut it appeared she came around — she spoke at the Republican National Convention as her husband was officially nominated to join the ticket and appeared alongside him at Trump campaign's victory party on election night.\n\nJD Vance, the former junior senator from Ohio and bestselling author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" and Usha Vance, a litigator whose résumé includes a Supreme Court clerkship, met as students at Yale Law School and wed in 2014.\n\nSince becoming vice president and second lady, the Vances have taken several international trips together, including a visit to the US military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland in March 2025.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Vances announced that they are expecting their fourth child, making Usha Vance the first second lady in US history to be pregnant while in office.\n\nHere's a look inside the relationship of the newest GOP power couple who serve as vice president and second lady.\n\nJD Vance served as a public affairs Marine in Iraq, liaising between service members and members of the press. After his military service, he majored in political science and philosophy at Ohio State University.\n\nUsha Vance grew up in a suburb of San Diego. Her parents are Indian immigrants.\n\nUsha Vance told Fox News in June that her parents' Hindu faith was \"one of the things that made them such good parents, that make them very good people.\"\n\nShe was a registered Democrat until 2014.\n\nIn law school, Usha Vance served as executive development editor of the Yale Law Journal and managing editor of the Yale Journal of Law and Technology, according to a bio on the website of her former employer, Munger, Tolles & Olson, that has since been removed.\n\nShe also worked pro bono with the Supreme Court Advocacy Clinic, the Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic, and the Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nUsha Vance told NBC News in 2017 that she and JD Vance took all of their classes together and were friends before they started dating. When they were assigned to work on a brief together, Usha Vance said she was impressed by his diligence.\n\n\"I've never seen anybody so starstruck,\" their law school professor, Amy Chua, said of JD Vance in an interview with NBC News. \"It was love at first sight.\"\n\nVance converted to Catholicism in 2019, The American Conservative reported. Usha Vance was raised Hindu.\n\nWhen asked about their interfaith marriage in a June 2025 interview with Fox News, Usha Vance said: \"There are a lot of things that we just agree on, I think, especially when it comes to family life, how to raise our kids. So I think the answer really is that we just talk a lot.\"\n\nWhile speaking at a Turning Point USA event in October 2025, JD Vance said that he hoped his wife would someday convert to Christianity.\n\n\"Do I hope that eventually she is somehow moved by what I was moved by in church? Yeah, honestly, I do wish that, because I believe in the Christian Gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,\" he said. \"But if she doesn't, then God says everybody has free will, and so that doesn't cause a problem for me.\"\n\nJD Vance's memoir details his working-class upbringing and the lives of poor, white Americans. He also wrote about how Chua, his professor, encouraged him to focus on his relationship with Usha Vance as a Yale law student.\n\nWhen JD Vance asked Chua to recommend him for a federal clerkship, she warned him that it's \"the type of thing that destroys relationships.\"\n\n\"Amy's advice stopped me from making a life-altering decision. It prevented me from moving a thousand miles away from the person I eventually married,\" Vance wrote.\n\n\"Most important, it allowed me to accept my place at this unfamiliar institution — it was okay to chart my own path and okay to put a girl above some shortsighted ambition,\" he continued. \"My professor gave me permission to be me.\"\n\nVance worked at Mithril Capital, a VC firm backed by Peter Thiel, in 2016. One former coworker previously told Business Insider that Vance was often away from the job promoting his book, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"\n\nThiel ended up being instrumental in Vance's rise to power in politics, donating $15 million to his Senate campaign and encouraging Trump to choose Vance as his running mate, The New York Times reported.\n\nVance went on to work at Revolution, a VC firm in Washington, DC, before founding his own firm, Narya Capital, in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, Usha Vance worked as a litigator at Munger, Tolles & Olson before leaving to clerk for Judge Brett Kavanaugh in the US Court of Appeals and Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts. Following her clerkships, she returned to Munger, Tolles & Olson, according to a bio on the firm's website that has since been removed.\n\nTheir first child, Ewan, was born a month before Usha Vance began her clerkship with Chief Justice Roberts, NBC News reported. They also have another son, Vivek, and a daughter, Mirabel.\n\nIn January 2026, the Vances announced that they are expecting their fourth child, a boy, in July.\n\n\"I'm not raring to change anything about our lives right now, but I really believe in JD and I love him, so we'll see what happens with our lives,\" she told Fox News in June 2024.\n\nOn the first day of the Republican National Convention, when Trump announced JD Vance as his vice presidential pick, a spokesperson for Munger, Tolles & Olsen told ABC News that Usha Vance had left the firm.\n\n\"Usha has been an excellent lawyer and colleague, and we thank her for her years of work and wish her the best in her future career,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nUsha Vance said that when they first met, JD Vance approached their differences \"with curiosity and enthusiasm.\"\n\n\"Although he's a meat and potatoes kind of guy, he adapted to my vegetarian diet and learned to cook food from my mother, Indian food,\" Usha Vance said in her speech. \"Before I knew it, he'd become an integral part of my family, a person I could not imagine living without.\"\n\nAfter white nationalist Nick Fuentes questioned JD Vance's ability to \"support white identity\" with an Indian wife, he voiced support for his spouse.\n\n\"Look, I love my wife so much. I love her because she's who she is,\" JD Vance said in an interview with Megyn Kelly in July. \"Obviously, she's not a white person, and we've been attacked by some white supremacists over that. But I just, I love Usha.\"\n\nHe also hit back against the attacks on ABC News' \"This Week,\" telling host Jonathan Karl in August, \"Look, my attitude to these people attacking my wife is, she's beautiful, she's smart. What kind of man marries Usha? A very smart man and a very lucky man, importantly.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Don't attack my wife. She's out of your league.\"\n\nUsha Vance appeared alongside her husband and members of the Trump family at the campaign's election night event in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n\"THANK YOU!\" Vance wrote on X after the election results came in. \"To my beautiful wife for making it possible to do this. To President Donald J. Trump, for giving me such an opportunity to serve our country at this level. And to the American people, for their trust. I will never stop fighting for ALL of you.\"\n\nJD Vance was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Usha Vance's former boss when she clerked for him in the US Court of Appeals.\n\nThe vice president attended the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris and the Munich Security Conference. He and Usha Vance also visited the Dachau concentration camp in Germany.\n\nThey brought their three children along on Air Force Two.\n\nSince winning a second non-consecutive term in the White House, Trump has doubled down on his intention to acquire Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory where the US has a military base. The governments of Greenland and Denmark have maintained that it is not for sale, but Trump has said he would not rule out using force.\n\nIn March 2025, the White House announced that Usha Vance would embark on a solo trip to Greenland to \"visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland's national dogsled race.\" The government of Greenland said that they had not invited any delegations to visit, and Greenland's Prime Minister Múte Bourup Egede called the trip \"very aggressive.\" Trump said that Greenland had asked the US to visit.\n\nUsha Vance's trip was subsequently scaled back to visiting Pituffik Space Base, the US military's northernmost installation in Greenland. In a video, JD Vance announced he would travel with her.\n\n\"There was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her,\" he said.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, JD Vance's press secretary, told Business Insider that the Vances were \"proud\" to visit Greenland.\n\n\"The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island,\" Van Kirk said.\n\nDuring a public appearance at military bases in North Carolina, observers noticed that Usha Vance wasn't wearing her wedding ring.\n\nIn a statement to People magazine, the second lady's spokesperson described Usha Vance as \"a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths, and forgets her ring sometimes.\"\n\nJD Vance also addressed the marriage rumors, telling NBC News that \"we kind of get a kick out of it\" and that their marriage was \"as strong as it's ever been.\"",

    "description": "The link to claim your credit is actually a phishing scheme.",
    "fullText": "Verizon had a massive outage last week, leaving roughly two million customers unable to use their phones off of wifi or SOS mode for nearly a day. As an apology for the inconvenience, the company promised to refund those affected a meager $20 to their accounts—so naturally, scammers quickly got a phishing scheme up and running targeting people eligible for the credit. As reported by Android Authority, the Jones County Sheriff's Office in Georgia has issued an alert about fake Verizon \"credit\" messages floating around.\n\nAccording to the sheriff's office, scammers may contact you via text or email—claiming to be from Verizon—with information about the outage credit. These messages contain phishing links, which may be set up to collect personal information or account credentials or deliver malware to your device. Clicking through will likely compromise your data in some way, especially if you enter any details on a malicious website.\n\nIf you are a Verizon customer who was affected by the outage, you will receive a text letting you know that your $20 credit is available to claim in the myVerizon app, which is why you may not be immediately suspicious of the scam. Plus, since you do need to claim the funds, you may be swayed by a message that sounds urgent. Don't fall for it.\n\nIn general, you shouldn't click links in unsolicited communication, and you should be suspicious of any messages that prompt you to click said links, even if they appear to be from a legitimate company about a legitimate matter. As evidenced by this phishing campaign and those like it, scammers can and will impersonate trusted brands and use real events to seem more believable.\n\nInstead, always navigate directly to the app or official website—type in the URL and check it carefully or go through your password manager—and log in using your account credentials. Once logged in, you can see any legitimate communication and take action securely. Know that scammers can easily spoof websites, so if you click a phishing link, you may not realize that you're on a fake page.",

    "title": "ChatGPT Is Getting on the AI Age Verification Bandwagon",
    "description": "The app will guess your age and set limits for users it thinks are under 18.",
    "fullText": "When OpenAI first announced GPT-5.2 last month, it quietly disclosed a new safety feature it called \"age prediction.\" Considering ChatGPT proper isn't exactly an \"all ages\" kind of tool, it makes sense that users under the age of 18 should have protections in place to shield them from harmful content. The company says that users who indicate they're under 18 already receive an altered experience to \"reduce exposure to sensitive or potentially harmful content,\" but if the user doesn't voluntarily share how old they are with OpenAI, how does the company enforce these protections? Here's where age prediction comes in.\n\nOn Tuesday, OpenAI officially announced its new age prediction policy, which, like other age verification systems being used by the likes of Roblox, uses AI to guess how old a user is. If the system decides that a particular user is under the age of 18, OpenAI will adjust the experience accordingly, with the goal of keeping all interactions age-appropriate.\n\nHere's how it works: The new age prediction model looks at both the user's behaviors within the app, as well as the general account data. That includes things like how old the account is, what times of day the user is accessing ChatGPT, usage patterns, as well as, of course, the age the user says they are. Looking at all this data, the model determines how old the user likely is. If the model thinks they're over 18, they'll get the full experience; if the model thinks they're under 18, they'll get the \"safer experience.\" If the model isn't confident, it defaults to that safer experience.\n\nThat limited experience means that someone the model thinks is under 18 will try to reduce the following content types:\n\nViral challenges that might inspire \"risky or harmful behaviors\"\n\nRole play that is sexual, romantic, or violent in nature\n\nContent promoting \"extreme\" beauty standards, unhealthy dieting, or body shaming\n\nThe company says that its approach is informed by \"expert input\" as well as literature discussing child development science. (It's not clear whether how much of that input is from direct interviews and coordination with experts, and how much, if any, is from independent research.) The company also acknowledges \"known teen differences in risk perception, impulse control, peer influence, and emotional regulation\" when compared to adults.\n\nThe biggest risk with any of these age prediction models is that they'll sometimes get it wrong—hallucination is an unfortunate habit AI models all share. That goes both ways: You don't want someone too young accessing inappropriate content in ChatGPT, but you also don't want someone older than 18 getting stuck with a limited account for no reason. If you experience the latter situation, OpenAI has a solution for you: direct age verification through Persona. This is the same third-party Roblox uses for its age verification, which hasn't gone very well thus far.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily spell doom for OpenAI. Roblox tried overhauling their age verification system for a massive user base all used to a certain type of multiplayer experience, which led to users not being able to chat with other users in newly-assigned age categories, which were often incorrect. Meanwhile, ChatGPT's age prediction is only controlling the experience of one user at a time. To that end, OpenAI will let you upload a selfie as an added verification step if the prediction model alone isn't enough. Interestingly, OpenAI doesn't say anything about the option to upload an ID for verification, which other companies, like Google, have provided.\n\nI'm not necessarily a fan of age prediction models, as I think they often sacrifice user privacy in the name of creating age-appropriate experiences. But there's little doubt that OpenAI has to do something to limit the full ChatGPT experience for younger users. Many of ChatGPT's users are under 18, and much of the content they experience is wildly inappropriate, whether it be instructions on getting high, or advice on writing suicide notes. In some tragic cases, minors have taken their own lives after discussions with ChatGPT, leading to lawsuits against OpenAI.\n\nI don't have any great answers here. We'll just have to see how this new age prediction model affects the user experience for minors and adults alike, and whether it actually manages to create a safer experience for younger, more impressionable users.",

    "fullText": "World Cup 2026 ticket holders can now access priority visa appointments for travel to the United States - but doubt remains whether fans from every country to have qualified will be able to enter.\n\nThe Fifa Prioritised Appointment Scheduling System - or Fifa Pass - announced by US President Donald Trump in November, went live on Tuesday.\n\nIt was introduced in part because citizens of some countries whose teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup may not otherwise receive visa appointments in time for the tournament.\n\nBut the US State Department has stressed that a Fifa Pass appointment does not guarantee a visa will be approved, with all ticket holders having to \"undergo thorough security screening and vetting\".\n\nMost citizens of countries under the US visa waiver programme, which covers much of Europe, including the UK, along with Japan, Australia and others, can ordinarily travel visa-free for up to 90 days, so do not need to use the Fifa Pass. Travellers from those countries would need to apply instead for an Esta - an Electronic System for Travel Authorization.\n\nA senior State Department official said the new Fifa Pass system will cut wait times - with applicants in \"over 80%\" of countries now able to schedule a visa appointment in \"less that 60 days\".\n\nIt added: \"At the visa appointment, the applicant must show they qualify for the visa and plan to follow our laws and leave at the end of the tournament. America's safety and the security of our borders will always come first.\"",

    "fullText": "Arne Slot has suggested Mohamed Salah will return to the Liverpool starting line-up against Marseille in Wednesday's Champions League tie, insisting his relationship with the forward is \"as normal as it's always been\".\n\nSalah last started for Liverpool in the 4-1 home defeat by PSV Eindhoven in November, but scored four goals at the Africa Cup of Nations where his Egypt side finished fourth.\n\nThe 33-year-old gave an exposive interview shortly before departing for Afcon, in which he claimed \"someone doesn't want me in the club\" and he no longer had any relationship with Slot after being dropped.\n\nAsked if he had a chance to reflect on the situation with Salah after the events in December, Slot said: \"There's been a moment in the season where I decided not to play Mo.\n\n\"And one moment where I decided not to take him to the game [against Inter Milan]. For all the other games, he's been in the squad and he was the first substitution against Brighton so, at that moment of time, there's never been an issue for me.\n\n\"The first time he's able to be in the squad again, he is because he trained today and is in the squad for tomorrow. Let's see the line-up tomorrow if you still think there's an issue.\"\n\nSlot's side have been unbeaten during Salah's time in Morocco, but the Dutchman admitted he was \"happy\" to have Liverpool's record Champions League goalscorer available again.\n\n\"I am really happy and pleased he is back,\" added Slot. \"In his absence I think we have done quite OK in terms of hardly conceding any chances and starting to create more and more.\n\n\"If you create more and more, then it is really helpful to have Mohamed Salah. There has only been one who scored more for this club [who is alive] but I don't think I can play Ian Rush still! Then it is really helpful to have him back.\"\n\nAsked about his relationship with Salah, he said: \"It's as normal as it's always been, with one exception and that was Inter Milan.\n\n\"I spoke to him today and I'm happy to have him back because this season I've only had two wingers who've played more than 100 minutes in the Premier League and that's Mo and Cody [Gakpo].\n\n\"Jeremie Frimpong and Florian Wirtz can also play in these positions, but if I asked Florian what was his favourite position he wouldn't say left or right wing. Jeremie would be the same, but he's shown what he can do off the right side.\n\n\"I saw today that Mo has 45 goals for Liverpool in the Champions League and the next highest is Virgil van Dijk with five. So it is nice to have him back, especially if he is able to reach those levels that brought him 45 goals again.\"\n\nLiverpool have taken a 20-man squad to Marseille, with Ibrahima Konate not in the touring party due to a family matter.\n\nThe game against Robert de Zerbi's side will influence their hopes of finishing in the top eight and avoiding two extra ties in the knockout phase play-offs next month. The Reds host Qarabag in their final game in the group phase on Wednesday, 28 January.",

This is the real deal,\" Waugh told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I wouldn't be lending my name to it, or bringing my knowledge, if it wasn't. The players we've spoken to are very keen to play in this league.\"\n\nBollywood actor and film producer Abhishek Bachchan is a part-owner of the ETPL in conjunction with Rules Sport Tech, a private Indian company.\n\nBBC Sport understands the franchises were sold for £11.1m ($15m) over a 10-year period.\n\nTeams will have a total salary budget in the region of £1.1m ($1.5m) per season, with the inaugural tournament set to start on 26 August.\n\nThe league is being run in collaboration with the cricket boards of Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands.\n\nIt has been sanctioned by the International Cricket Council, who see it as a useful base for the broader development of cricket in Europe.\n\nBachchan said that, with \"the quality of players signing on,\" everything about the tournament \"will be world class\".\n\n\"We are all primed and ready to go but the true hard work starts now,\" Bachchan added.\n\n\"We are very confident of the stakeholders we have on board and expect the ETPL will establish itself in the global ecosystem of franchise tournaments.\"",

    "title": "Sandbox Your AI Dev Tools: A Practical Guide for VMs and Lima",
    "description": "AI coding assistants and other devtools can steal your credentials and data. Here's how to run them safely in isolated VMs using Lima on macOS/Linux.",
    "fullText": "AI coding assistants, npm, pip, and other development tools can run arbitrary code and scripts on your machine, potentially stealing SSH keys, API tokens, wallet keys, sensitive credentials and other private data without you noticing.\n\nThis guide shows you how to sandbox these tools in isolated VMs using Lima, so you can experiment and develop freely without putting your sensitive data at risk.\nJump straight to the guide, or read on for a bit of personal context.\n\nI’ve been having quite a bit of fun with AI assisted coding recently.\n\nI use LLMs for a wide range of things, including discussing architecture, design choices, learning about new tools and libraries I wasn’t previously aware of, to reviewing PRs and quickly cranking out dirty prototypes.\n\nEspecially for hobby projects that are not meant to ever go into production, I enjoy playing with AI tools fast and loose, producing results quickly and not getting slowed down by annoying things such as reading code before running it 🤣.\n\nAnd yeah… that’s obviously unsafe, unless it’s all contained in a sandbox!\n\nYou should never run potentially dangerous, experimental code on your main machine, since it could steal your passwords, API keys, environment variables, private keys, access to your communication tools, install services, and do all sorts of other nefarious things.\n\nNowadays I isolate all my devtools in VMs, and thought it might be useful to others if I put together a guide to shows how to do it. Well, here it is, and I hope it’ll be useful to you, too!\n\nYou’ll want to run the entire development environment, including the AI tool itself, inside a sandbox. This way it’s safe to install dependencies and to execute code, and unlocks other fun features like snapshots before running sketchy code, and reverting if something goes wrong.\n\nAnd it’s not just AI-generated code. Node.js/npm/yarn and Python/pip are particularly troublesome because they allow any package to run arbitrary scripts on your system during installation, and install tons of additional dependencies that can do the same. This attack vector is called “supply chain attack” and it happens all the time.\n\nVirtual Machines (VMs) and Containers (i.e. Docker, Podman, containerd) are the two most practical methods for isolating development tools from your host operating system. VMs provide much stronger protection and more flexibility overall, and are better suited for co-developing with AIs.\n\nContainer runtimes share the host operating system’s kernel, which means they’re fundamentally running on the same system as your main machine, just with isolated namespaces and resource limits. This creates several security concerns:\n\nIn contrast, a VM runs its own complete operating system with its own kernel. The hypervisor (like QEMU/KVM) creates a much stronger isolation boundary. Even if malicious code completely compromises the VM, it would need to exploit the hypervisor itself to reach your host, a significantly harder target.\n\nFurthermore, a VM enables better concurrency. It can run Docker containers, databases, web servers, multiple build processes, and background services all at once, and the AI tool can interact with everything naturally just like on a normal development machine.\n\nIn this guide, we use Lima VM to sandbox AI and devtools. Lima is a delightful, lightweight virtual machine manager for Linux and macOS which provides easy and quick ways to create and manage VMs.\n\nYou interact with Lima through the limactl command:\n\nVMs are based on templates, which can include (build on) other templates:\n\nThe Lima VM docs have platform-specific installation guides.\n\nHomebrew is recommended on macOS:\n\nOn Linux install the binary like this:\n\nNow ensure your Lima version is up-to-date:\n\nWe only want to share very specific host directories with the VM.\n\nLet’s create ~/VM-Shared on the host, which we later mount into the VM at ~/Shared (with write access):\n\nYou can use that directory to easily copy files between the host and the VM, and to share project directories from the host with the VM.\n\nDefaults for all VMs can be defined in ~/.lima/_config/default.yaml.\n\nLet’s create the default YAML file:\n\nLima conveniently creates default SSH configuration files for all VM instances, which makes it easy to log in with SSH (including using VS Code for a Remote-SSH session).\n\nI recommend using a ~/.ssh/config.d/ directory on the host and have SSH include all configs there by default. That allows us to simply link the Lima-created config files there to use them.\n\nAdd this as first line in your ~/.ssh/config file, to make SSH include all configs from there:\n\nGreat! After creating a new VM, we can now simply create a symlink to the Lima-generated SSH configs and use it to SSH into the instance.\n\nLet’s start an Ubuntu 25.10 VM instance, named dev.\nWe use the internal _images/ubuntu-25.10.yaml template because it doesn’t include the automatic home directory sharing:\n\nYou can share additional project-specific directories between host and VM in several ways:\n\nCreate a symlink for the SSH config file and SSH into the VM:\n\nLet’s update the services on the instance, and configure git:\n\nLet’s confirm that port forwarding works. We do this using a one-liner Python HTTP server (on port 7777) inside the VM, and accessing it from the host:\n\nThis section guides you through installing several other languages and development tools, including Golang, Node.js, Python, Rust, Docker.\n\nWe can accomplish that either by installing each tool according to it’s documentation, or by using a version manager such as mise (“mise-en-place”, 22k stars on Github) which can install hundreds of tools via a simple command-line interface.\n\nFirst, we install mise (“mise-en-place”, 22k stars on Github) and make bash support it:\n\nYou use mise latest <tool> to see the latest versions it knows about:\n\nNow you can install all the tools you want in a single command:\n\nTo manually install (or update) Golang in the VM, download the latest release and extract into /usr/local/go:\n\nThe Golang path needs to be in the PATH environment variable, which we have already added before.\n\nA good way to install a current version of Node.js in Ubuntu is by using nvm, a modern node version manager (90k stars on GitHub):\n\nNow it’s all installed and ready to use! Check the versions like this:\n\nPerhaps you don’t even need Docker, since Lima includes containerd and nerdctl by default. This is a Docker-compatible runtime and command-line interface that can also run images from Docker Hub:\n\nIf you do want to install Docker, the quickest way to install it by using their official get-docker.sh script:\n\nFor the group changes to take effect, exit the shell and re-login (may need a VM restart).\n\nVerify that user is in the ‘docker’ group:\n\nGitHub CLI provides a useful gh cli command that let’s you easily interact with GitHub and private repositories.\n\nYou can install it in the VM following the Linux installation instructions:\n\nWarning: Authorizing GitHub CLI to access private repositories will leave an API key in the VM which could potentially be stolen by unauthorized scripts (which is what we wanted to avoid in first place by running everything in a VM).\n\nOnly authorize it with gh auth login for private repo access if you accept the risks! I personally avoid having any sensitive credentials in the VM, in particular those that allow access to private GitHub repositories.\n\nIf you prefer an IDE like VS Code, you can use Remote-SSH to start a session inside the instance.\n\nPlease note that this is potentially unsafe, as explained in the Remote-SSH README:\n\nSecurity Note\nUsing Remote-SSH opens a connection between your local machine and the remote. Only use Remote-SSH to connect to secure remote machines that you trust and that are owned by a party whom you trust. A compromised remote could use the VS Code Remote connection to execute code on your local machine.\n\nSee also this discussion on GitHub for more context and information.\n\nNow a new VS Code window opens, and sets up VS Code Server:\n\nThen you can click “Open” and choose a folder, like Shared:\n\nBefore setting up the tools, let’s create a “Hello World” directory in the Shared folder as our playground:\n\nLet’s start with installing Claude Code in the VM, following the instructions in the documentation:\n\nOn first start, Claude asks you to authorize it.\n\nThe docs mention support for an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable (i.e. set in .bashrc), but that did not work when I tried it; claude CLI didn’t let me skip the login process. Only after the login was done it notified me about the existing environment variable, and whether I’d prefer to use that one.\n\nAfter the login, Claude Code CLI is ready to be ued in the VM! 🎉\n\nSince Claude is running in a VM, it might be permissible to run it in “dangerously skip permissions mode”, which makes it bypass all permission checks:\n\nYou could also create an alias for it and add it to your .bashrc:\n\nAnthropic provides documentation for using Claude in VS Code, and also offer a VS Code Claude extension.\n\nYou can install the Claude extension in the VM through the Remote-SSH session window:\n\nIn contrast to the CLI tool, the authentication flow did not work through the user interface, and I had to set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable:\n\nReload the VS Code window (open command palette with Shift + CMD + P and choose “Developer: Reload Window”):\n\nNow the VS Code Claude extension should work:\n\nIf you want to enable “dangerously skip permissions mode” in the VS Code extension, you can enable it via your user settings. Open the settings (CMD + ,), search for “claude” and enable “Claude Code: Allow Dangerously Skip Permissions”:\n\nLet’s install Gemini CLI from Google next.\n\nThe documentation recommends installing it with npm, the Node.js package manager. You’ll need to install Node and npm first, see also the Node.js setup instructions.\n\nIt will ask you to authenticate:\n\nI chose “Login with Google”. Note that the authentication flow may require a retry if the first attempt times fails.\n\nAfter authorization is done, Gemini CLI works!\n\nYou can run Gemini in YOLO mode:\n\nAutomatically accept all actions (aka YOLO mode, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0 \n\nThe alias you could define in .bashrc:\n\nCodex CLI is the AI dev tool from OpenAI/ChatGPT.\n\nIt will ask you to sign in, either via ChatGPT or by providing an API key:\n\nAfter that is done, Codex CLI is ready to work for you!\n\nYou can also run Codex in dangerous mode:\n\nSkip all confirmation prompts and execute commands without sandboxing. EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Intended solely for running in environments that are externally sandboxed\n\nThere are several other great tools worth a mention:\n\nDrop your favorite tools in the comments below!\n\nVM clones and snapshots allow you even more flexibility and isolation. You can use them to quickly and cheaply run new VMs for experiments and specific projects based on already provisioned instances. Use them frequently!\n\nLima offers several ways to take VM snapshots and/or clone VMs.\n\nYou can make a copy of an existing VM instance with limactl clone. The existing instance needs to be stopped first.\n\nAfter all the initial VM setup is done, clone it and use it both as backup as well as a base for future instances:\n\nRemember that after starting a new instance, you probably want to symlink the VM SSH configuration to your ~/.ssh/config.d/ directory, so ssh knows about it (See also “SSH into the VM”):\n\nFor maximum security and flexibility, consider using multiple VMs for different purposes and trust levels. This approach provides better isolation and lets you tailor each environment to specific needs.\n\nHere are some suggested VM configurations:\n\nYou can quickly clone your base VM setup to create new instances for different projects using limactl clone, as described in the VM cloning section above.\n\nFor sensitive or production projects, consider dedicating a separate VM to each project. This prevents potential cross-contamination between projects and allows you to mount only the specific project directories you need.\n\nWhen creating project-specific VMs, you can customize the mounted directories by editing the instance configuration. Either adjust the mounts section before starting the VM (by not using the -y flag), or edit ~/.lima/<vm_name>/lima.yaml after creation and restart the instance.\n\nThis approach also makes it easier to share VM configurations with team members. Instead of sharing entire disk images, you can distribute just the Lima template YAML file, which team members can use to spin up identical environments on their machines.\n\nFor automated setup, Lima supports provisioning scripts that run during VM creation. For more complex setups, consider using idempotent provisioning tools like Ansible to ensure consistent environments across your team.\n\nIf you find yourself repeatedly creating VMs with similar configurations, consider creating custom Lima templates. Templates are YAML files that define VM settings, and they can include other templates.\n\nCustom templates are useful for:\n\nYou can create a custom template by copying and modifying an existing one from Lima’s template directory. Save your custom templates in ~/.lima/_templates/ and reference them when creating new VMs:\n\nSee the Lima templates documentation \n\nHere are some important security best practices to follow when using VMs for development:\n\nRemember: The whole point of using VMs is isolation. When in doubt, create a new VM for risky experiments and delete it afterwards.\n\nI hope this guide helps you get started quickly and right-footed!\nAs always, please leave feedback, questions and ideas in the comments below.\n\nSpecial thanks to Ilya Lukyanov and Overflo for reviewing drafts of this post and making great suggestions. 🙏",

    "fullText": "I’m an old Mac-head at heart, and I’ve been using Macs since the mid 1990s (the first Mac I used was an LC II with System 7.1 installed on it). I don’t tend to genuinely think that the computing experience was better in the olden days — sure, there’s a thing to be said about the simplicity of older software, but most of my fondness for those days is nostalgia.\n\nFor example, I have wonderful memories of finally getting a copy of ClarisWorks and being able to do pixel-based image editing, which sparked a wonderful childhood “career” of tinkering with icons and various other bits and bobs with that and ResEdit. The things you could do before code signing!\n\nHowever, I’m not going to sit here and say with a straight face that ClarisWorks on System 7 in the 1990s was better than using the myriad of tools we have available to us today. It’s nostalgia for a simpler time — both in computing, and in my life.\n\nAn exception to that, however, is Apple’s Aperture. I’m still grumpy that Apple discontinued it back in 2015, and I’m not alone. Start spending time in the online photography sphere and you’ll start to notice a small but undeniable undercurrent of lament of its loss to this day. Find an article about Adobe hiking their subscription prices because they added AI for some reason, and amongst the complaining in the comments you’ll invariably find it: “I miss Aperture.”\n\nA couple of things have happened recently that spurred me to actually write all of this down rather than grumble occasionally on social media:\n\nApple released macOS Tahoe, which has been pretty constantly raked over the coals for poor design and broken interactions from the day it was released (and even before, if we’re honest).\n\nApple very recently announced their Creator Studio subscription service, and I saw this post on Mastodon by @BasicAppleGuy:\n\nWhen I took this screenshot, the first reply to the post was “I miss Aperture. <long digital sigh>”.\n\nSo, I dug out the ‘ol Trashcan Mac Pro I lovingly reviewed here on this very blog over eleven years ago and fired up Aperture to document — at least partially — just why it was so special.\n\nThe Mac Studio is a perfectly cromulent computer, but it just doesn’t have the verve of the classics, you know?\n\nIf you’re not familiar with Aperture, it’s an app for organising, managing, editing, and exporting images. If you’re familiar with Apple’s Photos app, it’s that. But for professionals! Aperture is a complex app — its PDF user manual is over 900 pages long — so to keep this manageable I’ll focus on one particular aspect of it via two short excerpts from said manual.\n\nTwo excerpts that hide an astonishing amount of engineering effort.\n\nLet’s look at our first excerpt:\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nThis little sentence extremely succinctly describes how Aperture is different to most other software of its nature — it comes to you. Most software has you go to it.\n\nTo understand what I mean, let’s look at the Photos app. My brain works pretty spatially — I remember where I took a photo more than when. So, I pan around the map in Photos to find the cool photo of my car in the Alps that I want to edit and send to my friend. Here it is:\n\nI click the picture, and the map is gone, replaced with a list of the images at the location I clicked.\n\nI double-click the photo to bring it up bigger.\n\nI click “Edit” in the top right of the window to switch into Photos’ editing mode (as a shortcut, I could’ve pressed the Return key in the image list to open it straight in the editing mode).\n\nI perform my edits, then click “Done” to get back to the fullscreen viewer. Then I click “Back” to get back to the list of images. Then “Back” again, and I’m finally back at my map. Hooray! Oh wait, I forgot to export it…\n\nThis sort of design is common in apps like Photos, and especially in “shoebox” apps1. Every feature is in its own place, and if you want to use that feature you need to pick up your thing (in this case, a photo) and take it over to where the feature is. In this example, the journey from the map to the editor is through a separate list of images, the fullscreen viewer, then finally to the editor.\n\nIn contrast, Aperture comes to you. As a reminder:\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nWhen Aperture says this, it really means it. If you can select an image, you can edit it right where you are with that HUD.\n\nAperture’s map (which by some miracle still works eleven years after it was discontinued) doesn’t show the images on the map, but rather underneath it. It’s less pretty, but combines the first two steps of the journey in the Photos example — the map on top, and the images in the visible map area underneath. Clicking a pin refines the selection of images.\n\nAlight, let’s find another photo of my car in the Alps:\n\nA Volvo stuck in the snow is less awesome than the previous photo, but oh well. I need to edit it, so I press H on my keyboard to bring up the adjustments HUD. I’m still exactly where I was, but now I have editing controls. There’s no step three!\n\nThat was incredibly easy, and I didn’t even leave the map! I need to export it now… and, of course, I can do that from right here on the map too.\n\nI’m still exactly where I was, and I can carry on with the next task.\n\n“But Daniel,” I hear you cry, “Who edits photos on a map?”\n\nFine, it’s a contrived example, but one I was able to directly make between Photos and Aperture. Let’s look at something more real-world: Aperture’s book editor. I love making photo books as the years go by, but putting them together can be a long and tedious process.\n\nLet’s imagine it’s 2005, and I have a page in my book full of pictures of my new car for this year’s book. Unfortunately, auto white balance and changing lighting conditions means the car is a different shade of grey in every photo! Disaster!\n\nIt’d be nice to have them consistent with each other on the page, but matching them all together when they might be from all over the photo library is a big pain. Can you imagine doing that in Photos? Click, click, click, click, into the editor. Tweak white balance. Click, click, click, click, back to the book. Nope, still not right. Click, click, click, click…\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nOh, right! H, drag slider, done. Right on the book page.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate quite how revolutionary and smooth this flow is until you had it for multiple years before having it taken away. Nothing on the market — even over a decade later — is this good at meeting you where you are and not interrupting your flow.\n\nEspecially that book example. My Lord. When Aperture was discontinued (well, when it stopped working properly after an OS update or two) I moved over to Adobe Lightroom (now Lightroom Classic) which had separate modules for file management, editing, and books — switching modules was such a slow and clunky processes, I swear nearly threw my computer out the window trying to colour match photos on a book page.\n\nIt’s OK, Daniel, you got rid of Lightroom years ago. It can’t hurt you any more!\n\nTechnically speaking, the edit-anywhere model is an incredibly impressive feature. Managing a lot of images is already difficult2 (especially on the hardware of the time), and for a map, or a book editor… of course you’d have an optimised set of static thumbnails.\n\nOr, y’know, a full RAW image editing context ready-to-go for anything you might want to click on.\n\nAperture has a tool called the “loupe”. In real life, a loupe is a little cup with a magnifying glass on the top. It’s what’s on the Preview app’s icon, and you use it to zoom in to physical things on a physical surface (I know, how quaint).\n\nIf you want to quickly check specific compositional details of an image, you can use the Loupe. Aperture provides a software Loupe that lets you magnify portions of an image. The Loupe is particularly useful when you are quickly navigating through images in the Browser and you need to verify that the image is in focus or other details without having to switch to the Viewer or Full Screen view.\n\nIn Aperture, the loupe is a little round zoomy thing you can either drag around to view a zoomed-in portion of the image it’s on top of, or attach to the mouse so you can just point at stuff to zoom in.\n\nNote: I’ve dimmed the main Aperture window slightly in the following screenshots to make the loupe clearer.\n\nFun fact: Even when attached to the mouse, the loupe is a separate window just like the other HUDs — which means you can take a screenshot of it independently. Neat!\n\nIt’d be easy to think this is just a screen zoom, or at least a window into a big thumbnail that’s being downsampled a bit for the main viewer. But, since the loupe is attached to the mouse, we can just start pointing at stuff to see what happens.\n\nThere’s no way you’d keep a full-resolution image in memory for every thumbnail on screen, so this is another extremely impressive technical feat. Remember, this is over a decade ago, and Aperture’s system requirements were a Mac with 2GB of RAM. Keeping a whole 20 megapixel image in memory will consume somewhere in the region of 90-120MB3 once you’re starting to display it.\n\nHmm… now that I think about it, the manual doesn’t say where the loupe works and doesn’t, and since we’re not limited to selecting images like with the other HUD…\n\nOnce again, it’s hard to overstate how bonkers this is on a technical level. That’s a list of thumbnails of book pages, there so you can identify which page you want to edit. That thumbnail-within-a-thumbanail — on a Retina display! — is 68x47 pixels. 0.003 megapixels.\n\nFrom a software development perspective, it would be insane to have those pages be anything but static thumbnail images. But hey, would you want to be the person that made the manual say that the loupe works everywhere except in the book editor’s page list?\n\nThese days, technological marvels in computing — if you’ll forgive a gross generalisation — tend to be very flashy. Liquid Glass is a great example of that — it’s very impressive what can be done with the engineering talent and computing power we have available to us today, and the effect is cool. However, my browser’s UI refracting the webpage I’m reading as it scrolls by doesn’t really do anything except look cool… when it isn’t making things less readable.\n\nNotice how the Liquid Glass refraction effect makes it look — at first glance, at least — like we’ll be making a sharp right after we turn left? Thanks, Liquid Glass!\n\nGenerative AI is another technology that falls into this “flashy” camp, but kinda at the other end of the scale. BEHOLD THE AI, FOR IT IS PRODUCING CONTENT. Very useful, very impressive, and is transforming a lot of industries. Just… ignore the wider societal and environmental concerns AS THE AI IS PRODUCING A FUNNY POEM.\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss criticisms of these kinds of technologies as the ramblings of an old man, since on average — as I mentioned at the top of this post — the computing experience is orders of magnitude better than it was back then.\n\nHowever, when it gets to the point where we as humans need to use our computers as tools to get stuff done, I think we have stagnated over the past few years. When preparing for this post I was excited to fire up Aperture and experience it again, but after less than ten minutes of using it I was getting grumpy — here I am, sitting at a thirteen-year old computer, and I’m flying through my photos faster than I ever do on modern machines. Why is this not possible now?\n\nAperture’s technical brilliance is remarkable in how quiet it is. There’s no BEHOLD RAINBOW SPARKLE ANIMATIONS WHILE THE AI MAKES AUNT JANICE LOOK LIKE AN ANTHROPOMORPHISED CARROT, just an understated dedication to making the tool you’re using work for you in exactly the way you want to work.\n\nIt’s the kind of monumental engineering effort that the user is unlikely to ever notice, simply because of how obvious it is to use — if I want to zoom in to this photo, I point at it with the zoom thing. Duh. Sure, it’s a tiny thumbnail inside a small thumbnail of a page in a book… but how else would it work?\n\nAnd that is why Aperture was so special. It was powered by some of the most impressive technology around at the time, but you’d never even know it because you were too busy getting shit done.\n\nAnd then, it was taken away — with a final, cruel twist of the knife from Apple: “You can use the Photos app as a replacement!” — and everyone was grumpy forever.\n\nAperture’s discontinuation happened at the tail end of my time working at Spotify here in Sweden. As with any corporate job, it had good days and bad days… and after the particularly bad days, I’d rage-fill part of a job application elsewhere. I’d always loved Aperture — as a Mac developer, it was the pinnacle of what was possible on the Mac, and in a field I was passionate about — so this particular application was to work on Aperture at Apple.\n\nI ended up having a couple of interviews with the Aperture team, but as I remember (this was well over a decade ago) the process just… kinda petered out.\n\nA few months later, the official discontinuation announcement happened. I have no idea if I was just not up to the task or if something happened internally during my interview process, but it’s an interesting “What if…” to think about.\n\nAperture: Senior QA (2004-2005) by Chris Hynes \n\nWhile the result was amazing, the development process was… perhaps less so. This is an interesting read about Aperture’s development.\n\nIt’s hard to justify Tahoe icons by Nikita Prokopov \n\nA great look on why (amongst many other reasons) macOS Tahoe is being raked through the coals at the moment.\n\n“Shoebox” apps are apps that contain the content you use with them, as opposed to document-based apps which work with content you manage as a user.

    "fullText": "A series of graphics reveals how the Trump administration has sought historic cuts to science and the research workforce.\n\nGrant termination data analysis and visualization by Kim Albrecht\n\nMMore than 7,800 research grants terminated or frozen. Some 25,000 scientists and personnel gone from agencies that oversee research. Proposed budget cuts of 35% — amounting to US$32 billion.\n\nThese are just a few of the ways in which Donald Trump has downsized and disrupted US science since returning to the White House last January. As his administration seeks to reshape US research and development, it has substantially scaled back and restricted what science the country pursues and the workforce that runs the federal scientific enterprise.\n\nA year into Trump’s second presidential term, Nature presents a series of graphics that reveal the impact of his administration on science.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, officials began terminating already-funded grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in February, and later at the National Science Foundation (NSF), two of the largest public supporters of scientific research in the United States. A total of 5,844 NIH grants and 1,996 NSF grants were cancelled or suspended.\n\nThe Trump administration disproportionally cancelled or froze projects on topics it disfavours, such as misinformation, vaccine hesitancy, infectious diseases and research on people from under-represented ethnic and gender groups, which it has called discriminatory and unscientific.\n\nOver the course of 2025, more than 7,800 grants were cancelled or suspended. In this tree map, each block represents one grant or grant supplement, and the size of the block corresponds to the total budget of the original grant.\n\nThe inclusion of supplements means that some grants — less than 0.5% of the total — appear two or three times.\n\nThe blocks are grouped by state. New York (orange) had the most cancelled or frozen grants, totalling nearly 1,500. The majority were at Columbia University.\n\nSome of the largest grants (orange) are for clinical trials, cancer centres and infrastructure, and they can run over many years.\n\nThe NIH terminated or froze 5,843 research grants (yellow). The total for the NSF was 1,996 (blue).\n\nOf the grants that were terminated or frozen, more than 800 were related to infectious diseases (orange).\n\nCourts have ordered that thousands of grants be reinstated, and some universities have settled with the government to unfreeze funding (both reinstated and unfrozen grants are shown in blue). But it is unclear how many scientists have received those funds.\n\nRoughly 2,600 grants have not been reinstated or unfrozen (black), amounting to $1.4 billion of unspent funding.\n\nThe Trump administration has substantially reduced the number of new grants issued by the NSF and the NIH, which means that fewer researchers are getting support.\n\nIn 2025, the total number of new grants funded by the NSF dropped by 25% relative to the average of the previous ten years. In part, this resulted from uncertainty about future funding, and the agency’s decision to provide multi-year funding — in which a project’s budget is awarded all at once, rather than year by year.\n\nA similar story played out at the NIH, which issued 24% fewer grants in 2025, compared with the average of the previous ten years. After delays early in the year and with reduced staff levels, the agency raced to award grants by the end of the fiscal year. It achieved this in part by providing multi-year funding to a smaller number of new grant applications than usual — sharply reducing the number of scientists that received support.\n\nDuring the 2025–26 academic year, new international-student enrolment at US universities fell markedly. The Institute of International Education (IIE), a non-profit organization in New York City, released preliminary data, based on a subset of universities, showing a 17% decline from 2024 to 2025. This would result in the smallest number of new international enrolments in a decade, except for in 2020–21, during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThese trends are not uniform. An IIE survey found that about 60% of colleges and universities saw decreases, whereas 40% reported stable or increasing numbers. Of those experiencing declines, 96% cited visa-application concerns as a contributing factor. These concerns have intensified under the second Trump administration.\n\nIn total, federal science agencies lost about 20% of their staff in 2025 relative to the previous year, after modest increases over the past few years.\n\nAmong the hardest hit are the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA, both of which have been targets of the Trump administration’s attacks on climate science. The Food and Drug Administration also lost more than 20% of its staff.\n\nSome employees were fired during mass layoffs in early 2025, but most left voluntarily through a programme that offered incentives for federal workers to resign. Across the science agencies, there was an exodus of more than 25,000 people, many of whom were at early career stages.\n\nRemaining staff members at agencies such as the NIH and the NSF say they struggle to keep up with the workload, which includes approving research grants.\n\nIn its proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year, the Trump administration requested historic cuts of 35% to the budget for research and development not related to defence. The final funding levels will be determined through spending bills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate in an ongoing process.\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation, the president’s proposed decrease in funding for non-defence research would be unprecedented over the past half century and would reduce spending to 1991 levels.\n\nBut in enacted spending bills, lawmakers in both the Senate and the House of Representatives have so far rejected the most drastic budget cuts for many of the core science agencies. Policy experts hope that Congress will continue its long-standing support for science agencies when it finalizes the 2026 budget in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Trump administration shocked the science community when it proposed slashing more than $18 billion, or around 40% of the total, from the budget of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is the largest funder of biomedical research in the world.\n\nThe Trump administration also sought steep cuts at the National Science Foundation (57%) and NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (47%). In final budget agreements that are likely to be adopted by the House and the Senate, lawmakers agreed on much smaller cuts of 3.4% for the NSF and 1.1% for NASA’s science directorate.\n\nThe House and the Senate must finish negotiating final budgets for the remaining agencies, such as the NIH, and the actual funding levels will probably be somewhere in the middle. That would mostly protect the country’s total budget for research and development from the Trump administration’s drastic cuts for the current fiscal year.\n\nThis article is also available as a pdf version.",

    "fullText": "Mourning for Renee Nicole Good, the singer decried the Trump administration and the threat to freedom posed by “heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city.”\n\nBruce Springsteen took a side against the Trump administration’s authoritarian abuses last May, when he launched his European tour with an impassioned denunciation of the president’s assault on basic civil liberties, and decried an ugly moment in which the United States “is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration.” Now Springsteen has brought the complaint home, with a clarity that is all the more immediate and necessary.\n\nBefore launching into a fiery rendition of his 1978 classic “The Promised Land” during a Saturday night show in his home state of New Jersey, Springsteen turned the crowd’s attention to Minnesota, where, on January 7, an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a mother of three who loved to sing, wrote poetry, and evidenced a concern for her neighbors that embodied the spirit of Springsteen’s epic paean to community and solidarity, “We Take Care of Our Own.”\n\n“I wrote [‘The Promised Land’] as an ode to American possibility—both to the beautiful but flawed country that we are, and to the country that we could be,” Springsteen told the crowd. “Right now, we are living through incredibly critical times. The United States, the ideals and the values for which it stood for the past 250 years, is being tested as it has never been in modern times. Those values and those ideals have never been as endangered as they are right now.”\n\nThe crowd roared with approval as Springsteen continued:\n\n“So, as we gather tonight in this beautiful display of love and care and thoughtfulness and community, if you believe in democracy and liberty, if you believe that truth still matters, it is worth speaking out. It is worth fighting for. If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president—as the mayor of that city has said—ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”\n\nAbove what had become thunderous applause, Springsteen announced, “This song is for you and the memory of a mother of three and American citizen, Renee Good.”\n\nWith that, Springsteen and his band broke into “The Promised Land,” a song that speaks of a storm that will “blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted” and “blow everything down that ain’t got the faith to stand its ground”—and about how, against the tempest and through it all, “I believe in a promised land.”\n\nYears ago, Springsteen summed up his mission as an artist when he said, “I have spent my life judging the distance between American reality and the American dream.” The honesty with which Springsteen has conducted this decades-long examination has earned the songwriter the greatest honors the entertainment industry and the nation can grant. In addition to 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, and a Special Tony Award for his critically acclaimed Springsteen on Broadway shows, he is an inducted member of both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He has also been given the Kennedy Center Honor and, in 2016, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama, who hailed him for “carrying the rest of us on his journey: asking us all what is the work for us to do in our short time here.”\n\nIt was an appropriate honor for a singer who, like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger before him, refused to surrender the dream of a promised land to the crude machinations of billionaire investors and the crooked politicians who serve them. “There is a real patriotism underneath the best of my music,” Springsteen once said, “but it is a critical, questioning and often angry patriotism.”\n\nThere are plenty of artists who soften as they age.\n\nWith his denunciation of ICE violence in Minneapolis, he has once again proven himself to be as critical, questioning, angry, and, yes, patriotic as the times require.",
