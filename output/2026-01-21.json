    "description": "New Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Andruw Jones was one of the few to solve Ben Sheets when the Brewers hurler struck out 18 batters in a 2004 game.",
    "fullText": "“It’s funny,” former Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Ben Sheets said in 2024. “When they hit it like that, nobody says nothing about them shadows.”\n\nSheets, speaking to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Curt Hogg, was referring to the infamous stadium shadows that often make day games a challenge for hitters at American Family Field, and potentially something that contributed to Sheets' dominance on May 16, 2004. He was also talking about a pitch that new Baseball Hall of Famer Andruw Jones hit out of the park.\n\nThe Braves slugger was in the prime of his career in 2004, though it would be the only year in a run of five when he wasn't named to the All-Star Game and finished with fewer than 30 home runs. Still, one of his 29 homers that year threw a small wrench into one of the greatest pitching performances in Brewers history, when Sheets struck out 18 batters in a game.\n\nJones, one of two players inducted for the Class of 2026 by the Baseball Writers Association of America, belted a home run against Sheets in the seventh inning that afternoon, accounting for the only Atlanta run in a 4-1 Brewers win. Sheets induced a Mark DeRosa lineout to end the inning, then recorded his final six outs via strikeout.\n\nWhen Jones stepped to the plate with two outs that inning, Sheets had retired 20 of the last 21. Sheets himself said that it was a good pitch.\n\nThe homer spoiled the shutout and perhaps served as a small karmic kickback after Jones had swung through a curveball in the fifth for strikeout No. 8. \"A really good hitter swung through a really crappy hanging breaking ball,\" Sheets recalled.\n\n\"Dang. That was such a bad pitch. But sometimes pitches are so bad, they’re good. That’s what the fastball could do. He was probably just off time. I mean, hitting’s hard. Usually he rips that 450 feet.”\n\nJones hit 434 career home runs, including 51 the following season, though he was on the hook for two of Sheets' franchise record-setting 18 strikeouts that day. Only two pitchers have reached that single-game strikeout mark in the years since: Corey Kluber for Cleveland in 2015 and Max Scherzer for Washington in 2016. Scherzer recorded 20 strikeouts in his game.\n\nSheets gave up a leadoff double to Dewayne Wise starting the game, so he wasn't flirting with a no-hitter at any point. The Brewers scored three times in the bottom of the first to grab an early lead, and Bill Hall's RBI groundout in the bottom of the seventh answered Jones' solo home run.\n\nSheets was added to the Brewers Walk of Fame in 2024. No Brewers pitcher has truly threatened Sheets' strikeout tally; Corbin Burnes got as close as 15 in a 2021 game.\n\nJones received 78.4% of the Hall of Fame vote, ahead of the 75% necessary for induction. The five-time All-Star and 10-time Gold Glove winner joined Carlos Beltrán in the modern-ballot Class of 2026.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Andruw Jones kept Ben Sheets' epic 2004 game from being even better",

    "fullText": "For weeks, WWE fans have questioned the whereabouts of former United States Champions Rusev. In the case of former WWE Tag Team Champions Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins, that same uncertainty has lingered for months. Thanks to a new report, though, it can finally be put to rest.\n\nAccording to PWI Elite, the absence of Rusev and The Street Profits (Ford and Dawkins) on WWE television is the result of an internal decision to not waste them from a creative standpoint. As such, Rusev and The Street Profits are not currently involved in any storylines, reportedly as an effort to keep them \"fresh\" for when WWE officials approach them with new TV programs.\n\nRusev's last television match came on the December 6 edition of \"WWE Main Event,\" in which he defeated Alpha Academy's Otis. Prior to that, \"The Bulgarian Brute\" took on Jey Uso in the quarter finals of \"The Last Time Is Now\" tournament, but lost.\n\nThe WWE Universe last saw The Street Profits in the ring on the November 1 episode of \"Main Event,\" with the pair defeating Los Garza's Angel and Berto in tag team competition. Throughout 2025, Ford and Dawkins were a regular fixture in the \"WWE SmackDown\" tag team division, even holding the WWE Tag Team Championships from March until July.\n\nIn recent weeks, Rusev, Ford, and Dawkins have all appeared on promotional materials for the 2026 WWE Royal Rumble, which will emanate from Saudi Arabia on January 31. As of this writing, it is unknown if it will also bring about their on-screen returns.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "The arrival of Robert Saleh in Tennessee makes the AFC South spicier, thanks to the presence of Saleh's nemesis, Jaguars coach Liam Coen. The arrival of Kevin Stefanski in Atlanta makes the NFC South spicier, too.\n\nIt started when D. Orlando Ledbetter of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution posted a surprisingly aggressive tweet: \"Falcons’ [coach] Kevin Stefanski had a dumpster fire at quarterback in Cleveland — Baker Mayfield and Deshaun Watson failed, which started a chain reaction to 11 other starters. QB Shedeur Sanders closed out last season with seven starts.\"\n\nMayfield saw it, and responded.\n\n\"Failed is quite the reach pal,\" Mayfield said. \"Still waiting on a text/call from [Stefanski] after I got shipped off like a piece of garbage. Can’t wait to see you twice a year, Coach.\"\n\nMayfield is right; it was and is a reach. Mayfield took the Browns to the postseason in 2020, leading them to the divisional round against the Chiefs. Kansas City narrowly escaped, 22-17.\n\nIn 2021, Mayfield played through injuries, and the Browns missed the playoffs. In early 2022, someone in Cleveland got the bright idea to mortgage the future for (and pay a king's ransom to) Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson. The Browns traded Mayfield to the Panthers, who at the time were nearly as dysfunctional as the Browns have been for more than a decade.\n\nMayfield's three years with the Buccaneers have proven that he's not a \"dumpster fire\" quarterback. The Browns were the dumpster fire.\n\nNow, the smoke has spread to Atlanta and Tampa Bay, where the perpetual chip on Mayfield's shoulder has gotten a little bigger. And it's awesome.",

    "description": "A pair of former Yankees outfielders are heading to Cooperstown.",
    "fullText": "There are two new members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and both of them are ex-Yankees. On Tuesday night, the BBWAA released the results of this year’s Hall of Fame ballot: Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones have been elected as part of the class of 2026. The pair will be enshrined in Cooperstown alongside Eras Committee pick Jeff Kent on July 26th.\n\nThe pair were born just one day apart in April of 1977 and have now been elected to the Hall of Fame on the same day. Only two center fielders had been elected to Cooperstown in the last 45 years, so to induct a pair in on the same day is a relative bonanza.\n\nBeltrán topped balloting in this cycle, receiving 84.2 percent of the vote in his fourth year on the ballot. It’s a jump of almost 13 percentage points from last year, when Beltrán narrowly missed out on election.\n\nBeltrán played 20 seasons in the big leagues with the Royals, Astros, Mets, Giants, Cardinals, Yankees, and Rangers, slashing .279/.350/.486 with 435 home runs, 1,587 RBIs, 312 stolen bases, a 118 wRC+, and 67.4 fWAR. He was a nine-time All-Star, three-time Gold Glover, two-time Silver Slugger, the 1999 AL Rookie of the Year, and the 2013 Roberto Clemente Award winner. He hit the fourth-most home runs of any switch-hitter in league history behind only Mickey Mantle, Eddie Murray, and Chipper Jones, and is one of only eight players in MLB history with at least 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases alongside Willie Mays, Bobby Bonds, Andre Dawson, Barry Bonds, Steve Finley, Reggie Sanders, and Alex Rodriguez.\n\nBeltrán played two-and-a-half seasons for the Yankees in his late-thirties and was one of their more productive hitters upon signing with them in the mid-2010s before being traded to the Rangers for a trio of prospects at the 2016 Trade Deadline. He would go on to win his lone World Series ring a year later with the Astros (dispatching his old teammates in a seven-game ALCS), but was named as one of the architects of their 2017 sign-stealing scandal, which was one of the principal factors in not being elected to the Hall in his first three years of eligibility. Nonetheless, Beltrán becomes the sixth player from Puerto Rico to be elected to Cooperstown.\n\nJones sneaks in with 78.4 percent of the vote, representing just over a 12 percentage point increase from his vote share last year. It was Jones’ ninth year on the ballot, his penultimate year of eligibility.\n\nJones becomes the first player born in Curaçao to be elected to the Hall of Fame. He was considered one of the all-time great defensive center fielders in MLB history, his 126.4 UZR ranking him second all-time behind Ichiro Suzuki and his 150 total zone runs ranking him fifth all-time behind Clemente, Mays, Barry Bonds, and Jesse Barfield. He blended that defense with prodigious power — he is one of only four players in history with at least 10 Gold Gloves and 400 home runs, joining Mays, Ken Griffey Jr., and Mike Schmidt.\n\nIn his 17 big league seasons, Jones played for the Braves, Dodgers, Rangers, White Sox, and Yankees, making five All-Star appearances. He slashed .254/.337/.486 with 434 home runs, 1,289 RBIs, 152 stolen bases, a 111 wRC+ and 67 fWAR. His career is bookended by encounters with the Yankees. As a rookie in 1996, he became the youngest player in MLB history to homer in the World Series at just 19 years old, breaking the record set by Mickey Mantle when he hit home runs in his first two at-bats of Game 1 of the 1996 World Series. He played the final two seasons of his big league career with the Yankees in 2011 and 2012 before a two-season swan song in Japan with the NPB’s Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, where he was teammates with future Yankees ace Masahiro Tanaka.\n\nAndy Pettitte experienced one of the biggest jumps in vote share, going from 27.9-percent of the vote last year to 48.5-percent of the vote in this cycle. It’s an encouraging sign for Pettitte in his eighth year on the ballot — if he can experience similar jumps in his final two years of eligibility there is a real chance he could be elected. There will always be questions of the effect his admission to using HGH will have on future voting, but the all-time postseason wins leader is certainly trending in the right direction.\n\nAs for other former Yankees on the ballot, Alex Rodriguez remained relatively stagnant, going from 37.1-percent of the vote last year to 40-percent in this, his fifth year of eligibility. Bobby Abreu experienced a nice jump from 19.5-percent last year to 30.8-percent this year, but with only three more years on the ballot, he will need to be handed even bigger boosts in future voting cycles to have a shot. Edwin Encarnación received just six votes (1.4-percent) in his first year on the ballot and will therefore fall off the ballot as he comes up short of the five-percent threshold needed to maintain eligibility.\n\nCongratulations again to Beltrán and Jones on this fantastic achievement. The full voting can be found below.",

Done.\n\nMore:Bucs' Baker Mayfield offers explosive 'garbage' quote to Kevin Stefanski\n\nDespite the Browns going 11-5 and making the playoffs in 2020, Baker and Stefanski's first year together, the franchise followed it up with an 8-9 record.\n\nSo, things weren't all bad, but it was clear Mayfield had run his race in Cleveland after four years.\n\nBut Baker is clearly ticked off with how he was treated by Stefanski during his time with the Browns, and now that Kevin is with the Falcons, he gets a shot at retribution.\n\nHaving been nothing short of a revelation in Tampa Bay, Baker is nothing like the player he was with the Browns.\n\nAnd if the NFL schedule-makers know what's good for them, Week 1 will see the Bucs and Falcons face off on primetime.\n\nBills already have perfect Sean McDermott replacement\n\nWild trade idea for Ravens' Lamar Jackson surfaces involving Pro Bowl QB\n\nHas Bills' Super Bowl window closed with Josh Allen?\n\nWhy Texans are shaking at the thought of C.J.

    "title": "Don’t let the shooting stats fool you, Dallin Hall remains crucial to UVA basketball’s success",
    "description": "Hall continues to help the ’Hoos in more ways than one despite his scoring struggles.",
    "fullText": "Things are going well for Ryan Odom and the Virginia Cavaliers, to say the least. The ’Hoos are firmly back in the top-25 once again at 16-2 overall and 5-1 in the ACC, with a gigantic opportunity this Saturday against a struggling North Carolina team at home inside JPJ.\n\nA huge part of this team’s success, despite what anyone who only looks at the scoring column might tell you, is the leadership and all-around play of Dallin Hall.\n\nThe easy-to-knock, low-hanging fruit of his game as of late has been his shooting, rather the lack thereof throughout stretches this year, especially in UVA’s last three games. In the last three wins over Stanford, Louisville, and SMU, Hall’s combined for an ugly 3-of-16 from the floor, with all but three of those attempts coming from beyond the arc.\n\n19% shooting is bad; there’s no defending it in a vacuum. But pointing at that percentage alone to poke a giant hole in Hall’s game, as UVA’s narrow leader in minutes played per game (27.5), would be disingenuous for what he does for this team, and a misunderstanding of why Odom and his staff brought him to Charlottesville in the first place.\n\nHall does a handful of things well that you’ll never see in the box score or on a graphic flashed across on TV. He boxes out guards gunning for boards to open space for others to get their hands on rebounds, plays sound team defense, and does the things that make coaches pump their fist in a film session like funneling ballhandlers into the human skyscrapers of Johann Grunloh and Ugonna Onyenso for tough looks around the basket, or simply making the easy, productive passes in halfcourt offense for second or third assists.\n\nYou’ll never hear anyone talking about a hockey assist in a basketball game, but those are the plays that shine like flashing green lights to a coaching staff making playing time decisions.\n\nDallin Hall is a box score-watcher’s worst nightmare.\n\nAffects the game even when shots aren’t falling pic.twitter.com/JcBRSsykev\n\n— Garrett Keogh (@garrett_keogh01) January 19, 2026\n\nBesides, was the expectation when UVA secured his commitment in the summer that he would be averaging 13 points a night? Safe to say, probably not. In his first three years at BYU, he averaged 7.3, 9.0, and 6.8 points per game, respectively. Today, his scoring average sits at 5.8. And while there was serious talent on a few of those Cougar teams, the jury is still out on whether or not this UVA group is the best Hall’s been a part of — I lean more toward that being the case.\n\nHall starts and plays heavily because of his ability to distribute, defend intelligently, and be in the right spots. Guys like Thijs De Ridder, Malik Thomas, Chance Mallory, and Sam Lewis have shown they’re able to carry the scoring load. That’s part of why this team is up to No. 14 in the AP Poll. Odom and co. constructed this roster with a clear vision in mind for each guy’s role. Hall is out there to help run the show on both ends of the floor.\n\n\"He's just a winner.\"\n\nUVA coach Ryan Odom says Dallin Hall has made a tremendous impact on the team both on and off the court this season. Adds how valuable his mentorship with Chance Mallory is this year.\n\nAlso says he wants Hall to continue shooting.\n\n— Preston Willett (@PrestonWillett) January 19, 2026\n\nAnd sure, I can find clip after clip of great plays, and if you think differently, you can go find a share of bad ones. That’s as endless a game as someone still saying the SEC is the best conference in college football at this point. But overall? Hall is a net positive when he’s out there.\n\nIn fact, the analytics suggest that to be true when you look at how effective UVA’s lineup combinations are with him on the floor. Of the ACC’s top 15 rated three-player lineups measured by CBB Analytics, the ’Hoos own four of them. The only player included in each of those four? Dallin Hall.\n\nThe top '3-player lineup combos\" by Net Rating in the ACC (min. 150 MP) pic.twitter.com/OU4uh1AlJK\n\n— CBB Analytics (@CBBAnalytics) January 18, 2026\n\nNow, this isn’t to say UVA’s starting point guard should be free from criticism should he continue to not make shots for three or four straight games coming up, but to not acknowledge the little things, in addition to the fact he pulled down 12 rebounds against Louisville, and dished out nine assists at SMU — which now has him at a 19:4 assist to turnover ratio across the last three games — would be criminal when it comes to recognizing his overall value. He isn’t just logging 30+ minutes of cardio each night. He’s making winning plays, no matter how small some might seem.\n\nAnd, like the Maryland game when he went for 20 points, I wouldn’t be surprised if we see a time in the near future when this team is starving for a scoring lift, and it comes at the hands of a few big shots from No. 30.",

The jam electrified the Sixers' bench and the 18,005 spectators on hand at Xfinity Mobile Arena.\n\nKnown as a high-flyer, Edgecombe has had quite a highlight reel through his first 37 career games with the Sixers, from soaring chasedown blocks to acrobatic finishes.

He is also one of three rookies to score at least 20 points in four straight games this season.\n\nThough Edgecombe doesn't appear to be a likely contestant in the Slam Dunk Contest, the former Baylor guard is considered a lock for the Rising Stars Game on Feb. 13 as one of the top rookies.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rookie Wire: Sixers news: VJ Edgecombe dismisses Slam Dunk Contest question",

The 21-year-old was the Cowboys' first-round draft pick back in April, being selected No. 12 overall out of Alabama. He started 14 games as a rookie and played every offensive snap in each of those appearances, missing three games early in the season with a high ankle sprain.\n\nHe's the first Cowboys first-year player named to the squad since Tyler Smith was chosen in 2022.\n\nBooker is joined on the 2026 All-Rookie Team by standouts like Patriots running back TreVeyon Henderson, Buccaneers wide receiver Emeka Egbuka, Colts tight end Tyler Warren, Giants defensive lineman Abdul Carter, Eagles linebacker Jihaad Campbell, and Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori.\n\nBrowns linebacker Carson Schwesinger was named Defensive Rookie of the Year; Panthers wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan is this season's Offensive Rookie of the Year and the 2025 Rookie of the Year.\n\nFormer Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons won 2021's Rookie of the Year honors.

    "fullText": "Gabriel Jesus said he had \"tears in my eyes\" after scoring twice to help Arsenal win 3-1 at Inter Milan and seal their place in the Champions League last 16.\n\nThe 28-year-old was making only his third start since returning in December from 11 months out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury.\n\nJesus has been at Arsenal for four seasons but feels like he has played only \"one and a half or two\" having endured a series of setbacks.\n\nThe Brazil forward has shown flashes of his quality following his comeback, scoring an excellent fourth goal in Arsenal's 4-1 thrashing of Aston Villa last month but, against Inter, he looked back to his best.\n\n\"It's a dream night,\" Jesus told Amazon Prime after the Gunners maintained their 100% record in this season's Champions League with a club-record seventh successive win in the competition.\n\n\"I always dreamed of being a footballer. I watched when I was a kid. I watched a lot of Serie A, so to be here in this stadium and score here is tears in my eyes because I always dreamed of being here.\n\n\"There is always a reason that things happen, whether it's good things or difficult things. I learned that during my 11 months out of the field.\n\n\"It is always difficult to play against Inter Milan. We came here last season and lost. Tonight we played better than them, we controlled them but they are a top team and they attack.\n\n\"We scored at the end and got the three points. We have to keep going because we have another one at the weekend.\"\n\nHis two goals ended a run of 10 Champions League games without scoring - the last one coming in a 6-0 win over Lens on 29 November, 2023.\n\nGunners fans have been calling for Jesus to start since he came back to full fitness, with summer signing Viktor Gyokeres struggling for form and goals.\n\nThe Swede got on the scoresheet in Milan with an fine curling effort, but his strike for Arsenal's late third was just his second from open play in his past 13 games.\n\nGyokeres, though, does have two in his last three games after netting in the Carabao Cup semi-final first-leg win at Chelsea, while Kai Havertz offers another forward option following his return from a knee injury.\n\n\"Everyone wants to start,\" added Jesus. \"I am a very respectful guy. I am not a kid anymore, I am 28, so I understand football.\n\n\"I am very happy Vik came on and scored a goal. I am so happy I scored and Vik scored. I am confident Kai will score when he gets the chance.\"\n\nJesus stars as Arsenal beat Inter for landmark win\n\nWith Gyokeres and Jesus both on target in Milan, it marked the first time this season two centre-forwards had scored in the same game for the Gunners.\n\n\"We have been missing Gabi a lot,\" said manager Mikel Arteta. \"I think it is going to raise his confidence levels and the team's because we now have different profiles in that position, like we have with the wingers and in other positions.\n\n\"And the fact the players are playing at that level. Viktor [Gyokeres] comes in and makes a great impact in the game - and it only makes us better.\"\n\nJesus' two goals took the former Manchester City frontman's tally to 26 in the Champions League on his 53rd appearance, with the only Brazilians to reach 25 in fewer games in the competition being Neymar (44) and Jardel (45).\n\n\"In the end it's not even about competition between the players [for places]. The words Jesus said, even if the next player comes, he will still score his goal to help the team,\" four-time Champions League winner Clarence Seedorf told Amazon Prime.\n\n\"These are words I like to hear because they're coming into a different level now because, yes they are competing, but whoever plays needs to perform.\n\n\"If I'm not playing you perform because next game will be easier for me when the team is winning. I like that.\"\n\nWayne Rooney, whose former club Manchester United visit Premier League leaders Arsenal next on Sunday, added: \"If I was Gabriel Jesus now I'd be saying, 'I want to start the game on Sunday'.\n\n\"He's come here, scored two goals and played really well so if I was him, I'd be putting it in the manager's mind that I really want to play.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "Cooperstown calls: Carlos Beltrán, Andruw Jones and Jeff Kent lead class of 2026",
    "description": "Former White Sox ace Mark Buehrle gains traction as Hall of Fame debate evolves",
    "fullText": "It’s a tale of sustained excellence, peak brilliance and overdue redemption: Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones each surpassed the 75% needed for election by members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America on Tuesday, while Jeff Kent was formally awarded his place in Cooperstown this winter by the Contemporary Era Committee. The trio will headline the Hall of Fame Class of 2026.\n\nKent was announced as a Hall of Fame inductee in December, finally receiving long-overdue recognition for his sterling work at second base. His 377 homers are the most all-time at second base, while his 1,518 RBI and eight 100-RBI seasons are unmatched for a player at Kent’s position. Kent was a five-time All-Star and four-time Silver Slugger Award winner who slashed .290/.356/.500 with 55.4 WAR over 17 seasons. Simply put, Kent was a generational talent who did things at second base that most didn’t think were possible.\n\nBeltrán, meanwhile, fell just short of Cooperstown last year in his third trip on the BBWAA ballot, receiving 70.3% of the vote. But the writers have spoken this year, elevating Beltrán to the HOF with 84.2% of the vote. Beltrán appeared in 20 seasons and 2,586 games over his career, slashing .279/.350/.486 with 2,725 hits, 435 home runs, 312 stolen bases and 70 WAR. His counting numbers are all the more impressive considering he’s one of only five players in AL/NL history to post 500 doubles, 400 homers and 300 steals. Beltrán was a nine-time All-Star and won three Gold Gloves, as well as earning American League Rookie of the Year honors in 1999. What sets Beltrán apart from others, though? His resume in October. Beltrán was a different beast during postseason play, slashing .307/.412/.609 with a 1.021 OPS, which ranks among the best postseason performances ever.\n\nUnfortunately for Beltrán, his career wasn’t all sunshine and roses as he was named in the report on the Astros’ sign-stealing scandal and admitted to using text messages to share scouting information during his tenure with Houston. After apologizing to MLB, he stepped away from baseball for several years.  As time went on, it seems the writers, at least this year, decided to overlook his role in the scandal and accept his apology. Today, he serves as the Mets’ special assistant to the president of baseball operations, David Stearns.\n\nThe eventual election of Jones is just one of the many reasons that Hall of Fame voting can change drastically over time. He surpassed the 75% mark this year in his ninth year on the ballot, eventually landing at 78.4%. It wasn’t always pretty for Jones, who came alarmingly close to falling off the ballot in his first year of eligibility after recording just 7.3% of the vote. But each year, Jones gained steam as voters began to understand the value of his elite defense at a premium position, combined with plus power at the plate. During his best years, Jones was one of the best center fielders the game has ever seen, winning Gold Gloves for 10 straight seasons while also hammering 434 home runs over his career. Prior to this year, only eight center fielders were enshrined in Cooperstown; with the election of Beltrán  and Jones, that number now sits at 10.\n\nA deeper dive into Jones’ prime reveals just how good he was. At age 19, Jones homered twice in his first two career World Series at-bats. He hit seven 30-homer seasons, led MLB with 51 homers in 2005, and was a five-time All-Star. Unfortunately, injuries cut into Jones’ career after age 30 and prevented him from adding even more to his eye-popping stats. Jones spent one lone season in 2010 in Chicago, where he posted a 120 OPS+ and put up a 1.9 WAR across 107 games for the White Sox. His career was also not without issue, as an off-field arrest for domestic violence in 2012 may have stalled his early ballot progression to the HOF.\n\nFinally, reaching career highs on Monday was former White Sox southpaw Mark Buehrle, who saw his vote total jump from 11.4% in 2025 to 20% in 2026. It’s a steady increase over the course of his six years on the ballot, and one that could continue to trend upwards as seasons pass. Buehrle has one of the best pitching hallmarks of all time, tossing at least 200 innings in 14 straight seasons. Only seven Modern Era pitchers were able to reach that milestone at least once, and six of those pitchers are already in the Hall of Fame. Buehrle won 214 games, logged over 3,200 innings since the start of the 21st century, had elite defensive metrics earning him three Gold Gloves, and had signature moments, including a perfect game, a no-hitter, and an ALCS complete game. Hopefully, his case will only grow stronger with time, and the momentum eventually works in Buehrle’s favor.",

    "fullText": "Obviously frustrated by the heavy defeat suffered at the Santiago Bernabéu against Real Madrid (6-1), the English central defender spoke in the mixed zone after the match.\n\nThey were powerless against the Madrid steamroller. Pegged back very early in the match, the AS Monaco players ultimately succumbed to a heavy defeat against Real Madrid on Matchday 7 of the Champions League (6-1). It was obviously a disappointment, and one that Eric Dier sought to analyze in the mixed zone post-match. 🎙️\n\nGood evening, Eric. What happened tonight?\n\nIt’s difficult to explain right after the match, but it simply wasn’t a good performance from us. We’re obviously very disappointed, and there’s not much else to say. We just need to try to understand what went wrong, especially since when you lose by that score, it means a lot of things didn’t work. We now need to process this and move forward. I’m obviously very disappointed in myself, but everyone needs to do some self-reflection; that’s the most important thing.\n\nWe weren't surprised by the quality of this Real Madrid team; everyone knows them and was aware of their capabilities. We had a few chances  in the first half, which was quite open. Unfortunately, we left ourselves too exposed after halftime, and we conceded goals due to silly mistakes.\n\nWere you surprised by the level of your opponent?\n\nWe weren’t surprised by the quality of this Real Madrid team; everyone knows them and was aware of their capabilities. We had a few chances  in the first half, which was quite open. Unfortunately, we left ourselves too exposed after halftime, and we conceded goals due to silly mistakes. Their counter-attacks really hurt us.\n\nHow can you defend against a player like Kylian Mbappé?\n\nIn my opinion, football isn’t an individual sport; it’s always about collective play, and it’s often characterized by mistakes. Even if you’re a very good team, you’re bound to make mistakes, and when you’re struggling, you’re even more vulnerable. We now need to show a different attitude, both individually and collectively. But the best news is that we have another match in four days.\n\nNo, I don't think so. It's never too great a challenge, and we've shown in the past that we can perform well against very strong teams. But our performance was simply not good enough today. We need to learn from these kinds of matches as a team.\n\nEric DierOn the lessons to take from the amtch\n\nHow can we explain the team’s performance?\n\nIt’s sometimes difficult, when you’re on the inside, to find rational explanations for what’s happening, especially since we’re currently going through a difficult period. When everything is going well, it’s easy to make the right choices and show character. But we need to show that character precisely in these kinds of situations.\n\nWas the challenge too great tonight against Real Madrid?\n\nNo, I don’t think so. It’s never too great a challenge, and we’ve shown in the past that we can perform well against very strong teams. But our performance was simply not good enough today. We need to learn from these kinds of matches as a team.\n\nWhen you lose 6-1, you obviously have to change a lot of things. We need to be better in every aspect of the game. How do we bounce back? The advantage is that we have another match in a few days against Le Havre in the league to show a different side of ourselves. Again, when everything is going well, it’s very easy to have the right attitude, show personality, and demonstrate character, but it’s precisely in these difficult moments that it seems the hardest. But we have to face this challenge.",

    "fullText": "Union Saint-Gilloise head coach David Hubert thinks that his team’s Champions League showdown against Bayern Munich is the biggest match in the club’s history.\n\n“It doesn’t get any bigger than this – it’s the biggest game in the club’s history. Bayern are right up there when you look at the best teams in Europe. You can’t find a bigger challenge. But there’s confidence and hunger in our team. We want to show ourselves tomorrow. You see, everything is bigger here, even the microphone is bigger,” Hubert said with a laugh (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “The danger comes to you from all sides against Bayern. I like to review the chances an opponent creates before we play them. Normally, that takes two hours, but with Bayern it took two days. They have all the qualities, both collectively and individually.\n\n“Aggressive pressing, playing between the lines, down the wing, they have some truly exceptional players. They’re a team with no limits. But as long as the odds aren’t zero, you have a chance. We have to try to seize it. And after all, it’s eleven people against us. They have two legs, two arms, two lungs, just like us… We’re looking forward to it.”\n\nYup, Hubert is impressed with the Bavarians. However, the manager’s message is that in the Champions League…anything can happen.\n\n“In the Champions League, you compete against the best, and Bayern are currently the best in Europe. We want to show our best side. That’s why we play this sport. In football, there’s always a chance,” Hubert said.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "description": "The Boston Red Sox aren’t rushing their Plan B after the Alex Bregman miss.",
    "fullText": "The most revealing part of Chris Cotillo’s update wasn’t the name attached to it. It was the lack of movement.\n\n“Very little traction” on Eugenio Suarez is not the kind of phrasing that signals a deal is imminent, but it does tell you something important about where the Red Sox actually are right now.\n\nNot where they were a week ago, not where fans want them to be, but where the front office has landed in the immediate aftermath of losing Alex Bregman.\n\nThe loud part of the offseason is over. What’s left is quieter, more uncomfortable, and far more reflective of how Boston wants to operate.\n\nThe Bregman chapter closed loudly, expensively, and with more friction than the organization would ever admit publicly. He was the clean solution - the one that made sense on paper, in the clubhouse, and in the lineup. Boston pursued him seriously, but deliberately (to a fault), and when the bidding crept past their internal line in the low-$160 million range, they stopped.\n\nThat decision didn’t just cost them Bregman. It reshaped everything that followed.\n\nIn that context, Suarez becoming a legitimate Plan B option made perfect sense.\n\nAccording to Cotillo and Sean McAdam earlier this month, the Red Sox “like” him. That word matters. It’s not urgency. It’s not aggression. It’s interest, filtered through restraint.\n\nSuarez is not Bregman. He’s not Bo Bichette, either. What he is, however, is a very specific kind of bat - one Boston’s lineup has lacked at times.\n\nForty-plus home run power is not a projection with Suarez; it’s the foundation of his value. He launched 49 home runs in 2025 between Arizona and Seattle, and for a Red Sox offense that too often stalled when the ball stopped leaving the yard, that kind of thump plays.\n\nA near-30% strikeout rate isn’t a footnote. It’s a defining trait.\n\nHis defense at third base is serviceable at best, and nobody is confusing this with a long-term, stabilizing solution at the hot corner. Suarez doesn’t smooth out a roster. He fits into it, warts and all.\n\nAnd that’s where Cotillo’s report starts to read less like a dead end and more like a snapshot of Boston’s current posture.\n\n“Very little traction” suggests the Red Sox are not pushing. It suggests they’re content to let the market breathe, to see whether price and years come down, to avoid another negotiation that forces them to choose between structure and star power. After how the Bregman talks ended, that’s not surprising - it’s instructive.\n\nRemember to join our RED SOX on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

We’ll Let’s do that.”\n\nHarbaugh, who was fired by the Ravens earlier this month, was talking about the successful second act he envisions with the Giants.\n\nThe difference, of course, is that Harbaugh won a Super Bowl with the Ravens, and Reid came up short in Philadelphia. No head coach has ever won a Super Bowl ring with two different franchises. Can Harbaugh make history after failing to reach the big game with quarterback Lamar Jackson?\n\nHarbaugh got his start in the NFL with the Eagles in 1998.

He is averaging a team-high 19.2 points, 8.9 rebounds and 9 assists, and has seven triple-doubles.\n\n“I don’t know what the cutoff point is in terms of missed games and things like that, but before he got hurt, I think you could certainly make the argument he was playing at that level for strong consideration,” Donovan said.\n\nThe Bulls were ninth in the Eastern Conference at 20-22 entering Tuesday's game.

    "description": "Many Tottenham fans have already lost faith in Thomas Frank - but did Tuesday's 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund give cause for optimism?",
    "fullText": "Speaking to Tottenham fans on their way to Tuesday's Champions League game with Borussia Dortmund, almost none retained any belief in Thomas Frank.\n\nIt felt as though a bad defeat against the German side - which would have been a fourth loss in a row in all competitions - would not only have led to more boos and more toxicity inside the stadium, but the end of his reign as manager.\n\nInstead, a 2-0 win thanks to first-half goals from Christian Romero and Dominic Solanke is likely to buy Frank some time. An encouraging performance from his depleted team could even give him more than that.\n\nJust a few days earlier, loud boos greeted the final whistle at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as West Ham snatched a last-minute winner.\n\nBefore kick-off on Tuesday there were some jeers once again when Frank's name was read out, but they turned into cheers at full-time as Spurs secured a win that now puts them in a strong position to qualify automatically for the Champions League knockouts.\n\nThe question now is: was this a temporary reprieve for Frank or a platform to build on? And is it enough to win back the fans who had turned against him?\n\nIt was clear many fans had turned on Frank during the defeat by the Hammers, with large numbers singing \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" at him.\n\nThat feeling remained evident before Tuesday's match.\n\n\"I really do think 99% of this stadium are Frank out,\" said Spurs supporter Sarah Sturgeon-Scraggs, who has been attending home games with her dad Ronnie since she was nine.\n\n\"I have enjoyed coming to the matches because of the people we sit with and I get to spend time with my dad, but we get so little joy.\"\n\nRonnie added: \"Barring some sort of miracle on player support, style and results instantly the fans have abandoned him and I feel personally that he must go.\"\n\nThis win and the much-improved first-half performance was still not enough to change their view, with a return to a more conservative and unadventurous display in the second half a cause for frustration.\n\n\"The first half was really enjoyable,\" said Sarah. “There was a lot more movement, a lot more forward passing and a press. However, the second-half performance shows why Frank is not the right person to be managing this team. We went to five at the back, the game ground to a halt. It sucked the joy out of it yet again.\n\nFellow Spurs supporter Ali Speechly held a similar view before kick-off.\n\n\"If we could see signs of what he is trying to achieve we might have more patience,\" she said.\n\n\"It looks like a bunch of players doing what they want.\"\n\nAny change of heart after the game?\n\n\"Much better first half, where has that been? But second half we were dead again,\" she said. \"They either play a good first half or second half. It feels Thomas Frank can't string the two together.\"\n\nSome, however, did see enough to believe Frank can build on this.\n\nAlfie said before the match that Tottenham were playing “like a Championship team”, but after he said: “The first half was brilliant. The second half wasn’t great but we didn’t concede.\n\n“But I am really happy with the result and I think Frank might have a lot more up his sleeve than we think.”\n\nMany of the fans may still need some convincing - but what the display did suggest is that Frank retains the support of the dressing room.\n\nThe players' work rate, intensity and desire was there to see in the first half and when the whistle went for half-time they all gathered before heading down the tunnel together.\n\n\"What I saw tonight was not a performance where the manager had lost the dressing room,\" former Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk of a disjointed dressing room. That wasn't there [against Dortmund].\n\n\"It wasn't full here, the fans voted with their feet, but that was a group of players that played for their manager.\"\n\nThat is something Frank himself was keen to stress in the post-match press conference.\n\n\"The players are giving everything,\" he said.\n\n\"That is an extremely good sign about the culture. An extremely good sign they are together and we are together.\"\n\nFor Tottenham supporters, this season will be providing a sense of deja vu.\n\nThey were dreadful in the Premier League under Ange Postecoglu last term but it was a different story in Europe as they went on to win the Europa League.\n\nIt is a similar story under Frank, with Spurs languishing 14th in the league but in Europe they have lost just once in seven games and are likely just a win away from a place in the Champions League knockouts.\n\n\"There's two Tottenhams running about this season,\" former Scotland striker Ally McCoist said on TNT Sports.\n\n\"Fortunately it was the Tottenham that have been doing well in the Champions League who turned up tonight.\"\n\nRobinson added: \"When your back's against the wall, in adversity, you dig in and get a result.\n\n\"The thing that will frustrate Thomas Frank and these Tottenham fans is where was this in the Premier League? Where was this at the weekend?\"\n\nThere is never long in football to sit back and enjoy a result, and the pressure will be on Frank once again when they take on struggling Burnley in the Premier League at the weekend.\n\nWin that with another impressive performance and some might start to see green shoots of recovery.\n\nLose and the pressure on Frank will once again be immense, something he is all too aware of.\n\n\"The big thing is of course is to build on this with a performance and win against Burnley on Saturday,\" he said.\n\n\"What I would say is it is a big skill to be able to produce in the Premier League and Champions League every week.\n\n\"We just need to keep doing the same thing, keep believing and things will turn.\"\n\nIt has been a difficult few days for Frank, with the negative reaction after the West Ham loss, while news that the club's hierarchy are considering ending his seven-month reign broke on Monday.\n\nAfter all of that, Frank welcomed the opportunity to be able to savour this win against Dortmund for now.\n\n\"Two big glasses of red will be necessary,\" he said. \"I will enjoy them.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Head Coach Cael Sanderson, PJ Duke, and Mitchell Mesenbrink spoke to media ahead of Friday's dual vs. Indiana in Rec Hall.",
    "fullText": "This afternoon, Head Coach Cael Sanderson, 157 lbs starter PJ Duke, and 165 lbs starter Mitchell Mesenbrink spoke to media ahead of Friday’s dual vs. Indiana in Rec Hall.\n\nTranscript Readers: Be sure to watch the first few seconds of Mitchell’s video for a glimpse into his carefree way of being.\n\nYeah, I think the weekend went well. I think just a fun environment. Going on the road and competing is a lot of fun as a team. Obviously, a lot of little things we can improve on collectively and individually—just part of the process of figuring things out and I mean we say this every time we wrestle Iowa, but they do a really good job preparing and they kind of always give you an idea of what you need to get better at and just good competition, good wrestlers, good coaching staff there. So yeah, I think we come away with some ideas on how we can get better. (0:12 – 0:48)\n\nYeah, I don’t know. I mean it’s always just preparation for the next match. So a match comes and goes quickly. Everything comes and goes quickly. So it’s all just preparation. And so I don’t know if anyone’s patting themselves on the back or anything as much as just seeing what can we do better and continue to approach things with enthusiasm and gratitude is kind of the key. (0:58 – 1:28)\n\nYeah, it just depends. I mean the double dual is a double weigh-in. You get a pound now that second dual enough to—I mean the guys love that obviously but I’m not a big deal. But yeah, we’ll just continue to improve our conditioning. I mean we have eight or nine weeks until the nationals, I believe. So we’ll, you know, we got a lot of time to get better and technique and then take our shape up a notch or two. (1:42 – 2:13)\n\nI think Luke [Lilledahl] is just a competitor, number one. He just loves the sport. And he’s just going to keep getting better because that’s just his mindset and he has aspirations of being an Olympic champion and if that’s what you’re trying to do, it’s got to be little steps every day, every week, every month, each year obviously. So yeah, he’ll just keep getting better. He’s definitely the student of the game and a great competitor. Very technical in addition to just being a really good athlete and fast and just having a great feel. So yeah, he’s just a great competitor. He’ll just keep getting better and that’s just his plan. (2:30 – 3:19)\n\nI think they both have done a great job. I mean, they’re competitors. They’re going to go out there and be themselves and the bigger the moment, the better they’re going to wrestle. That’s just what they’ve done their whole lives and that’s what we do as a program. Yeah, great matches. Marcus [Blaze] wrestled a guy he could see in the NCAA finals, right? And [PJ] Duke wrestled an All-American and so it could be the same kind of a situation but the trick is just be yourself regardless of when, where, whoever—just do what you do and they both are great examples of that. (3:42 – 4:18)\n\nI don’t know. I mean, we have a special thing going here, right? I mean, kids know that. They see that. I think I have a pretty good idea of what we’re doing and what we’re not doing. I think in this era and the NIL era and all the different motivations to go to different programs, our kids know that they’re coming here because they want to be the best wrestlers they can possibly be. And so I think when we look back, we’ll see that this era has been good to us because we do our best to follow the rules and we’re going to get the kids that are coming here for the right reasons, right? Because the kids know, recruits know, parents know. So, although it seems like it’s an advantage, I think it’ll be an advantage to us just because kids are coming here with very high character, wanting to be the best wrestlers in the world. (4:34 – 5:35)\n\nYeah, we kind of just threw him in there right away as soon as that decision was made. And Braeden [Davis]is a competitor. He’s fine. He’ll just keep rolling with things and just improve. I thought he wrestled really well on Sunday, bouncing back from a tough loss. I mean, one takedown, there’s such a fine line between winning and losing. So, those are good lessons to learn. And just finishing a shot like you were saying before, getting a stalling call or getting a minute of riding time as opposed to 59 seconds. I mean, that’s just what makes sports fun is just the inches and centimeters that make a difference. He’ll keep competing and just keep getting better as we move forward. (5:44 – 6:36)\n\nI don’t know if there’s anything we didn’t know. He grew up in Pennsylvania, so you watch him—just again, I keep saying our guys are great competitors—but yeah, just a great competitor, very composed. Just wrestled tough and did an awesome job. And it’s just, alright, on to the next one. Obviously, you can’t win the nationals in January, so we’re preparing for the end of the season. And then when we get to the end of the season, it’s the same mindset—we’re just trying to compete to the best of our ability and really preparing for the next tournament because it just gets bigger. Everything gets bigger and things are quickly forgotten and you move on to the next thing. So, it’s just about progress. He’s just a kid that wants to be the best he can possibly be. He’s coachable and he listens, and he follows game plans. Just a tough kid and obviously very talented physically and mentally. (6:46 – 7:45)\n\nI think the chemistry is really incredible right now in the program. Just like I said before, just a lot of good kids that are here for the right reasons. Kids that could have named their price and gone to other schools are here because of what the program represents and stands for. Those are the kids that are going to care about one another and care about the team. When you do that, obviously, you’re going to get your best self and your best individual results. But yeah, these guys, they want to obviously win as individuals, but they’re team guys. The more time they spend together, the better things get. Very good, very close group. Recruits ask how close the guys are, and I think they’re close, but this is a really close group. A lot of really good kids coming from great families, a lot of team mentality, and they want to see each other do well. If it wasn’t like that, it just wouldn’t be fun. It’s got to be bigger than yourself or you’re just going to be miserable all the time. (8:06 – 9:26)\n\nYeah, I don’t think there’s been any surprises with Cole [Mirasola]. He’s just a really tough wrestler. Moves really well. And he’s learning how to wrestle heavyweight. I mean, he bumped up last year at heavyweight, and this would be his third year at heavyweight because his junior year [of high school] he was, but he’s just figuring things out. I don’t think anybody’s surprised. I think the big thing for us as coaches is just him having some nice signature wins for his own confidence. We obviously believe in him and know he can do really, really well and as well as he decides to do. So, yeah, great win for him. As a coaching staff, it’s more about him just knowing and believing that he can do that. So, we’re happy for him, too. (9:46 – 10:34)\n\nGreg [Kerkvliet] is not here anymore—he trains at Lehigh RTC now—but last year I’m sure they wrestled a lot. Greg [Kerkvliet] is a big, strong, athletic, tough guy. If he decides he’s going to win the Olympics, he’s going to win the Olympics. But even just being in the same room as him helped. And then we have a lot of good heavyweights in here and guys in the Nittany Lion Wrestling Club that do a great job. Even with Lucas Cochran, those two had to battle and prepare one another and they’re good friends. I think that was a huge blessing for Cole [Mirasola] to have a big hurdle even just to be the starter this year, which makes everybody stronger. Having a guy like Lucas [Cochran] to wrestle every day—he’s definitely one of the best heavyweights in the country. And everyone knows Coach [Casey] Cunningham is the “heavyweight tamer.” When he comes in, the heavyweights start hiding in the corners trying to get out of there. So, a lot of good training and he’s taken advantage of it all. (10:42 – 12:13)\n\nI’m not really sure what he said, but yeah, Cole [Mirasola] is a nice guy. But just like anything, there was a cartoon my dad had in his office growing up—he was a high school PE teacher and wrestling coach—and it was like a “nice guys finish last” kind of cartoon. It’s not being dirty or cheap—you work within the rules 100%—but then you got to compete. You have to be tough and you have to fight. That goes for all of our guys. There’s never been a great athlete that hasn’t had to fight for things a little bit. Technique is just a small piece. As guys figure that out, it’s kind of fun to see. (12:24 – 13:10)\n\nIt was a pretty crazy environment. It’s like something you dream about your whole life, just Iowa has a good reputation for fans and putting on a good show. So, it was pretty cool to be a part of that. (0:00 – 0:17)\n\nYeah, definitely. I think it’s just amazing kind of what we’re doing and stuff and it’s just incredible to be a part of it. (0:18 – 0:37)\n\nNot really. I kind of just treat every match the same. I try to at least, and I’m sure Marcus [Blaze] is the same. We both have pretty similar mindsets. So, no matter kind of where it is, whether it’s in practice or an actual match or wherever, just try to be the same person as always. And that kind of just helps you stay grounded and don’t let the fans get into the match. But we’ve just been doing it our whole lives, so it’s kind of just regular for us now. (0:38 – 1:19)\n\nYeah, I would have definitely been pretty surprised. I’m grateful to be where I am now and I put in a lot of work in the past, so I think I hold myself to a pretty high standard. I would definitely be proud of myself but I would be like, yeah, I do deserve to be there. (1:21 – 1:50)\n\nYeah, it’s—I mean, just to be at such a great program and to have such good teammates. It’s something that’s unescripable and just it’s kind of special how close our team is. I would say a lot of teams aren’t like that where everyone’s successful and everyone wants each other to get better. Most of the time when people are successful it doesn’t break you down, but not here it’s way different. Everyone wants you to get better and to do better. (1:51 – 2:28)\n\nYeah, it’s pretty special what KD is doing and his pipeline here is definitely amazing because he knows it’s the best place in the world for wrestling. He’s always going to believe that and he wants his guys to be the best in the world. So, he’s obviously going to love them to come here and there’s no better place to be. I’m super excited for those guys, too. They’re going to be really successful when they come here and I’m looking forward to having some fun with them for sure. (2:31 – 3:10)\n\nI would say I was kind of chasing him a little bit. He was more defensive and I would say most of the Iowateam got more defensive the whole time. I kind of just had to be patient and I knew an opening would eventually come and once it did I took advantage of it, took him down and that was pretty much the match. I just again had to be patient and there’s going to be an opportunity every match to score and I just had to take advantage of it. (3:12 – 3:49)\n\nI obviously like scoring a lot of points. That’s the goal is to obviously try and tech or pin everybody I wrestle, but obviously not every match can be perfect. It’s hard to do bonus points every match when guys don’t want to really wrestle too much. Some matches are just going to go a little slower and you got to be patient, but I love to score points, so I’m always going to try and do that. (3:50 – 4:20)\n\nI tried to treat every match similar. So, obviously warming up and stuff, you’re in Carver-Hawkeye Arena, so it’s pretty special. As I was walking out, I was kind of like looking around like, “Wow, this is really happening.” I was talking with Marcus [Blaze] actually before the duel, and I was like, “Yeah, this is crazy. Like we’re literally on Penn State‘s team about to wrestle Iowa.” I think sometimes I do wrestle better under pressure. Having all those fans probably does add a little bit extra pressure, but I try not to let it affect me for the most part, and I’m pretty good about that. (4:21 – 5:07)\n\nHonestly, I didn’t really hear too much to be honest, but we didn’t really give them too much to really chirp at, so they I don’t think they were saying too much. (5:08 – 5:21)\n\nI did hear KD. I can always hear KD. It’s actually kind of crazy. Even with however many fans, I heard KD‘s voice. He’s got a pretty loud voice. (5:22 – 5:32)\n\nIt’s definitely pretty incredible. Just being with this group of guys and being dominant and getting better every day is just so much fun. I think all of us try not to really look at the accolades and the scores and the matches and stuff and we just kind of look at how we can get better. It does mean a lot. Obviously we’re grateful that we did the job good, but we’re just kind of ready to get better and move forward. (5:33 – 6:15)\n\nI don’t know. I don’t think there’s any secret sauce or anything. It’s just keep doing the same things and focusing on the bigger picture of things in terms of getting ready for the next match or preparing for things later in life, not just wrestling. Instilling values into your day-to-day that mean something to you and that mean something to God and that make a difference. Everybody knows them. They’re not some crazy fable or message that you’ve never heard. It’s just making the—what’s the quote? It’s something like extraordinary is just ordinary over and over. (0:18 – 1:10)\n\nI just think it’s nice to be able to look down the line both ways and you got guys that are ready to go. They’re not only ready to go in the wrestling, but they’re enjoying it and they’re having fun. Maybe it’s competing against each other as well—not physically wrestling each other, but whether it’s “I want to get more takedowns than this guy” or whatever. It’s good. I think camaraderie is a big thing, making people feel like they matter and that they belong on a team. (1:27 – 2:03)\n\nHonestly, it’s whoever they send out. Set it up. (2:07 – 2:10)\n\nYou definitely learn a lot about a person and their coaching staff, like what they want to choose to try to throw out and employ against you the next time you wrestle and then the next time. You get to see their thoughts, but then you also get to see who they are when they do step out. Like what was it Mike Tyson said? “Everybody’s got a plan until you get punched in the face.” There is a part of that, but then there’s also a part of preparing. It’s been almost a year since we’ve wrestled, so you get to see things that they’ve tried to implement or they’ve done since then. I think you definitely get better. It’s easier to win once or beat someone one time than it is to continually do it and be successful. Cael [Sanderson] talks about that—it’s harder to win again and again and again. It definitely makes you level up for sure. (2:16 – 3:24)\n\nMaking it a game is definitely fun, like making it enjoyable. It’s just like playing games. You learn a guy—it’s funny, we’ve never spoken, but it’s like we know a lot about each other about little tendencies and little things. I think that’s fun. At the end of the day, you try to make people out to be hero and enemy, but if things got serious and the world turned upside down, you’d want those guys on your team. You’d want to be able to go to battle with any wrestler that you wrestle or compete against. Keeping that in mind, too—no one’s really an enemy. (3:46 – 4:30)\n\nI know what you’re meaning. I just don’t think—I think pride is a very slippery slope and ego and things like that. Like I said earlier, paying attention to the things that matter. If you’re paying attention to things like that, it becomes a thing where you’re not treating everything the same. Then when you’re in NCAA finals and that’s the biggest thing ever, you can’t breathe and your stomach hurts and you’re going out there nervous. At the end of the day, it’s like making this an eternal thing and just like this is more than just a wrestling match. So more so to your point, it’s put who you are, not what you are, out there.

    "description": "Nashville SC played the Chicago Fire in its first preseason match of 2026, losing 4-1 in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.",
    "fullText": "Nashville SC played soccer for the first time in more than two months. And though the result doesn't line up with the club's high expectations for 2026, it's a secondary concern for coach B.J. Callaghan.\n\nNashville lost 4-1 to the Chicago Fire on Jan. 20 in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida in its first preseason game ahead of what might be its most anticipated MLS season ever. Although the match was 90 minutes, starters played for only about half an hour, with backups and players from Huntsville City FC getting the rest of the action.\n\n\"For us, it's more about setting clear objectives of what we worked on this week,\" Callaghan said. \"Being clear with how we're going to evaluate in the game, which would be on certain objectives, a couple phases of play that we were focused on.\"\n\nHere are additional takeaways from the game against the Fire, as well as Nashville's first week of the preseason.\n\nNashville SC arrived in Florida on Jan. 12 and will play four of its six preseason matches there, with the next against the Colorado Rapids on Jan. 23. The team will practice in Nashville for a week ahead of an exhibition at USL club Birmingham Legion on Jan. 31, go back to Florida for two more games and finally face Lexington SC in Nashville on Feb. 14, two days before its CONCACAF Champions Cup opening match at Atletico Ottawa.\n\nNashville dealt with several injuries in its past two preseason training camps, but Callaghan said the team is almost fully healthy, with only one player, Huntsville forward Alioune Ka, sitting out against the Fire.\n\nThat doesn't mean Nashville would be ready to play a competitive game tomorrow.\n\n\"The fitness component is getting there,\" Callaghan said. \"It's growing in the right direction, but we're not where we need to be. We're not 90-minute fit for sure. But it's intentional, and we're gonna build through this preseason.\"\n\nNashville's first MLS game is Feb. 21 against the New England Revolution at Geodis Park (7:30 p.m. CT).\n\nMORE: Nashville SC signals MLS championship aspirations with Cristian Espinoza\n\nNashville's starting lineup looked like a full-strength group. Brian Schwake started at goalkeeper, while new signing Maxwell Woledzi paired with Jeisson Palacios at center back. Dan Lovitz and Andy Najar started at left and right back, respectively.\n\nEdvard Tagseth and Patrick Yazbek held down central midfield, with Alex Muyl and Cristian Espinoza playing on the wings and Hany Mukhtar and Sam Surridge up front in attack.\n\nCallaghan said Nashville started out in the 4-2-2-2 formation, which was its primary setup in 2025. While that remained the base throughout the 90 minutes, Nashville tweaked that shape at different moments.\n\nEspinoza, the club's newest designated player, worked for the first time with the other two DPs, Mukhtar and Surridge. The trio didn't produce any goals, but created a few opportunities, according to Callaghan.\n\n\"They bring different dynamics, whether it's playing between the lines, running behind, being able to get service,\" Callaghan said. \"It's about creating that connection, that chemistry between those three. But at the same time, it's also making sure that we're well dialed-in on the defensive side.\"\n\nMidfielder Charles-Emile Brunet scored Nashville's lone goal on a long shot during the third and final shift, which consisted largely of trialists and draft picks. Brunet was Nashville's third-round pick in December's MLS SuperDraft out of SMU.\n\nJacob Shames can be reached by email at jshames@gannett.com and on X/Twitter @Jacob_Shames.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nashville Tennessean: Nashville SC MLS preseason takeaways, what we learned",

    "description": "Joe Lunardi dropped UNC to a No. 7 seed as defensive issues and recent losses cloud the Tar Heels’ NCAA tournament outlook.",
    "fullText": "With March looming, fans are already scouring bracket projections to see where their teams might land.\n\nThat’s especially true in Chapel Hill, where North Carolina’s uneven ACC play has raised questions about Hubert Davis and the direction of the program. The Tar Heels are 14-4 overall but just 2-3 in league games and have dropped three of their last four.\n\nESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi has taken notice. In his latest update, he slots North Carolina as a No. 7 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament, a slide from last week when the Tar Heels were listed as a No. 5 seed in the East.\n\nNo. 1 Michigan vs. No. 16 ColgateNo. 8 UCF vs. No. 9 AuburnNo. 5 Kansas vs. No. 12 Murray StateNo. 4 Florida vs. No. 13 TroyNo. 6 Villanova vs. No. 11 George MasonNo. 3 Illinois vs. No. 14 UNC WilmingtonNo. 7 North Carolina vs. No. 10 USC/New MexicoNo. 2 Houston vs. No. 15 North Dakota State\n\nThe path out of the Midwest is anything but straightforward.\n\nIn Joe Lunardi’s latest projections, North Carolina opens against the survivor of the First Four game between New Mexico and Southern California.\n\nNew Mexico sits near the top tier of mid-major programs and may be stronger than most of the opponents Carolina has seen to this point. The Lobos are No. 40 in the NET rankings, a better mark than many of the teams on UNC’s schedule. USC, meanwhile, is a capable Big Ten squad whose guard play could expose one of North Carolina’s biggest weaknesses — defending the perimeter.\n\nShould the Tar Heels get through that first test, they would likely draw Houston in the next round, a matchup that could easily spell the end of their tournament run.\n\nWell, the Tar Heels can’t play defense at the moment despite being one of the most efficient teams scoring wise in the conference.\n\nThe Tar Heels rank 16th in field-goal percentage allowed (49.7%) and 17th in points allowed (85.4 per game) and defensive efficiency (120.5).\n\nThe perimeter numbers are especially glaring.\n\nNorth Carolina’s defensive problems start on the perimeter.\n\nThe Tar Heels rank last in the league in 3-point field-goal percentage defense (44.9%) and in effective field-goal percentage, a metric that weighs 3-pointers more heavily. Opponents have shot at least 40% from beyond the arc against UNC in four straight games. Since the start of ACC play, teams have made 72 3-pointers against the Tar Heels — an average of 14.4 per game, the worst rate in the conference.\n\nThe issues don’t stop on the inside. North Carolina is 14th in 2-point field-goal percentage defense and provides little resistance at the rim, sitting 12th in block percentage and 14th in blocks per game. Still, most of the damage is being done from long range.\n\nAnother problem that has flown under the radar is UNC’s inability to force turnovers. The Tar Heels have struggled to create miscues all season and rank second to last in the ACC and 341st nationally in turnover rate across all games. In conference play, they are 16th in turnover percentage and 18th in non-steal turnover percentage — the category that includes forced passes out of bounds, drawn charges and similar plays.\n\nGiven those numbers and a schedule that only gets tougher, North Carolina needs to start stacking quality wins and limiting bad losses to improve its NCAA tournament positioning.\n\nFollow us@TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of North CarolinaTar Heels news, notes and opinions\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC Basketball: Tar Heels sliding in latest Bracketology",

    "fullText": "For the past seven years, the Raiders have fielded the same kicker and punter. And for the last three years they've had the same kick squad trio of kicker Daniel Carlson, punter AJ Cole, and long snapper Jacob Bobenmoyer. But it looks like that trio could be breaking up this offseason.\n\nCole was given a long term extension prior to this past season. Meanwhile Carlson and Bobenmoyer are both set to become free agents this March. The team had every opportunity to re-sign either or both of them. just as they did Cole, but opted not to do that.\n\nIf the team were to sign Carlson back, you'd have to figure they would sign Bobenmoyer as well, just to keep the band together for continuity purposes.\n\nTuesday, the team signed long snapper Alex Ward on a reserve/futures contract, signaling they are prepared to let Bobenmoyer go, which, in turn, would suggest they are preparing to let Carlson go as well.\n\nWard spent the past three seasons with the LA Rams. He was waived last November, which is why he's signing with the Raiders instead of preparing to play in the NFC Championship game right now.\n\nThe three-year veteran went undrafted out of Central Florida where he was the long snapper for three years.\n\nThere is no guarantee he will be the team's long snapper going forward, but the mere fact they have added him suggests a change at the position is coming.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Raiders Wire: Raiders latest signing could signal end for longtime kick squad",

Hockenson has had a solid run as a member of the Minnesota Vikings, but his days in Minnesota may be numbered.\n\nThe Vikings could be looking to free up some salary cap space over the offseason, and cutting the veteran tight end could be an avenue to that end.\n\nIn a recent article, ESPN’s Aaron Schatz predicts that the Vikings will indeed cut Hockenson to free up $9 million or \n\n“With little cap space, the Vikings will say goodbye to tight end T.J. Hockenson, who has had injury issues and is coming off two straight years with fewer than 500 receiving yards. He ranked 35th among tight ends in ESPN's receiver scores this season. Cutting Hockenson would save the Vikings nearly $9 million in cap space before June 1 and $16 million if designated after June 1.”\n\nHockenson is a solid player who has made two Pro Bowls in his career. But, the Viking could probably get comparable production at the position for a cheaper price, and with other needs to address, it makes sense that the Vikings would look to shed cap space where they can.\n\nMinnesota will have an opportunity to identify a replacement for Hockenson in the upcoming 2026 NFL Draft. They could also look to fill the position with a cheaper option via free agency.\n\nMeanwhile, Hockenson is still just 28 years old and should still have some productive play in front of him.

It also helps that Stockton had a relationship with Nunley, as the new Michigan assistant coach was recruiting him when he was on staff at Boise State.\n\n247Sports’ Blair Angulo had good things to say about Nunley’s skills: “A talented cover corner with really good fluidity, the 6-foot, 180-pound Nunley has been a steady riser the last couple years and has seen his stock shift in an upward trajectory. He has shown a knack for man coverage and the ability to impact plays at the catch-point. Nunley had a strong senior season at Western where he was rarely tested on the perimeter, and he was one of the more consistent performers in the off-season showcase circuit.”\n\nThe stats from that “strong” senior year — 57 total tackles, 20 pass deflections, five interceptions and two forced fumbles. He also recorded 26 tackles, two interceptions and 10 total passes defended his junior season.\n\nWith former Michigan signee, four-star cornerback Andre Clarke Jr., being released from his letter of intent earlier this month, it’s good that Kyle Whittingham and company were able to seal the deal here and bring in another cornerback. He joins four-star safety Jordan Deck as the only members of the secondary for the Wolverines in the 2026 recruiting class.\n\nNunley is ranked No. 101 in the state of California, No. 108 at the cornerback position and No. 1,277 overall in the 2026 class on the 247Sports composite. Check out some of his senior year film down below.",

Now, they need to get back at them, and luckily, there’s a perfect player to do it with.\n\nAccording to Fansided’s Zachary Rotman, the Phillies could be a top suitor for former MVP and All-Star Cody Bellinger. Bellinger would address their outfield problems, and would take Bellinger from the Mets, who are also seen as another top suitor.\n\nMORE: Proposed blockbuster Giants trade sees San Francisco gut punch Dodgers by dealing for $152 million two-time All-Star ace, create 1-2 punch with Logan Webb\n\n“The Phillies need to improve their offense. They admitted such by pursuing Bichette. Bellinger might not be the hitter Bichette is, but he's a really good one nonetheless, and he's a much better defender and base runner. Plus, I'd argue the outfield is much more of a weakness than the infield, so signing Bellinger, an outfielder, could prove to be even more helpful,” Rotman wrote.\n\nThis past season, Bellinger slashed .272/.334/.480/.813 with 25 doubles, 29 home runs, and 98 RBI in 152 games played. He would definitely give the Phillies a facelift in the outfield, and replace Max Kepler as he serves his suspension for P.E.D. use.\n\nMORE: Mets predicted to steal another superstar from crosstown rivals, sign $182 million MVP to create super outfield with Juan Soto\n\nBellinger is projected to receive a six-year, $182 million deal, and that might be too much for the Phillies. However, they were going to offer Bichette seven years, so what’s stopping Philly from doing the same for Bellinger?\n\nHopefully, the Phillies cement their position and get in touch with Bellinger’s camp ASAP.

    "description": "Baker Mayfield still steamed about how it ended in Cleveland, is looking forward to seeing Kevin Stefanski in Atlanta.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns have experienced little to no success since their return to the NFL in 1999.\n\nBut there was one brief period where it appeared the franchise had finally turned the corner.\n\nThat was in 2020, when first-year head coach Kevin Stefanski and third-year quarterback Baker Mayfield helped lead the Browns to the playoffs for the first time in 18 years.\n\nOnce there, they handed the Pittsburgh Steelers the third playoff loss in what is now a seven-game postseason losing streak, and then pushed the Kansas City Chiefs to the brink before falling in the Divisional Round of the playoffs.\n\nAt the time, it seemed as if the Browns had finally cracked the code with a young head coach and a brash quarterback joining together to take on the NFL.\n\nThis is Cleveland, of course, where everything ends badly when it involves the Browns, so the joy did not last long.\n\nIn 2021, an injured shoulder left Mayfield ineffective, and the Browns lost four of their last six games to miss the playoffs. That offseason, ownership made the ill-fated decision to trade for quarterback Deshaun Watson, shipped Mayfield to the Carolina Panthers for peanuts (a conditional fifth-round selection), and things were never the same.\n\nMayfield bounced from the Panthers to the Los Angeles Rams before landing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2023, where he has thrown for 12,237 yards and 95 touchdowns in three seasons, while leading the Buccaneers to the playoffs twice.\n\nMeanwhile, in Cleveland, the Browns cycled through quarterbacks as Watson was suspended in 2022, and then injured in 2023 and 2024, limiting him to just 19 games.\n\nA surprise playoff appearance in 2023 helped to ease some of the hurt, but a combined record of 8-26 the past two seasons finally brought an end to Stefanski’s tenure in Cleveland. (When you can’t fire the owner, someone has to take the fall.)\n\nAs fate would have it, Stefanski was recently hired by the Atlanta Falcons, who share the NFC South Division with the Buccaneers and Mayfield, setting up an annual home-and-home meeting between the head coach and his former quarterback.\n\n#Falcons’ Kevin Stefanski had a dumpster fire at quarterback in Cleveland — Baker Mayfield and Deshaun Watson failed, which started a chain reaction to 11 other starters. QB Shedeur Sanders closed out last season with seven starts. https://t.co/nnuXs2ZCbd\n\n— D. Orlando Ledbetter (@DOrlandoAJC) January 20, 2026\n\nThat is an angle that D. Orland Ledbetter at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution explored on Tuesday in a (paywalled) column that described Stefanski’s time in Cleveland as a “dumpster fire” at the quarterback position.\n\nFailed is quite the reach pal. Still waiting on a text/call from him after I got shipped off like a piece of garbage. Can’t wait to see you twice a year, Coach. https://t.co/jUUsYkvlOC\n\n— Baker Mayfield (@bakermayfield) January 20, 2026\n\nMayfield, as he has been wont to do during his career, decided to throw some additional fuel on the fire by calling out both Ledbetter and the way his former coach handled the end of their time together in Cleveland:\n\nFailed is quite the reach pal. Still waiting on a text/call from him after I got shipped off like a piece of garbage. Can’t wait to see you twice a year, Coach.\n\nThe NFC South has always been a strange division, where rivalries, like the one between the Falcons and New Orleans Saints, are rarely noticed on a national level. But with Mayfield and Stefanski now in the same division, the Falcons and Buccaneers games this fall are going to be must-see TV.\n\nAnd in a fun scheduling twist, the Browns play both the Falcons and Buccaneers next season, with Atlanta and Stefanski coming to Cleveland, but, sadly, the Browns are facing the Buccaneers in Tampa.",

    "description": "If all goes well this Saturday at UFC 324, Rose Namajunas could be on the cusp of two-division glory.",
    "fullText": "Nearly four years have passed since Rose Namajunas reigned supreme as the UFC strawweight champion. And if all goes well this Saturday at UFC 324, she could be on the cusp of two-division glory.\n\nNamajunas, 33, has fought five times since moving up to the flyweight division in 2023, defeating Tracy Cortez, Amanda Ribas and most recently Miranda Maverick in June. To start her 2026 campaign, Namajunas faces off this weekend against the division's No. 2-ranked contender, Natalia Silva. Appearing Tuesday on \"The Ariel Helwani Show,\" Namajunas revealed UFC officials told her a win will earn her a title shot, which means a fight against her good friend, flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko.\n\n“It would be weird, but I mean, we’re martial artists,\" Namajunas told Uncrowned. \"I would love to have a conversation about it and talk with her first and everything like that. She’s somebody that inspired me and that I’ve looked up to. It would definitely be conflicting emotions, but at the same time, I’m down to do it. I also understand if there'd be second thoughts or if it would be kind of weird.\"\n\nThe thought of a Shevchenko fight has floated around in Namajunas' mind since she first gained steam at 125 pounds. For a brief spell, she didn't have to worry about the two meeting in the Octagon, thanks to Alexa Grasso's momentary title run. But Shevchenko ultimately won the belt back from Grasso in 2024, and now the prospective collision between friends appears closer than it's ever been before.\n\n\"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it, but honestly, just as a fan of hers, she’s literally my favorite female fighter, for real,\" Namajunas said of the 37-year-old Shevchenko. \"So it would be so weird because, obviously, I would never want to see her lose, but then I would have to go into a fight and try to beat her. Then, at the same time, as a martial artist, it would just be the ultimate culmination of being able to test myself, because she and Amanda Nunes are the greatest female fighters in MMA [history].\n\n\"It would just be a dream come true, but at the same time, it would definitely be like, 'Ahh!' That's kind of what fighting is — it's weird. I don't hate anybody I fight. I fought people like Tecia Torres — we trained together, then we fought, then we trained together, then we fought [again]. I've done it before. I don't have to hate anybody to compete.\n\n\"It doesn't mean I'm going to be like, 'We're going to have sleepovers and be best friends after,' or anything,\" Namajunas added. \"I love all my opponents, even the ones that maybe I was rivals with. Afterward it's water under the bridge, it's nothing.\"\n\nNamajunas was initially slated to meet Grasso at UFC 324 before the Mexican contender withdrew due to injury, allowing Silva to step in as a late-replacement. A fight against either women wouldn't have been easy for Namajunas though, and the odds reflected that — \"Thug Rose\" was slotted as a betting underdog in both pairings. Grasso opened as a heavy -400 favorite to beat Namajunas on BetMGM lines; against Silva, Namajunas' margin has only widened, with Silva currently listed as a -450 favorite.\n\nRegarding the difficulty of the matchups, Namajunas agrees with the moneyline view, however that's also why she's happier with Saturday's current matchup than with her previous one.\n\n“Stylistically, I think Natalia is just a trickier style to deal with than somebody like Alexa,\" Namajunas said. \"The toughness that Alexa would have brought, just her mental fortitude and how she seems like she doesn't change, no matter what's happening in the fight, that would have posed a different challenge than Natalia.\n\n\"So I’m definitely happier with the change-up, because I feel like I get closer to my goal faster with Natalia, as opposed to Alexa. Even with a dominant performance against Alexa, I don’t know where that would leave me in the mix [for a title shot]. ... Natalia definitely brings more challenges than Alexa did.”\n\nStill young despite her 13-year professional MMA run, Namajunas has accomplished nearly everything she's needed to at this point. Her two UFC title reigns at strawweight etched her into the history books, and while a third at 115 pounds would've been impressive, she's been happy to stay up at flyweight.\n\nEven with her friend manning the throne, the hardware Shevchenko holds is all the motivation Namajunas needs to keep going.\n\n\"I'm not at a stage where I can just not do anything for the rest of my life,\" Namajunas said. \"So finances are still a factor, but it's not the main motivating factor. If anything, I'm good with where I've wanted to be financially, as far as what I've wanted to get out of fighting. I've sort of accomplished most of what I wanted to do.\n\n\"But basically, it's the two-division [champion status] — to just have that as an accomplishment would be a dream come true. It's on the list of when I had goals to achieve in MMA, that was one of the goals that I had.\"",

    "description": "The former outfielders will join Jeff Kent in this year’s induction class",
    "fullText": "Former outfielders Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones have been elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame as part of the 2026 class, as both players reached the 75% threshold for induction as voted on by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America (BBWAA).\n\nThe duo will join second baseman Jeff Kent in the 2026 class, as Kent was selected by the Contemporary Baseball Era Committee back in December.\n\nBoth Beltrán and Jones finished just shy of making the Hall a year ago, as Beltrán received 70.3% of the vote and Jones hit 66.2%. Beltrán, now in his fourth year on the ballot, received 84.2% of the 425 ballots cast, while Jones, in his ninth year on the ballot, reached 78.4%.\n\nBeltrán, 48, seemed like a first-ballot lock near the end of his career, but after he reportedly took a key role in the 2017 Astros’ sign-stealing scandal, he lost his managerial job with the Mets before coaching a game, and his reputation was tarnished.\n\nStill, Beltrán finished his career with 70.0 bWAR, batting .279/.350/.486 with 435 homers, 2,725 hits, 1,587 RBIs, 1,582 runs, and 312 steals over 2,586 games during his 20-year career. He was also named AL Rookie of the Year with the Royals in 1999, and he was selected as an All-Star nine times, won a pair of Silver Sluggers, and three Gold Gloves.\n\nJones, also 48, had a slightly shorter career than Beltrán, playing 17 seasons from 1996 to 2012, though he still accumulated 62.7 bWAR. One of the greatest outfield gloves in baseball history, Jones won 10 Gold Gloves, a Silver Slugger, and was named an All-Star five times. For his career, he hit .254/.337/.486 with 434 homers, 2,196 hits, 1,289 RBIs, 1,204 runs, and 152 steals over 2,196 games.\n\nBeltrán will likely enter the Hall as either a Kansas City Royal or a New York Met. He spent seven years with both clubs, starting his career in Kansas City and accumulating 24.8 bWAR there before spending 2005-2011 in New York, totaling 31.1 bWAR with the Mets. Jones will almost certainly go in as an Atlanta Brave, having spent 12 of his 17 MLB seasons in Atlanta and totaling 61.0 of his 62.7 bWAR with the Braves.\n\nBeyond Beltrán and Jones, the only other player to break the 50% threshold was former second baseman Chase Utley, who garnered 251 votes, good for 59.1%. Andy Pettitte and Félix Hernández both fell just shy of 50%, as Pettitte received 48.5% of the vote on his eighth ballot and Hernández got 46.1% of the vote in his second year on the ballot.\n\nOf the 12 first-year candidates, Cole Hamels is the only name to remain on the ballot entering next year, as the left-handed starter received 23.8% of the vote. Ryan Braun led the group of players who won’t return to the ballot, as he picked up 15 votes (3.5%). Former Brewer Gio González received no votes, while former closer Francisco Rodríguez received 50 votes (11.8%) and will remain on the ballot for a fifth year next time around.\n\nCongratulations to Beltrán and Jones on joining Kent and the other 354 elected members (281 players) in the Hall this summer! The full voting results of this year’s ballot are below.\n\nBBWAA elects Carlos Beltran, Andruw Jones to Hall of Fame. pic.twitter.com/NpBXWv9Q2S\n\n— BBWAA (@officialBBWAA) January 20, 2026",

    "description": "Loan Huynh, an immigration attorney in Minneapolis, shared her advice for employers and employees as ICE continues heavy enforcement in the area.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Loan Huynh, an attorney who serves as the chair of the immigration department at Frederickson & Byron, a law firm based in Minneapolis. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThere's a huge concentration of ICE enforcement right now in Minnesota, specifically here in the Twin Cities. My law firm works with both employers and their employees.\n\nEmployees are very scared — they may be specifically being targeted by ICE, or they have family members or loved ones who are being targeted by ICE and they want to protect them, or they're just scared to be out in public.\n\nThe ICE action isn't just against individuals who are foreign nationals in Minnesota; it's against anyone who appears to be a foreign national, or anyone who's questioned and believed to be not cooperating with ICE — and there could be potential consequences, as we've seen.\n\nIt's a really difficult time for employers now, too. They're facing situations where they may have employees who can no longer work for them or who don't want to come to work, so they have to look at providing them with work-from-home options or other arrangements.\n\nICE is coming to their parking lots or places of business; we're getting questions from employers about how to ensure ICE doesn't have access to their spaces.\n\nWe know that this administration is taking a much broader interpretation of what rights they have in order to enforce immigration laws, and employers must be prepared for this.\n\nAs any law-abiding citizen or entity, you want to cooperate with law enforcement, but it doesn't mean that you don't have rights.\n\nThese are private properties that the businesses own, and businesses can restrict access.\n\nUnless there is some type of judicial order, warrant, or subpoena, there is no obligation for an employer to undertake enforcement activities or to perform the work of ICE activities here.\n\nIf you're communicating that they cannot enter your place of business — such as with a sign that says it's private property and there is no access to ICE — they don't have the right to do that.\n\nWe recommend that employers establish a protocol ahead of time about what they're going to do if ICE comes to their place of employment or contacts them about a specific employee.\n\nWe know now that it can happen; we're seeing it in Minnesota in ways we've never seen before.\n\nHere are questions that I think all employers in the US need to really need to address before that happens:\n\nEmployers should prepare early, before ICE comes to your neighborhood, to your place of employment, or to your city.\n\nIf ICE produces a judicial warrant asking for information or a subpoena about a certain individual, the employer should seek counsel to see what they must do in order to comply with it, whether it's right away or to inform ICE that they need additional time.\n\nIf ICE comes and says, \"I want to talk to this individual,\" and there's no warrant to allow that, an employer can respond, \"Thank you for the request. We will need to seek counsel in order to determine the next steps. We'll be happy to convey this information to the individual when we are able to.\"\n\nI was just on the phone with an employer about potential scenarios that they may face. I asked them, \"What do you plan to do if ICE comes to your parking lot and just parks there? How will you respond to that? Or if you get a call from one of your employees who says, 'I'm too scared to walk out of my car here. I see that there are ICE agents in the parking lot.'\"\n\nIt's so important for employers to prepare for any possible scenario, role-play, and determine, with their counsel, how they will respond to a request from a government agent or ICE.\n\nWe're seeing situations where an individual will say, \"I don't want to speak with you,\" or, \"I have counsel. Please contact my counsel,\" and the ICE agents continue to pressure them. They get very scared, and that's understandable, but please remember that you do have the constitutional right to be silent and not to speak to any investigator without counsel.\n\nWe have Know Your Rights information on our website. Everyone should know they have the right to choose whether to speak to a government agent. They have constitutional rights that, just because they are being threatened by an individual, don't mean that they have to succumb to those threats or requests.\n\nAre you a business owner or employee who's had an experience with ICE?

    "description": "The US reaching a diplomatic agreement with Denmark that could expand the US's presence in Greenland looks like the most likely outcome, JPMorgan said.",
    "fullText": "That is, Trump Always Chickens Out, or the idea that the president's aggressive policy tactics are mostly bluster aimed at getting a party to the negotiating table.\n\nThat's the question investors are mulling this week as the market swoons amid Trump's fiery comments about the future of Greenland, which he has said the US needs to control for national security.\n\nThe White House has told investors not to count on Trump backing down before, but his latest attempt to put pressure on Denmark has Wall Street talking about the president's notorious negotiation style again.\n\nTrump's most recent maneuver has been to threaten eight European nations with 10% tariffs starting in February, ramping up to 25% in June if no deal on Greenland is reached.\n\nTo some forecasters, the Greenland situation is clear: It's another opportunity for investors to position for the TACO trade.\n\n\"I think we need to read this from an 'Art of the Deal' perspective,\" analysts at JPMorgan's international markets intelligence desk wrote in a note on Tuesday. \"Trump creates noise and throws in a maximal stance designed to trigger negotiation and create leverage/urgency.\"\n\n\"The market wants to see if today is TACO Tuesday,\" the bank's market intelligence team added.\n\n\"How much uncertainty investors can stomach is a good question, but the resolve in the FOMO and TACO trade (the belief that President Trump is bluffing on Greenland and is only working to secure a 'deal') has proven time and again to be very difficult to break,\" David Rosenberg, a top economist and the president of Rosenberg Research, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\nAmid talk of a TACO trade revival, analysts say they see a handful of outcomes from Trump's tough talk on Greenland. Here are three ways forecasters see the situation playing out.\n\nThe US reaching an agreement with Denmark that could expand US presence in Greenland — such as by getting access to the territory's natural resources — looks like the most likely outcome, JPMorgan said, pegging the scenario with a 55% probability.\n\n\"We know Trump opens with a maximal stance, designed to trigger negotiation and create leverage. This is no different,\" the bank said, noting that the timing of the tariff threats looked \"not coincidental,\" given that the World Economic Forum is in full swing this week.\n\nAnalysts added that a sale of Greenland looks \"less likely\" due to the need to get Denmark's approval, and the US using military force to take Greenland looks \"highly unlikely,\" since it would draw pushback from Republican lawmakers and voters. The US attacking another NATO member could also open the door to further aggression from the bloc's rivals, JPMorgan added.\n\nThere's a 40% chance Trump's new tariffs won't be implemented at all, possibly by Trump's \"own retreat,\" according to Matt Gertken, the chief geopolitical and US political strategist at BCA Research.\n\nGertken added that he believed there was a 70% chance the situation in Greenland would have a \"non-military\" solution, and a 30% chance that solution would involve a short-term trade war with Europe.\n\n\"Global stocks would fall, while US treasuries and the dollar would fall, but the administration would then change course, as it did after Liberation Day,\" he wrote in a client note on Monday.\n\nChristopher Granville, a managing director at TS Lombard, added that he believed the most likely outcome was a \"truce\" between the US and Europe, with the US likely suspending tariffs as negotiations over Greenland stretch on.\n\nThat was what happened when Trump first introduced tariffs on Mexico and Canada last year, Granville added, later pointing to political pressures from the coming midterm elections, which could incentivize Trump to lower tariffs.\n\n\"Some commentators may slap the TACO label on any such truce that could be agreed at this week's in-person meetings in Davos between Trump and various European leaders,\" Granville said, though he noted that the situation wouldn't be a \"TACO for real\" scenario, since the US wasn't backing down on Greenland entirely.\n\nThe expected Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariffs could also come into play.\n\nBCA estimated there was around a 50% chance the Supreme Court could strike down Trump's tariffs, up from a 30% chance the firm had predicted earlier.\n\n\"Normally the court would defer to the president on international issues. But now the president threatens to entangle the court in lawless behavior that threatens the court's credibility and the constitutional balance of powers,\" Gertken said, pointing to Trump's threats against the NATO alliance. \"So we have less confidence that the court will defend the president's stance.\"\n\nJPMorgan's international market intelligence team said the latest tariff threats were \"riddled with challenges.\"\n\n\"First, the proposed tariffs are based on IEEPEA, which the Supreme Court could imminently rule to be illegal in their application. Second, I would think it practically impossible to tariff 6x EU countries at a different rate to other members, given the freedom of movement of goods which structurally exists within the EU,\" the bank's Matthew See wrote.",

    "fullText": "Montana's Glacier National Park typically sees over 2 million visitors between May and August each year.\n\nAlthough I love taking in the park's beauty in the warmer seasons, this spike in visitation can often lead to long lines to enter the park.\n\nHowever, after living near the park for 35 years, I've discovered the best time to visit is during the less-chaotic winter months.\n\nAlthough many of the park's services are technically closed from early October through late May, I love the peace and solitude the park offers during this time.\n\nVisiting Glacier National Park in the winter requires a bit more planning, but in my opinion, it's worth it. Here are my tips for visiting during the offseason.\n\nDuring the winter months, a pass is still required to visit the park, even if no one is manning the entrance. Luckily, though, the rates are typically cheaper than they would be in the winter months.\n\nEntrance passes can be purchased online via the National Parks Service website.\n\nMany of the park's roads are closed in the winter, making for great opportunities for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.\n\nSince our boys were young, we've loved strapping on cross-country skis or snowshoes to travel along Going-to-the-Sun Road for a couple of miles until we reach the bridge that crosses McDonald Creek.\n\nIn this section of the park, we pass through an area of dense, old-growth western hemlock and western red cedar that feels like the forests of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nJust keep in mind that if you decide to travel to higher elevations, you need to be prepared for changing winter conditions, and be familiar with avalanche safety.\n\nIf you want to explore the area with a knowledgeable guide, head to the Apgar Visitor Center for one of the ranger-led snowshoe outings held weekends from the end of December to the middle of March.\n\nIf you don't have your own snowshoes, you can rent a pair for $2.\n\nThis is a fantastic opportunity to learn about the park in the winter and look for signs of wildlife in the snow.\n\nOne of my most important pieces of advice is to not take the winter lightly when visiting Glacier. There is little or no cell service throughout most of the park, and the weather can quickly switch from idyllic to a blizzard.\n\nLeave your cotton clothing at home, and instead opt for wool, alpaca, or synthetic fabrics that wick away sweat. Wear multiple layers, including a wind-breaking outer layer, a hat, and gloves.\n\nAlso, remember to fill your gas tank or charge your electric vehicle before entering the park, as you will not have the opportunity to do so once you get inside.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 23, 2024, and most recently updated on January 20, 2026.",

    "description": "The Dow tumbled 870 points on Tuesday as investors assessed the impact of Trump's intensifying push to take control of Greenland.",
    "fullText": "US stocks plunged, and bonds sold off on Tuesday on Donald Trump's feud with Europe over Greenland.\n\nAfter spending much of 2025 doubting the president over everything from tariffs to threats to fire Fed boss Jerome Powell, stocks had their worst day since October amid Donald Trump's fight with European nations about who should control the Danish territory.\n\nThe sell America trade was in the spotlight again on Tuesday amid the latest turmoil.\n\nUS stocks plunged as investors took in the latest tariff threats targeting eight European Union countries if Denmark doesn't put Greenland up for sale by the start of February. EU leaders have discussed hitting back with tariffs of their own.\n\nMajor indexes fell sharply, with losses accelerating in afternoon trading. The Dow dropped almost 900 points, and traders sought shelter in defensive assets like gold and silver. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined more than 2%.\n\nLong-dated US Treasury yields spiked, while the US dollar declined against a basket of other currencies. Highlighting tensions in the bond market, a Danish pension said it was exiting the market for US government debt, with plans to dump $100 million in Treasurys due to \"poor\" US government finances.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood around 4 p.m. ET closing bell on Tuesday:\n\nHere were other big moves across markets:\n\nUntil now, investors had mostly brushed off Trump's talk of taking over Greenland.\n\nThat seems to have changed now that tariffs are back in the picture.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said eight NATO countries, including Denmark, would face a 10% tariff on goods exported to the US in February, with the rate increasing to 25% in June if Denmark doesn't agree to \"the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\"\n\n\"The United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years,\" the president wrote on his social media platform over the weekend, pointing to new defense initiatives that make acquiring Greenland \"especially important\" for the US.\n\n\"The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them, including maximum protection, over so many decades,\" he continued.\n\nThe sell-off has largely been driven by investors trimming their exposure to US equities now that tariffs, a major concern for markets all throughout last year, appear to be on the table, David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors also seem worried that the Supreme Court ruling on Trump's reciprocal tariffs could add further volatility in markets, he added.\n\n\"The US President upped his aggressive rhetoric overnight,\" Morrison said of the selling pressure. \"While some on Wall Street argue any tariff-driven sell-off could be a buying opportunity as the earnings season picks up steam, the scale and breadth of Trump's rhetoric have unsettled risk appetite.\"\n\nThe latest tariff threats are also driving a flight to safe-haven or defensive assets, like metals. Gold rose another 3% while silver jumped 8%.\n\n\"Global investors are clearly adding to the risk premium embedded in US assets, and diversification flows are picking up,\" Karl Schamotta, the chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions, wrote in a note.\n\nA major move in Japan's bond market also contributed to some of the volatility in the US. The yield on Japan's 40-year government bond hit a record 4.21% on Tuesday as investors weighed a new tax cut proposal that has raised concerns about the nation's growing deficit.\n\nThe nation's 10-year government bond yield also increased by more than 10 basis points to trade around 2.38%, a level that hasn't been seen in 27 years.\n\nRising yields in Japan have sparked fresh concern about the amount of foreign capital flowing into US markets. Specifically, investors are worried about the unwinding of the yen carry trade, a popular strategy in which traders borrow money at low rates in Japan to deploy in markets that offer higher returns, such as the US.\n\n\"As a sliding yen triggers intervention chatter, the fate of the massive 'yen-carry trade' hangs in the balance,\" Ed Yardeni, the President of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note to clients over the weekend.",

    "title": "Suicides Were Frequent at the Golden Gate Bridge. Not Anymore",
    "description": "For decades, there had been an average of 30 each year. With a new deterrent in place, there were none in the second half of 2025.",
    "fullText": "The Golden Gate Bridge, the iconic span that hangs between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, has been the site of more than 2,000 confirmed suicide leaps since its completion in 1937. The true death toll is certainly higher, since not all jumps are witnessed and not all bodies are recovered.\n\nIn 2006, at least 34 people jumped to their deaths by crossing the four-foot rail and plunging more than 200 feet into the strait below. It was also the year that Paul Muller and two others with family members who had jumped from the bridge decided to do something.\n\nThat something slowly evolved into a complicated, miles-long series of stainless-steel nets — a “suicide deterrent system” — now strung on both sides of the bridge. It is out of sight to the millions of people who cross the bridge every year, but plainly visible to anyone standing at the rail, looking down.\n\nFor decades, there had been an average of 30 suicides at the bridge each year. In 2024, as the final pieces of the net were installed and tweaks were made, there were eight.\n\nIn 2025, the first full year with the nets in place, there were four, and none between June and December.\n\nThat annual total is surely among the fewest ever recorded at the bridge, and seven months might be the longest stretch without a suicide at the bridge, though early records are sparse.\n\n“The last seven months there were zero, so the results couldn’t be better,” Mr. Muller said.\n\nMr. Muller was disheartened to learn that there has been one suicide early in 2026. But the goal all along was to save lives, and to eventually undo the dark magnetism of the bridge as a place to die.\n\nDenis Mulligan oversees the bridge operations as general manager of the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District. His office at the south end of the bridge overlooks the steady flow of cars, pedestrians and bikes that cross between San Francisco and Marin County.\n\nIn late 2023, as the installation of the nets was nearing completion, Mr. Mulligan said it would take a year or two of data collection to assess the impact of the nets on the death toll outside his window.\n\nEarly in 2026, Mr. Mulligan considered the results.\n\n“The assessment is that the net is working as intended,” Mr. Mulligan said. “We’re trying to reduce the number of deaths. That’s what government should do, is protect the public. We were candid up front that nothing’s 100 percent, but that we think this is a worthwhile endeavor and good for the community. And we think a lot of people are alive today because of the project.”\n\nMr. Mulligan also oversees a vast electronic surveillance system and a team of on-bridge officers whose responsibilities include identifying and stopping those who are considering a leap. Last year, there were 94 successful interventions, about half as many as the average before the nets.\n\n“Nets” is a misnomer; they are taut, marine-grade stainless steel cables about 20 feet below the public walkways on both sides of the bridge. The idea is that anyone who jumps into the net will be injured enough, or at least shaken enough, to keep them from crawling out and intentionally falling the rest of the way to the water.\n\nMr. Mulligan, wary of attracting copycat attempts, declined to explain how those who have died by suicide the past two years have circumvented the nets. He also declined to say how many people have jumped into them and been rescued.\n\nBut the immeasurable number might be those who came to the bridge, spotted the nets and decided that suicide there was no longer possible.\n\nIn 1937, 10 weeks after the bridge opened, a 47-year-old World War I veteran reportedly said, “This is as far as I go,” and jumped.\n\nHis was the first known suicide. Others followed. In 1939, the California Highway Patrol recommended that the four-foot rails be raised. For decades, decision makers ducked behind aesthetic concerns, costs and effectiveness. The death toll, loosely tracked, reached 500, then 1,000, and kept growing every week or two, on average.\n\nFrustrated by the inertia, Mr. Muller, Dave Hull and Patrick Hines founded the nonprofit Bridge Rail Foundation in 2006, with the hope of raising, finally, the height of the rails.\n\n“The overriding concept to the Golden Gate Bridge story is restricting easy access to lethal means,” Muller said. “It’s a way to reduce suicides that John and Jane Q. Public can do. You don’t need a lot of complex psychiatric training to, say, simply lock up the guns.”\n\nOr to make leaping into the ocean more difficult.\n\nSupport grew slowly. Growing numbers of grieving families, mental health professionals, even coroners pleaded for something to be done. Eventually, the idea that took hold was borrowed from a solution used in Bern, Switzerland: nets.\n\nDebates raged, approvals came, construction bids opened and costs rose. There were legal squabbles with contractors. Construction began in 2018, meaning it took longer to install the nets than the four-plus years it took to build the bridge itself. What was once estimated to cost $76 million ended up costing $224 million.\n\nCritics have long wondered if steering the suicidal away from the Golden Gate Bridge merely sends them elsewhere to take their own life. Net proponents do not think so.\n\nA 1978 study by Richard Seiden, at the University of California, Berkeley, tracked 515 people who, between 1937 and 1971, went to the Golden Gate Bridge intending to jump but had been persuaded not to. It found that 94 percent were still alive or had died of natural causes.\n\n“Suicidal behavior is crisis-oriented and acute in nature,” Mr. Seiden concluded.\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has long been a unique draw for the suicidal, some even coming from other states and countries. At the edge of the ocean, on one of the world’s most famous structures, it was a way to die somewhere both beautiful and notable. Death was almost certain. (Most jumpers are killed on impact, but those who survive usually drown.)\n\nAnd access was simple, with parking lots on both ends and public sidewalks along a short rail.\n\n“The bridge has exerted a siren’s call for so long for some suicidal people that it might be hard for them to believe that it’s no longer the case,” said John Bateson, a longtime director of a suicide prevention center in the Bay Area and author of “The Final Leap: Suicide on the Golden Gate Bridge.” He writes a monthly newsletter for the Bridge Rail Foundation.\n\nThat might all explain why, while the number of suicides in 2025 were about one-seventh the pre-net average, interventions only dropped in half. People are still showing up.\n\n“The more people who know that the barrier is in place will be discouraged for even thinking about the Golden Gate Bridge as a suicide destination,” Mr. Bateson said.\n\nThe Bridge Rail Foundation remains active, despite the successful completion of its original goal. It fields calls from officials around the world looking to reduce suicides from other bridges or high places.\n\nThat might be the incalculable legacy of the work, beyond the raw number of lives saved at the Golden Gate Bridge. If one of the world’s most famous and deadliest bridges can prevent all but a few suicides, other places can probably do the same.\n\n“That’s certainly the hope,” Mr. Bateson said. “From the outset, all of us have recognized that whatever happens on the Golden Gate Bridge is going to serve as a model for others.”\n\nIf you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.",

Elon Musk agrees.\n\nMusk isn't a fan of X's algorithm, and he's documenting the company's efforts to improve the technology that decides what you see in the platform's \"For You\" feed.\n\nMusk said he is overhauling the recommendation system that decides which user-generated posts and advertisements are shown when you open the app. He also pledged to make that system transparent in the process, with the underlying code getting published on GitHub every four weeks. Musk said any changes to the code will be explained with every post.\n\n\"We know the algorithm is dumb and needs massive improvements, but at least you can see us struggle to make it better in real-time and with transparency,\" Musk wrote on X. \"No other social media companies do this.\"\n\nX's engineering team has also said the new recommendation system is built on the same architecture as Grok, the chatbot developed by Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI.\n\nWhile X has not said the two systems share training data or model weights, the comparison signals a shift toward more AI-driven content ranking, moving beyond the rules-based and engagement-heavy systems the app has historically relied on.\n\nKey questions remain about how the system operates in practice. X did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for more specifics on the algorithm.\n\nThe social media app, formerly known as Twitter, hasn't always relied on algorithms to serve its users.\n\nFrom its launch in 2006 through 2015, it presented posts in reverse chronological order, showing users the most recent tweets from accounts they followed.\n\nBut, in 2016, after several updates, a \"Show me the best tweets first\" option became the default for all users.\n\nOver time, the system grew more complex, incorporating engagement signals such as likes, replies, shares, and blocks to predict what content users were most likely to interact with or remove.\n\nMusk has long voiced frustrations with that algorithm.\n\nBefore acquiring Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, he repeatedly described the platform's algorithm as a \"black box,\" arguing that it introduced political bias and failed to reflect users' true preferences — particularly for politically conservative users.\n\nHis complaints continued after the purchase. In a 2024 post, he said the rules-based algorithms had become too divisive.\n\n\"One of the strongest signals is if you forward X posts to friends, it assumes you like that content a lot, because it takes effort to forward,\" Musk wrote. \"Unfortunately, if the actual reason you forwarded the content to friends was because you were outraged by it, we are currently not smart enough to realize that.\"\n\nHe recommended that users send videos of puppies to friends to combat the issue.",

That means if you follow thousands of people, but maybe only a few hundred of those people follow you back, that'll show up as your \"friends\" count.\n\nFor those of you who care about those precious follower-to-following ratios, get ready for a potentially even more telling public ratio: How many of those Instagram followers are friends?\n\nInstagram is quietly running this as a \"small global test,\" a Meta spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider, adding that the platform is trying to understand how users respond to seeing more content from friends in the app.\n\n\"Friends are central to the Instagram experience, so we're exploring ways to make these connections more visible and meaningful,\" a Meta spokesperson said. \"We're running a small test to highlight Friends throughout Instagram.\"\n\nAs part of the test, Meta is also labeling some content in the feed as \"friends\" instead of \"posts\" or \"following.\"\n\nAs influencers, brands, and now AI slop have invaded Instagram's feed, it's felt less and less like a space to share content with your friends.\n\nThat's part of the reason Instagram has doubled down on its \"Close Friends\" features over the years, focused on direct messaging (where friends and family often share content), and added more friend-focused features.\n\nFor instance, Instagram rolled out a feature called \"Blend,\" which lets you and a friend share a mutual feed of reels.\n\nLast year, Instagram also introduced features like a social mapping experience similar to Snapchat's map, as well as a \"Friends\" feed in the reels tab, where you can see content your friends (by Instagram's definition) are engaging with.\n\nInstagram's top executive, Adam Mosseri, said in an August post that he wants Instagram to be somewhere where users can \"actually engage with and connect with the people that you care about.\"",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces fired nearly $100 million worth of air defense missiles battling Russia's latest bombardment, Kyiv revealed on Tuesday, offering insight into the war's growing financial toll.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that the Russian attack, which began Monday night and continued into Tuesday, forced Kyiv to launch around €80 million (roughly $94 million) worth of interceptor missiles.\n\n\"Imagine that — the cost of these missiles,\" Zelenskyy said over WhatsApp in response to a question about interceptor stockpiles.\n\nThe staggering figure covers only the interceptor missiles and does not appear to account for any other munitions expended to defend against the Russian attack, which also included hundreds of drones.\n\nRussia launched 18 ballistic missiles, 15 cruise missiles, and one anti-ship missile overnight, according to data from Ukraine's air force. It said in a statement that 27 were shot down, while five hit their targets.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia has \"significantly increased\" its use of ballistic missiles and has been able to obtain critical technology for the munitions from third-party countries and from industry.\n\n\"Nevertheless, their ability to produce these missiles must be reduced — and that is not happening yet,\" he said in response to another question.\n\nAlthough Ukraine has received some additional air defense systems from Western countries, Zelenskyy said more are still needed, along with additional interceptor missiles to keep pace with Russia's attacks.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged that it has been difficult for Ukraine to obtain the necessary interceptor missiles. He specifically singled out the PAC-3, which has a $3.7 million price tag and is fired from US-made Patriot batteries, as the best chance Kyiv has to defeat Russian ballistic missiles.\n\n\"War is an extremely expensive Russian luxury, and for us it results in severe losses,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussian missiles are not the only worry for Ukraine. Moscow's overnight attack involved 339 drones. Kyiv said its Air Force shot down 315 of them. Two dozen hit their targets.\n\nTo preserve its costly air defense missiles, Ukraine has been increasingly relying on locally made interceptor drones that cost as little as a few thousand dollars to hunt down and destroy Russian drones.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine is producing around 1,000 interceptor drones each day, a goal he set last summer. The challenge now, he said, is that the number of drones has outpaced the number of operators who can control them.\n\n\"Therefore, now we must catch up in terms of the number of interceptor groups — the corresponding mobile groups,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he has tasked senior Ukrainian military leadership with bridging the gap.",

    "fullText": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk are at it again, with each of the tech titans taking aim at the other in a series of heated posts on X.\n\nMusk appeared to start the latest escalation early on Tuesday morning, when he posted \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT\" in response to a post that said that use of OpenAI's chatbot had been linked to the deaths of nine children and adults since it was released in 2022.\n\nAltman fired back, first in defense of ChatGPT and OpenAI's desire to protect its users, and then blasting Tesla's Autopilot technology, calling it unsafe.\n\n\"It is genuinely hard; we need to protect vulnerable users, while also making sure our guardrails still allow all of our users to benefit from our tools,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman continued, calling out Autopilot.\n\n\"I only ever rode in a car using it once, some time ago, but my first thought was that it was far from a safe thing for Tesla to have released,\" he wrote. \"I won't even start on some of the Grok decisions.\"\n\nAltman added: \"You take 'every accusation is a confession' so far.\"\n\nThere have been at least eight wrongful-death lawsuits filed against OpenAI that allege use of ChatGPT has contributed to worsening mental health conditions, leading to instances of suicide and murder, including among children and young adults.\n\nSafety concerns around Tesla's self-driving technology have also been central to multiple wrongful-death lawsuits, including one surrounding a 2019 crash in Florida that left a 22-year-old woman dead. A jury determined Tesla was 33% liable for the crash and awarded the plaintiffs $329 million in total damages, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and Altman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe social media feud comes as the pair is stuck in the middle of a long-running legal battle over OpenAI's status as a nonprofit company. Musk sued Altman, and other leaders of OpenAI, alleging that they misled him when they decided to pursue a for-profit structure, moving the company away from its original nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was originally founded as a nonprofit.",

    "description": "Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance announced that they are expecting their fourth child, a boy due in July.",
    "fullText": "When Fox News asked Usha Vance in June 2024 how she felt about her husband, JD Vance, being considered as Donald Trump's running mate, she told host Lawrence Jones that she was \"not raring to change anything about our lives right now.\"\n\nBut it appeared she came around — she spoke at the Republican National Convention as her husband was officially nominated to join the ticket and appeared alongside him at Trump campaign's victory party on election night.\n\nJD Vance, the former junior senator from Ohio and bestselling author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" and Usha Vance, a litigator whose résumé includes a Supreme Court clerkship, met as students at Yale Law School and wed in 2014.\n\nSince becoming vice president and second lady, the Vances have taken several international trips together, including a visit to the US military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland in March 2025.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Vances announced that they are expecting their fourth child, making Usha Vance the first second lady in US history to be pregnant while in office.\n\nHere's a look inside the relationship of the newest GOP power couple who serve as vice president and second lady.\n\nJD Vance served as a public affairs Marine in Iraq, liaising between service members and members of the press. After his military service, he majored in political science and philosophy at Ohio State University.\n\nUsha Vance grew up in a suburb of San Diego. Her parents are Indian immigrants.\n\nUsha Vance told Fox News in June that her parents' Hindu faith was \"one of the things that made them such good parents, that make them very good people.\"\n\nShe was a registered Democrat until 2014.\n\nIn law school, Usha Vance served as executive development editor of the Yale Law Journal and managing editor of the Yale Journal of Law and Technology, according to a bio on the website of her former employer, Munger, Tolles & Olson, that has since been removed.\n\nShe also worked pro bono with the Supreme Court Advocacy Clinic, the Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic, and the Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nUsha Vance told NBC News in 2017 that she and JD Vance took all of their classes together and were friends before they started dating. When they were assigned to work on a brief together, Usha Vance said she was impressed by his diligence.\n\n\"I've never seen anybody so starstruck,\" their law school professor, Amy Chua, said of JD Vance in an interview with NBC News. \"It was love at first sight.\"\n\nVance converted to Catholicism in 2019, The American Conservative reported. Usha Vance was raised Hindu.\n\nWhen asked about their interfaith marriage in a June 2025 interview with Fox News, Usha Vance said: \"There are a lot of things that we just agree on, I think, especially when it comes to family life, how to raise our kids. So I think the answer really is that we just talk a lot.\"\n\nWhile speaking at a Turning Point USA event in October 2025, JD Vance said that he hoped his wife would someday convert to Christianity.\n\n\"Do I hope that eventually she is somehow moved by what I was moved by in church? Yeah, honestly, I do wish that, because I believe in the Christian Gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,\" he said. \"But if she doesn't, then God says everybody has free will, and so that doesn't cause a problem for me.\"\n\nJD Vance's memoir details his working-class upbringing and the lives of poor, white Americans. He also wrote about how Chua, his professor, encouraged him to focus on his relationship with Usha Vance as a Yale law student.\n\nWhen JD Vance asked Chua to recommend him for a federal clerkship, she warned him that it's \"the type of thing that destroys relationships.\"\n\n\"Amy's advice stopped me from making a life-altering decision. It prevented me from moving a thousand miles away from the person I eventually married,\" Vance wrote.\n\n\"Most important, it allowed me to accept my place at this unfamiliar institution — it was okay to chart my own path and okay to put a girl above some shortsighted ambition,\" he continued. \"My professor gave me permission to be me.\"\n\nVance worked at Mithril Capital, a VC firm backed by Peter Thiel, in 2016. One former coworker previously told Business Insider that Vance was often away from the job promoting his book, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"\n\nThiel ended up being instrumental in Vance's rise to power in politics, donating $15 million to his Senate campaign and encouraging Trump to choose Vance as his running mate, The New York Times reported.\n\nVance went on to work at Revolution, a VC firm in Washington, DC, before founding his own firm, Narya Capital, in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, Usha Vance worked as a litigator at Munger, Tolles & Olson before leaving to clerk for Judge Brett Kavanaugh in the US Court of Appeals and Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts. Following her clerkships, she returned to Munger, Tolles & Olson, according to a bio on the firm's website that has since been removed.\n\nTheir first child, Ewan, was born a month before Usha Vance began her clerkship with Chief Justice Roberts, NBC News reported. They also have another son, Vivek, and a daughter, Mirabel.\n\nIn January 2026, the Vances announced that they are expecting their fourth child, a boy, in July.\n\n\"I'm not raring to change anything about our lives right now, but I really believe in JD and I love him, so we'll see what happens with our lives,\" she told Fox News in June 2024.\n\nOn the first day of the Republican National Convention, when Trump announced JD Vance as his vice presidential pick, a spokesperson for Munger, Tolles & Olsen told ABC News that Usha Vance had left the firm.\n\n\"Usha has been an excellent lawyer and colleague, and we thank her for her years of work and wish her the best in her future career,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nUsha Vance said that when they first met, JD Vance approached their differences \"with curiosity and enthusiasm.\"\n\n\"Although he's a meat and potatoes kind of guy, he adapted to my vegetarian diet and learned to cook food from my mother, Indian food,\" Usha Vance said in her speech. \"Before I knew it, he'd become an integral part of my family, a person I could not imagine living without.\"\n\nAfter white nationalist Nick Fuentes questioned JD Vance's ability to \"support white identity\" with an Indian wife, he voiced support for his spouse.\n\n\"Look, I love my wife so much. I love her because she's who she is,\" JD Vance said in an interview with Megyn Kelly in July. \"Obviously, she's not a white person, and we've been attacked by some white supremacists over that. But I just, I love Usha.\"\n\nHe also hit back against the attacks on ABC News' \"This Week,\" telling host Jonathan Karl in August, \"Look, my attitude to these people attacking my wife is, she's beautiful, she's smart. What kind of man marries Usha? A very smart man and a very lucky man, importantly.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Don't attack my wife. She's out of your league.\"\n\nUsha Vance appeared alongside her husband and members of the Trump family at the campaign's election night event in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n\"THANK YOU!\" Vance wrote on X after the election results came in. \"To my beautiful wife for making it possible to do this. To President Donald J. Trump, for giving me such an opportunity to serve our country at this level. And to the American people, for their trust. I will never stop fighting for ALL of you.\"\n\nJD Vance was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Usha Vance's former boss when she clerked for him in the US Court of Appeals.\n\nThe vice president attended the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris and the Munich Security Conference. He and Usha Vance also visited the Dachau concentration camp in Germany.\n\nThey brought their three children along on Air Force Two.\n\nSince winning a second non-consecutive term in the White House, Trump has doubled down on his intention to acquire Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory where the US has a military base. The governments of Greenland and Denmark have maintained that it is not for sale, but Trump has said he would not rule out using force.\n\nIn March 2025, the White House announced that Usha Vance would embark on a solo trip to Greenland to \"visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland's national dogsled race.\" The government of Greenland said that they had not invited any delegations to visit, and Greenland's Prime Minister Múte Bourup Egede called the trip \"very aggressive.\" Trump said that Greenland had asked the US to visit.\n\nUsha Vance's trip was subsequently scaled back to visiting Pituffik Space Base, the US military's northernmost installation in Greenland. In a video, JD Vance announced he would travel with her.\n\n\"There was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her,\" he said.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, JD Vance's press secretary, told Business Insider that the Vances were \"proud\" to visit Greenland.\n\n\"The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island,\" Van Kirk said.\n\nDuring a public appearance at military bases in North Carolina, observers noticed that Usha Vance wasn't wearing her wedding ring.\n\nIn a statement to People magazine, the second lady's spokesperson described Usha Vance as \"a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths, and forgets her ring sometimes.\"\n\nJD Vance also addressed the marriage rumors, telling NBC News that \"we kind of get a kick out of it\" and that their marriage was \"as strong as it's ever been.\"",

    "description": "The link to claim your credit is actually a phishing scheme.",
    "fullText": "Verizon had a massive outage last week, leaving roughly two million customers unable to use their phones off of wifi or SOS mode for nearly a day. As an apology for the inconvenience, the company promised to refund those affected a meager $20 to their accounts—so naturally, scammers quickly got a phishing scheme up and running targeting people eligible for the credit. As reported by Android Authority, the Jones County Sheriff's Office in Georgia has issued an alert about fake Verizon \"credit\" messages floating around.\n\nAccording to the sheriff's office, scammers may contact you via text or email—claiming to be from Verizon—with information about the outage credit. These messages contain phishing links, which may be set up to collect personal information or account credentials or deliver malware to your device. Clicking through will likely compromise your data in some way, especially if you enter any details on a malicious website.\n\nIf you are a Verizon customer who was affected by the outage, you will receive a text letting you know that your $20 credit is available to claim in the myVerizon app, which is why you may not be immediately suspicious of the scam. Plus, since you do need to claim the funds, you may be swayed by a message that sounds urgent. Don't fall for it.\n\nIn general, you shouldn't click links in unsolicited communication, and you should be suspicious of any messages that prompt you to click said links, even if they appear to be from a legitimate company about a legitimate matter. As evidenced by this phishing campaign and those like it, scammers can and will impersonate trusted brands and use real events to seem more believable.\n\nInstead, always navigate directly to the app or official website—type in the URL and check it carefully or go through your password manager—and log in using your account credentials. Once logged in, you can see any legitimate communication and take action securely. Know that scammers can easily spoof websites, so if you click a phishing link, you may not realize that you're on a fake page.",

    "title": "ChatGPT Is Getting on the AI Age Verification Bandwagon",
    "description": "The app will guess your age and set limits for users it thinks are under 18.",
    "fullText": "When OpenAI first announced GPT-5.2 last month, it quietly disclosed a new safety feature it called \"age prediction.\" Considering ChatGPT proper isn't exactly an \"all ages\" kind of tool, it makes sense that users under the age of 18 should have protections in place to shield them from harmful content. The company says that users who indicate they're under 18 already receive an altered experience to \"reduce exposure to sensitive or potentially harmful content,\" but if the user doesn't voluntarily share how old they are with OpenAI, how does the company enforce these protections? Here's where age prediction comes in.\n\nOn Tuesday, OpenAI officially announced its new age prediction policy, which, like other age verification systems being used by the likes of Roblox, uses AI to guess how old a user is. If the system decides that a particular user is under the age of 18, OpenAI will adjust the experience accordingly, with the goal of keeping all interactions age-appropriate.\n\nHere's how it works: The new age prediction model looks at both the user's behaviors within the app, as well as the general account data. That includes things like how old the account is, what times of day the user is accessing ChatGPT, usage patterns, as well as, of course, the age the user says they are. Looking at all this data, the model determines how old the user likely is. If the model thinks they're over 18, they'll get the full experience; if the model thinks they're under 18, they'll get the \"safer experience.\" If the model isn't confident, it defaults to that safer experience.\n\nThat limited experience means that someone the model thinks is under 18 will try to reduce the following content types:\n\nViral challenges that might inspire \"risky or harmful behaviors\"\n\nRole play that is sexual, romantic, or violent in nature\n\nContent promoting \"extreme\" beauty standards, unhealthy dieting, or body shaming\n\nThe company says that its approach is informed by \"expert input\" as well as literature discussing child development science. (It's not clear whether how much of that input is from direct interviews and coordination with experts, and how much, if any, is from independent research.) The company also acknowledges \"known teen differences in risk perception, impulse control, peer influence, and emotional regulation\" when compared to adults.\n\nThe biggest risk with any of these age prediction models is that they'll sometimes get it wrong—hallucination is an unfortunate habit AI models all share. That goes both ways: You don't want someone too young accessing inappropriate content in ChatGPT, but you also don't want someone older than 18 getting stuck with a limited account for no reason. If you experience the latter situation, OpenAI has a solution for you: direct age verification through Persona. This is the same third-party Roblox uses for its age verification, which hasn't gone very well thus far.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily spell doom for OpenAI. Roblox tried overhauling their age verification system for a massive user base all used to a certain type of multiplayer experience, which led to users not being able to chat with other users in newly-assigned age categories, which were often incorrect. Meanwhile, ChatGPT's age prediction is only controlling the experience of one user at a time. To that end, OpenAI will let you upload a selfie as an added verification step if the prediction model alone isn't enough. Interestingly, OpenAI doesn't say anything about the option to upload an ID for verification, which other companies, like Google, have provided.\n\nI'm not necessarily a fan of age prediction models, as I think they often sacrifice user privacy in the name of creating age-appropriate experiences. But there's little doubt that OpenAI has to do something to limit the full ChatGPT experience for younger users. Many of ChatGPT's users are under 18, and much of the content they experience is wildly inappropriate, whether it be instructions on getting high, or advice on writing suicide notes. In some tragic cases, minors have taken their own lives after discussions with ChatGPT, leading to lawsuits against OpenAI.\n\nI don't have any great answers here. We'll just have to see how this new age prediction model affects the user experience for minors and adults alike, and whether it actually manages to create a safer experience for younger, more impressionable users.",

He has been an unused substitute in four of those matches.\n\nLast season, Nwaneri played mostly on the right wing and scored nine goals in 37 appearances in all competitions to mark himself out as one of England's most talented young players.\n\nBut with Madueke the first choice as back up to Bukayo Saka and Eze the number 10 to challenge captain Martin Odegaard, the two positions Nwaneri would fit into have become harder to get.",

    "fullText": "Arne Slot has suggested Mohamed Salah will return to the Liverpool starting line-up against Marseille in Wednesday's Champions League tie, insisting his relationship with the forward is \"as normal as it's always been\".\n\nSalah last started for Liverpool in the 4-1 home defeat by PSV Eindhoven in November, but scored four goals at the Africa Cup of Nations where his Egypt side finished fourth.\n\nThe 33-year-old gave an exposive interview shortly before departing for Afcon, in which he claimed \"someone doesn't want me in the club\" and he no longer had any relationship with Slot after being dropped.\n\nAsked if he had a chance to reflect on the situation with Salah after the events in December, Slot said: \"There's been a moment in the season where I decided not to play Mo.\n\n\"And one moment where I decided not to take him to the game [against Inter Milan]. For all the other games, he's been in the squad and he was the first substitution against Brighton so, at that moment of time, there's never been an issue for me.\n\n\"The first time he's able to be in the squad again, he is because he trained today and is in the squad for tomorrow. Let's see the line-up tomorrow if you still think there's an issue.\"\n\nSlot's side have been unbeaten during Salah's time in Morocco, but the Dutchman admitted he was \"happy\" to have Liverpool's record Champions League goalscorer available again.\n\n\"I am really happy and pleased he is back,\" added Slot. \"In his absence I think we have done quite OK in terms of hardly conceding any chances and starting to create more and more.\n\n\"If you create more and more, then it is really helpful to have Mohamed Salah. There has only been one who scored more for this club [who is alive] but I don't think I can play Ian Rush still! Then it is really helpful to have him back.\"\n\nAsked about his relationship with Salah, he said: \"It's as normal as it's always been, with one exception and that was Inter Milan.\n\n\"I spoke to him today and I'm happy to have him back because this season I've only had two wingers who've played more than 100 minutes in the Premier League and that's Mo and Cody [Gakpo].\n\n\"Jeremie Frimpong and Florian Wirtz can also play in these positions, but if I asked Florian what was his favourite position he wouldn't say left or right wing. Jeremie would be the same, but he's shown what he can do off the right side.\n\n\"I saw today that Mo has 45 goals for Liverpool in the Champions League and the next highest is Virgil van Dijk with five. So it is nice to have him back, especially if he is able to reach those levels that brought him 45 goals again.\"\n\nLiverpool have taken a 20-man squad to Marseille, with Ibrahima Konate not in the touring party due to a family matter.\n\nThe game against Robert de Zerbi's side will influence their hopes of finishing in the top eight and avoiding two extra ties in the knockout phase play-offs next month. The Reds host Qarabag in their final game in the group phase on Wednesday, 28 January.",

    "fullText": "Former Australia captain Steve Waugh is among the franchise investors in a men's European T20 tournament set to be played by city-based teams in Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands later this year.\n\nThe six-team European T20 Premier League (ETPL) was meant to launch in 2025, but the event was postponed because the sales of the participating franchises were not completed in time.\n\nHowever, deals have now been agreed for three of the franchises with two separate groups of investors from Australia and one from New Zealand.\n\nOne of those is led by Waugh, who is heading up the Amsterdam Flames, which is backed by a consortium that includes former Australian field hockey player Jamie Dwyer and Australian businessman Tim Thomas.\n\nThe Flames have already signed high-profile Australia internationals Steve Smith and Mitch Marsh as two of their overseas players.\n\nWaugh, 60, said he was \"fascinated\" by the opportunity to \"take the global game of cricket to continental Europe\".\n\n\"I'm not signing up to a Mickey Mouse T20 competition. This is the real deal,\" Waugh told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I wouldn't be lending my name to it, or bringing my knowledge, if it wasn't. The players we've spoken to are very keen to play in this league.\"\n\nBollywood actor and film producer Abhishek Bachchan is a part-owner of the ETPL in conjunction with Rules Sport Tech, a private Indian company.\n\nBBC Sport understands the franchises were sold for £11.1m ($15m) over a 10-year period.\n\nTeams will have a total salary budget in the region of £1.1m ($1.5m) per season, with the inaugural tournament set to start on 26 August.\n\nThe league is being run in collaboration with the cricket boards of Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands.\n\nIt has been sanctioned by the International Cricket Council, who see it as a useful base for the broader development of cricket in Europe.\n\nBachchan said that, with \"the quality of players signing on,\" everything about the tournament \"will be world class\".\n\n\"We are all primed and ready to go but the true hard work starts now,\" Bachchan added.\n\n\"We are very confident of the stakeholders we have on board and expect the ETPL will establish itself in the global ecosystem of franchise tournaments.\"",

    "title": "Sandbox Your AI Dev Tools: A Practical Guide for VMs and Lima",
    "description": "AI coding assistants and other devtools can steal your credentials and data. Here's how to run them safely in isolated VMs using Lima on macOS/Linux.",
    "fullText": "AI coding assistants, npm, pip, and other development tools can run arbitrary code and scripts on your machine, potentially stealing SSH keys, API tokens, wallet keys, sensitive credentials and other private data without you noticing.\n\nThis guide shows you how to sandbox these tools in isolated VMs using Lima, so you can experiment and develop freely without putting your sensitive data at risk.\nJump straight to the guide, or read on for a bit of personal context.\n\nI’ve been having quite a bit of fun with AI assisted coding recently.\n\nI use LLMs for a wide range of things, including discussing architecture, design choices, learning about new tools and libraries I wasn’t previously aware of, to reviewing PRs and quickly cranking out dirty prototypes.\n\nEspecially for hobby projects that are not meant to ever go into production, I enjoy playing with AI tools fast and loose, producing results quickly and not getting slowed down by annoying things such as reading code before running it 🤣.\n\nAnd yeah… that’s obviously unsafe, unless it’s all contained in a sandbox!\n\nYou should never run potentially dangerous, experimental code on your main machine, since it could steal your passwords, API keys, environment variables, private keys, access to your communication tools, install services, and do all sorts of other nefarious things.\n\nNowadays I isolate all my devtools in VMs, and thought it might be useful to others if I put together a guide to shows how to do it. Well, here it is, and I hope it’ll be useful to you, too!\n\nYou’ll want to run the entire development environment, including the AI tool itself, inside a sandbox. This way it’s safe to install dependencies and to execute code, and unlocks other fun features like snapshots before running sketchy code, and reverting if something goes wrong.\n\nAnd it’s not just AI-generated code. Node.js/npm/yarn and Python/pip are particularly troublesome because they allow any package to run arbitrary scripts on your system during installation, and install tons of additional dependencies that can do the same. This attack vector is called “supply chain attack” and it happens all the time.\n\nVirtual Machines (VMs) and Containers (i.e. Docker, Podman, containerd) are the two most practical methods for isolating development tools from your host operating system. VMs provide much stronger protection and more flexibility overall, and are better suited for co-developing with AIs.\n\nContainer runtimes share the host operating system’s kernel, which means they’re fundamentally running on the same system as your main machine, just with isolated namespaces and resource limits. This creates several security concerns:\n\nIn contrast, a VM runs its own complete operating system with its own kernel. The hypervisor (like QEMU/KVM) creates a much stronger isolation boundary. Even if malicious code completely compromises the VM, it would need to exploit the hypervisor itself to reach your host, a significantly harder target.\n\nFurthermore, a VM enables better concurrency. It can run Docker containers, databases, web servers, multiple build processes, and background services all at once, and the AI tool can interact with everything naturally just like on a normal development machine.\n\nIn this guide, we use Lima VM to sandbox AI and devtools. Lima is a delightful, lightweight virtual machine manager for Linux and macOS which provides easy and quick ways to create and manage VMs.\n\nYou interact with Lima through the limactl command:\n\nVMs are based on templates, which can include (build on) other templates:\n\nThe Lima VM docs have platform-specific installation guides.\n\nHomebrew is recommended on macOS:\n\nOn Linux install the binary like this:\n\nNow ensure your Lima version is up-to-date:\n\nWe only want to share very specific host directories with the VM.\n\nLet’s create ~/VM-Shared on the host, which we later mount into the VM at ~/Shared (with write access):\n\nYou can use that directory to easily copy files between the host and the VM, and to share project directories from the host with the VM.\n\nDefaults for all VMs can be defined in ~/.lima/_config/default.yaml.\n\nLet’s create the default YAML file:\n\nLima conveniently creates default SSH configuration files for all VM instances, which makes it easy to log in with SSH (including using VS Code for a Remote-SSH session).\n\nI recommend using a ~/.ssh/config.d/ directory on the host and have SSH include all configs there by default. That allows us to simply link the Lima-created config files there to use them.\n\nAdd this as first line in your ~/.ssh/config file, to make SSH include all configs from there:\n\nGreat! After creating a new VM, we can now simply create a symlink to the Lima-generated SSH configs and use it to SSH into the instance.\n\nLet’s start an Ubuntu 25.10 VM instance, named dev.\nWe use the internal _images/ubuntu-25.10.yaml template because it doesn’t include the automatic home directory sharing:\n\nYou can share additional project-specific directories between host and VM in several ways:\n\nCreate a symlink for the SSH config file and SSH into the VM:\n\nLet’s update the services on the instance, and configure git:\n\nLet’s confirm that port forwarding works. We do this using a one-liner Python HTTP server (on port 7777) inside the VM, and accessing it from the host:\n\nThis section guides you through installing several other languages and development tools, including Golang, Node.js, Python, Rust, Docker.\n\nWe can accomplish that either by installing each tool according to it’s documentation, or by using a version manager such as mise (“mise-en-place”, 22k stars on Github) which can install hundreds of tools via a simple command-line interface.\n\nFirst, we install mise (“mise-en-place”, 22k stars on Github) and make bash support it:\n\nYou use mise latest <tool> to see the latest versions it knows about:\n\nNow you can install all the tools you want in a single command:\n\nTo manually install (or update) Golang in the VM, download the latest release and extract into /usr/local/go:\n\nThe Golang path needs to be in the PATH environment variable, which we have already added before.\n\nA good way to install a current version of Node.js in Ubuntu is by using nvm, a modern node version manager (90k stars on GitHub):\n\nNow it’s all installed and ready to use! Check the versions like this:\n\nPerhaps you don’t even need Docker, since Lima includes containerd and nerdctl by default. This is a Docker-compatible runtime and command-line interface that can also run images from Docker Hub:\n\nIf you do want to install Docker, the quickest way to install it by using their official get-docker.sh script:\n\nFor the group changes to take effect, exit the shell and re-login (may need a VM restart).\n\nVerify that user is in the ‘docker’ group:\n\nGitHub CLI provides a useful gh cli command that let’s you easily interact with GitHub and private repositories.\n\nYou can install it in the VM following the Linux installation instructions:\n\nWarning: Authorizing GitHub CLI to access private repositories will leave an API key in the VM which could potentially be stolen by unauthorized scripts (which is what we wanted to avoid in first place by running everything in a VM).\n\nOnly authorize it with gh auth login for private repo access if you accept the risks! I personally avoid having any sensitive credentials in the VM, in particular those that allow access to private GitHub repositories.\n\nIf you prefer an IDE like VS Code, you can use Remote-SSH to start a session inside the instance.\n\nPlease note that this is potentially unsafe, as explained in the Remote-SSH README:\n\nSecurity Note\nUsing Remote-SSH opens a connection between your local machine and the remote. Only use Remote-SSH to connect to secure remote machines that you trust and that are owned by a party whom you trust. A compromised remote could use the VS Code Remote connection to execute code on your local machine.\n\nSee also this discussion on GitHub for more context and information.\n\nNow a new VS Code window opens, and sets up VS Code Server:\n\nThen you can click “Open” and choose a folder, like Shared:\n\nBefore setting up the tools, let’s create a “Hello World” directory in the Shared folder as our playground:\n\nLet’s start with installing Claude Code in the VM, following the instructions in the documentation:\n\nOn first start, Claude asks you to authorize it.\n\nThe docs mention support for an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable (i.e. set in .bashrc), but that did not work when I tried it; claude CLI didn’t let me skip the login process. Only after the login was done it notified me about the existing environment variable, and whether I’d prefer to use that one.\n\nAfter the login, Claude Code CLI is ready to be ued in the VM! 🎉\n\nSince Claude is running in a VM, it might be permissible to run it in “dangerously skip permissions mode”, which makes it bypass all permission checks:\n\nYou could also create an alias for it and add it to your .bashrc:\n\nAnthropic provides documentation for using Claude in VS Code, and also offer a VS Code Claude extension.\n\nYou can install the Claude extension in the VM through the Remote-SSH session window:\n\nIn contrast to the CLI tool, the authentication flow did not work through the user interface, and I had to set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable:\n\nReload the VS Code window (open command palette with Shift + CMD + P and choose “Developer: Reload Window”):\n\nNow the VS Code Claude extension should work:\n\nIf you want to enable “dangerously skip permissions mode” in the VS Code extension, you can enable it via your user settings. Open the settings (CMD + ,), search for “claude” and enable “Claude Code: Allow Dangerously Skip Permissions”:\n\nLet’s install Gemini CLI from Google next.\n\nThe documentation recommends installing it with npm, the Node.js package manager. You’ll need to install Node and npm first, see also the Node.js setup instructions.\n\nIt will ask you to authenticate:\n\nI chose “Login with Google”. Note that the authentication flow may require a retry if the first attempt times fails.\n\nAfter authorization is done, Gemini CLI works!\n\nYou can run Gemini in YOLO mode:\n\nAutomatically accept all actions (aka YOLO mode, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0 \n\nThe alias you could define in .bashrc:\n\nCodex CLI is the AI dev tool from OpenAI/ChatGPT.\n\nIt will ask you to sign in, either via ChatGPT or by providing an API key:\n\nAfter that is done, Codex CLI is ready to work for you!\n\nYou can also run Codex in dangerous mode:\n\nSkip all confirmation prompts and execute commands without sandboxing. EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Intended solely for running in environments that are externally sandboxed\n\nThere are several other great tools worth a mention:\n\nDrop your favorite tools in the comments below!\n\nVM clones and snapshots allow you even more flexibility and isolation. You can use them to quickly and cheaply run new VMs for experiments and specific projects based on already provisioned instances. Use them frequently!\n\nLima offers several ways to take VM snapshots and/or clone VMs.\n\nYou can make a copy of an existing VM instance with limactl clone. The existing instance needs to be stopped first.\n\nAfter all the initial VM setup is done, clone it and use it both as backup as well as a base for future instances:\n\nRemember that after starting a new instance, you probably want to symlink the VM SSH configuration to your ~/.ssh/config.d/ directory, so ssh knows about it (See also “SSH into the VM”):\n\nFor maximum security and flexibility, consider using multiple VMs for different purposes and trust levels. This approach provides better isolation and lets you tailor each environment to specific needs.\n\nHere are some suggested VM configurations:\n\nYou can quickly clone your base VM setup to create new instances for different projects using limactl clone, as described in the VM cloning section above.\n\nFor sensitive or production projects, consider dedicating a separate VM to each project. This prevents potential cross-contamination between projects and allows you to mount only the specific project directories you need.\n\nWhen creating project-specific VMs, you can customize the mounted directories by editing the instance configuration. Either adjust the mounts section before starting the VM (by not using the -y flag), or edit ~/.lima/<vm_name>/lima.yaml after creation and restart the instance.\n\nThis approach also makes it easier to share VM configurations with team members. Instead of sharing entire disk images, you can distribute just the Lima template YAML file, which team members can use to spin up identical environments on their machines.\n\nFor automated setup, Lima supports provisioning scripts that run during VM creation. For more complex setups, consider using idempotent provisioning tools like Ansible to ensure consistent environments across your team.\n\nIf you find yourself repeatedly creating VMs with similar configurations, consider creating custom Lima templates. Templates are YAML files that define VM settings, and they can include other templates.\n\nCustom templates are useful for:\n\nYou can create a custom template by copying and modifying an existing one from Lima’s template directory. Save your custom templates in ~/.lima/_templates/ and reference them when creating new VMs:\n\nSee the Lima templates documentation \n\nHere are some important security best practices to follow when using VMs for development:\n\nRemember: The whole point of using VMs is isolation. When in doubt, create a new VM for risky experiments and delete it afterwards.\n\nI hope this guide helps you get started quickly and right-footed!\nAs always, please leave feedback, questions and ideas in the comments below.\n\nSpecial thanks to Ilya Lukyanov and Overflo for reviewing drafts of this post and making great suggestions. 🙏",

    "fullText": "I’m an old Mac-head at heart, and I’ve been using Macs since the mid 1990s (the first Mac I used was an LC II with System 7.1 installed on it). I don’t tend to genuinely think that the computing experience was better in the olden days — sure, there’s a thing to be said about the simplicity of older software, but most of my fondness for those days is nostalgia.\n\nFor example, I have wonderful memories of finally getting a copy of ClarisWorks and being able to do pixel-based image editing, which sparked a wonderful childhood “career” of tinkering with icons and various other bits and bobs with that and ResEdit. The things you could do before code signing!\n\nHowever, I’m not going to sit here and say with a straight face that ClarisWorks on System 7 in the 1990s was better than using the myriad of tools we have available to us today. It’s nostalgia for a simpler time — both in computing, and in my life.\n\nAn exception to that, however, is Apple’s Aperture. I’m still grumpy that Apple discontinued it back in 2015, and I’m not alone. Start spending time in the online photography sphere and you’ll start to notice a small but undeniable undercurrent of lament of its loss to this day. Find an article about Adobe hiking their subscription prices because they added AI for some reason, and amongst the complaining in the comments you’ll invariably find it: “I miss Aperture.”\n\nA couple of things have happened recently that spurred me to actually write all of this down rather than grumble occasionally on social media:\n\nApple released macOS Tahoe, which has been pretty constantly raked over the coals for poor design and broken interactions from the day it was released (and even before, if we’re honest).\n\nApple very recently announced their Creator Studio subscription service, and I saw this post on Mastodon by @BasicAppleGuy:\n\nWhen I took this screenshot, the first reply to the post was “I miss Aperture. <long digital sigh>”.\n\nSo, I dug out the ‘ol Trashcan Mac Pro I lovingly reviewed here on this very blog over eleven years ago and fired up Aperture to document — at least partially — just why it was so special.\n\nThe Mac Studio is a perfectly cromulent computer, but it just doesn’t have the verve of the classics, you know?\n\nIf you’re not familiar with Aperture, it’s an app for organising, managing, editing, and exporting images. If you’re familiar with Apple’s Photos app, it’s that. But for professionals! Aperture is a complex app — its PDF user manual is over 900 pages long — so to keep this manageable I’ll focus on one particular aspect of it via two short excerpts from said manual.\n\nTwo excerpts that hide an astonishing amount of engineering effort.\n\nLet’s look at our first excerpt:\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nThis little sentence extremely succinctly describes how Aperture is different to most other software of its nature — it comes to you. Most software has you go to it.\n\nTo understand what I mean, let’s look at the Photos app. My brain works pretty spatially — I remember where I took a photo more than when. So, I pan around the map in Photos to find the cool photo of my car in the Alps that I want to edit and send to my friend. Here it is:\n\nI click the picture, and the map is gone, replaced with a list of the images at the location I clicked.\n\nI double-click the photo to bring it up bigger.\n\nI click “Edit” in the top right of the window to switch into Photos’ editing mode (as a shortcut, I could’ve pressed the Return key in the image list to open it straight in the editing mode).\n\nI perform my edits, then click “Done” to get back to the fullscreen viewer. Then I click “Back” to get back to the list of images. Then “Back” again, and I’m finally back at my map. Hooray! Oh wait, I forgot to export it…\n\nThis sort of design is common in apps like Photos, and especially in “shoebox” apps1. Every feature is in its own place, and if you want to use that feature you need to pick up your thing (in this case, a photo) and take it over to where the feature is. In this example, the journey from the map to the editor is through a separate list of images, the fullscreen viewer, then finally to the editor.\n\nIn contrast, Aperture comes to you. As a reminder:\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nWhen Aperture says this, it really means it. If you can select an image, you can edit it right where you are with that HUD.\n\nAperture’s map (which by some miracle still works eleven years after it was discontinued) doesn’t show the images on the map, but rather underneath it. It’s less pretty, but combines the first two steps of the journey in the Photos example — the map on top, and the images in the visible map area underneath. Clicking a pin refines the selection of images.\n\nAlight, let’s find another photo of my car in the Alps:\n\nA Volvo stuck in the snow is less awesome than the previous photo, but oh well. I need to edit it, so I press H on my keyboard to bring up the adjustments HUD. I’m still exactly where I was, but now I have editing controls. There’s no step three!\n\nThat was incredibly easy, and I didn’t even leave the map! I need to export it now… and, of course, I can do that from right here on the map too.\n\nI’m still exactly where I was, and I can carry on with the next task.\n\n“But Daniel,” I hear you cry, “Who edits photos on a map?”\n\nFine, it’s a contrived example, but one I was able to directly make between Photos and Aperture. Let’s look at something more real-world: Aperture’s book editor. I love making photo books as the years go by, but putting them together can be a long and tedious process.\n\nLet’s imagine it’s 2005, and I have a page in my book full of pictures of my new car for this year’s book. Unfortunately, auto white balance and changing lighting conditions means the car is a different shade of grey in every photo! Disaster!\n\nIt’d be nice to have them consistent with each other on the page, but matching them all together when they might be from all over the photo library is a big pain. Can you imagine doing that in Photos? Click, click, click, click, into the editor. Tweak white balance. Click, click, click, click, back to the book. Nope, still not right. Click, click, click, click…\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nOh, right! H, drag slider, done. Right on the book page.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate quite how revolutionary and smooth this flow is until you had it for multiple years before having it taken away. Nothing on the market — even over a decade later — is this good at meeting you where you are and not interrupting your flow.\n\nEspecially that book example. My Lord. When Aperture was discontinued (well, when it stopped working properly after an OS update or two) I moved over to Adobe Lightroom (now Lightroom Classic) which had separate modules for file management, editing, and books — switching modules was such a slow and clunky processes, I swear nearly threw my computer out the window trying to colour match photos on a book page.\n\nIt’s OK, Daniel, you got rid of Lightroom years ago. It can’t hurt you any more!\n\nTechnically speaking, the edit-anywhere model is an incredibly impressive feature. Managing a lot of images is already difficult2 (especially on the hardware of the time), and for a map, or a book editor… of course you’d have an optimised set of static thumbnails.\n\nOr, y’know, a full RAW image editing context ready-to-go for anything you might want to click on.\n\nAperture has a tool called the “loupe”. In real life, a loupe is a little cup with a magnifying glass on the top. It’s what’s on the Preview app’s icon, and you use it to zoom in to physical things on a physical surface (I know, how quaint).\n\nIf you want to quickly check specific compositional details of an image, you can use the Loupe. Aperture provides a software Loupe that lets you magnify portions of an image. The Loupe is particularly useful when you are quickly navigating through images in the Browser and you need to verify that the image is in focus or other details without having to switch to the Viewer or Full Screen view.\n\nIn Aperture, the loupe is a little round zoomy thing you can either drag around to view a zoomed-in portion of the image it’s on top of, or attach to the mouse so you can just point at stuff to zoom in.\n\nNote: I’ve dimmed the main Aperture window slightly in the following screenshots to make the loupe clearer.\n\nFun fact: Even when attached to the mouse, the loupe is a separate window just like the other HUDs — which means you can take a screenshot of it independently. Neat!\n\nIt’d be easy to think this is just a screen zoom, or at least a window into a big thumbnail that’s being downsampled a bit for the main viewer. But, since the loupe is attached to the mouse, we can just start pointing at stuff to see what happens.\n\nThere’s no way you’d keep a full-resolution image in memory for every thumbnail on screen, so this is another extremely impressive technical feat. Remember, this is over a decade ago, and Aperture’s system requirements were a Mac with 2GB of RAM. Keeping a whole 20 megapixel image in memory will consume somewhere in the region of 90-120MB3 once you’re starting to display it.\n\nHmm… now that I think about it, the manual doesn’t say where the loupe works and doesn’t, and since we’re not limited to selecting images like with the other HUD…\n\nOnce again, it’s hard to overstate how bonkers this is on a technical level. That’s a list of thumbnails of book pages, there so you can identify which page you want to edit. That thumbnail-within-a-thumbanail — on a Retina display! — is 68x47 pixels. 0.003 megapixels.\n\nFrom a software development perspective, it would be insane to have those pages be anything but static thumbnail images. But hey, would you want to be the person that made the manual say that the loupe works everywhere except in the book editor’s page list?\n\nThese days, technological marvels in computing — if you’ll forgive a gross generalisation — tend to be very flashy. Liquid Glass is a great example of that — it’s very impressive what can be done with the engineering talent and computing power we have available to us today, and the effect is cool. However, my browser’s UI refracting the webpage I’m reading as it scrolls by doesn’t really do anything except look cool… when it isn’t making things less readable.\n\nNotice how the Liquid Glass refraction effect makes it look — at first glance, at least — like we’ll be making a sharp right after we turn left? Thanks, Liquid Glass!\n\nGenerative AI is another technology that falls into this “flashy” camp, but kinda at the other end of the scale. BEHOLD THE AI, FOR IT IS PRODUCING CONTENT. Very useful, very impressive, and is transforming a lot of industries. Just… ignore the wider societal and environmental concerns AS THE AI IS PRODUCING A FUNNY POEM.\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss criticisms of these kinds of technologies as the ramblings of an old man, since on average — as I mentioned at the top of this post — the computing experience is orders of magnitude better than it was back then.\n\nHowever, when it gets to the point where we as humans need to use our computers as tools to get stuff done, I think we have stagnated over the past few years. When preparing for this post I was excited to fire up Aperture and experience it again, but after less than ten minutes of using it I was getting grumpy — here I am, sitting at a thirteen-year old computer, and I’m flying through my photos faster than I ever do on modern machines. Why is this not possible now?\n\nAperture’s technical brilliance is remarkable in how quiet it is. There’s no BEHOLD RAINBOW SPARKLE ANIMATIONS WHILE THE AI MAKES AUNT JANICE LOOK LIKE AN ANTHROPOMORPHISED CARROT, just an understated dedication to making the tool you’re using work for you in exactly the way you want to work.\n\nIt’s the kind of monumental engineering effort that the user is unlikely to ever notice, simply because of how obvious it is to use — if I want to zoom in to this photo, I point at it with the zoom thing. Duh. Sure, it’s a tiny thumbnail inside a small thumbnail of a page in a book… but how else would it work?\n\nAnd that is why Aperture was so special. It was powered by some of the most impressive technology around at the time, but you’d never even know it because you were too busy getting shit done.\n\nAnd then, it was taken away — with a final, cruel twist of the knife from Apple: “You can use the Photos app as a replacement!” — and everyone was grumpy forever.\n\nAperture’s discontinuation happened at the tail end of my time working at Spotify here in Sweden. As with any corporate job, it had good days and bad days… and after the particularly bad days, I’d rage-fill part of a job application elsewhere. I’d always loved Aperture — as a Mac developer, it was the pinnacle of what was possible on the Mac, and in a field I was passionate about — so this particular application was to work on Aperture at Apple.\n\nI ended up having a couple of interviews with the Aperture team, but as I remember (this was well over a decade ago) the process just… kinda petered out.\n\nA few months later, the official discontinuation announcement happened. I have no idea if I was just not up to the task or if something happened internally during my interview process, but it’s an interesting “What if…” to think about.\n\nAperture: Senior QA (2004-2005) by Chris Hynes \n\nWhile the result was amazing, the development process was… perhaps less so. This is an interesting read about Aperture’s development.\n\nIt’s hard to justify Tahoe icons by Nikita Prokopov \n\nA great look on why (amongst many other reasons) macOS Tahoe is being raked through the coals at the moment.\n\n“Shoebox” apps are apps that contain the content you use with them, as opposed to document-based apps which work with content you manage as a user. It’s an extremely common design nowadays, but less so back then — early pioneers of the shoebox app were iPhoto, iMovie, etc. ↩\n\nI maintain that one of the most technically impressive app on an iPhone is the Photos app’s thumbnail grid – being able to scroll that many images that smoothly is very hard. ↩\n\nMaths: 20 million pixels at 12-16 bits per channel. Doesn’t include overheads of getting from the encoded RAW to a GPU-ready pixel buffer. ↩",

    "fullText": "A series of graphics reveals how the Trump administration has sought historic cuts to science and the research workforce.\n\nGrant termination data analysis and visualization by Kim Albrecht\n\nMMore than 7,800 research grants terminated or frozen. Some 25,000 scientists and personnel gone from agencies that oversee research. Proposed budget cuts of 35% — amounting to US$32 billion.\n\nThese are just a few of the ways in which Donald Trump has downsized and disrupted US science since returning to the White House last January. As his administration seeks to reshape US research and development, it has substantially scaled back and restricted what science the country pursues and the workforce that runs the federal scientific enterprise.\n\nA year into Trump’s second presidential term, Nature presents a series of graphics that reveal the impact of his administration on science.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, officials began terminating already-funded grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in February, and later at the National Science Foundation (NSF), two of the largest public supporters of scientific research in the United States. A total of 5,844 NIH grants and 1,996 NSF grants were cancelled or suspended.\n\nThe Trump administration disproportionally cancelled or froze projects on topics it disfavours, such as misinformation, vaccine hesitancy, infectious diseases and research on people from under-represented ethnic and gender groups, which it has called discriminatory and unscientific.\n\nOver the course of 2025, more than 7,800 grants were cancelled or suspended. In this tree map, each block represents one grant or grant supplement, and the size of the block corresponds to the total budget of the original grant.\n\nThe inclusion of supplements means that some grants — less than 0.5% of the total — appear two or three times.\n\nThe blocks are grouped by state. New York (orange) had the most cancelled or frozen grants, totalling nearly 1,500. The majority were at Columbia University.\n\nSome of the largest grants (orange) are for clinical trials, cancer centres and infrastructure, and they can run over many years.\n\nThe NIH terminated or froze 5,843 research grants (yellow). The total for the NSF was 1,996 (blue).\n\nOf the grants that were terminated or frozen, more than 800 were related to infectious diseases (orange).\n\nCourts have ordered that thousands of grants be reinstated, and some universities have settled with the government to unfreeze funding (both reinstated and unfrozen grants are shown in blue). But it is unclear how many scientists have received those funds.\n\nRoughly 2,600 grants have not been reinstated or unfrozen (black), amounting to $1.4 billion of unspent funding.\n\nThe Trump administration has substantially reduced the number of new grants issued by the NSF and the NIH, which means that fewer researchers are getting support.\n\nIn 2025, the total number of new grants funded by the NSF dropped by 25% relative to the average of the previous ten years. In part, this resulted from uncertainty about future funding, and the agency’s decision to provide multi-year funding — in which a project’s budget is awarded all at once, rather than year by year.\n\nA similar story played out at the NIH, which issued 24% fewer grants in 2025, compared with the average of the previous ten years. After delays early in the year and with reduced staff levels, the agency raced to award grants by the end of the fiscal year. It achieved this in part by providing multi-year funding to a smaller number of new grant applications than usual — sharply reducing the number of scientists that received support.\n\nDuring the 2025–26 academic year, new international-student enrolment at US universities fell markedly. The Institute of International Education (IIE), a non-profit organization in New York City, released preliminary data, based on a subset of universities, showing a 17% decline from 2024 to 2025. This would result in the smallest number of new international enrolments in a decade, except for in 2020–21, during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThese trends are not uniform. An IIE survey found that about 60% of colleges and universities saw decreases, whereas 40% reported stable or increasing numbers. Of those experiencing declines, 96% cited visa-application concerns as a contributing factor. These concerns have intensified under the second Trump administration.\n\nIn total, federal science agencies lost about 20% of their staff in 2025 relative to the previous year, after modest increases over the past few years.\n\nAmong the hardest hit are the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA, both of which have been targets of the Trump administration’s attacks on climate science. The Food and Drug Administration also lost more than 20% of its staff.\n\nSome employees were fired during mass layoffs in early 2025, but most left voluntarily through a programme that offered incentives for federal workers to resign. Across the science agencies, there was an exodus of more than 25,000 people, many of whom were at early career stages.\n\nRemaining staff members at agencies such as the NIH and the NSF say they struggle to keep up with the workload, which includes approving research grants.\n\nIn its proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year, the Trump administration requested historic cuts of 35% to the budget for research and development not related to defence. The final funding levels will be determined through spending bills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate in an ongoing process.\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation, the president’s proposed decrease in funding for non-defence research would be unprecedented over the past half century and would reduce spending to 1991 levels.\n\nBut in enacted spending bills, lawmakers in both the Senate and the House of Representatives have so far rejected the most drastic budget cuts for many of the core science agencies. Policy experts hope that Congress will continue its long-standing support for science agencies when it finalizes the 2026 budget in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Trump administration shocked the science community when it proposed slashing more than $18 billion, or around 40% of the total, from the budget of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is the largest funder of biomedical research in the world.\n\nThe Trump administration also sought steep cuts at the National Science Foundation (57%) and NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (47%). In final budget agreements that are likely to be adopted by the House and the Senate, lawmakers agreed on much smaller cuts of 3.4% for the NSF and 1.1% for NASA’s science directorate.\n\nThe House and the Senate must finish negotiating final budgets for the remaining agencies, such as the NIH, and the actual funding levels will probably be somewhere in the middle. That would mostly protect the country’s total budget for research and development from the Trump administration’s drastic cuts for the current fiscal year.\n\nThis article is also available as a pdf version.",

    "fullText": "Mourning for Renee Nicole Good, the singer decried the Trump administration and the threat to freedom posed by “heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city.”\n\nBruce Springsteen took a side against the Trump administration’s authoritarian abuses last May, when he launched his European tour with an impassioned denunciation of the president’s assault on basic civil liberties, and decried an ugly moment in which the United States “is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration.” Now Springsteen has brought the complaint home, with a clarity that is all the more immediate and necessary.\n\nBefore launching into a fiery rendition of his 1978 classic “The Promised Land” during a Saturday night show in his home state of New Jersey, Springsteen turned the crowd’s attention to Minnesota, where, on January 7, an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a mother of three who loved to sing, wrote poetry, and evidenced a concern for her neighbors that embodied the spirit of Springsteen’s epic paean to community and solidarity, “We Take Care of Our Own.”\n\n“I wrote [‘The Promised Land’] as an ode to American possibility—both to the beautiful but flawed country that we are, and to the country that we could be,” Springsteen told the crowd. “Right now, we are living through incredibly critical times. The United States, the ideals and the values for which it stood for the past 250 years, is being tested as it has never been in modern times. Those values and those ideals have never been as endangered as they are right now.”\n\nThe crowd roared with approval as Springsteen continued:\n\n“So, as we gather tonight in this beautiful display of love and care and thoughtfulness and community, if you believe in democracy and liberty, if you believe that truth still matters, it is worth speaking out. It is worth fighting for. If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president—as the mayor of that city has said—ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”\n\nAbove what had become thunderous applause, Springsteen announced, “This song is for you and the memory of a mother of three and American citizen, Renee Good.”\n\nWith that, Springsteen and his band broke into “The Promised Land,” a song that speaks of a storm that will “blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted” and “blow everything down that ain’t got the faith to stand its ground”—and about how, against the tempest and through it all, “I believe in a promised land.”\n\nYears ago, Springsteen summed up his mission as an artist when he said, “I have spent my life judging the distance between American reality and the American dream.” The honesty with which Springsteen has conducted this decades-long examination has earned the songwriter the greatest honors the entertainment industry and the nation can grant. In addition to 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, and a Special Tony Award for his critically acclaimed Springsteen on Broadway shows, he is an inducted member of both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He has also been given the Kennedy Center Honor and, in 2016, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama, who hailed him for “carrying the rest of us on his journey: asking us all what is the work for us to do in our short time here.”\n\nIt was an appropriate honor for a singer who, like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger before him, refused to surrender the dream of a promised land to the crude machinations of billionaire investors and the crooked politicians who serve them. “There is a real patriotism underneath the best of my music,” Springsteen once said, “but it is a critical, questioning and often angry patriotism.”\n\nThere are plenty of artists who soften as they age.\n\nWith his denunciation of ICE violence in Minneapolis, he has once again proven himself to be as critical, questioning, angry, and, yes, patriotic as the times require.",
